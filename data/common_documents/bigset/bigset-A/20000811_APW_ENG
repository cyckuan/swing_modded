Reform Convention Opens With Feud
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Seeking the Reform Party presidential nomination,
Pat Buchanan pledged Thursday to make ''America a godly nation again'' by
cracking down on abortion and ''rampant homosexuality.'' The conservative former
Republican issued his personal manifesto as his adopted party opened its
convention by fracturing into two separate meetings -- Buchanan backers and
those of party founder Ross Perot. The battle for control of the party is aimed
partly at gaining $12.5 million in federal funds that goes with the nomination.

   SOUTH BARRINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- President Clinton said Thursday he feels
''this overwhelming sense of gratitude'' to have gained a measure of forgiveness

evangelical ministers, Clinton called the affair ''a terrible mistake.'' ''I
feel much more at peace than I used to,'' he told the clergymen, saying the
disgrace made him face the truth. He claimed that more than 60 percent of
Americans have ''stuck with me.''

Thousands Change Tires After Recall
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Motorists waited for hours at overtaxed tire stores Thursday
in the hunt for replacements for Firestone tires the company is recalling
because of concerns they may be a factor in a series of car crashes. So far, the
company is only recalling tires in four states as it tries to manage demand. At
least one other manufacturer, Goodyear, announced it was increasing production
to help meet demand created by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.'s recall of 6.5
million tires -- most of which are on Ford sport utility vehicles and light
trucks.

stepped up to the plate. That's what it boiled down to. It was a no-brainer,''
Jackson told The Star.

<HEADLINE> Another Tax Shelter To Be Shut Down  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is shutting down a
new kind of corporate tax shelter, continuing attacks on tax
schemes the government contends are costing it billions in lost
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the notice being issued Friday by the Treasury
Department and the Internal Revenue Service is a shelter the
administration dubbed ''Son of BOSS.'' The administration said the
shelter was an offshoot of a Bond and Option Sales Strategy shelter
the government moved to shut down in December.
</P>
<P>
   The government's action spells out the practices the IRS has
found objectionable and puts taxpayers on notice that they cannot
use those practices to avoid paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
   As in the BOSS shelter, Treasury officials said the new tax
avoidance scheme uses a series of steps involving assets and
liabilities of partnerships to generate artificial tax losses that
are designed to offset income from other transactions.
</P>
<P>
   A Treasury official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity, said the new tax shelter was being marketed by ''one or
two of the Big Five'' major accounting firms --
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Arthur Andersen, KPMG, Deloitte &AMP; Touche
and Ernst &AMP; Young. He refused to name the firms involved.
</P>
<P>
   But the official said the fact that this offshoot of the
December tax shelter had arisen so quickly showed the lengths to
which accountants will go to devise tax avoidance schemes for
wealthy corporations and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told reporters in a
conference call that the marketing of this new tax shelter ''simply
reinforces our determination'' to use all legal remedies available
to ''uphold the integrity of the tax system.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Closing tax shelters is an essential element of tax fairness
to minimize the tax burdens on American families,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we have an overall legislative solution in place, we are
sure to see further generations of this and other abusive tax
shelters,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers has called the growth of tax shelters the most
significant compliance problem confronting the U.S. tax system.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants Congress to take a comprehensive
approach toward making it more difficult to set up shelters and
easier for authorities to track down shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts has run into opposition from Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who is
opposed to taking up the issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has estimated that the shelters it has shut
down using current law would have deprived the government of $50
billion to $60 billion in revenue over a 10-year period if they had
been allowed to continue operating.
</P>
<P>
   The administration would like Congress to impose a 25 percent
excise tax on the marketers and buyers of tax shelters and an
increase in the penalty for corporate tax underreporting from 20
percent to 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- James Hadley, in a high-collar shirt that says
he'll soon be a Roman Catholic priest, approaches an office
building in the heart of Wall Street, his union ''Local 100'' sign
drooping after two hours of marching in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by a nun, a rabbi and Bree Kessler, 20, a college
student who plans to become a rabbi, the 22-year-old seminarian
walks through brass doors into the cavernous lobby. They are a
religious delegation, he tells the receptionist, and they want to
see the company's chief executive officer to ask him to support the
rights of food service workers to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's out of the country,'' the receptionist tells him.
</P>
<P>
   How about other executives? Unavailable, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Hadley walks outside, makes his way through a crowd of
about 100 and jumps on the back of a flatbed truck. Grabbing the
mike, he announces that management had refused to meet with workers
and now the religious community. But he vows to ''continue the
struggle for the right to organize.''
</P>
<P>
   Hadley and Kessler are among 25 interns in Seminary Summer, a
10-week program in 15 cities to teach future religious leaders the
ins and outs of community organizing.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, for instance, Paul Graham of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church is working with day laborers.
</P>
<P>
   In Little Rock, Alan Jenkins, who is Presbyterian, is organizing
poultry workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our seminaries we study the theology,'' says Kim Bobo of
the National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice, which
sponsors Seminary Summer with the AFL-CIO. ''What is often not
(taught) is how you live out your faith in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Seminary Summer, the sponsors say, is the latest phase of an old
partnership between religious leaders and labor that has brought
together ministers and meat packers, rabbis and janitors on picket
lines nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   It was Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical, affirming the right to
organize, that strengthened the bond between Catholics and unions.
In the late 1800s, Jewish leaders began organizing garment workers
in New York City. And in the early 1900s, pro-union Protestant
ministers faced the wrath of company guards in the West Virginia
coal mines.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, disagreements over the Vietnam War divided liberal
clerics and union leaders, but relations have warmed again. And so
today labor can reach out to budding religious leaders, including
some who never gave unions much thought.
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing up in Detroit, Kessler, a University of Michigan
religion major who hopes to become a rabbi, did not know union
members. Studying labor history led her to see a need for
collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Judaism had taught her the importance of demonstrating faith
through actions, so she jumped at the chance to join Seminary
Summer.
</P>
<P>
   Hadley, the son of a union carpenter, converted from evangelical
Protestantism to Catholicism in part because of its commitment to
social justice. ''As business becomes more faceless, the religious
community is the only one left to stand for the worker,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone shares this enthusiasm. When Hadley spoke to a
parish men's group about the AFL-CIO, ''the heat went on in the
room,'' he says. Kessler's Detroit friends kept bringing up union
corruption. Undeterred, the Seminary Summer interns trained for a
week before moving to their assigned cities.
</P>
<P>
   Graham went to Chicago, where he is trying to organize a team of
day laborers. He spends mornings at a shelter talking to workers
who sleep there. ''Some get up at 4 or 5 and sit around for
hours,'' not knowing if they will get work, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, Jenkins is meeting with poultry workers while
enlisting the support of religious leaders. He has attended Latino,
African American and Vietnamese churches, he says, where workers
''let their guard down and tell their stories.'' They've told him
about losing fingers in the machinery and poverty level wages.
''There are no bathroom breaks,'' he says, ''so workers sometimes
have to urinate on themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the interns' target has been Goldman Sachs -- the
Wall Street firm where Hadley asked for the CEO. The AFL-CIO's
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union is trying to
organize workers in the company cafeteria, run by a subcontractor
called Restaurant Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, who has friends at investment firms earning more than
$100,000, says some cafeteria workers couldn't afford company
health insurance. ''I met a food service worker who has to go on
Medicaid to have her baby,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Cafeteria workers were skeptical at first. Abby Saez, 34, says:
''Most young people just want to party. They don't care if we have
a job or not. It's good to know young people are out there
helping.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Kathleen Baum says the firm supports
''the workers' right to decide for themselves whether they want to
be represented by this union.'' A lawyer for Restaurant Associates
did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   When the interns' training ended, expectations were high, Hadley
says. ''It all seemed so glorious: labor prevails.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizing in the real world proved more complex.
</P>
<P>
   Hadley and Kessler approached local clergy people to try to
enlist their support. Some offered their signatures but others were
hesitant to sign, worried about offending congregants who worked
for Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too close to home,'' Kessler says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she says, quoting a Hebrew prayer, ''We don't have to
complete the task before us. We just have to begin.''

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Alberto Gains Strength  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Alberto, the first hurricane of the Atlantic
season, continued its northwesterly course over open ocean early
Thursday, one day after returning to hurricane strength.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto intensified Wednesday after briefly weakening to a
tropical storm. Forecasters predicted it will stay far from land.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said another smaller system they had been watching
east of Florida had tapered off.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are remnants out there,'' said Brian Jarvinen, a
hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
''We expect that to drive along to the northeast for the next
couple of days or so -- and not cause any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberto is expected to swing northward later in the week and
pass well east of Bermuda, forecasters said. At 11 p.m. Thursday,
it was about 420 miles southeast of Bermuda and moving at 15 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto had sustained 75 mph winds and could strengthen to 100
mph over the next three days, forecasters said. However, it was
expected to weaken over cooler waters to the north and become a
tropical system.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still predicting it could intensify today or tomorrow,''
Avila said Thursday. ''It will move to the northeast over upper
waters and that's it. It has about a day and a half to get
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through November
30, peaking around Labor Day. Noted hurricane expert William Gray
is predicting 11 named storms, seven hurricanes and three major
hurricanes this year.

<HEADLINE> Driver Fined in Powell Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- A traffic court fined an electrician $10
Thursday for not staying in his lane on a Virginia highway after
retired Army Gen. Colin Powell crashed into him.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Powell, driving a blue 1971 Mercedes, smashed into Ed
Nolan's pickup truck on a toll road just outside Washington.
Although Nolan said he was stopped in traffic for 30 seconds after
swerving to avoid an accident, the police officer at the scene gave
Nolan a ticket for an improper lane change.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
national security adviser, claimed that Nolan changed lanes in
front of him, causing the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan, of Annapolis, Md., contested the ticket in a Fairfax
County, Va., court.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan's pickup sustained minor damage, about $360, but the
damage to Powell's vintage Mercedes came to $11,000, according to
Nolan's insurance company. After the accident, Nolan and Powell
exchanged information, but Nolan did not recognize Powell, who was
dressed casually. Nolan took a picture that indicated a 65-foot
skid mark that Powell's car left on the road.
</P>
<P>
   A Virginia state police spokeswoman said after the trial that
the skid mark was not an indication that speed was involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''Powell's car never left the lane,'' spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell
told The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The judge found Nolan guilty, and fined him $10, plus $30 in
court costs.

<HEADLINE> Earthquakes Give Japan the Jitters  </HEADLINE>
By CHISAKI WATANABE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Will Japan survive the summer?
</P>
<P>
   For more than a month, daily earthquake bulletins have flashed
across TV screens, sometimes every half hour. Several quakes have
been so strong that national broadcaster NHK has thrown out normal
programming and switched to emergency warning mode.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, three volcanoes have belched large eruptions in the
past four months.
</P>
<P>
   Although Japan is one of the world's most earthquake- and
eruption-prone countries, a flurry of extraordinary activity lately
is fraying the nation's nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's jitters continued Thursday, as a volcano on an island
off Tokyo erupted for the fourth time in a month, sending black ash
into the sky and forcing the evacuation of more than 600 residents.
</P>
<P>
   The eruption of Mount Oyama on Miyakejima, a small resort island
with a population of 4,000, was its biggest since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   It was not unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two months, seismographs on Miyakejima and other
islands in the Izu chain have recorded tens of thousands of
earthquakes believed to be the result of shifts in huge underground
pools of magma.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 12,000 of the quakes have been strong enough to be felt,
and some have even swayed buildings in Tokyo and neighboring
Yokohama, 120 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The strong quakes automatically send Japan's emergency warning
system into motion, resulting in news flashes and cautions of
possible quake-caused tidal waves.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe the activity in Izu will continue, but admit
they are having trouble predicting what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect the same level of activity to continue,'' said
Yoshifumi Niide of the Central Meteorological Agency. ''But
prediction regarding volcanoes is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   To the legions of nervous Japanese seeking reassurance, that's
not much consolation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I get worried that an earthquake will hit Tokyo, too,'' said
Yoshiko Matsubara, a 65-year-old Tokyo housewife. ''I will never
get used to those bulletins on the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Though damage and casualties have so far been surprisingly light
-- one person has died -- the Izu activity is just the latest in what
has been a very seismic year for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mount Usu volcano in northern Japan erupted in March
and April for the first time in 22 years, 13,000 people were
ordered to evacuate. Two months later, Sakurajima, a constantly
sputtering volcano in southern Japan, exploded with four large
eruptions in one day.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a magnitude 6.1 earthquake hit the central Japan
province of Ibaraki and a magnitude 7.3 offshore quake stopped
bullet trains southwest of Tokyo over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   According to experts, the current activity is not necessarily an
omen of some bigger disaster -- which in Japan usually means a
catastrophic quake in Tokyo -- in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no correlation,'' said Kazuo Oike, a professor and
earthquake expert at Kyoto University.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that doesn't mean there's nothing for the 20
million people living in the greater Tokyo area to be worried
about.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's an area where you always have to watch out,'' he said.
''Anything could happen there.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's capital has repeatedly been devastated by earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Quakes ravaged the city in 1703, 1782 and 1812. In 1855, 7,000
people were killed. The latest disaster, the Great Kanto Earthquake
of 1923 and the fires that it touched off, killed more than 100,000
people and left an estimated 1.6 million people homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that, based on historical cycles, Tokyo is
now overdue for another big quake. A government report released
last year estimated that about 7,100 people would likely die and
500,000 homes be destroyed if a magnitude 7 quake hit the city
today.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the jolts and jitters, memories of the quake that
flattened the port city of Kobe just five years ago remain vivid.
More than 6,000 people were killed in the devastation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I worry what would happen to us if a quake hits here,'' said
Yoko Nagase, a housewife in a Tokyo suburb. ''I worry about my
insurance, if I should increase my earthquake coverage.''

Thousands Change Tires After Recall

is only recalling tires in four states as it tries to manage demand. At least
one other manufacturer, Goodyear, announced it was increasing production to help
meet demand created by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.'s recall of 6.5 million tires
-- most of which are on Ford sport utility vehicles and light trucks.

<HEADLINE> Downey Jr. Gets TV Role  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Robert Downey Jr., released from prison
last week, didn't have to wait long to find work.
</P>
<P>
   He will be joining the Fox series ''Ally McBeal'' in a recurring
role, playing a mysterious stranger who seems able to connect with
the complicated Ally, played by Calista Flockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're thrilled. We've admired his work for years and know
he'll make an enormous contribution to 'Ally McBeal,''' series
creator David E. Kelley said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''David's a genius, Calista's awesome, and once again I have a
choice of shirt colors,'' Downey said, apparently joking about his
recent prison garb. He will make his debut in the series' season
premiere on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Downey, 34, was jailed in June after he admitted during a
probation hearing that he missed scheduled drug tests. He was
sentenced to three years in prison for violating his probation but
gained early release because of errors made in calculating his
sentence and the time he had served.
</P>
<P>
   After his release, the actor moved into Walden House, a facility
he had previously lived in while trying to end his drug problem.
His attorney said it was to help him make the transition from
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The actor's legal troubles date to June 1996 when he was stopped
for speeding on the Pacific Coast Highway and authorities found
cocaine, heroin and a pistol in his vehicle.

<HEADLINE> Eminem Rejects Mother's Settlement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. (AP) -- Rap superstar Eminem has rejected
his mother's offer to settle her $10 million defamation lawsuit
against him for $2 million, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Mathers-Briggs of St. Joseph, Mo., filed suit in
September 1999 against her son, whose real name is Marshall Bruce
Mathers III. She alleges the Grammy-winning musician defamed her by
describing her in magazine interviews as an unstable, lawsuit-happy
drug user.
</P>
<P>
   Mathers-Briggs' attorney, Fred Gibson, submitted the settlement
offer to Macomb County Circuit Court after privately relaying the
offer to Eminem in June, The Macomb Daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Sterling Heights resident did not respond to
either offer. Eminem still intends to take the civil suit to trial
and will claim truth as a defense, said his attorney, Peter
Peacock.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem is scheduled to give a deposition on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   His latest album, ''The Marshall Mathers LP,'' has sold more
than 4 million copies sold since its release.
</P>
<P>
   He faces felony charges in two Michigan counties. He is charged
in one case with carrying a concealed weapon and assault with a
dangerous weapon for allegedly threatening a man who kissed the
star's wife at a bar.

<HEADLINE> Report: Raptors, Mark Jackson Agree  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Free agent point guard Mark Jackson has
agreed to a four-year, $14 million contract with the Toronto
Raptors, a newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The team denied a deal was done, but Jackson, in an interview
with The Indianapolis Star, confirmed he had come to terms with the
Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   ''They stepped up to the plate. That's what it boiled down to.
It was a no-brainer,'' Jackson told The Star.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was to be announced at a news conference Friday,
according to The Fan 590, an all-sports station in Toronto that is
the Raptors' official broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also told the Toronto Sun that being pursued by Raptors
GM Glen Grunwald and new head coach Lenny Wilkens were important
factors in his decision to go to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was talking to both of them,'' Jackson said. ''They made me
feel really appreciated. They gave me the sense of being wanted,
and it was really good to feel that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Indiana Pacers didn't make him feel wanted, Jackson
answered carefully: ''I didn't have any conversations with them.
But I'll talk about that soon enough. I just want to be a Raptor.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacers president Donnie Walsh said Thursday he had wanted to
re-sign Jackson, but acknowledged the team couldn't match a
contract from a team with plenty of salary cap room.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt he got an unbelievable offer from Toronto and I
understand why he had to take it,'' Walsh told The Star. ''I'll
miss him a lot, and somewhere down the line I know he'll be a great
NBA coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the Raptors and Chicago Bulls have a large amount of cap
room and Jackson, 35, has been linked with Toronto since the end of
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Raptors forward Antonio Davis, who played with Jackson in
Indiana, has reportedly been lobbying Toronto to sign Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 6-foot-3 and 205 pounds, has also played for the New
York Knicks and Los Angeles Clippers during his 13-year career. He
averaged 8.1 points and 27.0 minutes for the Pacers last season.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana has already committed to paying $182 million in deals
that re-signed their other free agents from the team that reached
the NBA Finals last season -- Reggie Miller, Jalen Rose, Austin
Croshere and Sam Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   When Miller's extension was announced Wednesday, he said he
wanted Jackson back with the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark has meant so much to the franchise,'' Miller said in a
statement distributed at the news conference. ''You hear about some
of these jerks and some of these guys with attitudes, it is hard to
find quality people who know how to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark knows how to play the game. It would be a disservice to
this organization if they do not sign Mark.''

<HEADLINE> Thousands Change Tires After Recall  </HEADLINE>
By APRIL CASTRO
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Motorists have been waiting for hours at overtaxed
tire stores in the hunt for replacements for Firestone tires the
company is recalling because of concerns they may be a factor in a
series of car crashes.
</P>
<P>
   At least one other manufacturer, Goodyear, announced it was
increasing production to help meet demand created by
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.'s recall of 6.5 million tires -- the
radial ATX and radial ATX II and the Wilderness AT brands -- most of
which are on Ford sport utility vehicles and light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the company is only recalling tires in four states as it
tries to manage demand. Though South Carolina has demanded to be
added to that list.
</P>
<P>
   Still, customers are already finding that many stores already
have sold out of the appropriate Firestone tires, or encountered
long waits for them to be swapped.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone is offering replacements of certain
specific brands, with their brand or a competitor's brand, at no
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Rubio, assistant manager at Firestone Tire and Service
Center in Miami Beach, Fla., spent the day putting customers on
queue for replacement tires.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are putting people down on a list and when the tires come
in, people can come and pick them up,'' Rubio said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davis, 33, of Miami Beach put down his name for four
Firestone Wilderness AT tires for his Ford Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are number 60,'' Davis said. ''It's an inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, motorist Steve Balogh visited several sold-out
Firestone outlets. Because he'll begin driving his two children to
school Monday, he decided to buy Michelins and seek reimbursement
from Firestone later.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing that's foremost on my mind right now is safety,''
Balogh said, while lounging in a National Tire and Battery waiting
area with a novel and a cup of coffee. ''The cargo I'm carrying is
just too valuable, so it's worth the wait. They said there are
about six or seven Explorers in front of me out here, so it's going
to be a little while.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen Ford Explorers were parked in front of a
Firestone Tire and Service Center in North Miami Beach, Fla. ''It's
been very busy -- it's crazy. We have orders booked for a month,''
said Firestone employee Duff Restrepo.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the second biggest tire recall ever,
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. said Wednesday that drivers in Texas,
California, Arizona and Florida would get attention first because
of indications that hot weather may contribute to the tire problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand the problem of meeting demand, but if that tire
is unsafe in Florida -- and we're talking about these tires killing
people -- then how can you say it can't be replaced in South
Carolina until next summer?'' Attorney General Charlie Condon said,
referring to the late-2001 expected completion date of the third
tier of the recall.
</P>
<P>
   Condon sent a letter Thursday to seven states scheduled to be in
the second tier of the recall asking their attorneys general to
join him.	   Those states are Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Nevada, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. The recall there will be effective
in the fall and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
The third phase covers the rest of the country and is expected to
be completed by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we want to make sure everybody in South Carolina is
comfortable and is confident in their tires,'' said
Bridgestone/Firestone spokeswoman Cynthia McCafferty.
</P>
<P>
   James Rabb, owner of a 1998 Ford Explorer, postponed a road trip
from San Dimas, Calif. -- just east of Los Angeles -- to San
Francisco on Wednesday until his tires could be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to make sure we're rolling on good rubber,'' Rabb said.
''This is one lottery I don't want to be the winner of.''

<HEADLINE> Cheney, North Relationship Probed  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a member of Congress in 1986, Dick Cheney
was present for one of the defining moments in the Iran-Contra
scandal -- a White House meeting where Oliver North misled members
of the House Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The episode, however, didn't keep Cheney from defending North at
the Iran-Contra hearings a year later or from stumping for him in
1994 when North ran for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   With his record scrutinized anew as George W. Bush's running
mate, Cheney is declining to discuss his role as a top Republican
on the House committee that investigated the Iran-Contra scandal in
the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''This race is about the future and what Governor Bush and
Secretary Cheney will do for the country, not on a resolved
situation from the past,'' Cheney spokesman Dirk Vande Beek
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, Congress held nationally televised hearings
into whether the Reagan administration improperly arranged for
military assistance to the Contra rebels battling communism in
Nicaragua at a time when U.S. aid to the rebels had been banned by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney helped lead the Republican defense of the Reagan
administration and North, trying to counter Democratic accusations
of lying and cover-up by highlighting North's tireless efforts on
behalf of the communist-fighting guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney even gave away some of his own time for asking questions
at the 1987 hearings so North, dressed in crisp military uniform,
could give a tutorial on Soviet-financed military might in Central
America and the dire straits of the Contra fighting force.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colonel North has been, I think, the most effective and
impressive witness certainly this committee has heard, and I know I
speak for a great many Americans when I thank him for his years of
devoted service to the nation, both in the United States Marine
Corps and as a member of the NSC (National Security Council)
staff,'' Cheney said in July 1987, concluding his questioning of
North.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's intersection with the scandal actually began earlier.
</P>
<P>
   When news stories in mid-1986 suggested that North was
overseeing a secret arms network to the Contras at a time when such
assistance was banned, then-House Intelligence Committee chairman
Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., pressed for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In the White House Situation Room on Aug. 6, 1986, North told
Cheney, Hamilton and nine other lawmakers on the intelligence
committee that his ''principle mission'' was to coordinate contacts
between U.S. officials and the Contras.
</P>
<P>
   North told the lawmakers he gave the Contras advice on human
rights and stressed the need for an improved civic image.
</P>
<P>
   As the Aug. 6 discussion ended, Hamilton ''expressed his
appreciation ... and indicated his satisfaction in the responses
received.''
</P>
<P>
   But minutes after the congressmen departed, North returned to
his work coordinating military supplies to the Contras.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, after being granted immunity from prosecution at
the Iran-Contra hearings, North admitted he'd made false statements
and ''misled the Congress'' in the Aug. 6 meeting. ''I tried to
avoid telling outright lies. But I certainly wasn't telling the
truth,'' North explained in his 1991 book.
</P>
<P>
   North did not return phone messages and a written request for
comment sent to his office this week.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight Republicans who signed the minority report on the
Iran-Contra affair, Cheney was the only one who had been lied to
face-to-face by North at the 1986 meeting. Still, he remained
supportive of the Reagan White House and North.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hamilton credited Cheney and the Republicans
with doing an effective job of protecting President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ''My impression of the position of the House Republicans
generally, of which he (Cheney) was one, was that they really took
the attitude that the end justifies the means,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In other words, the support of the Contras was so important
that if you fudged the law a little bit and fudged the truth it was
justified because we were fighting communism,'' Hamilton added.
</P>
<P>
   Former Democratic Rep. Bob Kastenmeier, another member of the
committee, was less complimentary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cheney was a member of the minority serving the White House
and not the committee, and he was the only member on the other side
I would say that about,'' Kastenmeier said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington attorney Dick Leon, who worked as a lawyer for
Republicans at the Iran-Contra hearings, defended Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was made very clear to us by Mr. Cheney personally that we
were there to get to the bottom of the facts wherever they would
lead us,'' Leon said.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted Cheney and other congressional Republicans signed
a final report that was ''quite critical of some of the most senior
members of the administration, from the secretaries of defense,
state and the White House chief of staff on down to North and his
immediate superiors.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney and seven House and Senate Republicans characterized the
White House's deception as ''a fundamental mistake'' but suggested
the deception was not designed to hide any illegalities.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney and his GOP colleagues, however, refused to join
Republican Sens. Warren Rudman and William Cohen and Democrats in
concluding that Reagan failed in his constitutional duty to ''take
care that the laws be faithfully executed.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, Cheney campaigned for the former Marine
colonel in his unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Senate seat from
Virginia. Cheney praised North for embracing the same conservative
principles as Ronald Reagan.

<HEADLINE> McCaffrey Optimistic About Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- Barry McCaffrey, a retired four-star
U.S. Army general who has led Washington's war on drugs for the
past five years, is facing one of his toughest battles yet.
</P>
<P>
   He is overseeing a controversial $1.3 billion U.S. aid package
to Colombia that includes combat helicopters, weapons and training
by the elite U.S. Special Forces -- all part of an effort to stanch
the flow of drugs out of a country riven by war, death squads and
drug lords.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scale of the task before him, McCaffrey remains
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a widespread belief on the part of a lot of very smart
people that confronting drug production in Colombia is obviously
impossible and therefore why should you start,'' McCaffrey said in
an interview this week in Colombia. ''But the situation here is not
hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey and U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering met
Thursday with Colombian President Andres Pastrana to work out the
final details of the aid package. Most of the money will go to
supply this Andean nation with about 100 U.S. military advisers, 60
combat helicopters, weapons, and miscellaneous hardware for its war
on drug producers.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan, approved by Congress and signed by President
Clinton last month, also includes more than $400 million for
nonmilitary programs, such as encouraging farmers to plant
alternative crops. Specific use of those funds has yet to be worked
out, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a process that we will need to develop as we go
along,'' Pickering said, adding that both countries have sought
advice on how to best use the money from Colombian non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey calls the aid -- military and not -- the first step
toward Colombia's national recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is saying it will be easy, the hard work now begins.
But we need Colombia to know that they are not in this fight alone
(and) isolated. We need them to know we will win it,'' said
McCaffrey, who was a commander during the Persian Gulf War and
chief of U.S. forces in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   As director of the White House National Drug Control Policy
Office, McCaffrey has often enjoyed bipartisan support in
Washington, as well as foes for his tough stand against the use of
medical marijuana. During his five years, anti-drug spending has
grown to almost $6 billion, funds for drug-prevention programs have
increased 54 percent and the budget for drug-addiction treatment
has grown 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But helping Colombia step back from the brink is another
challenge altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Pastrana, who has an approval rating of barely 30 percent,
is trying to gain the upper hand in a 36-year war against more than
26,000 leftist guerrillas who reportedly earn at least $370 million
a year from their drug-protection racket.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the violence, right-wing paramilitary units kill
guerrillas and civilians suspected of being leftist sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   Armed groups across the spectrum, as well as common criminals,
kidnap some 3,000 people a year for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   And -- despite Washington's efforts over the years -- Colombian
drug production has increased. The country supplies the vast
majority of the world's cocaine. It also supplies most of the
heroin sold on the East Coast of the United States and now ranks
fourth in the world in overall production, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Bogota has stepped up its cooperation with Washington on the
drug front. On Thursday, Pastrana signed an order to extradite one
of his country's most powerful and ruthless drug traffickers to the
United States for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Orlandez Gamboa is wanted by U.S. prosecutors for
importing thousands of pounds of cocaine to the United States. His
lawyer said he will keep fighting the extradition.
</P>
<P>
   And as McCaffrey helps coordinate the unfolding of Washington's
costly assistance to Colombia, human rights groups worry that the
U.S. military is getting too friendly with an army that may ignore
or even encourage attacks on civilians by right-wing death squads.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics say they see the early stages of Vietnam all over
again. Still others are concerned that aerial spraying of
pesticides on crops of coca and poppy could harm Colombia's
environment -- and the health of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   While McCaffrey rejected those points, he conceded that U.S. aid
initiative is not perfect. But he said he believes it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a huge, beautiful country with 40 million people whom
we admire ... and who are sick of the drugs and the violence
here,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Targets Sanchez on Fund-Raiser  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE DeARMOND
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- Rep. Loretta Sanchez's insistence on
holding a fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion cost her a speaking
role at next week's party convention and could also prompt the
Democrats to boot one of their highest-profile minorities from a
leading party post.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was ''sorely disappointed,'' Democratic National
Committee Chairman Joe Andrew said he had ''no alternative but to
take action.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Loretta Sanchez will not be speaking at the Democratic
National Convention next week,'' Andrew said in a written statement
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials plan to meet Aug. 18 to determine what, if any,
additional action to take. They could remove Sanchez from her
position as the party's general co-chair, a job Vice President Al
Gore selected her for, as well as withdraw support from her
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Mark Fabiani said the vice president was
''in complete support'' of Thursday's action.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're sorry this has not been resolved. We bent over backwards
to find other locations and we've just reached the end of the
line,'' Fabiani said.
</P>
<P>
   The party is billed as a fund-raiser for Hispanic Unity, USA,
which promotes voter registration among Hispanics. It is expected
to draw about 600 people.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Sanchez, Andrew said that ''as the father of
young children, I tried to convey to you my dismay at the kind of
message this event would send.'' The event, he said, ''was neither
appropriate nor reflective of our party's values.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Sanchez called a news conference outside her
district office to say she respected Gore's decision not to attend,
but wouldn't cancel the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''We selected a high-profile venue to highlight the important
work of Hispanic Unity, USA. The event is sold out and it will be a
great success,'' she said, reading a statement. She refused to
answer questions before retreating behind locked doors.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez stressed that the event will raise money for
registering, educating and empowering Hispanics, a goal she said
Gore and other members of Congress support.
</P>
<P>
   ''I considered their concerns carefully, consulted with my board
of directors, the event's host committee and others,'' she said.
''They strongly recommended that the events proceed as planned.''
</P>
<P>
   An attempt to reach other members of Hispanic Unity, USA, was
unsuccessful. A staffer answering phones at the organization's
headquarters identified the office as the Sanchez campaign office
and referred comment to Sanchez's spokeswoman, who did not return
repeated calls from The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Rodriguez, a Hispanic issues analyst at the New America
Institute, a nonprofit public policy group, said Democrats were
taking a risk by ''coming down on a woman that they themselves made
an icon of Hispanic political empowerment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson Diaz, chairman of the DNC Hispanic Caucus, said he
fully supported Andrew's decision because ''holding the event at
the Playboy Mansion sends a message that is antithetical to values
of the Latino community and the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Torres, chairman of the California Democratic Party and a
Hispanic, said Democrats are ''not going to abandon her as a
candidate'' but that the state leadership is ''saddened'' by the
events.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does not send the right symbolic message and it just plays
into the hands of the Republicans,'' Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are running Gloria Matta Tuchman, their 1998 nominee
for state schools superintendent, against Sanchez this year.
Winning the seat would help them hold onto the House and give them
back a seat they held for 18 years until Bob Dornan lost it in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   While openly criticizing Sanchez, Gore's campaign has benefited
from Playboy's largesse as well. Hugh Hefner donated $1,000 to
Gore's campaign on March 17, 1999, and Hefner's daughter, Christie,
gave $500 to Gore in April of this year, Federal Election
Commission records show.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials accused the Gore campaign of hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may not like talking about it, but they sure do enjoy
that Playboy money,'' said Jim Nicholson, Republican National
Committee chairman.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Peacekeeper Killed in E. Timor  </HEADLINE>
By HEATHER PATERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- A suspected anti-independence militia
group in East Timor shot and killed a Nepalese U.N. peacekeeper, a
U.N. spokesman said. Three peacekeepers and a civilian were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Devi Ram Jaishi, 25, was the second U.N. peacekeeper to die
in fighting in East Timor. He was pronounced dead on arrival late
Thursday at the military hospital in Dili, according to the
spokesman for peacekeepers in Dili, Norwegian Col. Brynjar Nymo.
</P>
<P>
   A second Nepalese soldier was in the military hospital in the
capital in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers were patrolling an area 20 miles from the
border of West Timor, which is still part of Indonesia, when the
suspected militia group they had been tracking fired on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have confirmation whether they were ambushed by the
militia gang or if an exchange of fire took place,'' Nymo said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other peacekeepers and a civilian were treated on the spot
and at a hospital in the southern town of Suai.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations moved into East Timor to administer its
transition to independence after Indonesian military-backed
militias went on a rampage of killing and destruction 11 months ago
to oppose a vote by East Timorese for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The territory was invaded by Indonesia 25 years ago as colonial
power Portugal retreated.
</P>
<P>
   The first U.N. peacekeeper to die in fighting in East Timor was
a New Zealand soldier who was shot in the head July 24 during a
clash with anti-independence militias.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Condemns 'Moral Crisis'  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Further polarizing the Reform Party,
candidate Pat Buchanan bemoaned America's ''moral crisis'' as rival
factions staged separate conventions that will likely award dual
presidential nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan portrayed himself as the winner of the intraparty
battle and the nomination, planning a Friday announcement of his
running mate and a Saturday acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   But followers of party founder Ross Perot held their own
convention next door to their adversaries', declaring it the
''true'' nominating gathering and rallying behind nuclear physicist
John Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
   Reconciliation talks between the factions broke down, all but
ensuring that the outcome of the twin nominations would be decided
by federal elections officials and perhaps ultimately by a court.
</P>
<P>
   The Perot-Hagelin wing filed a complaint with the Federal
Elections Commission contending that Buchanan's forces had
illegally rigged the process.
</P>
<P>
   The action sought to block Buchanan from receiving the $12.5
million that the government will award the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Perot followers reject Buchanan's conservative views on such
moral issues as abortion, saying such matters are not part of the
party's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The former Republican further alienated them with a fiery speech
Thursday denouncing ''social and moral decline and cultural
decadence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Rampant homosexuality, a sign of cultural decadence and moral
decline from Rome to Weimar, is celebrated, as our first lady
parades up Fifth Avenue to share her 'pride' in a lifestyle ruinous
to body and soul alike,'' Buchanan said in a speech.
</P>
<P>
   He warned of an America in which ''abortions replace tonsil
removals as America's most common medical procedure,'' and
lambasted Hollywood for serving up ''vulgar'' entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   He condemned the Democratic Party for ignoring the ''moral
crisis'' and the GOP for seeking ''peace'' with gay groups.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, delegates to the splinter convention received his
remarks with alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's none of the government's business -- government doesn't
have the moral authority to decide what individual Americans'
habits should be,'' said Paul Wilson, a delegate from Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe Buchanan is a good man but the wrong man for the
Reform Party, which was founded on libertarian principles,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's going to serve any purpose, saying things
like that, which are just inflammatory,'' said Stanley Spink, a
delegate from North Kingstown, R.I., who opposes Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can be sure that's among the reasons people (in the party)
have split,'' said his wife, delegate June Spink.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin appeared to respond to Buchanan in his own speech to
more than 1,000 people in the breakaway convention.
</P>
<P>
   The path to victory is ''not through a message of exclusivity
and intolerance, not through embroiling ourselves in divisive
social issues,'' he said. ''But by putting forth an inclusive
message, a broad-based platform of commonsense reforms that the
overwhelming majority of people support.''
</P>
<P>
   Added former party chairman Russell Verney, a Hagelin backer:
''If you have hate in your heart, get out the door, we don't want
you.''
</P>
<P>
   While Buchanan focused on America's moral decline, Hagelin
offered proposals on a litany of issues, including campaign-finance
reform, preventive health care, clean energy, teachers' salaries
and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the party would rise from the disarray, declaring:
''The reports of the demise of the Reform Party are exaggerated.''

<HEADLINE> Helicopter Crashes on Swede Mountain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- A helicopter with three people on board
crashed into a mountainside early Friday while trying to rescue two
climbers in arctic Sweden, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews were trying to reach the site of the crash on
Kebnekaise, Sweden's highest mountain, police said in Gaellivare,
the closest town, about 720 miles north of the capital, Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the helicopter crew was not known.
</P>
<P>
   The climbers were still stuck on the mountain but were not
injured in the crash, police spokesman Owe Savonen said.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter, which had been called in by a rescue team that
had reached two climbers, was approaching the group when it crashed
about 6,000 feet up the mountain, Savonen said.
</P>
<P>
   Two helicopters and another rescue team, as well as rescuers who
had already reached the climbers by foot, also were trying to reach
the site of the wreck on the southwest side of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very steep terrain; it's very difficult climbing,''
Savonen said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Ahead in Battle For States  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The challenge facing Al Gore in the battle to
win states, and electoral votes, was underscored this week as
Republican George W. Bush campaigned in California.
</P>
<P>
   The powerhouse state, where Gore once led comfortably, now
appears competitive. And Bush is showing strength in the polls in
many other crucial states.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 states where both campaigns are focusing their energy and
advertising, Bush has a lead or an edge in more than half,
including some states Democrats should be able to count on. He was
even with Gore in seven of those states, while Gore was ahead in
two.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't think of any state where Gore is over-performing,''
said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst. ''From
what I've seen in the tossup states and even some states that are
reliably Democratic, Bush has an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Republican National Convention, Bush's single-digit
lead grew into double-digits in national polls, ranging from 11
points in some surveys to 18 points in a tracking poll. Gore heads
to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles next week
seeking a poll ''bounce'' of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a hurricane passing over the political electorate,''
Republican pollster Neil Newhouse said of the conventions' effect
on public opinion. ''We're in the eye now, then we're going to have
the Democratic Convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Substantial improvement by Gore in national polls should help
him in the state-by-state battle for electoral votes, which is how
the presidency is won. Whoever wins a state gets its electoral
votes. California, the biggest prize, has 54 electoral votes --
one-fifth of the 270 needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''A rising tide lifts all boats,'' Newhouse said, using
pollsters' favorite expression to describe the relationship between
national and state polls. ''Gore needs to raise his numbers
nationally before targeting states.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's widely praised vice presidential pick of Sen. Joe
Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew from Connecticut, should give him a
boost along with the weeklong convention exposure, some say.
</P>
<P>
   Gore couldn't have made a stronger pick, said Charles Oberly, a
Democrat and former Delaware attorney general who (knows)
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole situation has changed in a subtle manner,'' he said.
''Picking Lieberman will prove a dynamic move. He's an extremely
solid, contemplative, good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has an edge in polls in Delaware, as in many battleground
states. But Oberly thought Lieberman's addition to the ticket -- he
was the first Democrat in Congress to chastise President Clinton
for the Monica Lewinsky scandal -- could help level the playing
field on moral values.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that as voters begin to focus on the campaign and the
candidates' stand on the issues, they'll see that Al Gore is on
their side,'' said Gore campaign spokesman Doug Hattaway. ''The
choice of Joe Lieberman has created a lot of excitement and
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was traveling through California this week, before heading
to Oregon and Washington -- competitive states where Gore should be
strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''This allows us to spend time in traditional Democratic
strongholds while Al Gore has to fight to secure his base,'' Bush
campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, a poll released Thursday by the Public Policy
Institute of California, found Gore backed by 40 percent of likely
voters while Bush drew 37 percent. A Field Poll conducted in June
found Gore backed by 46 percent of likely voters and Bush by 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign hopes to build his electoral base in
Northeastern and West Coast states and fight it out in the
battlegrounds of Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania
and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was able to pick off several Southern states in his two
elections, but the South could be tougher for Democrats this time,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore is probably going to do worse in the South than in the
rest of the country,'' said Charles Bullock, a political scientist
at the University of Georgia. ''The polls suggest that Gore is even
less popular than Clinton in the South. He is simply not as
appealing to women. He doesn't have the charisma that Clinton had
and Bush seems to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has an edge in his home state of Tennessee, and is within
striking distance in Georgia. Both men are close in Florida, which
Clinton won in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   His immediate concern is to solidify his base of support in
crucial states like California.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our survey suggests that Gore needs to come to California and
win back the support of centrist voters,'' said Mark Baldassare,
survey director at the Public Policy Institute of California.
''He's got to come out and do a good job at this convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It depends on how he does this week and next,'' he said. ''He
got off to a good start with Lieberman ... he's got to build on
that.''

Cheney, North Relationship Probed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a member of Congress in 1986, Dick Cheney was present
for one of the defining moments in the Iran-Contra scandal -- a White House
meeting where Oliver North misled members of the House Intelligence Committee.
The episode, however, didn't keep Cheney from defending North at the Iran-Contra
hearings a year later or from stumping for him in 1994 when North ran for the
U.S. Senate. With his record scrutinized anew as George W. Bush's running mate,
Cheney is declining to discuss his role as a top Republican on the House
committee that investigated the Iran-Contra scandal in the mid-1980s.

   MIAMI (AP) -- Alberto, the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, continued
its northwesterly course over open ocean early Thursday, one day after returning
to hurricane strength. Alberto intensified Wednesday after briefly weakening to
a tropical storm. Forecasters predicted it will stay far from land. Forecasters
said another smaller system they had been watching east of Florida had tapered
off. Alberto is expected to swing northward later in the week and pass well east
of Bermuda, forecasters said. At 11 p.m. Thursday, it was about 420 miles
southeast of Bermuda and moving at 15 mph.

Another Tax Shelter To Be Shut Down

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is shutting down a new kind of
corporate tax shelter, continuing attacks on tax schemes the government contends
are costing it billions in lost revenue. The object of the notice being issued
Friday by the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service is a shelter
the administration dubbed ''Son of BOSS.'' The administration said the shelter
was an offshoot of a Bond and Option Sales Strategy shelter the government moved
to shut down in December. The government's action spells out the practices the
IRS has found objectionable and puts taxpayers on notice that they cannot use
those practices to avoid paying taxes.

Yahoo!'s auction site, where Nazi medallions, swastika-emblazoned battle flags
and other Third Reich paraphernalia can be bought and sold. The case, which
resumed on Friday, boils down to freedom of speech, which is caught in between
some nations' laws and the Internet's borderless, hard-to-regulate nature. In
France, it is illegal to sell or exhibit anything that incites racism and two
Paris-based human rights groups filed suit in April against Yahoo! for hosting
the auctions of Nazi objects. But Yahoo! is based in Santa Clara, Calif. and the
U.S. Constitution protects many pages expressing racist or extremist ideas.

<HEADLINE> 'Reality Tour' of L.A. Offered  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT JABLON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The air conditioned bus stopped in front of
the local landmark and the tourists got out to gawk and snap
photos.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's not every day they get to see a weedy,
block-long mountain of concrete rubble.
</P>
<P>
   As southern California puts on its best face for next week's
Democratic National Convention, activists showcased its seedier
side Thursday with a ''Reality Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   The sweep through downtown and the industrial suburbs of Los
Angeles included stops at a half-built high school sitting on a
toxic site and an oil refinery that critics fear could spread a
poison cloud in an accident. Community activists provided running
commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers saw it as a way to educate would-be convention
protesters and press the view that big-moneyed interests have
hijacked the political process at the expense of the poor and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a responsibility to look in our own back yard,'' said
Dan La Botz of Global Exchange, a San Francisco-based group that
organized the tour.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen activists, high schoolers and the simply curious
paid as much as $50 each for the three-day rolling teach-in.
</P>
<P>
   The tour also was to visit a prison, the city's garment
district, a Chinatown housing project, sweatshops and some of the
gathering places of day laborers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm learning that the communities want to mobilize, but it's
hard because they don't have money and they don't have power,''
said Joy Gohring, 25, a free-lance TV and stage comedy writer from
Hollywood. ''It breaks your heart ... how do they make a better
life for themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   The trip began the same day the media got a tour of the region's
glamorous entertainment industry, including Universal Studios, and
a discussion with studio heads.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hollywood and the facade of the movie industry is not the only
thing that exists in Los Angeles,'' said Leila Salazar of Global
Exchange. ''There are thousands of people who work in the garment
factories, there are thousands of day laborers. ... This is the
reality of Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   In Huntington Park, near downtown, tourists gaped at a 60-foot
pile of concrete rubble that neighbors have dubbed ''the mountain
of death.'' The owner had planned to sell the debris as road base
but legal wrangling held that up. Residents have complained that
grit blown from the 375,000-ton pile has caused asthma-like
symptoms and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Santa Fe Springs, tourists got out in the broiling
heat and smog to snap photos of a closed oil refinery. The tank
farm and jungle of rusting, twisting pipes may resume operations
next year under a company controlled by televangelist Pat
Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Workers unexpectedly came out to meet the group.
</P>
<P>
   ''If (Al) Gore wants the Latino vote, why does he not deal with
the environmental injustices and problems in these communities?''
said Jesus Torres, another organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The tour also viewed the Belmont Learning Center. The nation's
costliest high school project sits half-built within sight of
downtown's gleaming hotel and business towers. It was halted
because potentially toxic and explosive gases were found at the
site, which had been an oil field.

<HEADLINE> Vt. Campaign Finance Law Upheld  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) -- A federal judge has upheld much of
Vermont's campaign finance law in a ruling experts say could give
the U.S. Supreme Court an opportunity to reassess campaign finance
laws nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge William Sessions supported Vermont's
limit on individual campaign contributions in his ruling Thursday,
but declared unconstitutional provisions imposing limits on
campaign spending and out-of-state contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which went into effect in January 1998, limits campaign
contributions and spending and offers public financing to
candidates for governor and lieutenant governor. It also targets
so-called soft money by limiting indirect contributions and
out-of-state contributions to 25 percent of a candidate's total
campaign budget.
</P>
<P>
   In declaring the campaign spending and out-of-state contribution
limits unconstitutional, Sessions cited a 1976 Supreme Court case,
Buckley vs. Valeo. The high court ruled that free-speech rights
under the First Amendment outweigh any attempt to limit an
individual candidate's spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today this court has upheld the act to the furthest extent
that the First Amendment will allow,'' Sessions said in a 90-page
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the clearest language yet from a federal court that it
is time to revisit the Supreme Court's ruling in Buckley vs.
Valeo,'' said Brenda Wright, lead counsel for the National Voting
Rights Institute of Boston, which sided with the state in defending
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they were pleased with the outcome, but each is
considering an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''He recognized that expenditure limits may not be written in
granite,'' said Peter Langrock, a lawyer for the American Civil
Liberties Union, which challenged the law. Langrock hasn't decided
whether to appeal the part of the ruling that upheld limits on
contributions. The Vermont Republican party, which also opposed the
law, said it would appeal that part of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general's office, which defended the law, is
leaning toward its own appeal in a bid to restore spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions' statements were cheered by supporters of Vermont's
strict limits on campaign spending for offices from governor to
state representative.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for public funding under the law, a candidate for
governor must raise more than $35,000, with contributions from at
least 1,500 individuals, each giving no more than $50.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, Massachusetts and Maine also have implemented systems
of public campaign funding. Limits have been set on candidates'
expenditures or fund-raising in at least 24 states, and some
legislatures have set up partial systems of publicly financing
campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Gore Courts Labor Leaders  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Courting a key constituency in battleground
states, Al Gore is touting his tax proposals as a boon for working
women and assuring labor leaders ''I'll never let you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, at the same time, introduced new running mate Joe
Lieberman as ''the son of a bakery truck driver'' who has spent a
lifetime siding with working families.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was headed to Little Souls Inc., a suburban doll-making
company known for hiring the disabled and homeless and run by
women.
</P>
<P>
   At that event, and later collecting a key endorsement from the
United Auto Workers Union, Gore argued that his $500 billion
tax-cut package includes a tax credit for child care expenses, as
well as tax breaks for those taking care of elderly or infirm
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Those caregivers are largely women.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed to a $100 billion package improving Social
Security benefits for widows, all aimed at reminding working-class
voters that their interests would best be served by his election.
</P>
<P>
   The sound bite of his message is simple: He argues a single
mother with two children gets $1,358 in tax breaks under his
proposals, but only $295 under rival George W. Bush's broader tax
plans.
</P>
<P>
   It's a message Gore urgently needs to get out because Democrats
traditionally enjoy a ''gender gap'' sparked by women suspicious of
Republican candidates. Bush has targeted women and some polls show
him making inroads.
</P>
<P>
   In key battleground states like Pennsylvania and Michigan,
suburban woman are a crucial swing vote; Gore headed to both states
to court those voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's relations with labor have been occasionally rocky, but he
was putting the best face on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the Gore-Lieberman administration we are going to be
pro-union, pro-worker and pro-collective bargaining,'' said Gore,
speaking over a satellite hookup with a convention of steel worker
union leaders. ''I guarantee it.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest prize of the day was the autoworkers
endorsement, and Gore added a hastily scheduled trip to Michigan to
accept it. The endorsement had long been sought with resistance
strong in some parts of the 700,000-member union.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of the most important organizations representing
working people, particularly in the key states of the Midwest,''
said spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting the endorsement wasn't easy, because the union
sharply disagrees with Gore's backing of trade deals like the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and other backers argue free trade deals open markets
overseas for American goods. Labor leaders and other critics view
that as naive, warning they force American workers to compete with
countries lacking workplace or environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking a compromise, Gore has argued for approval of trade
deals, while including sections requiring trading partners to
upgrade labor and environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''Beneath our differences on some specific trade agreements, we
do agree on this important principle -- we have to use trade to lift
up labor and environmental standards around the world, not drag
them down,'' said Gore. ''I promise you this, I will never let you
down.''
</P>
<P>
   That compromise doesn't satisfy many in the UAW, a leading trade
critic, and the union had flirted openly with Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader. That flirtation has the potential of being very
damaging for Gore, because of the union's influence in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Some polls have suggested that Republican rival Bush gains from
Nader's presence, because the relatively small support he garners
comes out of Gore's base.
</P>
<P>
   While the union was withholding its endorsement to pressure
Gore, labor leaders faced pressure of their own. Bush's position on
trade is virtually identical to Gore, and the Republican is far
less likely to back other measures favored by union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The choice in this election is very simple and it comes down
to this -- we are for working families, not the powerful, not the
comfortable, not the well-off and well-connected,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gore argued that Lieberman is a tested friend
of labor.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Gore aides announced plans for a 400-mile boat ride down
the scenic Mississippi River, beginning the day after next week's
Democratic National Convention.

<HEADLINE> McCain: Independents Should Eye Bush  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LODI, Calif. (AP) -- George W. Bush thinks he can persuade
independent-minded voters to support him for president but, to be
safe, he's counting on help from Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The winner and loser of the GOP presidential nod were
campaigning together Friday in Portland, Ore., and at a fund-raiser
in Medina, Wash., after a day on the railroad through central
California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said those states have ''a lot of independent thinking
people,'' and thinks McCain -- who attracted independents during his
failed presidential run -- can help turn them on to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are states that in the past couple of election cycles,
people have said 'Well, you don't have a chance,''' the Texas
governor said Thursday. ''Not only do we have a chance, we're going
to do well, and it's awfully helpful to have John by my side.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Bush on a three-day campaign swing, McCain said he
was proud of Bush and promised to do more to help, either at Bush's
side or separately.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have offered to do whatever I can,'' he said during their
first stop Thursday in Salinas. ''So I will do whatever the Bush
campaign determines I can do most effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   That included a Thursday night fund-raiser in Stockton for the
state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain rallied independents and crossover Democrats to his
losing cause during the presidential primaries, but said he can't
tell them what to do now.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can really do is ask the independents to look at
Governor Bush,'' he said. ''Independents are independents because
they're independent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''... What I can do, really, is ask independents to look at him
and I hope that I have the credibility with them so they will
examine his campaign,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   He said they should find Bush's message of inclusion and
diversity attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The former rivals spent much of their first campaign day
together riding a 13-car chartered train for nearly four hours,
between rallies in Salinas and Lodi, with a quick stop between in
Pleasanton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a united party and we are going to reunite this
nation,'' McCain told a crowd that packed the platforms and tracks
behind the train at the Lodi station, their last stop Thursday. He
hailed Bush as the Republican who can carry California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush returned the praise to ''a man who's now on my team and I'm
on his.
</P>
<P>
   While the two clashed in the primaries, Bush said that's all
over and they are moving on together, allies as they were before
becoming rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I campaigned with John McCain,'' he said. ''I campaigned for
John McCain. I campaigned against John McCain. We're gone full
cycle. I'm campaigning with John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were friends before and we're friends now,'' Bush said.
''That's what you can tell the independent voter.''
</P>
<P>
   He brushed aside a question about his differences with McCain --
on tax cuts and campaign finance reform -- by saying Vice President
Al Gore and his running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, differ on some
issues and they're on the same ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore and Lieberman are in disagreement on school vouchers, and
that's going to be an interesting debate in their camp,'' Bush
said. ''Joe Lieberman and I agree on giving parents school
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers, supported by the Republicans and flatly opposed by
Gore, would permit parents to use government funds to help send
their children to private school. Lieberman has supported
experimental voucher programs.

<HEADLINE> Akers, Overbeck Back For Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Michelle Akers had shoulder surgery in
April and is hobbled by chronic fatigue syndrome. Carla Overbeck
had knee surgery in May, not long after she was diagnosed with
Graves' disease.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to imagine a U.S. women's soccer team without
either of them. Both were at practice Thursday, Akers wearing a
harness and Overbeck a brace, as both were selected to the
18-player squad that will represent the United States at the
Olympics next month in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having Michelle Akers and Carla Overbeck on this team was a
decision that I made in my mind two or three months ago,'' coach
April Heinrichs said.
</P>
<P>
   ''While Carla's knee might be at only 70 to 75 percent right
now, her will and power among these players, along with her
leadership, makes her the glue of this team. ... We all know that
Michelle one year ago helped this country win one of its most
impressive trophies ever. One year away from that, she is still a
world-class player, but she struggles with her shoulder. I think
what we will see over the next couple of weeks that she will get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of the 20 players from last year's World Cup
championship squad, including all of the regular starters, were
selected. Although Heinrichs has initiated something of a youth
movement, the only major difference between the Olympic team and
the World Cup team is starting goalkeeper Siri Mullinix, who
displaced Briana Scurry while Scurry was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs initially made the veterans nervous when she
experimented with younger lineups after she succeeded Tony DiCicco
in January. It quickly became apparent that five players from the
World Cup team -- Tisha Venturini, Danielle Fotopoulos, Tiffany
Roberts, Tracy Ducar and Saskia Webber -- did not figure in
Heinrichs' Olympic plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the first week, some players approached me and were a
little concerned about bringing in these young players,'' Heinrichs
said. ''I told them if we had more than two to three younger
players, we've made too much of a change. I'm so proud of these
players who've hung in there, and clawed to hang around this team.
We weeded out the ones that aren't mentally ready yet, and we
weeded out the ones that aren't physically ready yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs' eye on the future was reflected in three players who
weren't at the World Cup -- Mullinix, 22, Nikki Serlenga, 22, and
Danielle Slaton, 20 -- but the mainstays are still in place, from
Mia Hamm to Brandi Chastain to Overbeck to 34-year-old Akers, the
oldest player on the roster. Akers and Overbeck, who each appeared
in three World Cups and the 1996 Olympics, both say this will be
their last international tournament -- and both admitted they
weren't sure they'd make this one.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a concern of mine after being diagnosed with Graves'
disease,'' Overbeck said. ''I got that under control, then my knee
surgery came about, and finding out that my knee wouldn't be right
for six months when I only had three was hard. But I was determined
to make it back in time.''
</P>
<P>
   The team is training in Annapolis and will play there against
Russia in the first game of a three-game Olympic kickoff tour
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Thompson Wins 100-M Butterfly  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- When his body aches and his health is
questionable, Tom Dolan knows he can always count on his freestyle
leg of the 400-meter individual medley.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming his strongest stroke for the final 100 meters, Dolan
overtook Erik Vendt and Tom Wilkens in a thrilling finish to earn a
spot on the U.S. Olympic team Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Moses, meanwhile, gulped down a cup of coffee 30 minutes
before setting an American record in the 100 breaststroke and
winning an Olympic berth two years after returning full time to his
childhood sport.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Thompson defeated rival Dara Torres in the 100 butterfly
final, while 18-year-old Diana Munz made her first Olympic team in
the 400 freestyle on the second night of the trials.
</P>
<P>
   Checking his time of 4 minutes, 13.72 seconds on the scoreboard,
Dolan punched the water defiantly and tore off his goggles, having
turned away another challenge to his 400 IM dominance that began
with setting the world record in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can put anyone you want in front of me in the final 100,
and they better pray pretty hard I'm not reeling them in coming
home,'' he said. ''I knew I could still bring it home better than
anyone else in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolan wasn't feeling as confident Monday when he had a
102-degree fever. The asthmatic couldn't even swim 50 meters that
day because his lungs were choked. The fever had disappeared by
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm on so many antibiotics, my muscles aren't firing,'' he
said. ''On the breaststroke leg, I felt awful. My legs were
hurting. All I tried to do was stay with Erik and Tom going into
the last 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens had a half-second lead at 300 meters after his
specialty, the breaststroke. But Wilkens faded on the freestyle as
Dolan held off a hard-charging Vendt, of North Easton, Mass., who
earned the other Olympic berth in 4:13.89.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always do it the hard way,'' Dolan said. ''It's been a long
time coming. That's the most emotion I've had in swimming in a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Moses, of Burke, Va., tossed back coffee and then gulped an
anti-acid to soothe his churning stomach before setting the
American record of 1:00.44 in the 100 breaststroke, breaking Jeremy
Linn's mark of 1:00.77 set at the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to keep calm, but the cup of coffee probably didn't
help,'' he said. ''I look at this as a stepping stone on the way to
the top.''
</P>
<P>
   His family held up signs saying ''11th Commandment, Moses Shall
Go Fast'' and ''12th Commandment, Moses Shall Go For The Gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Calhoun of Auburn, Ala., claimed the other Olympic berth at
1:01.09.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought I'd break through to this level,'' said
Calhoun, who won an Indiana high school swimming title in the same
pool a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 fly final didn't produce any records as Thompson and
Torres headed toward the finish nearly in sync before Thompson
touched the wall first in 57.78 seconds. Torres swam 57.86.
</P>
<P>
   They both earned spots on the Olympic team, which will make
33-year-old Torres the first American to swim in four Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I got out of the pool, I pinched myself to make sure it
wasn't a dream,'' said Torres, who returned to the sport in July
1999 after a seven-year retirement. ''It's a pretty awesome
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Swimming next to each other, Thompson and Torres were virtually
stroke-for-stroke over the final 25 meters after Torres led the
first 50.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took it out well and when I got to 75 meters I started
peaking to see where she was,'' she said. ''I rushed my stroke and
tightened up a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has won five golds during her career, but all have come
in relays. Four years ago, she stunningly failed to qualify at the
trials for any individual Olympic events.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't tell you how thrilled I am, but at the same time
relieved,'' Thompson said. ''There's a lot of anxiety and you don't
just walk in here as smooth as can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Munz, of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, edged top qualifier Brooke Bennett
in the 400 free. Munz finished in 4:08.71, while Bennett also heads
to Sydney after going 4:08.76.

<HEADLINE> Problems Persist With Flight Delays  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It may not be apparent to thousands of annoyed
travelers waiting for delayed or canceled flights, but things are
getting better this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Flight delays in July were down significantly from June, the
Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But, ''if you're a passenger who is delayed, these numbers don't
mean anything to you,'' admitted deputy associate administrator
Peter Challan.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're a passenger and you're stuck, as I was yesterday,
it's very frustrating,'' added his boss, FAA Administrator Jane
Garvey, who was delayed nearly an hour Wednesday as she tried to
fly from Dallas to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The flight delay improvement followed a June in which the number
of flights arriving late was thousands higher than in June of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   And the performance gain is clouded by ongoing problems at
United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, where the
combination of a dispute with pilots and bad weather has resulted
in scores of flights delayed or canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The public has ''suffered through a difficult summer and we know
it. We wish there were a silver bullet; there is not,'' said
Garvey.
</P>
<P>
   Flight delays nationwide totaled 44,401 in July, down more than
11 percent from June and a 1.7 percent decrease from July of last
year, said Challan said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited cooperation between the FAA and the airlines for the
improvement, noting that they are working together to share weather
data, reroute planes and make earlier decisions on cancellations to
improve planning downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Challan was reluctant to discuss the effect of United's problems
on overall delays, saying only that ''United, clearly, at this
time, has additional issues that they're dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   With the current strong economy and the air transport system
nearing capacity, many delays or cancellations by such a large
airline could put a strain on the other carriers as passengers seek
alternate flights during the busy August travel season.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA report covers overall delays but does not break them
down by airline. The Transportation Department collects data
separately on airlines' on-time performance, but its reports for
June and July have not been released yet.
</P>
<P>
   Challan noted that the overall improvement in delays took place
despite increased air traffic and much worse weather this July than
in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines reported 14,873,580 flights in July, up from 14,726,317
in the same month a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   There were 153 occasions in July of thunderstorms affecting
major airports, up from 99 instances in July 1999, he said. The
result was 33,907 weather-relayed delays in July, up from 33,664 in
the same month a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   With growing air traffic, delays caused by volume were also up,
from 2,606 to 4,781.
</P>
<P>
   But there were fewer delays caused by FAA equipment
malfunctions, runway problems and other causes such as bomb
threats, aircraft emergencies and VIP movements.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association, the airline trade group, has been
vocal in blaming the FAA for this summer's many delays, but airline
representatives sought to mute that on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rhetorical finger-pointing between the ATA, the FAA, Congress
... is not going to solve the problem,'' said Tim Rainey of
Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's difficult to move the traffic when you have a line of
storms,'' he said. With all the traffic in the air, it's not
possible to reroute everything around the weather, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rainey and Jay Salter of Continental Airlines praised the FAA
for working with them to reduce delays.

<HEADLINE> Canine Managers Allege Retaliation  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eight months into office, Customs Commissioner
Raymond Kelly invited employees to suggest improvements. Five
senior managers who did -- urging changes in the drug-sniffing dog
program -- claim they were transferred from their longtime posts as
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Now three sets of investigators are probing whether the
transfers were retaliation for a letter they wrote to Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The Customs Service denies any retaliation, saying the transfers
last September were part of an ongoing effort to fix serious
problems within the canine program, particularly at the Front
Royal, Va., center where new dogs and handlers learn to ferret out
marijuana, cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   All sides agree the center was troubled.
</P>
<P>
   Customs reviews last year found it failed to turn out enough
trained dogs to meet increased demand; didn't ensure proper
training; was lax in tracking narcotic training aides; lacked
enough staff to exercise the dogs; and offered poor veterinary
care, such as failure to quarantine new animals.
</P>
<P>
   Even litters of puppies specially bred by Customs risked
exposure to disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw a real decrease in the quality of the dogs that were
coming out of there,'' said Bob Gruetter, 51, who was canine
program officer before he took early retirement to avoid a transfer
from Washington headquarters to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Gruetter authored the group letter telling Kelly the canine
program was ''badly managed'' from above.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven officials took part in the letter. Among them, Gruetter
and four other senior managers were transferred to new posts
hundreds of miles away. Four have filed official protests; the
fifth also blames retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Customs spokesman Dennis Murphy said three other canine
officials -- including the training center's director -- also were
transferred last year. Because of those and other efforts, the
training center ''has turned a corner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A directed reassignment is not a punitive action. It's a
management tool,'' Murphy said. Reassignments were used sparingly
during the decade before Kelly arrived in August 1998, but the
commissioner has supported increased use of reassignments because
he ''believes in putting the right person in the right job,''
Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   The employees' complaints have sparked investigations by
Customs' internal affairs, the Treasury Department inspector
general and the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, which protects
federal whistleblowers.
</P>
<P>
   Gruetter traces the transfers to his April 22, 1999, letter
seeking more autonomy for the canine program and asking that it be
moved from the Office of Field Operations to the Office of
Investigations, which oversees air and sea drug interdiction
programs.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggested Customs misled Congress by asking for more
canine funding when many canine positions weren't filled and the
money was used for other things.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was meant to help Customs. It was not in any way meant to
slap anybody in the face,'' said Chuck Meaders, chief of the canine
program in Miami for 12 years. He was too disillusioned to complain
about his transfer to Calexico, Calif. ''What happened, it's a
total destruction of people's lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy said the transfers stemmed from reform efforts begun
months before Gruetter penned his suggestion, when the commissioner
received an anonymous letter about the training center in November
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were transferred said they received hints their letter
had landed them in the doghouse with their bosses in Field
Operations.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a headquarters official claiming to speak for assistant
commissioner of field operations Charles Winwood -- since promoted
to deputy commissioner -- cited the letter at a briefing for Customs
employees in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   According to one inspector's notes of the meeting, the official
said ''the Canine Program was now in Mr. Winwood's 'sights,' and
that was not a good place to be, this was due in part to letter
written by 16 (sic) canine managers to the commissioner.''
</P>
<P>
   And when San Diego canine chief Tom Iverson followed up with a
separate letter telling Kelly that the shortage of dogs was a
''crisis situation,'' one of his local bosses got a stern e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very disappointed that your managers have decided to deal
directly with the commissioner on canine issues,'' wrote James
Engleman, then national chief of the canine program.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Gabel, transferred from Chicago branch chief to
instructor in Front Royal, Va., suggests the five were singled out
from among the letter signers for transfers because ''we've been
outspoken critics'' for years.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Berkowitz said he protested his transfer from New York to
the training center as retaliatory, but couldn't say more ''because
I'm still working.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Iverson. After 22 years with Customs, the San Diego canine
chief took worker's compensation rather than transfer from his desk
job to a physically active post at the Virginia training center.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first, I was very angry,'' Iverson said. ''In hindsight, it
was the best thing that ever happened to me. You don't need to be
working at an agency that can deceive you and be that nasty.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Grateful for Forgiveness  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BARRINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- In his most detailed, candid
public reflection on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, President Clinton
said he had made a ''terrible mistake'' and that Al Gore should not
be blamed for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't get enough credit for what we did together that is
good. And surely no fair-minded person would blame him for any
mistake that I made,'' Clinton said of the vice president in an
appearance before 4,500 ministers at a conference in suburban
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lengthy confessional on Thursday came during a nearly
90-minute question-and-answer session with an evangelical minister
Clinton has consulted since 1992. And it was made just days before
Gore, who is trying to distance himself from any voter distaste for
Clinton's actions in the sex scandal, becomes the Democratic
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's choice of a running mate this week is an implicit part of
that effort. In Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Gore has on his ticket the
Democrat who first rebuked Clinton from the Senate floor and an
observant Jew who serves as a model of rectitude in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton's speech to the
Willow Creek Association was scheduled six months ago. The
discussion with group leader, the Rev. Bill Hybels, was not
supposed to focus on the Lewinsky matter, but conservative members
insisted Hybels bring it up, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Hybels told Clinton to expect Lewinsky
questions, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will address the Democratic National Convention on
Monday in Los Angeles, and there has been speculation that he would
use the speech to formally absolve Gore for the Lewinsky scandal of
two years ago that led to Clinton's impeachment in the House and
acquittal in a Senate trial. Thursday's blunt confessional may
serve that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm now in the second year of a process of trying to totally
rebuild my life from a terrible mistake I made,'' Clinton said
without detailing the mistake or mentioning Lewinsky, the former
White House intern, by name.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to come to terms with a lot of things about the
fundamental importance of character and integrity,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush has
treaded lightly on the Lewinsky matter, he gets applause for his
stump speech promise to ''restore decency and integrity to the Oval
Office.''
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention
last week, vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney took that a step
further, saying: ''Mr. Gore will try to separate himself from his
leader's shadow. But somehow, we will never see one without
thinking of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the political agenda of Clinton's confessional,
Cliff May, communications director for the Republican National
Committee, said he thought Clinton was confusing the issues on
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton's personal foibles and failings have nothing to do
with the fact that Al Gore went to a Buddhist temple to raise money
and that his closest associates and fund-raisers were convicted of
multiple felonies in regard to that event,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he has worked hard to rebuild trust within
his family and among his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''It took a lot, a lot of effort that I've never talked about,
and probably never will, because I don't really think it's anybody
else's concern,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he feels much more at peace, and does not dwell on
the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wake up everyday, no matter what anybody says or what goes
wrong or whatever, with this overwhelming sense of gratitude,''
Clinton said. ''Because it may be that if I hadn't been knocked
down in the way I was and forced to come to grips with what I've
done, and the consequences of it, in such an awful way, I might not
never ever had to really deal with it 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   On other topics, Clinton counted the killing of U.S. forces in
Somalia and the Oklahoma City bombing as dark moments in his
two-term tenure, and said the decision to send U.S. warplanes to
Kosovo last year was among the toughest calls he made.
</P>
<P>
   High points include passage of his hard-fought economic plan in
1993, creation of the AmeriCorps program and the pursuit of peace
in Northern Ireland, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to be remembered as the president that led
America from the industrial era into the information age, into a
new global society that reaffirmed the importance of our mutual
responsibility to one another ... and that I was a force for peace
and freedom and decency in the world, that tried to bring people
together instead of drive people apart.''

<HEADLINE> Student admits guilt in rape of classmate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A 19-year-old admitted raping a
15-year-old girl in a rest room at the Wilson Magnet High School.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Smith, acquitted of sexually abusing a classmate
three years ago, admitted to the rape charge on Thursday as part of
a plea bargain agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the plea and Smith's promise not to appeal,
state Supreme Court Justice David D. Egan will sentence him Oct. 6
to five years' probation and youthful offender status, which will
seal his criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   Smith could have been imprisoned up to 25 years. But Egan said
he offered leniency to entice a plea and spare the girl from
testifying.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe County Assistant District Attorney Paul D. Fuller and the
girl's parents had wanted Smith to go to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''As parents, we were upset and we wanted to see him pay for
what he did, to get the maximum that he could get,'' the girl's
father said. ''But realistically, what could the judge do? I trust
his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuller conceded that the case was weak.
</P>
<P>
   ''This (the girl) was a child who had no experience in the
system,'' he said. ''I believe that sexual predators choose
vulnerable victims.''
</P>
<P>
   As he pleaded guilty, Smith admitted that he pinned the girl to
the rest room floor while he raped and abused her.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was a 16-year-old student when he was charged in March
1997 with sexually abusing a 14-year-old classmate. He was later
acquitted.

<HEADLINE> Fires Knock Out Major Power Lines  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN GALLAGHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA (AP) -- The devastating forest fires in southwestern
Montana's Bitterroot Valley have slowed somewhat, choked by their
own smoke and cooler temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Bitterroot National Forest officials said the fires made only
moderate advances Thursday, though there was an order for 50
additional evacuations. Nearly 1,000 people have left their homes
and authorities say more than 50 residences have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Fire manager Dave Larsen said conditions in the area are so
extreme that 6 inches to 8 inches high were seen on moss-covered
rocks this week.
</P>
<P>
   South of Helena, two fires burning near Boulder were slowed by
high humidity and rain after knocking out two major power lines
that deliver electricity to the Pacific Northwest. Both remained
out of service Thursday night and repair crews were held back by
the flames.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonneville Power Administration said there was no immediate
risk of a power shortage because of the loss of the 500-kilovolt
lines -- ''as big as they get,'' according to a BPA official.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Perry Gruber of BPA headquarters in Portland, Ore.,
said the regional energy system should be able to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   The power lines are part of a toll that mounts daily in what is
being called the nation's worst fire season in 50 years. More than
4.3 million acres have burned so far, including more than 300,000
acres in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Around the West, firefighters made progress in Nevada, though
fire officials said a 12,000-acre blaze was growing with only 80
firefighters on hand and a 7,500-acre fire had a lone person
keeping an eye on it.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke closed a portion of Interstate 84 in Oregon's Columbia
Gorge, and there were 11 new lightning-caused fires in southern
Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just facing a whole combination of tough circumstances
with the dry vegetation and the summer thunderstorms,'' said Rob
Harper at the state's Emergency Operations Center.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, firefighters took advantage of high humidity and
rain that calmed a fire burning on 5,200 acres at Mesa Verde
National Park, raising hopes that visitors may be able to visit
portions of the park as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   In northwest Wyoming, there was good news outside Jackson, where
more than 200 people were forced out of their homes by a fire early
last week. Bob Luntsford, a Forest Service spokesman, said the fire
was burning into an old burn area where it would be easier to
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the evacuees were allowed to visit their homes and
cabins but ''we're not allowing anybody to stay,'' Luntsford said.
</P>
<P>
   Montana's Department of Environmental Quality on Thursday
prohibited open burning, adding to a ban on public use of state
lands. The Bureau of Land Management also extended use restrictions
statewide on its lands.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the public is barred from western Montana forests
comprising an area a bit larger than New Hampshire. Plum Creek
Timber Co. also closed its vast Montana timberlands to public use.
</P>
<P>
   Crews from Canada, New Zealand and Australia were en route to
the Bitterroot fires, along with special firefighting crews from
California. Gov. Marc Racicot has also called up additional
National Guard troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Boulder area fires also shutdown the Montana Tunnels gold
mine, where 120 workers were sent home this week for their own
safety
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing our best, but until the weather changes, this is a
very dangerous situation,'' said Jack Kendley, fire information
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the state, a 5,000-acre fire 40 miles east of
Missoula was threatening Garnet, a ghost town which attracts about
20,000 visitors a year. And a blaze near Wisdom that prompted the
evacuation of the Big Hole National Battlefield led authorities to
recommended evacuating about 30 homes.

<HEADLINE> Quiet Visits For Taiwan Head Wanted  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Foreign presidents often get the red carpet
treatment on arrival in the United States, but the Clinton
administration wants Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian to be as
invisible as possible during his overnight stay this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has given Chen a transit visa for a layover
in Los Angeles to facilitate a visit he is making to the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher made clear Thursday
the administration would not look favorably on a proposal by
members of Congress to meet with Chen during his stay in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would expect activities to be consistent with the purpose
of transiting and for the safety, comfort and convenience of the
traveler,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Two California congressmen have requested private meetings with
Chen. One is Republican Dana Rohrabacher, a prominent congressional
China critic; the other is Democrat Howard Berman.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rohrabacher, Ricardo Bernal, said the Clinton
administration has pressured Chen not to meet with the lawmakers
and that Chen has passed word that ''it would be difficult'' for
any such meeting to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Bernal said Rohrabacher was still exploring whether a meeting
could be arranged. Efforts to obtain comment from Berman's office
were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   China objected to the U.S. decision to issue Chen a visa for the
layover and warned that it would severely damage U.S. ties with
China.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao expressed ''strong
resentment and firm opposition'' to the decision.
</P>
<P>
   China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and is
extraordinarily sensitive to any activity that would give Chen
increased international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is a hot-button issue for the State Department as well.
U.S.-Chinese relations hit a low point in 1995 when the
administration granted a visa to then-Taiwanese President Lee
Teng-hui to visit Cornell University, his alma mater, despite
giving Beijing assurances that no visa would be issued. Beijing was
outraged.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing-Taipei rivalry was played out once again Thursday at
the United Nations. Taiwan's allies called for the economically
powerful island to join the United Nations, but China insisted that
Taiwan, as a mere province, is not eligible to be a U.N. member.
The Taiwanese bid is doomed to fail, much as it has for the past
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said Chen will be greeted as a courtesy by the chairman
of the nominally private organization that oversees unofficial
relations with Taiwan. The United States has no official relations
with Taiwan; it traded them in 1979 for relations with China, but
U.S. military ties with the island have continued without
interruption.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's two-week trip, beginning Sunday, includes Dominica,
Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, and the African countries of Gambia,
Burkina Faso and Chad. They are among the 29 countries with which
Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations.

<HEADLINE> Commerce Supprts Census Sampling  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposal giving the Census Bureau the final
say over whether to release politically sensitive sampled census
data is ''perfectly legal'' despite criticism from several
Republicans, the Commerce Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary Norman Mineta supports giving the job to the
''experts and professionals (at the Census Bureau) who make that
determination,'' Mineta spokesman Morrie Goodman said Thursday.
''Our attorneys feel very confident that everything about the
delegation of authority is perfectly legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman's comments came in response to letters from House GOP
members led by Rep. Dan Miller of Florida, as well as Michigan Gov.
John Engler opposing the Commerce proposal to delegate the
decision-making to the statistical agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The point, however, is that decision to vest this authority
lies with the Congress; and Congress has given final
decision-making authority exclusively to the secretary, not the
director of the Census Bureau,'' Miller, chairman of the House
Government Reform Committee's census panel, said in a letter signed
by five other Republican congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say most of the responses to the proposal though are
favorable, including two from Barbara Everitt Bryant, a Republican
and head of the agency during the Bush administration, and one from
Los Angeles City Attorney James Hahn supporting the legality of the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Republicans oppose sampling, while Democrats and
Census director Kenneth Prewitt favor it. Prewitt believes the
proposal removes a layer of partisan influence from the
decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling is a statistical method which supporters believe will
help account for parts of the population missed in prior counts,
including minorities, the poor and inner-city residents that
traditionally vote Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Some GOP leaders fear using sampled numbers could result in
reshaped congressional districts with more Democratic voters when
constitutionally mandated redistricting begins next year. In his
letter, Engler also said that nonpartisan statisticians outside the
Census Bureau should be involved in the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats accused Republicans of reversing course on the
issue in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Miller questioned whether fraud or improper
procedures may have tainted the quality of data collected from 15
Census offices around the country. An internal Census Bureau review
found there were no problems in those offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''One week they are making charges of political manipulation in
the census and the next week they are opposing the scientists
making the decisions with sampling and leaving it with
politicians,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. ''I wished they'd
make up their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau is part of Commerce, which unveiled the
proposal in June. Goodman said Commerce hopes to make a final
decision by October.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt has said that if left up to him, his choice will be
based purely on what is best to do scientifically, not politically.
Ultimately, appointees of the next presidential administration
would have the final say.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last year said the reapportionment of House
seats must be based on raw, non-sampled data which are due to be
released by Dec. 31. It left open the option for states to use
statistically adjusted numbers for purposes of redrawing political
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, sampled data would be released by next April.

<HEADLINE> Protein May Determine Fat, Muscle  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers probing the inner workings of the
cell have found a protein that acts as a ''fat switch,'' causing
some developing cells to become either muscle or fat.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for the ''fat switch'' to be the answer to a
bulging waistline and a groaning bathroom scale. University of
Michigan Medical School researchers say the protein could not be
used as a diet pill.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you could see my midriff, you would know that breaks my
heart,'' said Ormond A. MacDougald, one of the scientists.
</P>
<P>
   In a study appearing Friday in the journal Science, co-authors
MacDougald and Sarah E. Ross reported that a protein called Wnt 10b
acts as a molecular switch to determine which developing cells
become fat and which become muscle.
</P>
<P>
   MacDougald said that both fat and muscle cells evolve from what
are called precursor cells. The ultimate destiny in the body of
some of these precursor cells is determined by a family of 18
proteins called Wnts.
</P>
<P>
   In laboratory studies, MacDougald and Ross found that Wnt 10b
appears to regulate production of muscle cells. When Wnt 10b links
with certain precursor cells, they develop into muscle. But when
the Wnt protein is missing, the same cells will turn into fat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used muscle precursor cells and showed that if you inhibit
the Wnt signal then they turn into fat cells,'' said MacDougald.
''Wnt has to be suppressed in those cells for adipocytes (cells
that turn into fat) to form.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, said MacDougald, Wnt 10b appears to act as ''a
molecular switch to turn on either fat or muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   The action of Wnt 10b was discovered in test tube experiments,
but the role of the protein was proven when precursor cells with or
without Wnt 10b were implanted in lab mice.
</P>
<P>
   Precursor cells with the Wnt protein continued to evolve toward
mature muscle cells, while those lacking Wnt ''are redirected from
muscle cells toward fat cells,'' said MacDougald.
</P>
<P>
   MacDougald said the action of the Wnt protein is very local,
affecting only a few cells in its vicinity. It does not work like a
hormone, such as insulin, that travels through the blood stream and
affects billions of cells.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, Wnt 10b is unlikely to be developed into
an anti-fat pill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our findings will be important in learning how obesity
develops, but the Wnt protein will not be a target for an
anti-obesity drug,'' said MacDougald.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he predicted that the best target for a magic slimness
pill would be one that controls appetite -- not one that controls
how the body makes fat or muscle.
</P>
<P>
   That means that Americans who want to lose weight still have to
do it the old-fashioned way: eat less food and get more exercise.

<HEADLINE> Heart Patient Awake During Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME HERNANDEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A 61-year-old man stayed awake for the entire
4-hour, 10-minute open heart surgery operation performed on him by
a team of three doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Anderson of the Miami Veterans' Affairs Medical Center
performed a single coronary artery bypass graft Thursday using only
an epidural, an anesthetic shot injected into the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   The operation began at 8:10 a.m. and was over at 12:20 p.m. The
patient, whose name was not made public, was reported to be in
stable condition at the hospital Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The two doctors who assisted in the operation, Juan Restrepo and
Gerard DeSouza, said they believed the operation was just the
second of its kind to be performed in the United States. They said
they had heard reports another one was previously performed in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very tricky operation,'' Restrepo said after the
procedure. ''As well as upsides, there are risks in doing it this
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The anesthetic procedure meant doctors did not have to insert a
tube down the patient's windpipe. Using an epidural instead of a
general anesthetic also reduces a patient's recovery time, in part
because there is much less stress response on a respirator.
</P>
<P>
   The downside, said DeSouza, is that a higher level of anesthesia
is injected into the spinal cord than is used with general
anesthesia. That means the anesthetic has to be closely monitored
because it can stop a patient from breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ''This can only be done for a single bypass surgery, maybe a
double,'' said DeSouza. ''When the heart needs to be lifted or the
posterior part of the heart needs to be worked on, it won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   DeSouza and Restrepo said the patient asked not to be fully
sedated for the operation because he didn't want a tube stuck down
his throat. The doctors said they told him they couldn't promise
that general anesthesia wouldn't be used, if needed.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Releases EgyptAir Crash Report  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public release of reports compiling the facts
in the EgyptAir Flight 990 crash is a routine step, but one likely
to fan the international dispute over what caused the tragedy last
fall off the New England coast.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators have suggested that a co-pilot of the
jetliner may have deliberately plunged the plane into the sea,
killing all 217 people aboard on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   That idea has been vehemently rejected by Egyptian officials,
who contend that mechanical failure is the probable cause, or
possibly even a bomb or missile.
</P>
<P>
   The new reports from the National Transportation Safety Board,
being released Friday, compile the findings of investigators in
such areas as human performance, aircraft structure, power plants,
maintenance, air traffic control and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   But they do not single out a particular cause of the crash and
do not include any analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The probable result will be each side finding evidence to
support its contention as the investigation continues into the
reason the Boeing 767 plunged into the sea off the coast of the
Massachusetts island of Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said that the cockpit voice recorder
contained words that may have been a prayer just before the plane
went into its plunge. That led to speculation that co-pilot Gameel
El-Batouty may have deliberately crashed the plane.
</P>
<P>
   El-Batouty had been investigated by a New York hotel's security
staff for a number of incidents that allegedly included exposing
himself, USA Today reported in its Friday editions, quoting sources
it did not name.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations were contained in FBI investigative reports into
the backgrounds of the plane's crew members, and some of the
reports were expected to be released Friday, the sources told the
newspaper. However, investigators could not determine whether
El-Batouty's behavior at the hotel had any connection with the
crash, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, El-Batouty's family angrily denounced the published
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are running out of things to say, so they are ruining the
guy's reputation,'' Walid El-Batouty, the co-pilot's nephew, told
The Associated Press. ''They are trying to raise anything to divert
people from the real reason (for the crash).''
</P>
<P>
   An air traffic control recording released earlier showed no
radio transmissions from Flight 990 to controllers or other
aircraft in the final minutes before the plane crashed. The last
word was a routine ''good morning'' signoff.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB Chairman Jim Hall has testified before Congress that the
movements of the plane were ''consistent with a deliberate action
on the part of one of the crew members.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, information from the flight data recorder released early
in the investigation showed the plane's autopilot was switched off
before it was put into a steep dive. Both engines on the Boeing 767
were also turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting that theory, families of the crew members have filed
suit against the plane's manufacturer, Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials have focused on possible problems with the
plane's elevators, a pair of small wing-like surfaces at the tail
of the jet that control the up-or-down angle of the nose.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data show the plane's elevators were uneven during
the rapid descent, indicating a major problem. The elevators are
designed to operate in unison. Investigators are trying to
determine if the split was caused by the plane's breakup, a jamming
problem in one of the elevators, crew panic or even a struggle for
control by two people in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   The last contact with the flight came at 1:47 a.m. EST. The
pilot's last words after being asked to switch to another radio
frequency: ''One-two-five-nine-two, good day,'' followed by an
unintelligible utterance, then, ''Nine-nine-zero heavy, good
morning.'' The heavy referred to his big aircraft, a Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
   The first indication that something was wrong came seven minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   The New York air traffic controller said, ''EgyptAir 990, radar
contact lost, recycle transponder squawk one-seven-one-two.'' It
was a declaration that the plane no longer appeared on radar
screens and a request for it to send out a signal. But that and
several other efforts failed to get a response. The FAA estimates
that the plane hit the water at about 1:51 a.m., four minutes after
its last transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation also prompted a dispute over who is
responsible for paying for the costly investigation, which has
included recovering most of the crash plane from the seafloor.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt gave the United States $5 million in June to help pay for
the search and rescue efforts. That country's share of the cost was
expected to be $10.6 million and officials promised to pay the
balance expeditiously.

<HEADLINE> Downey Jr. Gets TV Role  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Robert Downey Jr., released from prison
last week, didn't have to wait long to find work.
</P>
<P>
   He will be joining the Fox series ''Ally McBeal'' in a recurring
role, playing a mysterious stranger who seems able to connect with
the complicated Ally, played by Calista Flockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're thrilled. We've admired his work for years and know
he'll make an enormous contribution to 'Ally McBeal,''' series
creator David E. Kelley said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''David's a genius, Calista's awesome, and once again I have a
choice of shirt colors,'' Downey said, apparently joking about his
recent prison garb. He will make his debut in the series' season
premiere on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Downey, 34, was jailed in June 1999 after he admitted during a
probation hearing that he missed scheduled drug tests. He was
sentenced to three years in prison for violating his probation but
gained early release because of errors made in calculating his
sentence and the time he had served.
</P>
<P>
   After his release, the actor moved into Walden House, a facility
he had previously lived in while trying to end his drug problem.
His attorney said it was to help him make the transition from
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The actor's legal troubles date to June 1996 when he was stopped
for speeding on the Pacific Coast Highway and authorities found
cocaine, heroin and a pistol in his vehicle.

   A pair of reports out today showed no change in wholesale prices
last month, with an increase of 0.7 percent in retail sales in
July.
</P>
<P>
   The reports have left bond prices little changed to slightly
lower.

<P>
   Also, Dell Computer posted better-than-expected profits,

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened mixed Friday, with blue chip
stocks rising on encouraging economic data and the technology
sector falling on continued fears of a second half earnings slow
down.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 13.92 at 10,922.68.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indexes were lower. The Nasdaq composite index was down
40.15 at 3,719.84 and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 1.74 at
1,458.51. The Russell 2000 index of small companies was down 1.34
at 500.31.
</P>
<P>
   Blue chip investors were encouraged by an inflation report that
showed that wholesale prices remained virtually the same in July
after a huge jump in June caused by soaring energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said Friday its Producer Price Index, which
measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was
flat in July, a significant easing of price pressures following a
hefty 0.6 percent surge in June.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout was the result of a big swing in gasoline and
other energy costs, which declined by 0.7 percent in July after
having jumped 5.1 percent the month before.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks fell, meanwhile, after widely held bellwether Dell
Computer beat Wall Street's targets but apparently disappointed the
high expectations of investors.
</P>
<P>
   The tech sector extended losses from Thursday that were also
based on fears that earnings will decline in the second half of

<HEADLINE> Cape Town Car Bomb Explodes  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- A car bomb exploded in a parking
lot outside a fashionable shopping center in Cape Town on Friday,
slightly injuring two people, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The car was gutted and its roof was ripped off by the explosion
shortly after noon about 60 feet from a popular restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard a loud bang and the windscreen came flying though the
air,'' said Lucille Adams, who was in the parking lot. ''I ducked.
I was worried about my three kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The car's windscreen smashed into the ground near Adams but she
wasn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Selebi, the national police commissioner, promised to
track down those responsible. ''We don't know what kind of human
beings place a bomb next to a restaurant,'' he said. ''To us it
must be mad people.''
</P>
<P>
   Selebi said a 10-year-old boy in the restaurant and a man who
was sitting in his car were injured. Earlier, police said four
people were slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
   A series of bombings in Cape Town have killed two people and
injured at least 100 since June 1998. Police have accused a Muslim
vigilante group called People Against Gangsterism and Drugs for
some of the explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Selebi said police were investigating whether there was any link
between Friday's blast and the attempted murder conviction earlier
in the day of a member of the vigilante group.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of People Against Gangsterism members have been arrested
on other charges but none has been accused in the bombings. The
organization denies responsibility and claims that corrupt police
are involved.

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The Marquess of Blandford -- one-time bad boy of
British blue bloods -- was acquitted Friday of stealing two pairs of
sunglasses and a stick of deodorant from a London department store.
</P>
<P>
   The jury took an hour to return its verdict backing Blandford,
who said he had forgotten to pay for the items, worth $355, while
shopping in November 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old son of the Duke of Marlborough, who appeared in
court under his full name Charles James Spencer-Churchill, said he
had been suffering from ''absent-mindedness antagonized by distress
and general fear'' along with post-traumatic stress disorder
triggered by a car accident several months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution said Blandford was tracked by store detectives
after allegedly behaving in a ''hyper'' manner in the swank Harvey
Nichols store.
</P>
<P>
   Blandford, a one-time cocaine and heroin addict, has 21 previous
convictions for offenses including theft, forgery, possession of
drugs and assaulting a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, his father went to court to have him disinherited so he
would not get the $150 million, 11,500-acre Blenheim Palace estate,
birthplace of relative Winston Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, the Duke of Marlborough said, ''I think there have
been black sheep in every family and there's nothing new about
that. We have had some good 'uns and some bad 'uns.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's had every chance, hasn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   Blandford -- whose family motto is ''faithful though
unfortunate'' -- once blamed his privileged upbringing for his
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do feel confused about my destiny and I have always resented
having my life mapped out for me,'' he said. ''I don't really know
what to do with my life.''

<HEADLINE> Helicopter Crashes on Sweden Mountain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- A helicopter trying to rescue two
stranded climbers crashed into Sweden's highest mountain and burst
into flames Friday, killing all three crew members, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers found the three bodies at the crash site at an altitude
of 6,000 feet on the steep northeastern side of Kebnekaise, which
rises 6,966 feet in Sweden's arctic about 700 miles northwest of
the capital Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   The climbers, ages 50 and 80, were rescued a few hours after the
crash by a Norwegian helicopter and taken to a research station at
the base of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's difficult to say at this stage what caused the
accident,'' police inspector Lennart Landstroem said of the crash.
''Witnesses saw sparks, indicating that the helicopter's rotor
blades hit the mountainside and crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter, equipped for mountain rescues, crashed as it
approached the two climbers, who had been stuck on the snowy
mountain since Tuesday because of bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not release the names of the crew members, but said
two of the men were in their 50s and one was in his 40s.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Doctors Strike  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Medical service in South Korea was
disrupted for the second time in two months Friday as thousands of
doctors went on strike to protest a new prescription system that
would deprive them of some income.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 40 percent of the 19,000 clinics in the country
open, the strike appeared less widespread than a six-day walkout in
June. That time only 10 percent of clinics remained open and
several patient deaths were blamed on the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Many hospitals turned patients away, but most emergency rooms
remained open with a small number of volunteer doctors.
</P>
<P>
   At the state-run Seoul National University Hospital, Yon Oh-nam,
a 57-year-old housewife suffering from kidney failure, angrily
complained that she could not see her doctor or get medication.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are they really doctors if they're fiddling with people's
lives?'' Yon shouted in the hospital lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are protesting a new Western-style system, which makes
them responsible for writing prescriptions and pharmacists
responsible for selling drugs, with a doctor's prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and pharmacists have traditionally served similar roles
in South Korea, with both allowed to prescribe and sell drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say they need to sell drugs in order to make ends meet,
because medical fees cover only 80 percent of their minimum costs.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to avert the strike, the government offered a
compensatory package late Thursday that would increase fees for
prescriptions and examinations.
</P>
<P>
   The Korea Medical Association, which represents 70,000 doctors
in South Korea, said the deal fell short.

<HEADLINE> Three Acquitted of Killing Diplomat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- A jury acquitted two men and a woman
Friday in the 1998 slaying of a Saudi diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Riza Yilmaz, 29, his wife Melissa Moussa, 23, and their friend
Mutlu Yildiz, 26, were released after the verdict was announced.
They had been charge in the death of Abdullah Al Ghamdi, first
secretary to the Saudi Embassy in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
   Moussa began sobbing as the verdicts were read, and she and
Yilmaz hugged tightly. Yilmaz and Yildiz dabbed their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Al Ghamdi, 54, was found with his throat slashed and more than
30 stab wounds in his apartment in Australia's national capital on
Oct. 13, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, prosecutors alleged Yilmaz had threatened Al Ghamdi
because of a relationship the diplomat had with Moussa.
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating for more than five hours, the jury acquitted
Yilmaz of murder and manslaughter. Moussa and Yildiz were acquitted
of manslaughter. All three had denied the charges.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 140; Nasdaq Adds 16  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Friday as blue chips surged on
encouraging economic data. Concerns for a second half earnings slow
down kept technology stocks from broader gains.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 139.55 at 11,048.31, the first time since
April that the blue chip index has crossed the 11,000 threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 12.62 at 1,472.87, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 15.96 at 3,775.95, having
recovered from a loss of 60 points earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is kind of directionless. People seem to be
grasping, looking for some fundamental issue to hang their hat
on,'' said John Caldwell, director of portfolio strategies for
McDonald Investments in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell said a pattern has emerged recently in which investors
react to whatever news is released on a given day, causing markets
to fluctuate from session to session.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, for example, blue chip investors were encouraged by
an inflation report that showed that wholesale prices remained
virtually the same in July after a huge jump in June caused by
soaring energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index, which
measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was
flat in July, a significant easing of price pressures following a
hefty 0.6 percent surge in June.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout was the result of a big swing in gasoline and
other energy costs, which declined by 0.7 percent in July after
having jumped 5.1 percent the month before.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are optimistic that Federal Reserve Board policy
makers will leave interest rates alone at their next meeting Aug.
22 if it appears that inflation has been kept at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sectors helping push the Dow index higher were
tobacco, drugs and banking. Philip Morris rose $2.75 to $31.375
after an analyst at Goldman Sachs said the tobacco and food
conglomerate's stock could rise 50 percent to 60 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks fell in early trading but recovered. Tech investors
have been jittery lately based on fears that earnings will decline
in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Widely held bellwether Dell Computer was punished Friday after
the computer retailer announced earnings that beat Wall Street's
targets but apparently disappointed the high expectations of
investors. The company failed to live up to projected revenue
growth figures.
</P>
<P>
   Dell shares fell $3.875 to $37.875.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 582.45 million
shares, down from Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 4.38 at 506.03.

<HEADLINE> Catholics Accept Protestant March  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) -- In a sign that talking
works, leaders in this mostly Roman Catholic city say they'll
accept a march Saturday by Londonderry's main British Protestant
group.
</P>
<P>
   The Apprentice Boys of Derry parade atop the city's 17th-century
battlements has frequently provoked militant Catholic opposition.
But this week both sides talked through their differences -- guided
by the hope of inspiring compromise in other Northern Ireland
flashpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to days when we don't even need to have talks,
when everybody can be happy that there's a parade and that
everybody can enjoy it,'' said Luke Hasson, a Catholic businessman
whose department store overlooks the Diamond, Londonderry's central
square.
</P>
<P>
   But in an indication that not everyone wants compromise, police
said Friday they thwarted apparent plans by Irish Republican Army
dissidents to detonate a bomb in Londonderry before the march.
</P>
<P>
   A van packed with homemade explosives came across a police
checkpoint in the city Thursday night, then sped into the Republic
of Ireland, where it was abandoned. It contained some 500 pounds of
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamond has been a focal point for confrontations between
Protestants and Catholics since the 19th century, particularly when
the Apprentice Boys march.
</P>
<P>
   The group takes its name from the 13 youthful tradesmen who
bolted the city gates in the face of forces loyal to James II, a
Catholic king who was trying to retain power after losing his
British throne to a Protestant. Londonderry's starving Protestant
garrison survived a 105-day siege that concluded Aug. 12, 1689,
when English reinforcements arrived by sea.
</P>
<P>
   Since the founding of the Apprentice Boys in 1814, Catholics
from the impoverished Bogside quarter outside the city walls have
seen the parades as celebrating Protestant dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Bogsiders' resentment boiled over into street warfare in 1969, a
pivotal moment that led Britain to deploy soldiers as peacekeepers
-- and in turn encouraged Catholic hard-liners to found a
''Provisional'' IRA.
</P>
<P>
   That IRA faction halted its bombing and shooting in 1997, long
after destroying most Protestant-owned businesses inside
Londonderry's walls.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Londonderry's rebuilt commercial heart is in the hands of
Catholic entrepreneurs and the city's one-time IRA commander,
Martin McGuinness, is education minister in Northern Ireland's
power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the city's Protestants have resettled across the
Foyle River, far from downtown. Many return only once a year to
march in their Apprentice Boys regalia.
</P>
<P>
   Even that was threatened in 1995, when IRA supporters from the
Bogside began trying to block the parade in a bid to force
Protestants into direct negotiations. Similar tactics were used
against the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's larger Protestant
fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen, who march in July, have largely refused to
negotiate with Catholic protesters, but the Apprentice Boys saw the
need to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have nothing to be ashamed of. I'm helping to bring peace to
our city,'' said Apprentice Boys Governor Alistair Simpson, who has
braved criticism since he agreed to discussions with Bogside
leaders in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite talks, Catholic rioting followed Apprentice Boys
demonstrations in 1998 and 1999, causing more than $15 million
damage -- most of it to Catholic-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike others in confrontation zones, Catholic moderates in
Londonderry proved willing to get involved in mediation, and to
apply subtle pressure on militants to back off.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lesson is that if you keep working, if you keep trying to
see where the person across the table is coming from, bit by bit
you realize that we've far more in common than we have in fighting
each other,'' said Brendan Duddy, who oversaw negotiations in
Londonderry's Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, in a veiled message to Orange leaders, said resolving
march confrontations requires talking with opponents -- and time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody who thinks they can go into one or two meetings and
get what they want is going to be sadly disillusioned,'' said
Simpson.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Grateful for Forgiveness  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BARRINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- In his most detailed, candid
public reflection on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, President Clinton
said he had made a ''terrible mistake'' and that Al Gore should not
be blamed for it.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he appreciated Clinton's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's said it before,'' Gore told Fox News on Friday. ''I think
that he also went on to say that this election, as all elections,
is about the future and not the past and I very much agree with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore communications director acknowledged Clinton's
headline-making confessional was a distraction. ''We need to stay
focused on the positive Gore message. We can't be distracted by
things that are out of our control,'' Mark Fabiani said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke Thursday before 4,500 ministers in suburban
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't get enough credit for what we did together that is
good,'' Clinton said of Gore. ''And surely no fair-minded person
would blame him for any mistake that I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks came during a nearly 90-minute
question-and-answer session with an evangelical minister Clinton
has consulted since 1992. It was made just days before Gore, who is
trying to distance himself from any voter distaste for Clinton's
actions in the sex scandal, becomes the Democratic presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's choice of a running mate this week is an implicit part of
that effort. In Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, Gore picked the
Democrat who first rebuked Clinton from the Senate floor and an
observant Jew who serves as a model of rectitude in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton's speech to the
Willow Creek Association was scheduled six months ago. The
discussion with group leader, the Rev. Bill Hybels, was not
supposed to focus on the Lewinsky matter, but conservative members
insisted Hybels bring it up, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Hybels told Clinton to expect Lewinsky
questions, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will address the Democratic National Convention on
Monday in Los Angeles. There has been speculation he would use the
speech to formally absolve Gore for the Lewinsky scandal of two
years ago that led to Clinton's impeachment in the House and
acquittal in a Senate trial. Thursday's blunt confessional may
serve that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm now in the second year of a process of trying to totally
rebuild my life from a terrible mistake I made,'' Clinton said
without detailing the mistake or mentioning Lewinsky, the former
White House intern, by name.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to come to terms with a lot of things about the
fundamental importance of character and integrity,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush has
treaded lightly on the Lewinsky matter, he gets applause for his
stump speech promise to ''restore decency and integrity to the Oval
Office.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Cliff May of the Republican National Committee said
that ''Clinton's personal foibles and failings have nothing to do
with the fact that Al Gore went to a Buddhist temple to raise money
and that his closest associates and fund-raisers were convicted of
multiple felonies in regard to that event.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, the president said he has worked hard to rebuild
trust within his family and among his staff.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he feels much more at peace, and does not dwell on
the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wake up everyday, no matter what anybody says or what goes
wrong or whatever, with this overwhelming sense of gratitude,''
Clinton said. ''Because it may be that if I hadn't been knocked
down in the way I was and forced to come to grips with what I've
done, and the consequences of it, in such an awful way, I might not
never ever had to really deal with it 100 percent.''

<HEADLINE> Police: Suspect in nursing home murder tried to kill himself  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A man on the run for several days after he
allegedly shot his supervisor at a nursing home was finally found
Friday when he attempted to kill himself on a Queens street corner,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Robinson, 40, shot himself in the head with a .22-caliber
handgun as he stood at the intersection of Baisley Boulevard and
Lakeview Avenue in the Jamaica neighborhood at around 7:30 a.m.,
just blocks from the 113th Precinct. He was rushed to Jamaica
Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   He was placed under police custody at the hospital. He was
charged with second-degree murder and criminal possession of a
weapon, but his arraignment was not immediately scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Police had been searching for Robinson since Tuesday, when he
allegedly shot cleaning supervisor Elizabeth Parker, 58, in the
head in her basement office at the New York State Veterans Nursing
Home in the St. Albans section of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Robinson returned a call from the Daily News, which
left messages on his answering machine and through a pager number
obtained from his father. He told a reporter he was ''so sorry for
the pain I caused my family and the victim's family. I wish I could
take it back.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My life is over,'' he added. ''I don't want to go back to
prison. I deserve punishment but I can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson claimed that Parker had made his life tough at work.
''This woman just loved to make people's lives miserable,'' he
said. ''For 2&AMP;frac12; years, it just built up. I just snapped. ... I could
not take her anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   However, police said that Parker, who has four children, one of
whom is a transit police officer, appeared to be on good terms with
other employees.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who was paroled in January 1999 after serving four
years in prison on drug charges, has been arrested at least six
times. He landed the job in the home for aging veterans through a
work release program.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, Robinson rode his bicycle to the home of his
father, Willie Robinson, the pastor of the St. John's Christian
Methodist Episcopal Church in St. Alban's.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he just snapped,'' the father said. ''He said she
pushed him over the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The father said he could not persuade his son to turn himself
into police, and after the conversation his son left.

<HEADLINE> Forgotten Hungarian Prisoner Leaves  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A Hungarian prisoner deposited in a Russian
psychiatric hospital after World War II and forgotten for five
decades headed home Friday, glancing anxiously past his
gray-haired, 75-year-old reflection at a world he hasn't seen since
the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Andras Tamas, who was taken by bus to Moscow, mumbled to himself
and looked confused after he arrived at the Russian capital's
bustling international airport. Doctors carefully led him through
customs and onto a flight to Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, Tamas had not set foot outside the small hospital
in the provincial town of Kotelnich, in central Russia, since
Soviet secret police brought him there as a young man in 1947. For
years, nobody knew who he was, and hospital staff mistook his
Hungarian mutterings for gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   An encounter with a Hungarian-speaking Russian unlocked the
mystery. This week, Hungarian authorities said they had uncovered
enough about Tamas' background to issue him a Hungarian passport
and bring him home.
</P>
<P>
   A privately chartered double-decker bus rolled out of the
hospital yard Friday, embarking on a nearly daylong journey to
carry Tamas and accompanying medical staff to Moscow. Doctors
thought a bus trip to Moscow would be less stressful than a flight.
</P>
<P>
   Seated by a window on the bus, Tamas stared nervously ahead,
occasionally glancing around anxiously. He grew teary-eyed at
times, and doctors said he felt ill.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a light blue button-down shirt, a sweater vest and a
small hat, Tamas was guided into a wheelchair and pushed through
the maze of passengers at Moscow's airport. He looked dazed.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday night, Tamas was to be back in his homeland -- but just
who would welcome him was unclear. No record of his birth or any
living relative has been found, and his memories date to the
ravaged Hungary of the war years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know where I will live, because everything has been
bombed,'' he said recently in his hospital room.
</P>
<P>
   Tamas is believed to have been among the 150,000 Hungarian
troops who fought under Nazi command at the Don River in 1944. Red
Army soldiers killed about 90,000 Hungarians and thousands more
died in freezing temperatures trying to walk to Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Tamas was among prisoners of war sent by train from western
Russia to a prison camp in Siberia, records indicate. He seemed to
be suffering from psychological problems, so guards took him off
the train when it passed near Kotelnich and left him at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Other than his name, Soviet-era records said nothing about his
background. Unable to speak Russian, Tamas could not communicate
with hospital staff. Later, somebody thought Tamas was Romanian,
and that was written in his records.
</P>
<P>
   Tamas was forgotten. Time stopped for him in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has lived here for a long time, but all his impressions,
all his knowledge have remained at the level of 1940s,'' the chief
doctor of the Kotelnich hospital, Yuri Petukhov, said last week.
Doctors at Kotelnich had tried to figure out Tamas' past, but all
documents seemed to have been lost in the tumultuous years after
the war, Petukhov said.
</P>
<P>
   Then a Russian police major of Hungarian descent, Karl
Maravchuk, came to live in the town in 1991. Invited to the
hospital by Petukhov, he recognized Tamas' speech as Hungarian.
That got the ball rolling: Hungarian doctors were sent in and
identified Tamas as a countryman.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Petukhov was accompanying Tamas to Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Physically he's feeling good taking into account his age,''
Petukhov said at the Moscow airport. ''He understands he's going to
Hungary, he understands what's going on around him and that it's
probably going to be better because he likes to interact with
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The extent of Tamas' mental problems is unclear, but after years
of isolation, he was spending most of his time sitting on a bench
in the hospital yard, occasionally carving wood in the hospital
workshop. He had a leg amputated above the knee about three years
ago because of circulatory problems.
</P>
<P>
   One Hungarian official in Russia said he is ''mentally seriously
damaged.'' But a Hungarian doctor who examined Tamas last month
said he believes that in his homeland, surrounded by his mother
tongue, Tamas will recover his memory.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomat at the Hungarian Embassy in Moscow, Ferenc Puskas,
said 20 Hungarian families have already offered to adopt him.
</P>
<P>
   Petukhov said patients and staff there ''were maybe a bit sad
over parting'' from the longtime resident.

   ''But on the other hand, we are happy that a person is getting
discharged from the hospital and is leaving,'' he said. ''It means

<HEADLINE> Myers Dissolves 'SNL' Lawsuits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mike Myers is as happy as a little girl. The
actor has reached a deal with two movie studios that dissolves
three lawsuits so he can move ahead with a movie based on his
''Saturday Night Live'' character Dieter.
</P>
<P>
   Though details of the agreement were not disclosed, Myers said
in a statement Thursday he will write his comedy as a
''co-production'' for Universal Studios and DreamWorks SKG, with
Imagine Entertainment producing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad to put all of this behind me and I'm looking forward
to doing a movie that we can all be proud of,'' said Myers, who
created the character of Dieter (pronounced DEET-er), the
slick-haired German host of a techno-pop dance show called
''Sprockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers had backed away from the movie, saying the script needed
work, and Universal Pictures sued in June for $3.8 million plus
lost profits. Then, in July, Imagine Entertainment sued for more
than $30 million alleging Myers reneged on an agreement to write,
produce and star in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, the ''Austin Powers'' star countersued Universal
Pictures. Myers sought $20 million for invasion of privacy and
intentional infliction of emotional distress, claiming that a
process server for the studio chased him ''in a threatening manner
down dark, winding and unlit streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie had been slated to begin shooting this month with Will
Ferrell and David Hasselhoff and a June 2001 release.

<HEADLINE> Union members approve tentative contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Members of the state's second-largest public
employee union approved a four-year contract Friday that calls for
pay hikes of three percent in the first two years and 3.5 percent
in the next.
</P>
<P>
   The contract was approved by a vote of 33,899 to 2,876.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the pay hikes, the pact calls for a $500 bonus
for full-time employees (prorated for less than full-time); better
dental benefits; increased copay for office visits to $10 from $8;
a decrease to $5 from $8 for generic prescriptions; and an increase
to $15 from $8 for name-brand prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Ratification of the contract also means members will receive the
enhanced pension benefits approved by the state Legislature in
June. Tier III and IV members who have worked 10 or more years in
the system will no longer have to pay the three percent employee
contribution, and Tier I and II members will receive one month of
retirement service credit for each year worked, to a maximum of 24
months of service.
</P>
<P>
   PEF represents 54,000 white-collar, mostly public-sector
employees around the state.

<HEADLINE> Guiliani Writing a Book  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rudolph Guiliani is going to write a book. Never
mind that he doesn't yet know what it'll be about, or when -- or if
-- he'll ever finish it.
</P>
<P>
   But the New York mayor will need something to do after term
limits force him out of City Hall in 15 months. He says he's not
interested in being governor or taking a cabinet post in a George
W. Bush administration, and he dropped out of the Senate race
earlier this year after announcing he had prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has already discovered the chief hazard of living the
writer's life. ''Since I was U.S. attorney, I think actually it is
four or five different versions that I've started,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Constance Sayre, director of the publishing trade association
group Marketing Partners International, predicted a somewhat modest
advance. ''For a book that only has possibly regional interest, if
he gets $100,000, I'd think he'd be doing well, although what do I
know?'' Sayre said. ''Publishers are crazy.''

<HEADLINE> Cleric's Art Offer Raises Questions  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- An Italian monsignor was under investigation
Friday by prosecutors who suspect the former Vatican bureaucrat of
trying to palm off fake masterpieces with Holy See certificates of
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Michele Basso insists the works -- ranging from a piece
attributed to Michelango to 6th century B.C. Grecian gold -- are the
genuine articles, bequeathed to him by clerical colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got them from various monsignors who died old, alone, with
no relatives,'' said Basso's lawyer, Lorenzo Contrada. ''So they
left what they had to their friends, people they had spent their
lives with in the Vatican.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He got them in good faith, like a gift from a friend,'' the
lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Basso is the former administrator of the Vatican archives and
then of the Vatican pension fund, leaving that post in 1994-95,
according to Contrada.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy See's press office described his current duties at St.
Peter's as ''strictly liturgical,'' such as celebrating Masses.
</P>
<P>
   Basso still calls Vatican City his home, sharing what Rome's Il
Messaggero daily described as a two-level penthouse flanking the
dome of St. Peter's with his -- if genuine -- priceless art
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Il Messaggero broke the news of the investigation Friday, saying
Rome prosecutors started asking questions July 27 upon learning the
cleric was looking for buyers for his works.
</P>
<P>
   The most potentially valuable works include Etruscan relics, the
ancient Greek gold pieces, a depiction of St. John attributed to
Michelangelo and a work by 16th-century, Flemish-born Giambologna.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have moved to seize the works -- as well as a cache
of blank certificates of authenticity on Vatican paper with seals
of the Holy See that allegedly were to be used in their sale, Il
Messaggero said.
</P>
<P>
   Rome's art superintendent's office examined photos of the works
and expressed doubts about their authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities suspect the pieces are not genuine -- and even if
they are, attempts to sell them would run up against laws
safeguarding Italy's artistic patrimony.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Rome prosecutors' office failed to return
repeated calls for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Contrada confirmed that a Vatican judge and Italian police have
questioned his client.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican declined to go into the merits of the case, with the
press office saying only, ''The Holy See respects the Italian legal
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrada said none of the works has yet been sold. The lawyer
said his client believes the works to be genuine and has given
investigators names and dates surrounding their acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Basso only belatedly realized the worth of the gifts his friends
had left him, Contrada said. His aim now is to sell the works to
raise money for a hospital in Albania, Contrada said.
</P>
<P>
   It's far from the first time Vatican clerics have come under
scrutiny from prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the Vatican distanced itself from two priests who
allegedly provided a cloak of respectability for rogue U.S.
financier Martin Frankel, who is accused of bilking millions of
dollars from U.S. insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican bank, formally called the Institute for Religious
Works, was badly tainted by a banking scandal in the 1980s due to
the collapse of the Banco Ambrosiano.
</P>
<P>
   Clerics have been suspected of illegal trafficking in works of
art in at least two other cases since World War II -- one involving
a part-time representative of the Holy See at the United Nations
and the other a monsignor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a Polish worker in the Holy See's protocol department
fled a Rome arrest warrant for alleged participation in a stolen
car-ring into Poland.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules for Poland's Walesa  </HEADLINE>
By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Solidarity founder Lech Walesa, who fought
Polish communist rule for two decades before vanquishing it in
1989, was cleared Friday of collaborating with communist-era secret
police and will again be allowed to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa was forced to defend his reputation in the special
screening court, which dismissed suggestions in old police files
that he spied on fellow dissidents. The decision freed the
56-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner to run this fall for the
presidency he lost in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fought with them, and I finally defeated them,'' the former
shipyard electrician said after the court agreed that the files,
written by agents whose job it was to discredit dissidents, were
not credible.
</P>
<P>
   In one of history's bitter ironies, Walesa was scrutinized under
a new law that requires candidates to declare whether they ever
cooperated with the communist secret services. There is no penalty
for admitting collaboration, but anyone found by the court to have
lied is banned from public office for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   President Aleksander Kwasniewski, an ex-communist who defeated
Walesa in 1995 and is heavily favored to win again Oct. 8, was
cleared by the screening court Thursday of similar allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of a popular president and a national hero having
to defend themselves against such charges in open court appalled
many Poles. It also has rekindled debate over Poland's belated and
awkward struggle to come to terms with its communist past.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the screening law is flawed because it requires
potentially embarrassing hearings even on flimsy evidence. But the
Solidarity-led government -- and Walesa himself -- argued the law is
appropriate and must be followed.
</P>
<P>
   At least two members of parliament have been ousted for lying in
screening statements since the law took effect in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa leaned back and smiled in relief, his cheeks flush with
emotion, as the verdict was read in the crowded, wood-paneled
courtroom. But he said later he was ''not fully pleased'' because
it would not persuade his political opponents that he was never a
police informant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a little sick at heart because I had trusted in the
screening. Now I see it has no point because the whole operation
did not convince anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa staunchly denied suggestions in photocopies dredged from
police files that he had worked as an agent under the code-name
Bolek.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding Judge Pawel Rysinksi said he and his two colleagues on
the court panel agreed that there ''is no proof whatsoever to
confirm (the allegations) or to question Lech Walesa's screening
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Krzysztof Kauba asked that the trial be stopped after
newly disclosed documents Friday indicated secret police conspired
to discredit Walesa in the 1980s when Solidarity was fighting to
topple the communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   A May 1985 Interior Ministry report detailed the use of
professional forgers to fabricate documents to make it appear that
Walesa was a paid agent. It said forged papers even were sent to
Nobel committee members in 1982 in a bid to prevent Walesa from
winning the peace prize. He won it anyway in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa was agitated when he showed up Friday morning for his
third and final hearing. He called the hearings a ''laughable''
political vendetta against him by former communist enemies.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed morning session, the court heard from two former
secret police officers and two former intelligence chiefs: Piotr
Naimski, a political opponent of Walesa who held the job in 1992;
and Gromoslaw Czempinski, a Walesa backer who held the post from
1993-96.
</P>
<P>
   They refused to reveal their testimony afterward, but Naimski
repeated to reporters his belief that agent Bolek was Walesa.
</P>
<P>
   Czempinski countered that he did not believe Walesa could have
been Bolek, and said he found it deplorable that the ''symbol of
Solidarity'' had to undergo such treatment.

<HEADLINE> France Concorde Flight Ban Remains  </HEADLINE>
By PAMELA SAMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Investigators are getting closer to understanding
why an Air France Concorde erupted in flames and crashed last
month, but until they can pinpoint exactly why, the pride of French
aviation will stay on the ground, the Transportation Ministry said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry said it would not lift the ban on the supersonic
jets because ''uncertainties remain'' in determining the sequence
of events that caused Flight A4590 to plummet from the air minutes
after takeoff on July 25, killing 113 people outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the ''initial cause'' of the accident was
a metal strip that punctured a tire, sending huge chunks of rubber
into the area of the fuel tanks. Despite that theory, the ministry
said in a statement that it would be premature to resume Concorde
flights given the number of unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if the origin of the destruction of the tire seems to
have been outlined, some uncertainties remain about the chronology
of events and the links between them ... such as the source and the
importance of the fire,'' the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement gave no indication of when flights might resume. A
spokesman for Air France had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The crash -- the first fatal accident involving the elite
Concorde in its 25 years of commercial flying -- was a blow to
French aviation and led Transportation Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot
to immediately ground the fleet of five remaining jets. British
Airways has continued to operate its fleet of seven Concordes.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Auguin, a spokesman for France's National Union of Air
Pilots, said the organization supports Friday's decision. But the
national union of aviation mechanics disagreed, saying the
discovery of the metal piece absolves the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want to believe that British Airways ... would fly
planes that French authorities still deem as dangerous,'' a union
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Gayssot said he would propose to his
British counterpart, John Prescott, that French and British civil
aviation authorities work together in deciding what new security
measures to take.
</P>
<P>
   The statement comes one day after investigators offered their
first explanation of what might have been at the root of the crash:
Investigators said a 16-inch strip of metal found on the runway
probably punctured a tire, sending debris flying at high speed and
possibly damaging one or several fuel tanks on the left wing,
causing a fuel leak and fire.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said experts must still confirm that theory.
A preliminary report on the crash is due at the end of August.

<HEADLINE> 700 Jordanians Call for Holy War  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZARQA, Jordan (AP) -- Shouting the Muslim battle cry of ''Allahu
Akbar,'' or God is great, hundreds of Jordanian protesters on
Friday demanded a holy war to liberate Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday prayers, about 700 protesters marched between two
mosques in Zarqa, 17 miles northeast of the capital Amman, calling
upon Muslims to rise against the ''Jewish enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Jerusalem is the city of Muslims and their prophet Mohammed.
Liberate it and kick out the treacherous Jews,'' shouted Theeb
Anis, general secretary of the Zarqa Muslim Brotherhood Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood Movement opposes peace
with Israel and advocates its eradication. Last week the group held
a similar protest in Amman, in which protesters briefly clashed
with police when they were banned from marching.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's peaceful but noisy protest, the crowd chanted, ''We
sacrifice our blood and soul for Al Aqsa,'' referring to the mosque
on Jerusalem's Temple Mount, the third-holiest site in Islam. They
also carried banners which read, ''Palestine is Muslim from the sea
to the river.''
</P>
<P>
   A peace summit last month in the United States collapsed over
the issue of Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim
as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is the return of refugees. Israel says it will
allow only a limited number of refugees to return to the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the residents of Zarqa are Palestinians who were
displaced in the 1948 and 1967 wars with Israel. Roughly two-thirds
of Jordan's 4.8 million people are Palestinian. About 1.5 million
live in refugee camps and demand the right of return to their homes
in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and what is now Israel.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 152; Nasdaq Adds 11  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Friday as blue chips surged on
encouraging economic data. Concerns for a second-half earnings
slowdown kept technology stocks from broader gains.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 151.64 at 11,060.40, the first time since
April that the blue chip index has crossed the 11,000 threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 12.41 at 1,472.66, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 11.03 at 3,771.02, having
recovered from a loss of 60 points earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a pattern has emerged recently in which investors
react to whatever news is released on a given day, causing markets
to fluctuate from session to session.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is kind of directionless. People seem to be
grasping, looking for some fundamental issue to hang their hat
on,'' said John Caldwell, director of portfolio strategies for
McDonald Investments in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, for example, blue chip investors were encouraged by
an inflation report that showed that wholesale prices remained
virtually the same in July after a huge jump in June caused by
soaring energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index, which
measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was
flat in July, a significant easing of price pressures following a
hefty 0.6 percent surge in June.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout was the result of a big swing in gasoline and
other energy costs, which declined by 0.7 percent in July after
having jumped 5.1 percent the month before.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, consumer spending in July increased at a better-than
expected level, a sign that the economy remains healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are optimistic that Federal Reserve Board policy
makers will leave interest rates alone at their next meeting Aug.
22 if it appears that inflation has been kept at bay while the
economy continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sectors helping push the Dow index higher were
tobacco, banking, drugs and health care. Philip Morris rose $2.938
to $31.563 after an analyst at Goldman Sachs said the tobacco and
food conglomerate's stock could rise 50 percent to 60 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Verizon officials say progress made as bargaining resumes  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Verizon Communications and phone workers'
unions resumed negotiations Friday in hopes of concluding a nearly
weeklong strike, making apparent progress on the cumbersome issue
of unionizing wireless service workers.
</P>
<P>
   But working conditions and job security remained stumbling
blocks as the parties worked to craft new contracts for the 87,200
employees on strike since Sunday. The work stoppage has left the
company's 30,000 managers scrambling to process daily workloads
reaching 80,000 repair orders.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those orders are from customers who have no service. The
rest are seeking changes or improvements to their service. The
managers are resolving 25,000 repair problems daily, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 million customers are affected by the strike, which
covers the District of Columbia and Delaware, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Among the greatest obstacles to an agreement has been the
unions' desire to have greater access to Verizon's fast-growing but
largely nonunionized wireless work force. However, sources familiar
with the talks, who discussed the issue on condition of anonymity,
said both sides have tentatively agreed to an expedited election
process, rather than full secret-ballot elections.
</P>
<P>
   The election plan, which would cover only the former Bell
Atlantic region, would unionize the wireless workers once a
majority of them signed their names to a card requesting
representation.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it saw very encouraging signs of resolving the
wireless representation matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The end of this negotiation process and the end of the strike
is within reach,'' said Eric Rabe, Verizon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   For some employees, the wireless issue is the most important.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father worked here for 40 years and worked 10,000 hours of
overtime,'' said Harold C. Jones Jr., a striking Verizon
maintenance administrator, who attended a rally with several
hundred employees in Richmond, Va., Friday. ''Now to have any
future, we have to be included in the wireless division.''
</P>
<P>
   Candice Johnson of the Communications Workers of America, the
larger of the two striking unions, said the talks have made
progress, but asserted that a number of important concerns remain,
such as forced overtime and shifting work to cheaper areas.
</P>
<P>
   Employees represented by the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers also are on strike against Verizon, the nation's
largest local and wireless telephone company, which was formed by
the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, more than 1,500 union members rallied outside the
company's offices, waving signs that read ''Jobs with Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are the millstone holding this company up,'' said IBEW
Local 2222 President Eddie Fitzpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Verizon's Baltimore headquarters, about 150 union
members marched and chanted, while managers stood nearby passing
out the last regular paychecks strikers from the facility will
receive until the walkout ends.

<HEADLINE> Arafat's Diplomacy Falling Flat  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's diplomatic
offensive -- he has visited 15 countries in 18 days -- is shaping up
as a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Arab leaders have been cold to the idea of a special Arab summit
-- the ultimate brotherly embrace Arafat so badly sought after the
United States blamed him for the failure of last month's
Israel-Palestinian summit talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader has also been unable to win international
backing for a unilateral proclamation of Palestinian statehood in
the event a peace treaty is not concluded by its Sept. 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials say U.S. pressure is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Edward Walker has been
briefing Arab leaders on the U.S. positions and urging them not to
do anything to lessen chances for a resumption of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat adviser Nabil Amr said many countries empathize with
Arafat but are unwilling to defy Washington. ''No one can ignore
that many countries have strong relations with the United States
and they don't want these relations to be affected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During Arafat's tour, including stops in Egypt and Saudi Arabia,
he was told by many heads of state that he ''should wait and give a
chance for peace to move forward,'' Amr said.
</P>
<P>
   Hinting at the Palestinians' disappointment, peace negotiator
Ahmed Qureia told reporters this week that while the Arab world in
principle backed Arafat's refusal to compromise over Jerusalem,
''we, the Palestinians, want more from the Arab nations, and we
hope they will contribute more.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's top priority remains a peace agreement with Israel, his
aides say. However, he lacks leverage -- something an Arab summit
and international backing for a unilateral statehood declaration,
to be used as a warning, might have given him.
</P>
<P>
   Now Arafat faces Israel alone, and his options appear
increasingly unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   If he softens his demands on Jerusalem and agrees to less than
full sovereignty over the traditionally Arab eastern sector of the
city, he can expect to be ostracized by many Arab and Islamic
nations. East Jerusalem is home to important Islamic shrines.
</P>
<P>
   If Arafat sticks to his position, he may be held responsible for
a failure of the peace talks. At Camp David, President Clinton gave
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak credit for going beyond what
Israeli governments had offered in the past and proposing limited
Palestinian sovereignty in parts of east Jerusalem. Participants
say Clinton angrily left the room when the Palestinians, insisting
their views on Jerusalem were known, did not present an offer of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   In his tour of the Arab world, Arafat has been encouraged to
stand tough on Jerusalem. Even at the risk of straining ties with
Washington, Egypt has scoffed at U.S. and Israeli requests that it
use its influence to soften the Palestinians' position.
</P>
<P>
   However, beyond words, there has been little else.
</P>
<P>
   With no efforts being made to convene an Arab summit, the most
Arafat can hope for is a discussion on Jerusalem during the regular
biannual meeting of the Arab League's foreign ministers in Cairo on
Sept. 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   Even Arafat's fallback plan -- an emergency gathering of the
member states of the Organization of the Islamic Conference -- is
not working out.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, the current leader of the 54-member OIC, had no comment
when Arafat raised the idea during a Thursday visit that began with
what appeared to be an intentional snub; the Palestinian leader,
welcomed around the world as a head of state, was received at
Tehran's airport by the Iranian deputy foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has only belatedly caught up with Arafat's diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's senior policy adviser, Danny Yatom, last week reportedly
made secret visits to Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. On
Thursday, Israel's chief peace negotiator, Shlomo Ben-Ami, began a
European tour, closely following the itinerary of Arafat envoy
Nabil Shaath.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, Shaath described Palestinian diplomacy as
a success. He said European leaders have reiterated their support
for U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, which stipulates an
Israeli withdrawal from occupied land and which the Palestinians
interpret as a demand that Israel relinquish east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian envoy scoffed at Israeli comments that Arafat's
travels are a waste of time. ''If this is a waste of time, why are
they following us from place to place?'' Shaath said.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Speight Charged With Treason  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT KEITH-REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- George Speight, the coup leader whose raid on
Parliament plunged Fiji into two months of crisis, smiled and
listened to cheers from hundreds of supporters Friday as he was
driven to court to be charged with treason.
</P>
<P>
   Speight was not required to enter a plea during the hearing at
Suva Magistrate's Court. The charges filed against him included
treason, conspiracy to commit treason and being an accessory after
the fact to treason.
</P>
<P>
   He could face the death penalty if convicted of treason, but he
is unlikely to be put to death: No death sentence has been carried
out in this Pacific nation since independence from Britain in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Speight led an armed group into Parliament on May 19 and took
dozens of lawmakers hostage. He claimed ethnic Indian Fijians, a
large minority here, had too much power and were threatening
indigenous Fijian culture.
</P>
<P>
   His rebels held hostages for eight weeks, freeing the last of
them only after the military discarded Fiji's multiracial
constitution, ousted the government and agreed to an amnesty for
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Speight was arrested late last month, just days after releasing
the last of the hostages. The coup leader is being held in pretrial
custody in a barbed wire pen on a prison island near Suva, Fiji's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he was driven to the court hearing under tight
security along with 14 of his senior aides, who also face
coup-related charges. About 300 supporters cheered and had to be
held back by police as they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Speight appeared in court with an adhesive bandage on the back
of his clean-shaven head. Chief magistrate Salesi Temo said he had
received copies of medical certificates that bore out complaints by
Speight and eight others of being assaulted by soldiers while in
custody. Temo did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   At a separate hearing last week, Speight pleaded innocent to
minor public order and weapons offenses related to his leadership
of the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Indians were first brought to Fiji as indentured laborers in the
1870s by British colonialists, and the elected government that was
ousted was led by Mahendra Chaudhry, the first prime minister from
Fiji's ethnic Indian minority. The coup provoked sanctions from
nations including Australia and the United States and has severely
damaged Fiji's economy, which is based on sugar exports and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's bodyguards, Vilimone Tikotani and Jitoko Soko, were
among the Speight allies charged with treason. His media spokesman,
Jo Nata, was one of those charged with conspiracy to commit
treason.
</P>
<P>
   All 15 people in court Friday were remanded to custody until
Aug. 25.

<HEADLINE> Teens recount frightening experience in rain-swollen ditch  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAMBURG, N.Y. (AP) - His legs pinned in a drainage ditch by the
fast-moving current, 13-year-old Brandon Santa thought he could
hold on until help arrived.
</P>
<P>
   With the water rushing by, Brandon had one hand on the stone
bridge in front of him and the other on his buddy, Jim Daly, who
was yelling for help.
</P>
<P>
   Then the water began to rise. Past Brandon's lower back it
crept, reaching his neck, then his head. Brandon craned his neck to
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Jim splashed the water away to get him some air.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I was going to die, because the water started going
over my head,'' Brandon told The Buffalo News Thursday, a day after
his ordeal at the South Shore Golf Course. ''The water was going
over the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon decided to let go and see whether he could slide through
the narrow culvert. He didn't even realize he was being swept into
an underground tunnel less than 3 feet wide and more than 10 feet
long.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just flew through,'' he said. ''It only took a few
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   He stumbled to safety, before rescuers put him in an ambulance.
Hours later, he was released from Children's Hospital, a bit
bruised - and with a newfound respect for rain-swollen creeks and
ditches.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, Brandon and Jim returned to the scene of the
narrow escape.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at this,'' Brandon said to his best friend. ''I don't
even know how I fit through that. I have no clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Their escapade began Wednesday evening, when they began floating
on their backs in a creek behind a car dealership.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt like we were on a water slide,'' Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   They then began walking along the drainage ditch when Jim's legs
were sucked under by the current. With Brandon's help, Jim pulled
himself out, but then Brandon was sucked underneath.
</P>
<P>
   For about 15 minutes, Brandon held onto his friend and the stone
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst part for me was when the water was going over his
head, and he couldn't breathe,'' Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon said that when he let go, ''I was just wondering if I
was going to come out the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he stumbled to safety, Brandon was hurting. He was
breathing hard, his face was red, and he was coughing a lot but he
suffered only bruised hips and a scratch on his foot.
</P>
<P>
   The boys learned their lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stay away from creeks and stuff when they're overflowing,''
Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon went a step farther:
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even want to take a bath anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Russians Discuss Military, Nuclear  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin summoned Russia's highest
officials to the Kremlin on Friday to debate the future of the
fractured, bedraggled military and defuse tensions over control of
the country's nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   The structure of the armed forces appeared to remain intact
after the four-hour meeting of the Security Council, despite
speculation that the session might result in major reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Russian media depicted that as a possible victory for the
defense minister, Gen. Igor Sergeyev. He had been in a rare public
argument with the head of the general staff, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin,
over plans to reduce the strategic rocket forces by folding them
into the air force. Sergeyev, a former commander of the nuclear
forces, had staunchly opposed the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''No missile silo will be destroyed until its service life
expires,'' Sergeyev said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''A decision was made by the commander-in-chief, it is balanced,
well-founded, and takes into consideration the government's
economic possibilities,'' he said, according to Russian news
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the decision were unclear. Security Council Secretary
Sergei Ivanov said documents on increasing military spending and
improving combat readiness had been adopted, but they had yet to be
edited. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Kvashnin said the meeting focused on ''harmonic development of
all parts of the armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin had been keen to settle the feud between Sergeyev and
Kvashnin, which has highlighted rifts in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''I rather tolerantly treated the polemics within the Defense
Ministry. Now we have to wrap up this discussion, make a balanced
decision,'' Putin said at the start of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current structure of the armed forces is hardly optimal.
How can it be considered optimal if training is not conducted in
many units, pilots rarely fly and sailors rarely go to sea,'' he
said. ''The structure of the armed forces must precisely correspond
to the threats Russia faces now and in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's 1.2 million-member armed forces are broke and low on
modern equipment and morale. The Defense Ministry budget for 2000
is less than $5 billion -- compared to about $268 billion in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a former KGB agent, was elected in March on a platform of
restoring order to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned against the ''unrestrained accumulation of
piles of weapons. We know what that led to in the past. That was
among the reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that any military reforms must be financially
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev argues that Russia needs to improve its nuclear arsenal
to deter possible attacks by other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Kvashnin insists Russia's lack of money means the missile forces
should take a back seat to conventional weapons -- the kind of arms
Russia needs to avoid defeats in conflicts such as the war in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council is a secretive advisory body formed under
Boris Yeltsin to coordinate the activities of the armed forces,
security agencies and police. Friday's meeting also included the
prime minister and several other Cabinet ministers.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Athletes Seek Asylum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Sixteen teen-age soccer players from Sierra
Leone who disappeared from a tournament in Norway last week have
requested asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the group, which has been trickling into a local
police station, turned up Thursday, the Norwegian news agency NTB
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of them will be interviewed during the next three or four
weeks,'' said Frode Forfang, spokesman for the Directorate of
Immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The boys will be allowed to stay in Oslo while their requests
are processed during the fall. Forfang said no asylum-seekers from
the war-ravaged and poverty-stricken West African nation have been
deported in recent years. Sierra Leone -- one of the world's poorest
countries -- is undergoing a vicious civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-member Freetown Vikings team, along with their coach, was
participating in the youth tournament of the Norway Cup in Oslo.
Last Friday, the coach and 20 members disappeared. Some of the
players later showed up and requested to go home while others asked
for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, six members of the team, plus the coach, returned to
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The Freetown Vikings team, made up mainly of orphans, was
created by aid worker Svein-Arne Laukli, who works for the
Norwegian Refugee Council in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day tournament attracted 1,278 youth teams -- about
20,000 players --from around the world.

<HEADLINE> Police investigate string of violent robberies in Manhattan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A man was severely beaten inside his Manhattan
home and police said Friday they believe the attack is the work of
a violent burglar who has struck eight times since June in the
Upper West Side neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incident occurred Thursday at West 81st Street and
Amsterdam Avenue, just blocks from the 20th Precinct and in an
affluent neighborhood long regarded by its residents as safe. A
woman returned to her apartment and found her 57-year-old husband
on the floor with a fractured skull and lacerations. There were no
signs of forced entry.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was no evidence anything was taken, police
believe the same man who has burglarized several homes in the area
and in some cases, attacked other people, is responsible for
Thursday's incident.
</P>
<P>
   On July 28, a couple were beaten severely inside their townhouse
on West 87th Street, near Riverside Drive, about 2:30 a.m. There
were no signs of forced entry.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, another couple was beaten and stabbed in their home
on West 93rd Street near Central Park West. There were no signs of
forced entry
</P>
<P>
   The similarities in the July 24 and July 28 incidents prompted
police to look at earlier burglaries on the Upper West Side. They
found five other burglaries in the neighborhood since June 25 where
the robber got into the homes through open windows or doors. No one
was attacked in these robberies.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 119; Nasdaq Gains 18  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Friday as blue chips surged on
encouraging economic data. Concerns for a second-half earnings
slowdown kept technology stocks from broader gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 119.04 at 11,027.80,
according to preliminary figures. It marked the first time since
April that the blue chip index has crossed the 11,000 threshold.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.59 at 1,470.84, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 18.05 at 3,778.04, having
recovered from a loss of 60 points earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a pattern has emerged recently in which investors
react to whatever news is released on a given day, causing markets
to fluctuate from session to session.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is kind of directionless. People seem to be
grasping, looking for some fundamental issue to hang their hat
on,'' said John Caldwell, director of portfolio strategies for
McDonald Investments in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, for example, blue chip investors were encouraged by
an inflation report that showed that wholesale prices remained
virtually the same in July after a huge jump in June caused by
soaring energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index, which
measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was
flat in July, a significant easing of price pressures following a
hefty 0.6 percent surge in June.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout was the result of a big swing in gasoline and
other energy costs, which declined by 0.7 percent in July after
having jumped 5.1 percent the month before.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, consumer spending in July increased at a better-than
expected level, a sign that the economy remains healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are optimistic that Federal Reserve Board policy
makers will leave interest rates alone at their next meeting Aug.
22 if it appears that inflation has been kept at bay while the
economy continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sectors helping push the Dow index higher were
tobacco, banking, drugs and health care. Philip Morris rose $2.438
to $31.063 after an analyst at Goldman Sachs said the tobacco and
food conglomerate's stock could rise 50 percent to 60 percent this
year. And investment banking firm Lehman Brothers closed up $6.75
at $132.625 on the positive inflation data.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks fell in early trading but recovered. Tech investors
have been jittery lately based on fears that earnings will decline
in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Widely held bellwether Dell Computer was punished Friday after
the computer retailer announced earnings that beat Wall Street's
targets but apparently disappointed the high expectations of
investors. The company failed to live up to projected revenue
growth figures.
</P>
<P>
   Dell shares fell $4.062 to $37.688.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell said many technology stocks are overvalued and have
little room to move higher. Consequently, when their earnings
reports are anything less than spectacular, their stock prices
slip.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems suffered the same fate earlier this week, as did
Microsoft, Intel and Apple Computers last month.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than a 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 833.82
million shares, down from Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 5.25 at 506.90.

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Militant Group Makes Threat  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Islamic militants warned Friday that
a car bombing this week in Kashmir marked the start of a fresh
campaign of terror inside the Himalayan province and elsewhere in
India.
</P>
<P>
   ''If India does not understand our demand, we will make a series
of attacks against military installations in Indian-occupied
Kashmir and elsewhere in India,'' Salim Hashmi, a spokesman for
Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, the main Islamic militant group in Kashmir,
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   An Islamic insurrection has raged for 11 years in Kashmir, a
border region claimed by nuclear rivals India and Pakistan,
claiming the lives of some 25,000 people. Muslim militants want
Kashmir to break away from India and remain independent or merge
with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Hezb-ul Mujahedeen claimed responsibility for the car bombing
Thursday in the capital of Srinigar that killed nine policemen and
a photojournalist. Another 20 people were injured, some of them
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The attack began with a smaller decoy explosion that drew police
and spectators before the car bomb exploded about 10 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our target was the security forces and not civilians,'' Hashmi
said of the blast, outside a busy downtown bank.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-India protesters in Srinagar took to the streets to protest
the bombing, smashing car windows and keeping children from going
to school.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hezb-ul Mujahedeen offered a three-month cease-fire,
demanding India halt human rights abuses in Kashmir and stop
attacks against militants.
</P>
<P>
   India accepted the offer of talks, but Hezb-ul Mujahedeen later
demanded inclusion of Pakistan in peace talks, which India refused.
</P>
<P>
   India accused Pakistan of sabotaging the cease-fire and of
arming, training and financing militant Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan denies the allegations, but says it is sympathetic to
the Kashmiri militants. Pakistan wants a vote held on both sides of
the disputed Kashmir border to decide whether a united Kashmir
joins either Pakistan or India.
</P>
<P>
   Divided between India and Pakistan after British rule of South
Asia ended in 1947, Kashmir has been the flashpoint of two previous
wars between the hostile neighbors. There is international concern
that another war could result in the use of nuclear weapons. India
and Pakistan exploded nuclear bomb in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Since then there has been considerable pressure from the
international community, particularly the United States, for India
and Pakistan to find a peaceful end to the nagging 53-year-old
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   India has refused Pakistan's offers of talks, demanding
Islamabad first withdraw militants from Indian territory, something
Pakistan insists it has no ability to do.

<HEADLINE> Computer program allows hospital visits from home  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - When Jessie McCarthy was in the
hospital for major surgery, she was in no condition to call her
friends and family - in Curacao, the Netherlands and New York - to
keep them updated on her condition.
</P>
<P>
   So she left that to her Guardian Angel.
</P>
<P>
   Using a new computer program at White Plains Hospital Center,
McCarthy's husband Tim set up a private Internet page and entered
the e-mail addresses of their loved ones. The program gave a
password to those pre-approved visitors and notified them every
time Tim McCarthy - the page's designated ''Guardian Angel'' -
posted an update.
</P>
<P>
   Without leaving the hospital or accessing his own e-mail
account, McCarthy could walk down the hall to a visitingOurs.com
kiosk - there are five at the hospital - and type in whatever he
wanted people to know.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything went fine,'' McCarthy wrote on the day of surgery
last month. ''Jessie is in recovery for the next 2 hours and then
she will be moved to the CCU unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, he wrote, ''After a challenging night, she is
feeling much better now. ... Jessie sends thanks for all your
prayers and good thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   The friends and relatives could visit the page anytime to get
the latest news, leave their own good wishes and even order a
get-well gift from Amazon.com, Toys 'R' Us or 1-800-Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hi Im happy to hear that everything is going good,'' read one
message left by a nephew in the Netherlands. ''Greetings to tante
(Dutch for aunt) Jessie and tell her I send a big ''Knuffel''
(''hug'') and to get well soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Another message made available by the McCarthys was written by a
friend in a language spoken in Curacao and Aruba: ''I am writing in
Papiamento so you can know that Curacao also is thinking about
you,'' the friend said. ''I will check later how the surgery
went.''
</P>
<P>
   As she recovered, Jessie McCarthy, a teacher, wrote her own
messages from the hospital or from her Hartsdale home. There's no
limit on how long a page can be used.
</P>
<P>
   The program is also in use, or about to come online, at the
Ronald McDonald House in Manhattan, CancerCare, The New York State
Hospice Association and Action for Sick Children in London. About
100 patients were using it this week. A similar service, called
theStatus, is in use at the Cleveland Clinic Heart Center and has
about 250 patient pages, said company spokeswoman Missy Corbat.
</P>
<P>
   The developer, president and chief executive officer of
visitingOurs is David Gottesfeld, a White Plains psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beauty of what our site does is once you create that
e-mail list, you don't have to worry about it any more,'' he said.
''All you have to do is post the updates and we take care of the
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he lets not-for-profit organizations affiliate for free,
Gottesfeld said he expects the business to be making money from
licensing and retail links by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We become financially more valuable the more pages that are
opened up, the more people that are using it,'' he said. ''Part of
this is also just doing good, helping people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said visitingOurs is complementary, rather than competitive,
to other hospital-oriented sites like Baby Press Conference, which
lets new parents tell friends about a newborn and even do a live
Internet video chat.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Harris, president of Ronald McDonald House, said the
program is ideal for her institution, which puts up 84 children and
one parent each while the kids are being treated for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kids are away from home, lots of relatives can't visit
and they all love computers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Cliro, a 23-year-old from Colombia, spent six days in the
hospital this month being treated for Lyme disease and other
ailments she picked up working as a camp counselor in Westchester
County. Since her mother is a nurse and her father a doctor, she
used visitingOurs.com to keep them current on her treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really missed getting my regular e-mail but this was a
help,'' she said. ''It was a great idea.''

<HEADLINE> Day-care center probed after toddlers injured in pool  </HEADLINE>
By PAT MILTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLE PLACE, N.Y. (AP) - A Long Island home where two toddlers
nearly drowned in a backyard pool faced a state probe Friday to
determine whether its residents were actually running an illegal
day-care center.
</P>
<P>
   There were several questions that still needed answers following
the Thursday accident that left the two little girls in critical
condition, said William Van Slyke, spokesman for the state Office
of Children and Family Services.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators wanted to know if Julio and Joaquina Carvalho were
operating a day-care center in their home; if so, whether they were
licensed; or if they were simply caring for relatives when the
accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The Carvalhos were ordered not to do any baby-sitting at the
home until the investigation was complete, Van Slyke said.
</P>
<P>
   The two toddlers, girls aged 17 months and 21 months, were in
critical condition and breathing on respirators one day after they
were found floating in the above ground pool in the Carvalhos' back
yard.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a tragic accident,'' said Nassau County Police
Detective Sgt. Dennis Farrell. ''There are two sets of parents
holding a bedside prayer vigil that their children recover.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the older toddler, Patricia Graca, lived at the
Carvalho house, Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Aida Graca, Patricia's mother, was fixing lunch in the house for
five other children when the toddlers walked out a side door, said
Farrell. Three other adults in the house failed to notice their
departure.
</P>
<P>
   The girls apparently climbed the stairs to the pool's deck and
tumbled in. Police do not believe they were in the pool long before
Graca noticed them missing and discovered the pair.
</P>
<P>
   An off-duty New York City police officer who lives nearby heard
Graca's screams and responded, giving one child mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation. An emergency services worker, summoned by a 911
call, tended to the other girl.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia's 10-year-old sister called 911 because her mother
speaks little English.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Graca remained in critical condition at Nassau County
Medical Center in East Meadow. The other toddler, Natalie Correia
of Mineola, was listed in critical condition at Winthrop-University
Hospital in Mineola.
</P>
<P>
   The Carvalhos were in Portugal visiting relatives at the time of
the accident. Authorities were checking whether they had turned the
children's care over to Graca while they were gone.
</P>
<P>
   State and Nassau County regulations generally require a day-care
license for people caring for more than two children who are
unrelated, said Fran Karliner, spokeswoman for Child Care of Nassau
County.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they are related to you, then you are allowed to care for
as many as you want without a license,'' Karliner said.

<HEADLINE> Analysis of new Liberal Party ad  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of a new television advertisement from
the Liberal
Party.
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIME: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   TITLE: Superimposed.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Callahan Creative.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMARY AND TEXT: The ad criticizes Republican U.S. Senate
candidate Rep. Rick Lazio for not insisting that the Republican
Leadership Council pull a television ad that features a spliced
picture of Lazio with U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Lazio and
Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton are running to succeed
Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   In this ad, images of Lazio are spliced together with pictures
of various people and objects. A narrator says: ''The Republicans
recently aired a commercial superimposing Rick Lazio next to Sen.
Moynihan, suggesting Moynihan supports him. Moynihan wants the ad
withdrawn. Using that technique, you can make anyone look like
they're backing him. Here's Lazio with Henry VIII. With a kangaroo.
Look, this bowl of fruit really likes him too. But without faking
it, you can tell who got behind Lazio by making him his deputy
whip. Newt Gingrich. A message of truth from the New York State
Liberal Party. Call Lazio and tell the Republicans to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: The ad, the first this election season from the
Liberal Party, seeks to present Lazio as a lightweight by picturing
him next to images such as a kangaroo and a bowl of fruit. By
showing him with Gingrich, the ad implies Lazio is too far to the
right. During the campaign, Lazio has sought to downplay his
association with the former House Speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has defended himself from attacks about the original
Republican Leadership Council ad, saying that he can not control
what some supporters do. But few doubt that if Lazio had made the
request, the Republican ad would have been quickly pulled -- Lazio
even offered to make such an appeal to the RLC last week, but only
if Clinton agreed to a moratorium on the use of soft money in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party ad, which never mentions Clinton, succeeds in
making Lazio appear foolish, and emphasizes two of the major
campaign thrusts by Democrats against Lazio: That he lacks gravitas
to be a U.S. Senator and that he is too conservative to represent
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The state's small Liberal Party is led by Raymond Harding, an
adviser and close friend of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Before
Giuliani dropped out of the Senate race this spring, the Liberal
Party appeared poised to endorse the Republican mayor instead of
Clinton; it has since backed the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spokesman Dan McLagan said: ''Rick has offered to call for
all outside groups to stop running ads, and was met with silence
from Mrs. Clinton. The sad truth is New Yorkers aren't supporting
her campaign, so she needs these outside groups and soft money to
fuel her attack machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The spot will run in New York City, Long Island, Albany and
Buffalo beginning Monday or Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> With BC-NY--EgyptAir, Bjt  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Excerpts from Friday's news conference by James Hall,
chairman
of the National Transportation Safety Board, regarding the board's
investigation into the Oct. 31 crash off Nantucket Island of
EgyptAir Flight 990, which killed 217 people:
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALL: We are here this morning to report to the American people,
to the Egyptian people and to the families of the victims the
status of our investigation and to open the public docket
pertaining to the investigation of this crash.
</P>
<P>
   By doing so, we are fulfilling our mandate to make public the
factual information gathered to date and to provide the public with
an accounting of the progress of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   By statute, where there is a cockpit voice-recorder transcript,
we open the docket, either as part of a public hearing, or when the
majority of the factual reports are complete. In this instance, the
board has determined there is no need for a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to note that only factual information is being
released today. The Egyptian authorities have reviewed all the
material contained in the docket. Where they have disagreements,
they have been given the opportunity to submit those disagreements
in writing, and that material is also included in the docket that
is being opened today.
</P>
<P>
   There is no National Transportation Safety Board analysis in
this material as to the cause of the crash. That analysis will be
developed in the future and will be released by the board in its
final report.
</P>
<P>
   Because EgyptAir 990 was a non-U.S.-operated flight and crashed
into international waters, international procedures as outlined by
Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation dictated
that Egypt, as the state of registry, would be the investigative
authority.
</P>
<P>
   However, under the provisions of Annex 13, the government of
Egypt delegated the investigation to the United States. As a
result, the National Transportation Safety Board immediately
assumed control of the investigation, and we have conducted this
investigation under NTSB's rules and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian government designated the Egyptian Civil Aviation
Authority as its accredited representative to this investigation.
Representatives from the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority, along
with technical advisers from EgyptAir and other organizations,
arrived on scene soon after the crash and have been involved
throughout the entire investigative process.
</P>
<P>
   Among the factual reports is one prepared by the cockpit
voice-recorder group. That group produced two transcripts of the
cockpit voice-recorder tape. The first is a transcription of what
was actually spoken, both the original English, which was used in
radio transmissions, and the original Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   The second is a translation of the Arabic into English. The
translation was done by an NTSB-contracted interpreter, an FBI
language specialist, two members of the Egyptian delegation and a
State Department official, and it was agreed to and signed by all
participants, including the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority and
EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
   This process was no small task. It usually takes a cockpit voice
recorder group about 16 hours to develop a 30-minute transcript,
which is the length of the cockpit voice recorder tape. This group
worked for 130 hours to prepare this transcript.
</P>
<P>
   Under ICAO procedures, the staff's draft report will be shared
with the Egyptian accredited representative, who will then have 60
days in which to review and respond to the information. After
receipt of that response, the board staff will finalize its draft
report and submit it to the five members of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   I hope this gives you and the viewing public a good
understanding of where we are in the process of completing this
investigation. The circumstances of the crash and the scope of the
human tragedy have made this an extremely difficult investigation.
</P>
<P>
   As I said earlier, the investigators have already spent 286 days
investigating the crash. The NTSB's investigation is expected to
cost an estimated $17 million, much of that in search and recovery
costs.
</P>
<P>
   As you may know, the government of Egypt has contributed $5
million toward defraying those search and recovery costs and has
pledged to pay more in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Before I close, let me say that I have spoken with Egyptian
Ambassador Nabil Fahmy this morning. He strongly expressed the
Egyptian government's understandable displeasure at the leak of
factual information from the official docket of this investigation.
I share his displeasure. This is a breach of our investigative
process.
</P>
<P>
   I also spoke to FBI Director Louis Freeh this morning. We both
agreed that we will conduct an inquiry as to who leaked this
information. And if we can identify the individual or individuals
who leaked this information, we will take appropriate action.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the National Transportation Safety Board, I want to
make it perfectly clear that no determination as to the cause of
this crash has been made. We will continue to work with the
Egyptian officials to find the truth.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: With some evident different perspectives on the cause
of this accident, why are you not going into a public hearing? Was
that the board's decision? Did the Egyptians concur or disagree
with it? What's the basis for the decision?
</P>
<P>
   HALL: The staff recommended to the board that a hearing not be
held on this crash because they believe there are no unresolved
safety issues that require such a forum. The board members agreed
to this recommendation. I cannot speak for the other members as to
why they did not want a hearing, but for myself, I agreed with the
staff's reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ...
</P>
<P>
   The positions of both the American investigators and the
Egyptian investigators are contained in the factual report. And
those issues, again, will be discussed at the technical review
which will be held in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: Has the board ever before spent 286 days investigating
a crash and not come to the conclusion as to the cause?
</P>
<P>
   HALL: Next week in this room, we, after four years, will be
concluding the investigation of the Trans World aircraft, Flight
800, and will be issuing the first probable cause of that accident
at that time. So this certainly is not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I want to follow up on the previous questions about
additional work. Is there additional work being done right now to
look at any systems, or is that work finished at this point, as far
as the investigation is ...
</P>
<P>
   HALL: We are - have completed all the work at this point. Any
further decisions will be made at the next step of the
investigative process, the technical review.

<HEADLINE> Union members approve contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Members of the state's second-largest public
employee union have voted overwhelmingly to accept a new four-year
contract with the state, officials announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Public Employees Federation members voted 33,899 to 2,876 to
replace a contract that expired in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, which is retroactive to April last year, gives
workers an across-the-board salary increase of 6 percent for the
first two years. Another 3.5 percent wage increase will take effect
in April 2001 and 3.5 percent more in April 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the pay hikes, the pact includes a $500 bonus for
full-time employees; better dental benefits; increased copay for
office visits to $10 from $8; a decrease to $5 from $8 for generic
prescriptions; and an increase to $15 from $8 for name-brand
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Ratification of the contract also means members will receive the
enhanced pension benefits approved by the state Legislature in
June. Tier III and IV members who have worked 10 or more years in
the system will no longer have to pay the three percent employee
contribution, and Tier I and II members will receive one month of
retirement service credit for each year worked, to a maximum of 24
months of service.

<HEADLINE> Special interest groups pump in $6.2 million to New York politics  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Special interest groups seeking to influence
state government donated more than $6.2 million to New York's major
political parties in the first seven months of the year, a
government reform group reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Public Interest Research Group said during the 2000
legislative session, political action committees, corporations and
individual donors pumped in more than $1.6 million in ''soft
money'' into accounts maintained by the state's political parties
and by party legislative committees. There are no limits in New
York on how much money can be given into such ''housekeeping''
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Service and Employees International Union Local 1199,
representing 14,000 health workers in upstate New York, was the
heaviest-giving PAC, donating more than $300,000 to Republican and
Democratic committees, according to records filed with the state
Board of Elections and reviewed by NYPIRG. SEIU/1199 topped the
donor's list to both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Other health-related groups were also major donors, with the
Medical Society of the State of New York kicking in about $145,000
and the Empire Dental PAC giving another $142,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are always health issues circulating around Albany. It's
not surprising who's on the list,'' NYPIRG's Blair Horner said.
</P>
<P>
   Horner added that some of the payments could be money pledged as
a result of lawmakers supporting the new $9 billion Health Care
Reform Act, which passed the state Legislature in December.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, all 211 seats in the state Legislature will be up
for election in November.
</P>
<P>
   Horner pointed out that the tobacco industry was a ''glaring
omission'' from this year's top donors list. Tobacco giant Philip
Morris, a traditionally heavy-giving corporation, was conspicuously
absent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Legislators don't want to have Big Tobacco money this year,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1999, the state Lobbying Commission fined Philip
Morris $75,000 for lobbying violations and barred chief Albany
representative Sharon Portnoy from lobbying in New York state for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican party committees raised nearly twice as much as
their Democratic counterparts from Jan. 15 through July 15, the
report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate Republican Campaign Committee raised the most
money, nearly $2 million, followed by the Republican State
Committee at $1.6 million. The Republican Assembly Campaign
Committee received $466,097.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the Democratic Assembly Campaign
Committee raised $1.27 million and the Democratic State Committee
received $702,230. The Senate Democratic Campaign Committee had
$184,640.
</P>
<P>
   Horner said it was expected that the majority in both chambers -
Republicans control the Senate while Democrats lead the Assembly -
would raise more money than the minority. But he added that Senate
Republicans were more ''aggressive'' fund-raisers and have ''more
leverage'' with Republican George E. Pataki in office.
</P>
<P>
   The state GOP also led in the so-called soft-money donations,
collecting more than $1.2 million. Special interest groups donated
about $408,000 in soft money to the state Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money donations are supposed to be used for overhead
expenses like paying the electric bill, and for generic
''party-building'' activities. While barred from directly
supporting candidates, the accounts can be used to bring out
Republican or Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, ''hard money'' donations, or dollars that could
be used directly to back candidates, cannot exceed $76,500 each
year for any donor. Soft money has no such restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''These (soft money contributions) continue to be sky-high,''
Horner said.
</P>
<P>
   NYPIRG's report noted that both parties had created additional
''conference housekeeping accounts'' to raise more soft money -
''It doesn't make sense why, but they're there,'' Horner said.
</P>
<P>
   NYPIRG and other government reform groups have been calling on
New York politicians to adopt stiffer campaign contribution laws.

<HEADLINE> NASA:Problems Delay Spacecraft Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Test flights of the X-33 space plane,
which NASA once hoped to get off the ground in 1999, have been
delayed until 2002 because of fuel tank problems.
</P>
<P>
   A crack was found in the tank after a test, forcing a new round
of evaluations for the $1.2 billion project, NASA officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Austin, who manages the X-33 program at the Marshall Space
Flight Center in Huntsville, said the latest delay does not put the
program in danger of cancellation, though much of its budget
already has been spent.
</P>
<P>
   The pilotless craft is to serve as a prototype for a privately
operated plane, possibly replacing the space shuttle, that Lockheed
Martin and its partners hope to build.
</P>
<P>
   Last January the plane's manufacturer, VentureStar LLC,
announced that plans for a test flight would be delayed because of
defects in the graphite-epoxy composite tanks, which hold the
liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen used to power the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Austin said Thursday a final decision hasn't been made on
whether aluminum will be used in place of the lighter composite
material for the tanks. But he said the problems in the design and
manufacture of the tanks have taught NASA enough about the
materials that they are likely to be used on more space hardware in
the future.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota dollars for New York Republican  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK HOWE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) - Minnesota Republicans ate their way
through ''an incredibly successful'' fund-raiser for New York U.S.
Senate candidate Rick Lazio on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican congressman raised more than $120,000 in a lunch
event that was the last stop on a five-day, 14-city tour for Lazio,
who is in a race against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''This race for a lot of folks in Minnesota transcends the
boundaries of New York,'' Lazio said. ''People see this race as a
battle over the heart and soul of America.''
</P>
<P>
   A Lazio aide said the entire trip raised more than $1 million,
though he declined to give a specific figure.
</P>
<P>
   The event was organized by Minnesota Republican Jim Ramstad of
Minnetonka. The congressman is a popular lawmaker and, as a member
of the House Ways and Means Committee, a prolific fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Ramstad said he organized the event because Lazio is one of his
best friends in Congress. He described Lazio as ''a fiscal
conservative and a good social moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio boasted that he has raised his campaign money in ''hard,
reportable dollars,'' a jab at his opponent, who he said is
''addicted'' to so-called soft money, which can be raised from
corporations and unions in unlimited amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio camp suggested that Clinton return a $2,000 ''soft
money'' contribution made by Playboy Enterprises CEO Christie
Hefner. The donation, alleged by Lazio campaign manager Bill Dal
Col, was revealed on Friday as pressure built for a California
congresswoman to relocate a fund-raiser that had been planned next
week at the Playboy mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, concerned that the event projects the wrong
image as they convene for their national convention in Los Angeles,
asked Rep. Loretta Sanchez to pick an alternate location.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said Friday he supports the party's
decision to distance itself from the event - and from Sanchez, a
staunch supporter - despite his own acceptance of campaign money
from Playboy magazine executives, including Hugh Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign manager blasted Clinton and the Democrats as
hypocrites. ''It's OK for Hillary Clinton to take soft money from
the Hefner family under the cover of darkness, but heaven forbid if
another Democrat has a public fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion.''
Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to inquiries
seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> First 'sentinel' chicken tests positive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOMERS, N.Y. (AP) - For the first time in New York, a sentinel
chicken - set out for the purpose of tracking the West Nile virus -
has been infected, health officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the area where the chicken was infected has already
been sprayed with an insecticide, and since the chicken was
infected before the spraying, no additional action is planned, the
Westchester County Health Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The chicken, one of a flock in Somers, was not sickened by the
virus and did not have to be killed for testing, said Department
spokeswoman Valerie Goldstein. Chickens are used as sentinels
because while they are not physically affected by the virus, their
blood reveals its presence.
</P>
<P>
   The state Health Department announced that in addition to the
chicken, nine birds from around the state were reported infected
for a total of 164 this year: three each from Dutchess and Nassau
counties and one each from Orange, Rensselaer and Yates County. It
was Yates County's first positive finding.
</P>
<P>
   A trapful of mosquitoes from Rockland County also tested
positive, Rockland's seventh finding and the state's 61st.
</P>
<P>
   Only one human case has been detected, a Staten Island man who
is recovering. Last year, the virus killed seven people.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki sent a letter to President Clinton on Friday
requesting $20 million in emergency federal assistance to New York
to help cover costs of fighting the virus.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists object to dumping of dredged material off Sandy Hook </HEADLINE>
By HANAH CHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have begun
dredging the area where the Raritan River meets the Arthur Kill
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists say the dredged material, which will be
placed six miles off the coast of Sandy Hook, is unsafe to marine
life and humans.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Corps of Engineers
officials say the sediment is clean enough to cap the contaminated
material in the so-called ''Mud Dump'' site.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-foot dredging of parts of the area, which began
Wednesday, will produce 175,000 cubic yards of sediment, said John
Hartmann, the Corps of Engineers chief of operations. The dredging
is expected to continue for another two weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corps of Engineers spokesman Peter Shugert said the dredging is
a federally required maintenance project. The last maintenance
project in the area was completed in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government is required to maintain the safe navigational
depth in the federal channel,'' Shugert said. ''The last thing we
want is an oil spill in the port of New York and New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartmann said over 3,000 commercial vessels passed through the
channel in 1999 with over 1.8 million tons of commodity, such as
petroleum, iron ores and steel scrapes.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say they are not opposed to the dredging
project, but to the dumping of sediment that they believe is laced
with PCBs and other toxins.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like black mayonnaise,'' said Cindy Zipf, executive
director of the Sandy Hook-based Clean Ocean Action.
</P>
<P>
   Zipf said the EPA, the Corps of Engineers and other federal
agencies are reneging on an agreement to end the dumping of toxic
dredge spoils off Sandy Hook.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Vice President Al Gore helped broker the deal to close
the underwater mud dump and create the remediation area.
Uncontaminated dredged material was to cap the dump.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have opposed other dredging projects since the
1996 agreement, saying the sediment is not much cleaner or safer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is that the federal government is cleaning up
the ocean by making it worse,'' Zipf said.
</P>
<P>
   But Shugert said the Corps of Engineers have been following one
of the strictest standards for offshore dumping since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, U.S. Rep Frank Pallone called on President Clinton to
appoint a federal mediator to solve the dispute between the
environmental community and federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Pallone said the EPA was supposed to develop stricter guidelines
as part of the 1996 agreement. ''We don't think anything should be
dumped until the new standards are adopted,'' he said. ''I feel we
have reached an impasse. Two sides clearly don't agree.''
</P>
<P>
   EPA spokeswoman Mary Helen Cervantes said the agency is
reviewing possible revisions to current guidelines, but not under
the 1996 deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no material going out there to pose a threat to those
who swim and surf,'' Cervantes said. ''There's a misconception that
it does, and it's not true.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Rescue workers struggled to reach a
rain-soaked region where 27 people were killed in landslides and
flooding, officials said Friday. Blocked roads hampered the rescue
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rain caused several landslides Wednesday in two
districts in the mountainous Kumaon region in the northern Uttar
Pradesh state. Word from the remote area reached the Indian capital
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole mountain toppled down on a village ... we don't even
know where the bodies are,'' said Pratap Singh, an assistant to the
administrator in Pithoragarh, one of the two affected districts.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonal monsoon rains have caused flooding across the east
and northeast, stranding more than 5 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain landslides in Pithoragarh's Didihat village flattened
four houses, killing 16 people. A landslide in second village in
the district killed seven others.
</P>
<P>
   The Indo Tibetan Border Police worked to clear the roads, but
bad weather hindered their work.
</P>
<P>
   In the neighboring Nainital district, a popular hill resort,
four people were swept away in the swollen Bhagra River when their
jeep plunged into the waters, district administrator Aradhna Shukla
said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 people were killed in the same state in August
1998, in two massive landslides on a route taken by pilgrims headed
for a sacred lake in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Spain's ETA Admits To Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By MAR ROMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The armed Basque separatist group ETA
claimed responsibility Friday for 12 attacks committed between May
9 and July 29, including the killing of two Spanish politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement published Friday by the Basque daily Euskaldunon
Egunkaria, ETA admitted killing Jose Maria Martin Carpena, a town
councilor of the governing Popular Party who was gunned down in the
southern city of Malaga on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   The group also said it was responsible for the July 29
assassination of Juan Maria Jauregui, 49, a Socialist Party
politician and former representative of the Interior Ministry in
the Basque region, who was shot twice in the head while vacationing
in northern Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The statement did not mention two car bombings and a shooting
this week that left two people dead and 11 injured in different
Spanish cities. Police and politicians have blamed ETA for those
attacks as part of a recent offensive by the group.
</P>
<P>
   The organization traditionally waits weeks or months to claim
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Some 35,000 walked in silence through the pouring rain Friday in
the northern city of Pamplona to protest one of the incidents the
ETA did not mention -- the deadly shooting of a soldier as he parked
his car at his home near the city.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was led with a banner that proclaimed ''Peace and
Liberty. ETA No.''
</P>
<P>
   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, also claimed responsibility for several bomb attacks,
including one in a downtown Madrid shopping area that injured nine
people, and two in a wealthy residential zone of a small Basque
town in which no one was killed.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, ETA says that some of its attacks were aimed
at leading members of the Basque business elite for not paying the
so-called ''revolutionary tax,'' which is the money the group gets
from extortion. Among others, the group cites Emilio Ybarra,
chairman of the Spanish financial institution, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria.
</P>
<P>
   It also identifies attacks against prominent politicians, such
as a senator of the Popular Party, and directors of newspapers in
the Basque region.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its
campaign for the independence of three Basque provinces in northern
Spain. Since ending a 14-month cease-fire in December, ETA has been
blamed for nine deaths in around 20 attacks.

<HEADLINE> Former security guard guilty in death of unruly gambler  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A former Trump Plaza Hotel &AMP; Casino
guard was convicted of second-degree manslaughter Friday in the
fatal beating of an unruly gambler.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 12 hours of deliberations over two days, jurors
found Mark Petty guilty in the Sept. 8, 1998, death of Hue To.
</P>
<P>
   To, 25, of Plainfield, had been ejected from the casino for
panhandling and threatening guards. Trump Plaza officials also said
To was caught trying to steal chips from a customer's pocket. When
confronted, he swore and made death threats to casino workers and
security guards, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   To was taken to a security office at the casino where he died of
a spinal injury after Petty threw him into a door and kicked him,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Petty is 6-foot-1 and weighs 240 pounds. To was 5-foot-1 and
weighed about 110 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Petty sat quietly when the verdict was announced, but his wife
began crying. She and other relatives declined to talk to a
reporter when they left the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin J. Jacobs Jr., Petty's defense lawyer, said he and his
client were confident with their case throughout the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not second-guessing ourselves. We're sad about the
verdict, but we respect it,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they were satisfied with the jury decision,
which included convicting Petty of one count of witness tampering.
The jury found him innocent of two other counts of witness
tampering and deadlocked on another.
</P>
<P>
   To's relatives said they were still healing from his death.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel so bad for the death of my brother,'' Nghia To said
after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Petty's sentencing was scheduled for Sept. 21. He faces five to
10 years in prison. The judge revoked Petty's $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Petty, 37, of Galloway Township, was charged with witness
tampering for trying to bully other security guards into lying
about the incident in their official reports, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Waldron, 51, of Egg Harbor Township, an investigator for
Trump Plaza, was also charged with witness tampering in the case.
</P>
<P>
   She threatened four guards, warning them not to tell the truth
about what happened because it would send Petty to jail and result
in their firings, said First Assistant Atlantic County Prosecutor
Ellen Loughney.
</P>
<P>
   Waldron's case is pending trial.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 119; Nasdaq Gains 29  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Friday as blue chips surged on
encouraging economic data. Concerns for a second-half earnings
slowdown kept technology stocks from broader gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 119.04 at 11,027.80,
marking the first time since April 25 that the blue chip index has
closed above the 11,000 threshold. Friday's surge gave the Dow a
gain of 260.05 for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 11.59 at 1,471.84, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 29.48 at 3,789.47, having
recovered from a loss of 60 points earlier in the session. The S&AMP;P
rose 8.91 for the week, while the Nasdaq eked out a gain of 2.11.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a pattern has emerged recently in which investors
react to whatever news is released on a given day, causing markets
to fluctuate from session to session.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is kind of directionless. People seem to be
grasping, looking for some fundamental issue to hang their hat
on,'' said John Caldwell, director of portfolio strategies for
McDonald Investments in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, for example, blue chip investors were encouraged by a
Labor Department report that showed wholesale prices were virtually
unchanged in July after a huge jump in June. The turnabout in the
Producer Price Index was the result of a big swing in gasoline and
other energy costs, which declined by 0.7 percent in July after
having jumped 5.1 percent the month before.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, consumer spending in July increased at a better-than
expected level, a sign that the economy remains healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are optimistic that Federal Reserve Board policy
makers will leave interest rates alone at their next meeting Aug.
22 if it appears inflation has been kept at bay while the economy
continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sectors helping push the Dow index higher were
tobacco, banking, drugs and health care. Philip Morris rose $2.625
to $31.25 after an analyst at Goldman Sachs said the tobacco and
food conglomerate's stock could rise 50 percent to 60 percent this
year. And investment banking firm Lehman Brothers closed up $6.75
at $132.625 on the positive inflation data.

   Tech stocks fell in early trading but then recovered. Tech
investors have been jittery lately based on fears that earnings
will decline in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Widely held bellwether Dell Computer was punished after the
computer maker's late Thursday announcement that its earnings beat
Wall Street's targets. Dell apparently disappointed the high
expectations of investors by failing to live up to projected
revenue growth figures.

Microsoft, Intel and Apple Computers last month.

<HEADLINE> State reports on reform progress in poor schools  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A vast majority of New Jersey's poor
schools are ignoring the state's suggestion on how to reform their
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the schools in the state's 30 so-called special
needs districts have proposed reform plans, but only a handful
subscribe to the method endorsed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court in 1998 ordered the poor districts to
institute reforms to reverse failing academic performance. The
justices agreed with state education officials in recommending the
schools put into place a reform method called Success for All. The
method stresses small class sizes, intense tutoring in reading,
staff retraining, and innovative budgeting.
</P>
<P>
   But of the 370 schools that have proposed reform plans, only 67
plan to use Success for All, according to the state Department of
Education. This despite the promise of $70,000 state incentive
grants for schools selecting it.
</P>
<P>
   Department spokesman John Crosbie downplayed the significance of
the unpopularity of the state's preferred choice.
</P>
<P>
   When the state and the court first considered mandating reforms
more than two years ago, Success for All was the most successful
program nationally. Since then, other, newer models have caught up,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some others are very highly regarded by teachers as being more
in line with their philosophy,'' he said. ''Some of these other
models are coming into their own.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, one reform model, the Yale University-based Comer
method, emphasizes both academics and social programs and is very
popular among teachers in urban schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the department did everything to make it known that
Success For All was the preferred model by providing grants and
technical workshops ... we also recognized from the outset, that we
needed schools themselves to embrace their own reform models,''
Crosbie said.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the department approved adoption of models other than
Success for All, as long as a school proved its case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Broken down, only 66 of the 306 elementary schools have chosen
the state's preferred method, with the remainder selecting one of
11 others.
</P>
<P>
   Among secondary schools, where reform is not yet a mandate, only
one of the 64 schools have chosen Success for All, according to
state statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, Gov. Christie Whitman this week named
former Gov. Thomas Kean and others to a new advisory panel. The
Abbott Implementation Advisory Council, named after the
decades-long court case filed by the poor schools, is responsible
for monitoring the state's and the schools' performance
implementing court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Kean said Friday he is looking forward to getting to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''My feeling is, the sooner the court decision is implemented,
the better. Every year that goes by, these children are warehoused
instead of educated,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Missing in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARITA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels seized about two dozen
biological researchers, including an American, in western Colombia,
and a guerrilla leader on Friday promised to release them soon.
</P>
<P>
   National Liberation Army commander Nicolas Rodriguez said his
forces had detained the scientists to investigate their reason for
being in the area. The researchers have been missing since
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The team was from Colombia's National University and had been in
the grassy highlands of western Colombia in Antioquia province to
study the local biodiversity. Colombia is among the most
biologically diverse countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, interviewed by phone on national radio chain
Radionet, said he was now satisfied the team was conducting an
environment-related investigation and that he would have the
researchers freed as soon as a safe mechanism for their release
could be organized. Rodriguez told Radionet that he did not know
precisely how many researchers had been seized.
</P>
<P>
   Among the captives is John Douglas Lynch, a native of Collins,
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch recently retired from the faculty of the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln where he was a professor in the school of
biological sciences for nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   He conducted research in Colombia on amphibians for at least two
decades and upon retirement moved to Bogota, where he became a
curator at the National Science Institute of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The army said guerrilla group -- known by its Spanish initials of
ELN -- intercepted the scientific team as they drove along a road
and took them to an unknown location.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic fighting between army units and the ELN in the region
Friday may delay the release, said the spokesman, Maj. Oscar Anzola
of the Army's 4th Brigade, based in the provincial capital of
Medellin.
</P>
<P>
   The group of 21 to 26 people had been missing since Wednesday,
police spokesman Carlos Perdomo said. The group included six
professors, five biologists, 10 students and several assistants,
according to the National University.
</P>
<P>
   One of the students has dual German-Colombian nationality,
according to the German Embassy in Bogota, which refused to reveal
the student's identity.
</P>
<P>
   The area where the scientific team was working has been wracked
for years by clashes between leftist rebels and paramilitary groups
backed by landowners. Colombia has one of the highest kidnapping
rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific team had been based in a rural school in the La
Union area southeast of Medellin.

<HEADLINE> State asks for bar owners to fight drug use  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Owners of bars and nightclubs across the
state are being asked to help cut the use of the designer drug
Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to all those holding a liquor license, the
director of the Alcoholic Beverage Commission told owners to report
any suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also warns that undercover officers will be making
visits as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am asking you to remain vigilant in your efforts to ensure
that your establishment remains free of illicit drug use,'' Jerry
Fischer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers claim the drug now popular among teens
and young adults at so-called rave parties can cause sudden
illness, including artificially high temperatures that can kill.
</P>
<P>
   The drug known as Ecstasy is the synthetic compound 3-4
methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine, or MDMA. Other similar compounds
found to be dangerous have sometimes been sold under the same name,
and other nicknames include ''X,'' ''XTC,'' and ''Adam.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one more way we are addressing the rising prevalence
of Ecstasy use among our young people. The time to act is now,''
Gov. Christie Whitman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Whitman signed a law that increases criminal penalties
associated with the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, Ecstasy is in the same legal class as heroin and
cocaine. People holding five ounces or more - about 500 pills that
carry a street price of $20 - would face a prison term of up to 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Those caught with less than half an ounce can face up to five
years, the former penalty for any amount of the drug. Offenders
with between half an ounce and five ounces will now face up to 10
years in prison, a second-degree crime. Each ounce is about 100
pills.
</P>
<P>
   The law also provides for warnings to parents and teen-agers
through the state Health and Education departments about the risks
of Ecstasy. The warning will include letters home and posters for
schools and health facilities.

<HEADLINE> Americans To Stand Trial in BVI  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands (AP) -- A judge ruled Friday
that four Americans will stand trial in the slaying of a
Connecticut artist in the British Virgin Islands in January.
</P>
<P>
   Investment broker William Labrador, 36, of Southampton, N.Y., is
charged with killing Lois Livingston McMillen, 34, of Middlebury,
Conn..
</P>
<P>
   Charged as accessories are law student Michael Spicer, 36, of
Albemarle County, Va., Evan George, 23, a construction worker from
Washington D.C. and book publisher Alexander Benedetto, 35, of New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   The four men, who have maintained innocence, will go on trial
October. Magistrate Gail Charles denied bail to the men, who have
been jailed since their arrest Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the evidence they have is an admission supposedly made by
(Labrador) to a prison snitch,'' said Labrador's attorney, Ralph
Gonsalves. Gonsalves said he has not spoken to his client since the
ruling but ''I understand his spirits are good.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They were surprised at the ruling,'' said Oscar Ramjeet, the
attorney for Spicer and George. ''They felt the evidence was not
strong enough for them to stand trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Benedetto's attorney, Paul Dennis, could not immediately be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Charles' ruling followed a preliminary inquiry in which 15
witnesses including police officers and a pathologist testified
from June to August. The inquiry was closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not present DNA evidence then because test
results from Britain had not arrived in time, said government
spokeswoman Sandra Ward. Police seized a bloodstained shirt worn by
Spicer, clothing worn by the other men on the night of McMillen's
killing and three pairs of wet, sandy shoes.
</P>
<P>
   McMillen's body was found Jan. 15 along a shore on the island of
Tortola, with her rental car nearby. She had drowned but appeared
to have had a struggle, police said at the time. The men, who said
they had socialized with McMillen days before, denied seeing her on
the day she died.
</P>
<P>
   The artist had been staying in a villa owned by her family on
Tortola and had long known Spicer, who had a house nearby. George,
Labrador and Benedetto were Spicer's house guests.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapper Sets New Rules for Actor  </HEADLINE>
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRAS, India (AP) -- An elusive bandit who kidnapped a veteran
Indian movie star two weeks ago put forward new conditions for his
release Friday, and set an Aug. 31 deadline for his demands to be
met.
</P>
<P>
   But the mainly political demands were rejected outright by
officials in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the two southern states that
are negotiating the release of the actor Rajkumar. In southern
India, many people go by one name.
</P>
<P>
   The new demands include referring a dispute between Karnataka
and Tamil Nadu over the sharing of the Cauvery River to the
International Court of Justice, making Tamil the only language of
teaching in Tamil Nadu, and compensating women allegedly raped by
policemen.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier demands are also mostly political, but include
amnesty and a $12 million ransom.
</P>
<P>
   ''The demand relating to the Cauvery issue is totally
unacceptable. This just cannot be done,'' Tamil Nadu Chief Minister
K. Karunanidhi told reporters .
</P>
<P>
   On the Tamil language demand, he said attempts by the state
government to make Tamil a compulsory language in school had been
struck down by the Supreme Court. The rape victims had already been
compensated, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan, the kidnapper, is wanted for killing at least 130
policemen, slaughtering elephants and felling thousands of
sandalwood trees. He has long escaped capture.
</P>
<P>
   A special emissary is negotiating with Veerappan on behalf of
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Another demand by Veerappan, 56, is the release of five
activists of an extremist organization, Tamil Karunanidhi said.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the five extremists could be negotiated in
exchange for Rajkumar and three others who were kidnapped by
Veerappan, Karunanidhi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Veerappan settles all issues, this matter will also be
settled,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Verizon, union officials say progress made as bargaining resumes  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Verizon Communications and phone workers'
unions resumed negotiations Friday in hopes of concluding a nearly
weeklong strike, making apparent progress on the cumbersome issue
of unionizing wireless service workers.
</P>
<P>
   But working conditions and job security remained stumbling
blocks as the parties worked to craft new contracts for the 87,200
employees on strike since Sunday. The work stoppage has left the
company's 30,000 managers scrambling to process daily workloads
reaching 80,000 repair orders.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those are from customers who have no service. The rest
are seeking changes or improvements to their service. The managers
are resolving 25,000 repair problems daily, according to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 million customers are affected by the strike, which
covers the District of Columbia and Delaware, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Among the greatest obstacles to an agreement has been the
unions' desire to have greater access to Verizon's fast-growing but
largely nonunionized wireless work force. However, sources familiar
with the talks said the two sides have tentatively agreed to an
expedited election process, rather than full secret-ballot
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which would cover only the former Bell Atlantic
region, would unionize the wireless workers once a majority of them
signed their names to a card requesting representation. The sources
discussed the issue on condition of anonymity. Company and unions
officials declined to address the specifics of any negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But Verizon spokesman Eric Rabe said he felt generally that they
have very encouraging signs of moving toward an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The end of this negotiation process and the end of the strike
is within reach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some employees, the wireless issue is critical
</P>
<P>
   ''My father worked here for 40 years and worked 10,000 hours of
overtime,'' said Harold C. Jones Jr., a striking Verizon
maintenance administrator, who attended a rally with several
hundred employees in Richmond, Va., Friday. ''Now to have any
future we have to be included in the wireless division.''
</P>
<P>
   Candice Johnson of the Communications Workers of America, the
larger of the two striking unions, said the talks have made
progress, but asserted that a number of important concerns remain,
such as forced overtime and the shifting of work to cheaper areas.
</P>
<P>
   In a late afternoon update, the union said it is pressing the
company to address issues related to job stress and said the
company has failed to hire and train enough employees to meet
demand.
</P>
<P>
   The union said the company has used ''unreasonable work quotas
and intense monitoring'' to create a high-pressure work
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said they hope to get a resolution on all
issues quickly.
</P>
<P>
   On another matter of union concern - excessive overtime mandated
by the company - Rabe said that overtime for employees is planned
far advance, so that they can make accommodations. But overtime
gives the company flexibility and is ''a tool to manage customer
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees represented by the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers also are on strike against Verizon, the nation's
largest local and wireless telephone company, which was formed by
the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, more than 1,500 union members rallied outside the
company's offices waving signs that read ''Jobs with Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are the millstone holding this company up,'' said IBEW
Local 2222 President Eddie Fitzpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Verizon's Baltimore headquarters, about 150 union
members marched and chanted, while managers stood nearby passing
out the last regular paychecks strikers from the facility will
receive until the walkout ends.

<HEADLINE> Morris County butcher shop recalls ground beef after toddler's death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) - A Morris County butcher shop ordered a
recall of its ground beef products Friday following state tests
that confirmed E. coli bacteria in frozen hamburger patties eaten
by a 20-month-old boy who later died of the infection.
</P>
<P>
   The hamburger patties purchased from Karl Ehmer Meats in Lake
Hiawatha tested positive for E. coli infection, state health
officials said. The Brayton family in Parsippany had bought frozen
patties from the shop about two months ago, and fed them to twins
Nicolaus and Samantha, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolaus died on Aug. 1 from hemolytic uremic syndrome, a
condition brought on by the bacterial infection. Doctors said the
toddler suffered several strokes that caused brain death.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolaus experienced diarrhea and a light fever about a week
before he died, and a couple of days after the family had the
hamburger for dinner, said his mother, Lorraine Brayton.
</P>
<P>
   Brayton said she and Nicolaus' twin sister, Samantha, also
became ill, but both recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been going to them for years,'' Brayton said of the
butcher shop.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Health and Senior Services is conducting
further tests to determine whether the strain of E. coli matches
the strain found in the beef.
</P>
<P>
   Officials told consumers who have bought ground beef from Karl
Ehmer Meats through Friday to destroy the product or return it to
the butcher for a refund.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department has asked the U.S. Department of
Agriculture to investigate to find out where the contaminated beef
shipped to the butcher shop came from. Karl Ehmer Meats on Friday
sanitized all its meat grinding and processing equipment and passed
an inspection by the Parsippany Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   No other cases of E. coli illness associated with Karl Ehmer
Meats have been reported, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There were 78 reported cases of E. Coli infection in New Jersey
last year and 47 so far this year. Brayton's death was the first
reported fatality in 18 months, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 10,000 to 20,000 cases annually of E. coli
infection in the United States. The illness, with symptoms that
include severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and dehydration, is
usually associated with eating undercooked or contaminated ground
beef.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Claim 800 Casualties  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- A Congolese rebel leader said Friday
his fighters had killed about 800 government soldiers when their
three riverboats burned and sank under rebel fire.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of the Ugandan-backed Congolese
Liberation Movement, said his rebels had counted about 800 bodies
floating on the Oubangi River on Thursday after the attack near
Dongo, in the northern Equateur Province.
</P>
<P>
   ''One ship which carried most of the troops burned because of
fuel and ammunition,'' Bemba said by satellite telephone from his
headquarters in Gbadolite in northern Congo. ''We destroyed them
with 107 mm artillery missiles, and our infantry had attacked
them.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claim.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a cease-fire agreement last year, fighting between
President Laurent Kabila's army and the rebels has intensified,
dimming hopes for an end to the two-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Bemba said he had given Kabila a 72-hour ultimatum through U.N.
military observers in Gbadolite to withdraw from Imesse, a
previously rebel-held town that fell to the government in clashes
last month.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report on state-controlled National Congolese
Radio, government troops were ordered to withdraw from the Oubangi
River area on Friday after ''pushing back the aggressors.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have returned to the positions we held before the signing
of the cease-fire,'' said Leonard Ntwaremba Onfre, the official
responsible for government relations with the United Nations. ''The
head of state believes in respecting this accord.''
</P>
<P>
   Onfre, who spoke at a news briefing Friday, did not mention
fighting along the river, but called upon the rebels to strictly
observe the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   He also demanded that the rebels' Rwandan and Ugandan backers
withdraw from Congo, urging U.N. observers to speed up their
deployment in rebel-held territory to create ''evacuation corridors
for the aggressors.''
</P>
<P>
   Onfre added, however, that there was no need for U.N. forces to
deploy in government-held territory, arguing that the war was only
taking place in rebel-held areas.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council has authorized a U.N. peacekeeping
force of 5,537 observers and troops.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, however, has blocked the deployment of U.N. troops in
the capital, Kinshasa, and Mbandaka, a key river port, in violation
of the peace plan he signed with the three rebel factions and their
backers last year in Lusaka, Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, which back Kabila, also signed.
</P>
<P>
   A summit bringing together leaders of all the countries involved
in the Congo conflict has been scheduled for Monday in Lusaka.

<HEADLINE> Arts-and-crafts tycoon sentenced to 36 months in prison  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MEADOWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) - An arts-and-crafts tycoon was
sentenced to 36 months in prison on tax evasion charges Friday
after witnesses portrayed him as a devoted father and Robin
Hood-type who gave his time and money to the less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge T.K. Hurley said he deviated from the
minimum 41-month sentence required under federal guidelines because
of the extraordinary needs of 71-year-old Robert Perlmutter's five
children, including a 12-year-old emotionally and mentally
handicapped daughter and twin 8-year-old autistic sons.
</P>
<P>
   ''While I think Mrs. Perlmutter has been shouldering the
day-to-day care, the evidence before me suggests this has been a
husband and wife duo who have acted in tandem,'' Hurley said about
the couple's raising of their children. ''While the needs in this
case are extraordinary, I don't think they can be met by Mrs.
Perlmutter alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlmutter, owner of a chain of arts and crafts stores, sobbed
as he stood before the judge and said he was ''thoroughly ashamed''
of himself and ''selfish and greedy'' before he was handcuffed and
led from the courtroom by U.S. marshals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts me. The stigma I have brought on my family, to serve
time in jail,'' Perlmutter said just before Hurley sentenced him
and ordered him to pay a $75,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Perlmutter, working with a manager at Pearl Arts and Crafts in
East Meadow, N.Y., was charged with skimming money off the top of
the business beginning in 1983 and netting $1.2 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Allan Jacobowitz was accused of sending as much as
$100,000 at a time to Perlmutter. Federal investigators started
looking into the case four years ago after Jacobowitz sent a
package containing $72,000 to Perlmutter and it broke open during
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   IRS agents say Perlmutter didn't report the income in tax
returns and used the money to make an estimated $2.5 million in
cash payments to contractors during the construction of his
palatial 12-bedroom, 19-bath mansion in Weston.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess he's going from living in the biggest house to the big
house,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeff Kaplan said after the
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 people, including doctors, a rabbi, employees and
people Perlmutter had helped financially and emotionally, took the
stand on his behalf and talked of his devotion to his family and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Tehan met Perlmutter in 1974 while working as a
manufacturer's representative. When Tehan's wife was murdered in
1984 he had a nervous breakdown and began drinking heavily, he
said. Perlmutter and his wife, Rosalyn, saved his life, Tehan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bob and Roz came and put me in the hospital. They took care of
my dog, called my kids, called my manufacturers, saved my business,
paid my bill, saved my life,'' Tehan said. ''He's almost like a
Robin Hood. He was helping other people. He's kind of a different
kind of crook.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said Perlmutter is no Robin Hood. The money he skimmed
from his business paid for his opulent home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were not denying that what he has done in certain instances
is commendable,'' Kaplan said. ''But his priority was to keep on
skimming.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Arts and Crafts operates several stores in Florida, New
York and New Jersey and has outlets in Chicago, Houston, Atlanta
and in the Washington, D.C., area.

<HEADLINE> Baby Killed, Woman Hurt by Subway  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A woman holding a baby jumped in front of an
oncoming Toronto subway train Friday morning, killing the child and
seriously injuring herself in what police were treating as a
murder-suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the two were not immediately available. Police
said they may be a woman and her 6-month-old son reported missing
by family members Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The two were crushed beneath a subway train at the St. Clair
West station in central Toronto just after dawn as the morning rush
hour began, police Staff Sgt. Fred Ellarby said. The baby died at
the scene. The woman was taken to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center
with life-threatening injuries.
</P>
<P>
   She ''had been taken from under the train and was still living
at that point, (but) her condition of course is very, very
serious,'' Ellarby said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told local media that the woman ran with the child in
her arms from one platform to another before leaping onto the
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ''She jumped (of) her own accord, there's no doubt about that,''
police Constable Richard Cashmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Transit officials shut down a section of the subway line Friday
morning. Dozens of buses were used to transport commuters into the
city center.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred on the fifth anniversary of another
tragedy at the same station. In that case, one train rammed into
the back of another, killing three people and injuring 36.

<HEADLINE> State settles wetlands violation with GOP powerhouse  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Friday settled a two-year battle
with a prominent Republican cranberry grower who illegally
destroyed wetlands, but an environmental critic said the farmer got
off easy.
</P>
<P>
   J. Garfield DeMarco, a former Burlington County GOP chairman and
generous contributor to state Republican coffers, will donate 74
acres of his land outright as Pinelands parkland, and restrict
another 591 acres from development, under the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, his Hammonton company will escape having to pay
upward of $600,000 in state fines for destroying 22 acres of
regulated freshwater wetlands. DeMarco was cited for converting the
land, in the heart of the pristine Pinelands in Woodland Township,
to cranberry bogs in October 1998 without a state permit.
</P>
<P>
   It is now far easier for cranberry growers to obtain state
permits to create new bogs than it was in 1998, under recent rule
changes. Under the settlement with the state Department of
Environmental Protection, DeMarco will be able to keep the new
22-acre bog, provided that he obtains a permit.
</P>
<P>
   DEP officials touted the deal because it adds to the state's
parkland inventory.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for DeMarco to donate three parcels in Bass River and
Woodland to the state. The fourth and larger parcel, in nearby
Tabernacle Township, will still be owned by the cranberry company,
but no development will be allowed there.
</P>
<P>
   According to the DEP, the land is home to the rare pygmy pine
forest, 35 species of mammals and 150 bird species. The Tabernacle
land also contains a short section of the Batona Trail, a popular
hiking spot.
</P>
<P>
   But an environmentalist was displeased at the outcome of the
DeMarco case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thinks it's outrageous that someone who deliberately
violated the law is given a permit after the fact and is given
virtually no penalty,'' said New Jersey Sierra Club Director Jeff
Tittel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because what he did was so egregious, he should have been made
to restore the wetlands and pay real fines and not just hand over
land that's not really even buildable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco is losing out on a potential of more than $300,000, the
worth of his land if it was fully developed, according to DEP
spokesman Peter Page.
</P>
<P>
   Page disputed Tittel's characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ''Critics have been speaking of this conversion in terms that
are just irrational,'' he said. ''All he did wrong was he didn't
get a permit.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a reasonable likelihood that the bog expansion will be
approved once DeMarco applies under the new rules, Page said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental critics of the Whitman Administration have long
distrusted the DEP's treatment of DeMarco, one of southern New
Jersey's GOP powerbrokers and a mentor of current DEP Commissioner
Robert Shinn. Shinn has excused himself from the case, citing
appearance of a potential conflict.
</P>
<P>
   State records show DeMarco and the legal and engineering firms
involved in his permit application gave GOP campaigns more than
$200,000 last year. Since 1995, the firms have given New Jersey
Republicans $517,000, including $196,000 from DeMarco between 1995
and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this says is, especially with the right political
connections, if you're rich and powerful you can violate the law
and not have any consequences,'' Tittel said.
</P>
<P>
   Page and DeMarco's attorney, Anthony Drollas, disputed those
allegations, saying the state crafted a fair settlement.

<HEADLINE> Report: EPA Security 'Ineffective'  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency's computer
systems are ''highly vulnerable to tampering, disruption and
misuse'' by both users within the agency and outside hackers,
congressional investigators said in a report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative arm, said previous precautions taken by the EPA to
protect its computer systems are ''riddled with security
weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Since February, the EPA has been conducting a security overhaul.
The GAO report addresses the problems that existed before February,
and investigators said that they have not yet begun to test the
effectiveness of the new security controls.
</P>
<P>
   During the GAO probe, investigators successfully breached the
EPA's firewall -- a software package that ensured that only
authorized communication passes between EPA computers and the rest
of the Internet -- and gained access to the EPA's network. They were
also able to guess many passwords used at the agency and used
commonly available password decryption software to break others,
obtaining high-level privileges on the agency's computer network.
</P>
<P>
   The report also detailed seven examples in 1998 and 1999 of how
computer hackers launched successful attacks against the agency. In
some attacks, intruders took control of some EPA computers, and in
others the EPA's computers were slowed by a coordinated ''denial of
service'' attack, such as occurred against several popular Web
sites earlier this year. In another incident, hackers used a
compromised EPA computer to chat with other hackers.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO also criticized the EPA's ability to detect network
attacks. In an attack in February 1999 against three EPA computers,
the agency wasn't aware of the intrusion until it was notified by
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce
Committee, accused the Clinton administration of failing to
coordinate information security efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The GAO report, coupled with the committee's other recent
oversight in this area, shows that, despite the tough rhetoric, the
Clinton-Gore administration's cyber-security policy amounts to
little more than paper-pushing,'' said Bliley, who requested the
audit.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO released preliminary findings critical of the EPA's
security policy in February, prompting Bliley's committee to
request that the agency increase its computer security.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter responding to the GAO report, Margaret N. Schneider,
deputy assistant administrator at the EPA, conceded the technical
problems found by the GAO and included a specific, long-term plan
for the agency's systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though we have made many enhancements in our program
since the first of the year,'' Schneider said, ''we recognize that
the agency must continue to improve our security procedures, to
hold the agency's senior managers accountable for overseeing these
procedures, and to upgrade our technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliley has also requested a GAO audit of security systems at the
Commerce Department and Food and Drug Administration.

<HEADLINE> Attorney General takes over investigation into racism at state beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Attorney General Richard Blumenthal on
Friday took over the state's investigation into allegations that
workers at Sherwood Island State Park in Westport harassed a group
of 200 black and Hispanic children visiting from Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Rocque, the commissioner of the Department of
Environmental Protection, requested the move after expressing
disappointment with a similar investigation done by the Department
of Administrative Services.
</P>
<P>
   The DAS report into the July 13 YMCA outing to the beach was
incomplete and did not include interviews with all those involved,
Rocque said.
</P>
<P>
   Camp counselors accused park staffers of hurling racial slurs at
the children, and forcing them to pick up other people's trash,
including dirty diapers, using their bare hands. The children said
their own belongings were tossed into the garbage when they left
them on the beach during a picnic at a nearby pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Rocque Friday, Blumenthal said his office would
conduct a whistleblower investigation into the incident, and would
ask the state Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities to
investigate whether park workers committed any violations of state
public accommodation laws.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal also said that based on the DAS report, the state
should ask for the resignation of the senior conservation officer
at the park. The lifeguards involved are no longer under the
authority of the DEP, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This state and its officials must assure all its citizens that
they are entitled to enjoy all the benefits of our society without
the taint of such unconscionable, illegal misconduct,'' Blumenthal
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   DEP officials have asked Blumenthal to draft a ''legally
defensible letter'' calling for the employee's resignation before
taking any action.

<HEADLINE> East Hartford police chief fired; mayor cites incompetence, insubordination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Mayor Timothy Larson fired Police
Chief James Shay on Friday, saying Shay mishandled the
investigation into the murder of Officer Brian Aselton as well as
numerous other assignments.
</P>
<P>
   In a 16-page letter to Shay, Larson accused Shay of being
incompetent and insubordinate. He wrote that the chief wrongly
influenced internal affairs investigations, failed to run the
department efficiently and lied to town officials on several
occasions
</P>
<P>
   After Aselton was killed while responding to a routine call in
January 1999, Larson said Shay called for the help of state police
detectives but made them wait at the station for 10 hours before
assigning them duties.
</P>
<P>
   Larson further accused Shay of failing to follow his own
directive in assigning the most experienced officer to handle the
department's internal review of the Aselton shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also cited 15 other incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''You lack veracity,'' Larson wrote. ''Your lack of veracity ...
erodes trust, credibility, morale and the reputation of the East
Hartford Police Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Shay nor his New Haven lawyer, John J. Kelly, could be
reached for comment Friday night. Shay has an unpublished home
telephone number and Kelly did not return a call left at his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Shay, a former state trooper who was hired as the East Hartford
chief nine years ago, has disputed Larson's allegations. He has
said Larson tried to pressure him into hiring Larson's friends and
tried to interfere with the operation of the police department.
</P>
<P>
   Shay has the right to call for a hearing before Larson. If just
cause for the firing is found, Shay can appeal to Superior Court
within 30 days of his termination.

<HEADLINE> NTSB releases evidence reports in EgyptAir crash  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Chilling details of a pilot's struggle to save
doomed EgyptAir Flight 990 were released Friday in voluminous
investigative documents that did little to settle a lingering
dispute over what caused the plane to crash, killing 217 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is this, did you shut the engines?'' asked Capt. Mahmoud
El-Habashy as he returned to the cockpit of the diving plane.
''Pull. Pull with me. Pull with me. Pull with me,'' he cried as he
fought to pull out of a dive during the plane's last moments before
it plunged into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Nantucket last
Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit voice transcript released Friday did not make it
clear if El-Habashy was trying to make sure the engines had been
powered back or wondered why that had been done.
</P>
<P>
   But Carl Vogt, a former National Transportation Safety Board
chairman now serving as a consultant to EgyptAir, said reducing
power is the correct action when a plane goes into an unexpected
dive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reducing power is an act to maintain controllability of an
aircraft,'' he said. ''It is evidence, in my mind as a pilot, that
this pilot was trying to control the airplane ... he was trying to
fly the airplane and maintain airspeed, not let it get excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   James Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, stressed in making the records public that the cause remains
under investigation. But he also noted that no public hearing will
be held by the board because its investigators ''believe there are
no unresolved safety issues that require such a forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall has testified before Congress that the movements of the
plane were ''consistent with a deliberate action on the part of one
of the crew members.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a suggestion that Egyptian authorities stoutly deny. They
did so again Friday, continuing to call for further study of radar
data and the plane's elevator, the device that controls up and down
movement of the craft's nose.
</P>
<P>
   ''Additional work remains to be done, particularly in the
assessing the design of the Boeing 767 elevator control system and
gaining additional radar information, before the cause of this
tragic accident can be finally determined,'' said Mohsen El
Missiry, the head of the Egyptian group assisting in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Much speculation as to the cause of the disaster has focused on
the co-pilot believed to be at the controls at the time, Gameel
El-Batouty. News leaks early in the investigation indicated that
when left alone in the cockpit he made some sort of statement,
followed by a prayer, before the plane went into a dive.
</P>
<P>
   The board doesn't make public the actual tape recordings from
cockpits, and El-Batouty's comment after el-Habashy left the
cockpit is not resolved by the transcript released Friday. That
transcript noted a dispute among the investigators over what was
said:
</P>
<P>
   ''The five Arabic speaking members of the group concur that they
do not recognize this as an Arabic word, words, or phrase. The
entire group agrees that three syllables are heard and the accent
is on the second syllable. Four Arabic speaking group members
believe that they heard words similar to 'control it.' One English
speaking member believes he heard a word similar to 'hydraulic.'
The five other members believe that the word(s) were
unintelligible.''
</P>
<P>
   What was made clear by the transcripts was el-Habashy surprise
to find his plane in a dive as he returned from a trip to the
lavatory, and his battle to right the craft.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's happening?'' asked el-Habasny. ''What's happening
Gamil? What's happening?''
</P>
<P>
   ''I rely on God,'' replies a second voice, believed to be that
of El-Batouty, then flying the plane. The co-pilot repeated the
phrase several times.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is this, did you shut the engines?'' asks el-Habasny, who
then struggles to pull his plane out of the dive. The transcript
did not show an immediate response from El-Batouty. About a minute
and a half later, the captain exhorted: ''Pull with me.'' And the
transcript ends there.
</P>
<P>
   The Flight Data Recorder shows that the plane's autopilot was
switched off and, just seconds before el-Habashy asked about the
engines, first the right, then the left engine lever was switched
from ''run'' to ''cutoff.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of the factual reports of the various teams of
investigators is a routine step in the lengthy process the NTSB
uses to investigate plane crashes. The reports contain no analysis.
That will be done as the investigators compare reports and seek
comments from the airline, aircraft manufacturer and other
interested groups as it moves toward a final report and conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Hall acknowledged there are continuing areas of friction between
the U.S. and Egyptian authorities. ''Where they have disagreements,
they have been allowed to submit them in writing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to seeking further investigation of possible
mechanical problems, El Missiry said the Egyptians were displeased
with speculation regarding the cause of the accident and with news
leaks about the reports. ''This is painful for the family,'' El
Missiry said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he has asked the FBI to investigate the source of the
leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The new reports compile the findings of investigators in such
areas as human performance, aircraft structure, power plants,
maintenance, air traffic control and so forth. It is possible that,
ultimately, the United States and Egypt will cite evidence to
support their separate theories as the investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   The docket also contained FBI reports indicating that El-Batouty
had been investigated by a New York hotel's security staff for a
number of incidents that allegedly included exposing himself. The
allegations were contained in FBI investigative reports into the
backgrounds of the plane's crew members.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the documents were included in the docket because the
agency's investigators felt they have ''potential'' relevance to
the rector of the Council on American Islamic Rwever, saying it
remains to be determined whether the alleged incident is relevant.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, El-Batouty's family angrily denounced the published
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are running out of things to say, so they are ruining the
guy's reputation,'' Walid El-Batouty, the co-pilot's nephew, told
The Associated Press. ''They are trying to raise anything to divert
people from the real reason (for the crash).''
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Hooper, communications director of the Council on
American Islamic Relations, commented that using a phrase like ''I
put my trust in God,'' is not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   El-Batouty ''repeats, 'I put my trust in God' many times and
this is not something that you would do if you've made the decision
to do some criminal act. This is something you would do if you are
trying to prevent something from happening or if you realized that
you're going to die and you're going to put your trust in God
because there is no way out of it and you think you're going to
die,'' Hooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Nihad Awad, executive director of the group, likened the phrase
to ''In God We Trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting the theory that the plane was deliberately crashed,
families of the crew members have filed suit against the plane's
manufacturer, Boeing.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Girardi Back in Lineup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- With his nose still swollen and a bandage on his
nose, Chicago Cubs catcher Joe Girardi was back in the lineup
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was good to be back out there. Each at-bat, I was more
comfortable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi took a fastball from Woody Williams square on the nose
Saturday when the Cubs played the San Diego Padres. The force of
the blow was so severe he fell to the ground and lay there for
several minutes, blood flowing from the cut on the left side of his
nose.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually walked to the clubhouse on his own power, holding
a towel to his nose, which was broken and needed three stitches to
close the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi took batting practice as usual, and said he didn't have
any fear when he was on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just felt a little rusty,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Agent: Witty Will Ride To Keep Spot  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speedskater Chris Witty will have to beat a challenger to keep
her spot on the Olympic cycling team for the Sydney Games, her
agent said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Bill Stapleton said Tammy Thomas of Yazoo City, Miss., who
was left off the three-member women's track team, is slated to race
Witty sometime between Aug. 18-20.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Petty, the cycling team's director of athlete performance,
said the showdown will take place at a sea-level track, probably in
Blaine, Minn., or Frisco, Texas. He said cycling officials will
decide on the venue Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be one ride each, just like it will be in Sydney,''
Petty said.
</P>
<P>
   Petty said the track in Frisco might be better suited because it
has better timing equipment and other racing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   He said Thomas took her appeal to an arbitration board, which
determined the race-off would be the best way to resolve the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Witty, of Park City, Utah, nor Thomas could be reached
for immediate comment. Witty was training with the U.S.
speedskating team in Calgary, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   Witty was slated to race in Sydney in the 500-meter time trial,
an event where she placed fourth at the 1998 world championships.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas placed third last year at nationals in the event.
</P>
<P>
   To choose the Olympic team this year, U.S. Cycling used a
subjective selection criteria that considered two years of
international racing performances.
</P>
<P>
   Petty has said the goal was to take the most experienced
top-level riders to Sydney. And Witty has been considered a
potential medalist on the bike.
</P>
<P>
   Witty won the silver medal in the 1,000 and the bronze in the
1,500 in the 1998 Nagano Olympics. She is trying to become the
fourth person to win medals in both the summer and winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   She was selected to the track cycling squad last month.
</P>
<P>
   With a medal in Sydney, Witty would become the second American --
and the first American woman -- to win a medal in both summer and
winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The first American was Eddie Eagan, a light heavyweight boxer
who won a gold medal in 1920 and also rode on the gold-medal
four-man bobsled team in 1932.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Peres Visit Norway  </HEADLINE>
By NILS MYKLEBOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- After a day of anticipation and delays,
Israel's elder statesman Shimon Peres and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat canceled plans to meet Friday in Norway but sounded
optimistic about the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The 71-year-old Arafat said he was hopeful about negotiations
with the Israelis but conceded that he has been unable to win
international backing for a unilateral proclamation of Palestinian
statehood in the event a peace treaty is not concluded by its Sept.
13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have received advice from many friends asking us to delay
the declaration of a Palestinian state such as we did before the
(Israeli) election campaign,'' he said as he emerged from almost
two hours of talks with top Norwegian officials.
</P>
<P>
   He did not comment further on his plans but said earlier in
Helsinki that it would be up the Palestinian central council to
decide on the proclamation, probably later this month or early next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry originally had planned a dinner for the two
Nobel laureates but later said Peres would meet Arafat at the
airport. Delays in Arafat's trip from Moscow to Helsinki and on to
Oslo, however, forced the cancellation of these plans and ministry
officials later said that the two men would not meet.
</P>
<P>
   Peres will stay in Oslo until Saturday afternoon and plans to
meet with government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat said he had informed Norwegian officials about last
month's summit with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at the U.S.
presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland, that collapsed over
the issue of Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sure we will continue to achieve the peace of the
brave,'' he said at a news conference.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks' Kitna Hopes to Play Ariz.  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Jake Plummer will be trying for another fast
start, and Jon Kitna will be just hoping to play when Seattle heads
into the Arizona heat to face the Cardinals on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren said Kitna's sore back had not
responded to treatment as well as had been hoped this week.
Seattle's starting quarterback will come to Arizona, but his
playing status is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he's going to putz around out there, I'm not going to let
him play,'' Holmgren said Friday. ''So I have to see some
noticeable improvement in another day.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kitna doesn't play, Glenn Foley will play the first half and
Brock Huard the second.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, meanwhile, hopes the offense can get off to the kind of
start it did in last week's 31-17 loss to Denver. Plummer was
3-for-3 and Michael Pittman had a 20-yard run as the Cardinals went
87 yards in four plays for a touchdown on their opening series.
</P>
<P>
   This from an offense that didn't score at all in the first
quarter last season.
</P>
<P>
   But the first team's night ended badly when Plummer's
interception was returned 45 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''We started fast last week and we want to continue that trend,
and not go through any lulls,'' Plummer said. ''The interception
was obviously no good and we had a period where there were some
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to eliminate those. We want to keep playing how we did
in that first series and then another couple series in the next
quarter and try to be explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams plan to use their first units the entire first half.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy won't make the trip as
he recovers from a bruised leg.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona defensive tackle Mark Smith, who ended his holdout and
reported last Friday, will play some with the first unit. Smith
played only two games last season because of a contract dispute and
a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was his first week of practice really in about two years,''
Arizona coach Vince Tobin said. ''It was really high tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith benefited from intense workouts the Cardinals had Tuesday
and Wednesday with the Chargers in La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was almost like playing ball games,'' Tobin said. ''He did
some good things, but there are some things he certainly is behind
on. He needs to continue to work on getting in football shape. And
there's only one way to get in football shape -- and that's by
playing football.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams feature rookie first-round draft picks at running
back, and the two had vastly different debuts last week.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Shaun Alexander, playing behind starter Ricky Watters,
scored touchdowns on a pair of 11-yard runs in a 28-16 victory over
Indianapolis. Alexander, the 19th pick overall, will play the
second and third quarters Saturday, Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jones, the No. 7 pick overall, had just 18 yards in eight
carries playing behind Pittman last week. He also fumbled the ball
away after his longest run, a 10-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals will throw a few more defensive looks at the
Seahawks than they did against the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll blitz and use the total package that we have,'' Tobin
have. ''We'll certainly have selected blitzes to use in certain
situations.''

<HEADLINE> Wizards Re-Sign Three Players  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jahidi White, Chris Whitney and Laron Profit
re-signed with the Washington Wizards, who were unable to lure
other teams' free agents because of salary cap problems.
</P>
<P>
   White, a center, was the only one of the Wizards' signings that
drew significant interest elsewhere. He averaged 7.1 points and 6.9
rebounds, blocked 83 shots and started the final 59 games of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, who backed up starting point guard Rod Strickland,
averaged 7.8 points and 3.8 assists. Profit, also a reserve, played
in 33 games in his rookie season, averaging 1.5 points.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney signed a three-year deal worth $8.2 million, according
to a source close to the negotiations, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the other deals were not disclosed, although the
Washington Post said Profit agreed to a two-year contract that
would could be worth more than $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards are well over the salary cap for the upcoming season
because of the big salaries of Strickland, Mitch Richmond and Juwan
Howard. Teams can exceed the cap when re-signing their own players.

<HEADLINE> Newton Advances to Amateur Final  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Marcy Newton ended Aree Wongluekiet's run
in the 100th U.S. Women's Amateur on Friday, beating the
14-year-old Thai star 1-up in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Newton, 22, of High Point, N.C., will face Laura Myerscough, 20,
of Charleston, Ill., on Saturday in the 36-hole final. Myerscough
beat 17-year-old Yvonne Choe of Temple City, Calif., 2 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   Newton made a 7-foot birdie putt on No. 17 to take a 1-up lead,
and matched Wongluekiet with a par on the 18th hole on the par-71
Waverley Country Club course.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew Aree was a great player, but coming in, I just tried to
play my game and not worry about her,'' said Newton, a recent
graduate of North Carolina who won the 1995 U.S. Girls title.
</P>
<P>
   At 14 years and nearly three months old, Wongluekiet surpassed
Roberta Albers as the youngest semifinalist in tournament history.
Albers was 14 years, 8 months when she lost in the 1961 semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''To play in you're first Amateur and finish as a semifinalist --
I'm quite happy. Top four is not bad,'' said Wongluekiet, the 1999
U.S. Girls champion and the low amateur this year in the LPGA's
Nabisco Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think about pressure. I'm just playing in a golf
tournament, just trying to focus on golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Wongluekiet evened the match with a 20-foot birdie putt on the
14th hole. Newton took the lead with a par on No. 15, but
Wongluekiet drew even again with a par on the 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Myerscough, who will be a junior at the University of Arizona
this fall, survived a bogey on the 16th hole to eliminate Choe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never let her get 1-up on me. I thought that was key to my
confidence,'' Myerscough said. ''I think the key was, I rolled in a
long put on 15. I was feeling good.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Readies for East Timor Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By HEATHER PATERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Peacekeepers in East Timor are bracing
for a new wave of attacks by anti-independence militias ahead of
the first anniversary of the territory's vote for freedom, a senior
U.N. commander said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns come as a U.N. peacekeeper was shot and killed
Thursday by a suspected militia group. It was the second
peacekeeper death in the last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There could well be some militias who have already infiltrated
... and who might be lying low to hit some pre-designated targets
on certain dates. But what those targets are we don't know,'' said
Maj. Gen. Mike Smith, the deputy chief of U.N. forces here.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said activity by armed militia groups crossing from
Indonesian West Timor into East Timor has increased in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, machete-wielding former militiamen trapped workers
inside the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees building in the
border town of Atambua for ''several tense hours'' before soldiers
intervened, U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
   The militias are the remnants of anti-independence forces that
rampaged across East Timor last year after an Aug. 30
U.N.-sponsored referendum resulted in the territory breaking away
from Indonesian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Most militia members fled to West Timor after international
troops arrived to restore order last September, and clashes between
the pro-Jakarta groups and peacekeepers have become more frequent
of late.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian military has been accused by the U.N. and human
rights groups of training and arming the militia groups. Recent
attacks have been carried out by gangs with automatic weapons and
grenades.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Nepalese Pvt. Devi Ram Jaishi, 25, became the
second U.N. peacekeeper to die in East Timor, caught in a firefight
about 18 miles from the border. He was pronounced dead on arrival
late Thursday at the military hospital in Dili, East Timor's
capital, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A second soldier was in stable condition after being shot in the
neck in a clash involving as many as 60 militiamen. Another
Nepalese soldier and a civilian were shot in the legs.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers were patrolling when the suspected militia
group fired on them.
</P>
<P>
   The head of East Timor's temporary U.N. administration, Sergio
Vieira de Mello, traveled to the southern city of Suai -- the
headquarters of the peacekeeping border operations -- to assess the
security situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The frequency and intensity of clashes with these militia
groups is increasing. That's a worrying sign. But we can contain
it. I'm certain,'' Vieira de Mello said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Credits Clinton, Gore  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Less than a month after the Camp David summit
broke down in failure, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Friday that the United States remains determined to help the
Israelis and Palestinians reach a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech outlining Clinton administration foreign policy
goals, Albright sought to answer those who question why the United
States has doggedly pursued Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States will be safer if the Middle East is stable
and secure,'' she said in remarks prepared for a gathering of civic
leaders in Albuquerque, N.M. ''The consequences of failure are not
predictable, but would entail grave risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks of talks between the Israelis, led by Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, and the Palestinians, headed by Yasser Arafat, broke
down over the two sides' claims to the holy city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We remain determined to do all we can to help Israelis and
Palestinians find the way to peace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright stopped in New Mexico on her way to the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Thursday with the London-based Arab newspaper
Al Hayat, Clinton said his post-Camp David message to the Arab
world is: ''There cannot be a winner and a loser in these
negotiations. We must have two winners.''
</P>
<P>
   In a transcript of the interview released by the White House on
Friday, Clinton said he believed a Mideast peace accord was within
reach and characterized the talks as ''revolutionary in their
detail.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They (the two sides) broke taboos and discussed issues
seriously, and not on the basis of mere rhetoric and slogans,''
Clinton said. ''I am ready to do my part.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Opposition Leading Election  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's long-governing party, stunned by
losing the presidency, is also trailing in a key gubernatorial
election, according to a poll published Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The poll in the newspaper Milenio showed opposition candidate
Pablo Salazar with a 56 percent to 43 percent lead in Chiapas state
over Sami David of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI,
in the first state election since Mexico's presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted by Maria de las Heras, whose polls before
the July 2 presidential race were among the few that closely
matched the final result. It has margin of error of 3.5 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the presidency for the first time in its 71 year
history, the PRI is putting a heavy effort into holding the
governorship of Chiapas -- long a PRI stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 20 election is seen as a test of how well the PRI can
survive in its unaccustomed role as an opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's task is complicated by the fact Salazar is backed by
an eight-party coalition that includes both its major opponents:
the conservative National Action Party of President-elect Vicente
Fox and the left-center Democratic Revolution Party.
</P>
<P>
   Three other recent polls also favored the opposition in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Chiapas is Mexico's poorest and most southern state. It has
suffered repeated armed clashes between pro- and anti-government
groups since the Zapatista National Liberation Army emerged there
in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign itself has been rough. PRI candidate David was hit
last month by a piece of metal thrown during a campaign rally.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers reported Friday that 14 Salazar backers were jailed
overnight in the Tojolabal Indian town of 20 de Noviembre for
violating the decision of a town meeting to unanimously support the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Such meetings to decide political, religious and other matters
are common among Indian groups in Chiapas.

<HEADLINE> Private Funeral for Alec Guinness  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Renowned actor Sir Alec Guinness, private and
self-effacing in life, was remembered Friday by his family and
close friends at a quiet funeral at his local church.
</P>
<P>
   The service at St. Lawrence's Roman Catholic Church, in
Petersfield, near Guinness's home 50 miles southwest of London, was
''very low key'' a family spokeswoman said. She added that at his
request there would be no memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness died Saturday at age 86 after a long illness. One of
Britain's finest stage and film actors, he won an Oscar for best
actor in the 1957 film ''Bridge On the River Kwai'' and a special
Oscar in 1980 for his entire film career.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness is survived by his wife of 62 years, Merula Salaman,
and son Matthew.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Cowboy Irvin Won't Be Charged  </HEADLINE>
By KELLIE B. GORMLY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Former Dallas Cowboys star Michael Irvin won't be
charged with marijuana possession following his arrest at an
apartment where police said they found drugs.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokeswoman Lori Bailey would not elaborate on the reasons
for the decision because the investigation, which involves other
people, is ongoing. Bailey left open the possibility that Irvin
could face other charges stemming from the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin was arrested Wednesday in a north Dallas apartment, where
authorities said they found less than 2 ounces of marijuana along
with ecstasy pills.
</P>
<P>
   A drug task force had a warrant for the apartment's tenant, who
was not there. Irvin and the tenant's sister were at the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, who retired last month and was hired for Fox Sports Net's
Sunday pregame show, insisted he was in the wrong place at the
wrong time and the drugs were not his.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Irvin is very excited about going forward with his
broadcasting career,'' his lawyer Howard Shapiro said. ''We're very
pleased that this ordeal is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents arrested Rhonda Adaham, the original person they
were seeking, on Thursday in a Dallas suburb. She was indicted on
federal drug trafficking charges in 1999 and had violated
conditions of her pretrial release, Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Adaham was part of a group accused of selling the heroin that
killed Mark Tuinei of the Dallas Cowboys last year, authorities
told The Dallas Morning News in Friday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Irvin pleaded no contest to felony cocaine possession
in exchange for four years of deferred probation, a $10,000 fine
and dismissal of misdemeanor marijuana possession charges.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL suspended Irvin for five games. He finished his deferred
probation on the charge just before he announced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin won three Super Bowls with the Cowboys.

<HEADLINE> Director of National Women's Hall of Fame announces departure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SENECA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - Mary Ann Oppenheimer has announced she
will resign as director of the National Women's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Hall of Fame's board of directors this week,
Oppenheimer said she is leaving after less than a year on the job
to follow her husband to Lyndonville, Vt. where he will become dean
of academic affairs at Lyndon State College. Michael Fishbein had
been dean of Cazenovia College.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer's last day will be Oct. 17. The position includes
general management duties, public relations and fund-raising for
the 31-year-old, not-for-profit education institution and museum.
Janet Reno, the nation's first female Attorney General, is among 19
women who will be inducted into the Hall of Fame in ceremonies on
Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   In 1848, suffragists met here to draw up a list of grievances
and remedies in a Declaration of Sentiments at a convention on
women's rights. It would be more than 70 years before women were
granted the right to vote but Seneca Falls earned the title
''Birthplace of Women's Rights.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Ends Minnesota Fraud Hearing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) -- The NCAA's Committee on Infractions
conducted a closed hearing Friday on allegations of academic fraud
in the men's basketball program at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's decision on possible NCAA sanctions is expected
in six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''As difficult as the past 17 months have been, we're looking
forward to the day when the committee announces its decision,''	   university
president Mark Yudof said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For many people here, and those who weren't here when the
infractions occurred, the most painful part of the process has been
the uncertainty. We are hopeful of a satisfactory resolution to
this hearing, and we are grateful that there will be closure.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the university's delegation did not include three
key figures in the case: former basketball coach Clem Haskins,
former academic counselor Alonzo Newby and former academic
counseling office manager Jan Gangelhoff. The NCAA offered them the
opportunity to speak but had no power to force them to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Yudof was expected to ask the committee to impose no additional
sanctions beyond those Minnesota already has imposed on itself. An
official statement from the university did not address that issue.
</P>
<P>
   During a morning break, Sandra Gardebring, the university's vice
president for institutional relations, said she thought the hearing
was going well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very cordial,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gardebring said the committee moved from opening statements to
discussions of the allegation at the heart of the probe: that
Gangelhoff had done course work for as many as 20 Gophers players.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing had been scheduled to last two days, but the
committee finished in one. In all, there were more than 20
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Yudof said he planned to wait until the NCAA
and federal grand jury investigations are complete before deciding
whether to try to retrieve the $1.5 million the university paid to
buy out Haskins' contract.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped Haskins' admission -- after repeated denials --
that he paid Gangelhoff $3,000 would show the committee how the
coach fooled university officials.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Musicians Give Concert at Home  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- As his gnarled hands pounded the keys of the
Russian-made concert piano in the Karl Marx theater, octogenarian
Ruben Gonzalez flashed a wide smile.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and the rest of the mostly elderly members of the Buena
Vista Social Club said they were delighted to be back home to share
their music with their compatriots after playing to sold-out
concerts in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''In your own land, one always feels better,'' said Gonzalez, a
smallish man with white cropped hair and a bright orange guayabera
shirt who gave his age as ''83, or 84.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I like going over there, but I like it more here,'' Gonzalez
added during the Thursday evening rehearsal for their first public
concert in Cuba on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   As the concert got under way Friday, concertgoers said they were
excited to see some of Cuba's most-heralded musicians perform.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're really great. We were never introduced to this
music,'' said David Cardenas, 33. ''I'm so glad they are now
bringing us the music of our parents and our grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   Caridad Arrozalena, 58, said she came to see the group because
she had remembered some of the singers and musicians when they
first performed 30 or 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have gained fame around the globe in recent years
for their music and the documentary ''Buena Vista Social Club,''
most of the musicians are virtually unknown in Cuba, where their
music has not been publicized and marketed.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-something-year-old Cuban musician Francisco Repilado, who
plays under the name ''Compay Segundo,'' is among the few
participants on the Buena Vista recordings well known here. But
Repilado has his own band and performs in Cuba occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   The Buena Vista group is made up of once nearly-forgotten
musicians who were discovered by American guitarist and producer Ry
Cooder in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The group's forte is the ''son'' -- traditional Afro-Cuban
orchestra music heavy in brass and percussion. They also play the
more romantic, Spanish-influenced bolero and the danzon -- dance
music with an urgent telegraph-like beat.
</P>
<P>
   The Buena Vista Social Club performed on the island twice last
year to small invitation-only audiences, group members say, but has
never held a concert for the general Cuban public. Tickets went on
sale earlier this week, at 50 cents for Cubans and $10 for
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The group's first album, ''Buena Vista Social Club,'' was an
instant international sensation when it was released in 1997. They
later released ''Buena Vista Social Club Presents Ibrahim Ferrer,''
''Introducing...Ruben Gonzalez,'' and the new ''Buena Vista Social
Club Presents Omara Portuondo,'' all on the World Circuit/Nonesuch
label.
</P>
<P>
   The albums have repeatedly appeared on Billboard's Top 10 lists
for world and Latin music. The latest, featuring female singer
Portuondo, appears this week on Billboard's Top 10 list for Latin
albums.
</P>
<P>
   The group's fame increased with its appearance in the concert
film of the same name. The movie by German filmmaker Wim Wenders
was nominated for an Oscar this year in the documentary category.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, ''Buena Vista Social Club'' remained on the list of
top video sales in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The group will continue its touring on Monday, when it leaves
for its first visit to Japan, said singer Ibrahim Ferrer, 73, one
of the group's top names, along with Gonzalez and Portuondo. Later
this year, the group will travel to South America for the first
time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I'm really happy now to be able to play in my own
country,'' Ferrer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our music is known all around the world, but we have been so
busy traveling we have not been able to perform in our own
country,'' added Portuondo as she sat in a theater seat listening
Thursday night to the keyboard gymnastics of Gonzalez, whom she
described as ''a true Cuban legend.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be our first concert here,'' she said, beaming up at
her fellow musicians on the stage. ''But it won't be our last.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT BENNING, Ga. (AP) -- Former World War II prisoners of war
honored their liberators with a memorial dedication Friday, 55
years after Army units freed 512 men from a prison camp in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were rescued Jan. 30, 1945, by members of the 6th
Ranger Battalion and the 6th Army Alamo Scouts. The Alamo Scouts
were a long-range surveillance unit that operated behind enemy
lines from 1943 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony at the Rangers training headquarters at Fort
Benning, Ga., the POWs dedicated a bronze plaque with the names of
143 men who participated in the operation, assisted by 284 Filipino
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The plaque will be installed on a granite memorial outside the
Ranger Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm satisfied, and I'll go to sleep tonight knowing that I've
finally honored these men,'' said John Cook, 79, a retired Army
medic from San Bruno, Calif., who spent 34 months as a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise assault killed 500 Japanese and two Rangers. None
of the prisoners was injured during the rescue and 30-mile trek to
U.S. lines.
</P>
<P>
   The liberation -- which took less than 30 minutes -- is still
recognized as an example of a virtually flawless special operation,
according to Fort Benning officials. One of the mission leaders,
Capt. Robert Prince, was inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame in
1999.

   LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Thomas A. Foran, the chief prosecutor
in the Chicago Seven case, died Sunday of cancer. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Foran was U.S. attorney in Chicago during the trial of the seven
Vietnam War protest leaders charged with conspiring to start a riot
during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Foran and his prosecuting team won convictions against five of
the accused protesters -- although not on the conspiracy charge.
</P>
<P>
   David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman and
Rennie Davis were convicted of crossing state lines with intent to
incite a riot. The two other defendants -- Lee Weiner and John R.
Froines -- were acquitted of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Julius J. Hoffman sentenced each of those
convicted to five years in prison and ordered their defense
attorney, William Kunstler, held in contempt of court. An appeals
court later threw out the convictions and rebuked Hoffman for his
conduct.
</P>

   Foran was U.S. attorney from 1968 to 1970 and successfully

<HEADLINE> Padres 3, Marlins 0  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Adam Eaton pitched eight strong innings, giving up
six hits in the longest outing of his career, as the San Diego
Padres beat the Florida Marlins 3-0 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton (4-2) struck out six and walked two en route to his fourth
career win in 14 starts. The victory was the Padres' 10th in their
last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins lost for just the second time in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, whose longest previous outing had been 7 2-3 innings on
June 17 against Cincinnati, gave up hits to two of the first three
batters he faced before retiring nine in a row and 12 of the next
13 Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and third and two outs in the eighth,
Eaton struck out Preston Wilson to end the inning and the Marlins'
best scoring threat of the night. Eaton struck Wilson out three
times, each time with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his 31st save in 37
chances.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Burnett (1-3) gave up four hits and all three runs. He left
after Eric Owens singled to led off the eighth. Owens scored four
batters later on Bret Boone's bases-loaded sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres took a 1-0 lead with an unearned run in the first
inning. Owens reached first on shortstop Andy Fox's error, then
moved to third on Mike Darr's single to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Darr stole second two pitches later, and Owens scored on catcher
Ramon Castro's errant throw to second.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego made it 2-0 in the fourth inning when Phil Nevin led
off with his 25th home run, breaking his career high for homers in
a season. Nevin, with his second homer in as many games, surpassed
his previous-best mark of 24 set last year.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Owens (elbow) and 1B Ryan Klesko (calf) returned to the
Padres' starting lineup after missing Thursday's game at
Philadelphia. They combined to go 1-for-8 in their return. ...
Florida's Luis Castillo snapped an 0-for-8 streak with a single
leading off the bottom of the first. ... Wilson increased his major
league-leading strikeout total to 146.

<HEADLINE> Four Americans to stand trial for Connecticut artist's slaying in British Virgin Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands (AP) - A judge ruled Friday
that four Americans will stand trial for the killing of a
Connecticut artist slain in the British Virgin Islands in January.
One is charged with killing her and three as accessories for
helping him hide it.
</P>
<P>
   Investment broker William Labrador, 36, of Southampton, New
York, is charged with killing Lois Livingston McMillen, 34, of
Middlebury, Connecticut. Law student Michael Spicer, 36, of
Albemarle County, Virginia, Evan George, 23, a construction worker
from Washington D.C., and book publisher Alexander Benedetto, 35 of
New York City, are charged as accessories after the fact. They all
deny involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Their trial starts in this British Caribbean territory in
October. Magistrate Gail Charles denied bail to the men, who have
been jail since their arrest Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the evidence they have is an admission supposedly made by
(Labrador) to a prison snitch,'' said Labrador's attorney, Ralph
Gonsalves. Gonsalves, who is from St. Vincent, said he has not
spoken to his client since the ruling but ''I understand his
spirits are good.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They were surprised at the ruling,'' said Oscar Ramjeet, the
attorney for Spicer and George. ''They felt the evidence was not
strong enough for them to stand trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Benedetto's attorney, Paul Dennis, could not immediately be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Charles' ruling, announced in a government statement, followed a
preliminary inquiry in which 15 witnesses including police officers
and a pathologist testified in June, July and August. The inquiry
was closed to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not present DNA evidence there because test
results from Britain did not arrive in time, said government
spokeswoman Sandra Ward. Police had seized a bloodstained shirt
that was worn by Spicer, clothing worn by the other men on the
night of McMillen's killing and three pairs of wet, sandy shoes.
</P>
<P>
   McMillen's body was found Jan. 15 along a shore on the island of
Tortola, with her rental car nearby. She had drowned but appeared
to have had a struggle, police said at the time. The men, who said
they had socialized with McMillen days before, denied seeing her on
the day she died.
</P>
<P>
   The artist had been staying in a villa owned by her family on
Tortola and had long known Spicer, who had a house nearby. George,
Labrador and Benedetto were Spicer's house guests.

<HEADLINE> Boy Convicted of Stabbing Friend  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A boy accused of stabbing his friend to
death during a sleepover was found guilty Friday of first-degree
murder and evidence tampering.
</P>
<P>
   Brookes Colby Shumway, who was 15 at the time of the slaying,
was tried as an adult and faces up to life in prison. It took the
jury two hours to find him guilty of stabbing 14-year-old
Christopher Ray 39 times with kitchen knives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Justice has been served,'' Ray's mother, Debra Robb, said
after the verdict was announced. ''And maybe my son can rest now.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Randall Lund had contended Shumway, who had a
cut on his hand, acted in self-defense after Ray attacked him with
a butcher knife the morning of Jan. 23. A teacher had testified
that Shumway was a calm, agreeable student and the slain boy was
''a hothead.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Katherine Bernards-Goodman said Shumway attacked Ray
as he slept on a couch after the boys played video games and that
he waited before waking Ray's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Before the trial, Shumway gave varying accounts of what happened
the night of the slaying, including the self-defense argument and a
statement that Ray fell on the knife. At one point he also claimed
the victim's mother took part in the stabbing.

<HEADLINE> White House Aide: Colombia Advances  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- A key White House official said
Friday that President Clinton's upcoming visit to Colombia shows
U.S. determination to be a ''reliable and dependable partner'' in
the fight against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The president's planned visit on Aug. 30 is the next logical
American move following passage last month of a $1.3 billion
anti-narcotics measure to support Colombia's war on drugs, said
White House special envoy for the Americas, Kenneth MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, who is here in advance of Clinton's visit to this
Caribbean coast port city, said Colombia's fight against drugs will
continue regardless of who wins November's U.S. presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a long term issue that passed with strong support from
both parties,'' MacKay said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have charged that the new aid package means
the United States is becoming too friendly with a military that has
often looked the other way while paramilitary groups kill leftist
guerrillas engaged in this Andean nation's 36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   But MacKay said the U.S. contribution comes on the condition the
Colombian military take strides to improve its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our belief that the Pastrana administration is making
the best effort approach to that and that more is being done than
ever has been in the past,'' MacKay said.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay said that a report analyzing, among other things,
Colombia's efforts to improve its human rights record will be
presented to the U.S. Congress in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay also addressed concerns expressed by some of Colombia's
neighbors that an escalated war on drugs here will force drug
producers to cross into their territories.
</P>
<P>
   But MacKay said that Plan Colombia includes anti-narcotics
provisions that will aid Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will meet with Pastrana and this country's top
anti-narcotics advisers before returning to Washington the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Washington feared Colombia's drug-financed leftists
guerrilla groups or paramilitary factions could have tried to use a
lengthy stay by Clinton to launch a terrorist attack and send a
signal at their anger over the new aid package.
</P>
<P>
   But MacKay said ''security here was not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, then-President George Bush touched down in Colombia for
a visit lasting a few hours.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Unveils Olympic Medal Design  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Sydney Olympics organizers unveiled
designs Saturday for the medals that will be awarded during the
Sept. 15-Oct. 1 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''The design underlines the Olympics in Sydney and through
Sydney, Australia, to people all over the world,'' designer
Wojciech Pietranik said. ''I think I will cry when the first medal
is awarded.''
</P>
<P>
   The front of the medals incorporates the traditional Olympic
symbols, including the representation of Nike -- the Greek goddess
of victory -- holding a laurel wreath, and a colosseum
</P>
<P>
   Adding an Australian flavor to the design on the front are some
sprigs of wattle, an Australian native plant.
</P>
<P>
   On the reverse side, Sydney's world-famous architectural icon,
the Opera House, is depicted symbolically amid the waves of the
Sydney Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic flame is represented opposite the Opera House and
below the five rings symbol of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a challenge to incorporate the traditional Olympic
symbols, which must feature on all Olympic medals, and the
Australian symbols, but I'm happy with the design,'' said
Pietranik, a designer with Australia's Royal Mint in Canberra, who
won a competition to design the medals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I treated the design more like a sculpture than a picture ...
I think the people who win the medals will remember where they
won.''
</P>
<P>
   All medals were produced at the Australian Mint in Canberra and
at the Perth Mint, in Western Australia, and all medals contain
silver.
</P>
<P>
   The gold medal comprises pure silver, plated in gold. According
to IOC guidelines, the medals for the winners contain at least six
grams of gold.
</P>
<P>
   The silver medals are pure silver and the bronze medals contain
elements of silver plus bronze, which was melted down from stocks
of Australia's disused one and two cent pieces.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Kansas City Royals are exchanging
30,000 George Brett commemorative key chains over concerns they
contain a lead core.
</P>
<P>
   The team said Friday the key chains were given away Aug. 7,
1999, during a promotion at Kauffman Stadium. The lead core was
discovered by the Colorado Department of Environmental Health when
it questioned the lead content of two similar key chains
distributed by the Colorado Rockies in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the Royals said the club believes the key
chains to be safe, but will exchange the items for other souvenirs
at the stadium gift shops or through the mail. Exchanges will be
accepted through Sept. 28, the final home game of the season.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 6, Pirates 1  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Armando Reynoso held Pittsburgh to a run over
seven innings and Jay Bell, slumping badly for two months, drove in
Arizona's first two runs in a 6-1 victory over the Pirates on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who played on three NL East championship teams during
eight seasons in Pittsburgh, was batting .218 since June 1 before
his RBI single in the fifth and run-scoring double in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez finished up Arizona's go-ahead, three-run seventh
inning with a two-run homer off Dan Serafini (1-1). It was the
Diamondbacks' first homer in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's 25th homer followed Tony Womack's two-out single and
Bell's double in an inning that would have been bigger if rookie
Jason Conti hadn't been thrown out at the plate by center fielder
Adrian Brown trying to score on Womack's single.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks failed to homer in the final three games of a
4-5 homestand that ended with two losses to Montreal, including a
4-3 loss Wednesday when Geraldo Guzman -- making his first career
relief appearance -- couldn't preserve a late-inning lead for Randy
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   That loss dropped the Diamondbacks three games behind San
Francisco in the NL West, their largest deficit in more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso (9-7) gave them another well-pitched game, limiting the
Pirates to four singles over seven innings to halt a personal
four-game road losing streak. He didn't allow a hit until Aramis
Ramirez's infield single leading off the fifth, which led to Alex
Ramirez's RBI single, and struck out three and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Swindell pitched the eighth and Byung-Hyun Kim, just back
from Triple-A Tucson, finished up the combined four-hitter in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates failed to homer for the fifth consecutive game while
losing their third in a row and eighth in 10 games. They are a
season-low 18 games under .500 at 48-66 and have a much better
chance of losing 90 games than winning 90, as owner Kevin McClatchy
suggested before the season.
</P>
<P>
   Serafini, a former Cubs reliever and Twins first-round draft
pick, gave up seven hits and four runs and walked four in 6 2-3
innings in his second Pirates start.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Colbrunn and Danny Bautista added run-scoring singles in
the ninth off Jeff Wallace, just back from a stay at Triple-A
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Pirates are 10-18 since the All-Star break. ... Womack
stole third base ahead of Bell's double, his 32nd steal and sixth
in seven games. ... Arizona OF Steve Finley sat out a second
successive game after receiving an injection Wednesday for a sore
lower back. ... Some Diamondbacks players and staff attended the
Panthers-Steelers preseason game Thursday night. ... Reynoso had
lost his two most recent starts against Pittsburgh. His only career
complete game was against the Pirates in 1993. ... Arizona is 7-1
in Three Rivers Stadium since joining the NL in 1998. ... Conti, a
former Pitt player from suburban Pittsburgh, left tickets for 43
family members and friends. ... Pirates RF Alex Ramirez, who
dropped an apparent game-ending fly ball in the ninth inning
Wednesday to give Colorado a gift 4-3 victory, also misplayed
Bautista's single for another ninth-inning error.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Halts US Beef Exports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Fresh and frozen Argentine beef
exports to the United States have been suspended temporarily over
concerns of possible foot-and-mouth disease contamination,
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The self-imposed suspension by Argentina, the world's
fourth-largest beef exporter, was taken as a preventive measure
after cattle bred near the Paraguayan border were believed to be
infected with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine Agriculture Secretary Antonio Berhongaray said the
decision to halt exports of fresh, chilled, and frozen beef would
not affect Argentina's status as a country free of the disease, a
designation bestowed more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with local news agency Diarios y Noticias, Berhongaray
said ''no country had modified its sanitary status'' for Argentine
beef and emphasized the move was only precautionary. He did not say
when exports might resume.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials in the U.S. Department of Agriculture
said they did not expect Argentina's would be a long-lasting
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We prefer to think of it as a temporary hold on imports until
we can get the situation clarified,'' said Anna Cherry, a
spokeswoman in the department's animal and plant health inspection
service.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes after Argentina ordered some 3,000 grass-fed
cattle destroyed earlier this week. Some cattle bred in grasslands
close to the northern border with Paraguay had tested positive for
the virus that causes foot-and-mouth, a disease that usually causes
cattle to stop eating and die.
</P>
<P>
   Under trade agreements, Argentina is allowed to export 20,000
tons of beef to the United States each year. Senasa President Oscar
Bruni is expected to travel to Washington in the coming days to
meet with agriculture officials there.

<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Larry Walker hit his fourth career grand slam
and Brian Bohanon homered and pitched seven strong innings to lead
the Colorado Rockies over the Montreal Expos 10-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton went 2-for-2, including a two-run, first-inning
double off Dustin Hermanson (8-10), to raise his major
league-leading average .387.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who has 98 RBIs, also walked three times. He is hitting
.541 (20-for-37) in August with six doubles, two home runs and nine
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon (6-8), who allowed nine hits and one run, hit his second
career homer with two outs in the fourth and added an RBI double in
the sixth. He was hitting .080 (2-for-25) with one RBI coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who played for Montreal from 1989-94, homered later in
the inning off Scott Forster for his third slam with the Rockies,
his first since May 29, 1998.

   Colorado won for just the 20th time in 68 road games.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson lost his third straight decision, allowing eight runs
and nine hits in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   After Colorado took a 2-0 lead on Helton's double in the first,
Montreal cut the lead in half on Lee Stevens' RBI single in the
third. Vladimir Guerrero took too wide a turn around second on
Walker's throw home, and Jose Vidro was thrown out at the plate,
ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson struck out Todd Walker and Brent Mayne in the fourth
before Bohanon launched a high drive that just cleared the left
field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Run-scoring doubles by Todd Walker and Bohanon made it 5-1 in
the six-run sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vidro had a run-scoring single in Montreal's two-run ninth
off John Wasdin. Vidro's 71 RBIs are the most by an Expos second
baseman, one more than Mike Lansing had in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bohanon also homered off Milwaukee's Bill Pulsipher last
Sept. 10. ... Mike DeJean pitched a scoreless inning Thursday night
in his first rehab start for Triple-A Colorado Springs. DeJean, who
has been on the 15-day disabled list since July 25 with a strained
left oblique muscle, allowed two hits. ... RHP Kevin Jarvis will
begin his rehab assignment with Colorado Springs on Saturday. ...
Montreal's Michael Barrett made his first start as catcher since
last Oct. 2. ... Tim Raines, who will be inducted into the Expos'
hall of fame along with Jim Fanning prior to Saturday night's game,
was in uniform prior to the game and took batting practice. ...
Montreal's Fernando Seguignol struck out in each of his four
at-bats.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Cops Away From Activists  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge ordered police Friday to stay
out of the headquarters of protesters gearing up for the Democratic
National Convention unless they have a search warrant or urgent
circumstances exist.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson said that although he found
police have been violating activists' rights, he understood their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''This city has had a history of unfortunate riots,'' he said.
''I can understand that the Los Angeles Police Department, on a hot
summer day, wants to protect the people. ... I can understand in
the context of the pressure cooker, tensions run high and some
officers acted inappropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in response to a request by the American Civil
Liberties Union, which contended that the activists' headquarters
was the subject of unconstitutional harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU attorney Carol Sobel told Pregerson that the headquarters,
known as the Convergence Center, has been hit with helicopter
spotlights up to 50 times a night, and that fire officials --
accompanied by police -- have inspected the building several times.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's meant to have an intimidating effect,'' Sobel said.
''It's part of the chill.''
</P>
<P>
   Pregerson's order was the latest constraint placed on Los
Angeles police in advance of next week's convention. The department
earlier was ordered to shrink a security zone around the Staples
Center convention site to allow demonstrators to be nearer to the
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Pregerson said the injunction would order that there be no more
efforts to enter the center without search warrants. But he added,
''I'm not precluding you from doing what you need to do in exigent
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Cmdr. David Kalish said he was ''quite pleased'' with the
ruling, adding that it ''validated our right to conduct criminal
investigations anywhere in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, anarchists gathered for the start of a three-day
conference as Mayor Richard Riordan and other officials painted a
glowing portrait of the city.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 1,000 people were expected for the conference, with
seminars on everything from welfare reform to first-aid training.
Hoping to distance the movement from potential unrest, conference
organizers urged people to avoid discussing protest plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want any possible excuse for shutting us down,''
activist Brendan Crill told conference-goers. ''There probably are
police infiltrators around.''
</P>
<P>
   Anarchists said they believe police and city officials have
targeted their anti-authoritarian movement as the scapegoat if
violent protests break out.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Riordan and others sang the city's praises before
convention volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still proud of where L.A. is,'' he said. ''We are the
capital city of the millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Riordan dismissed rumors that homeless people
would be removed from downtown streets during the convention. That
would be both inhumane and ''stupid politically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Friday:
</P>
<P>
   --Three protesters arrested as they put up a banner across from
the Staples Center on Monday filed a civil rights lawsuit against
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Barbara Hadsell said police cut ropes to the banner,
endangering two protesters who were rappelling down the hotel to
attach the sign. The suit also alleges all three plaintiffs were
denied access to an attorney and were booked for investigation of
felony conspiracy in an effort to deter other protests.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office declined to pursue felony
charges, but the three still face misdemeanor trespassing counts.
</P>
<P>
   --The National Lawyers Guild and the Working People's Law Center
announced that a group of 250 lawyers and legal observers will be
on the streets to ensure demonstrators' rights are respected.
</P>
<P>
   --House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and Rep. Patrick
Kennedy, D-R.I., appeared at a labor rally, with Gephardt telling
workers their votes are critical in a tight race for control of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1998, with impeachment looming, we picked up five seats and
labor accounted for 23 percent of the vote,'' Gephardt said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Make Gov't User-Friendly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- To make the federal government more
user-friendly to Americans who don't speak English, President
Clinton on Friday directed federal agencies to break down language
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's executive order aims to make it easier for
non-English- speaking citizens to gain access to federal programs
and services. Failing to do so can lead to unequal access to
federal financial assistance based on national origin, Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Breaking down these barriers will allow individuals with
limited English proficiency to more fully participate in American
society,'' the president said in a statement issued in Los Angeles,
where he traveled to attend the Democratic National Convention,
which begins on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department on Friday issued guidelines to ensure
that what the agencies make available to English-speaking people
also is provided to those who have limited English proficiency.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Predicts 1 M for Youth Day  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- A few lucky ones from as far as Tahiti will
stay in Pope John Paul II's summer villa and many others will sleep
under the stars as least 1.2 million young people come to Rome next
week for several days in prayer and reflection.
</P>
<P>
   Key event of the Catholic church's World Youth Day is a vigil
service under the stars Aug. 19 on the sprawling grounds of a
university campus on the outskirts of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   At least 1.2 million participants, ''perhaps even 1.5 million,''
will be in Rome by vigil time, predicted Monsignor Cesare Nosiglia,
who is helping to organize the events.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15 young men and women were chosen by organizers to stay at
the pope's summer residence in Castel Gandolfo, the cool hills
outside Rome. Their homelands include Tahiti, Congo, Sri Lanka,
Canada and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Those participants might dine on fare prepared by the pope's
staff of Polish nuns. But to satisfy the army of appetites of the
rest of the participants, 350 mobile restaurants will be parked
throughout the Italian capital, dishing out Italian fare.
</P>
<P>
   Many Romans are opening up their homes to young people.
</P>
<P>
   Participants who could afford it were asked to contribute about
$110 for meals and other expenses of a week's stay.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal James F. Stafford, who led the Denver diocese when that
U.S. city hosted Catholic Youth day events in 1993, said many
dioceses in the United States helped raised funds for those who
otherwise wouldn't have been able to come to Rome this year.
</P>
<P>
   The frail, 80-year-old pope often finds extra energy when his
audience is young.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul began the youth day tradition in 1985, and then took
the event around the world. It has also been held in Argentina,
Spain, Poland, the Philippines and France.
</P>
<P>
   Young people see John Paul as ''a father figure ... who is able
to give answers to natural longings of young people'' for something
that goes beyond what they find in school or in society at large,
Stafford said.
</P>
<P>
   For the pontiff, young people are key to his mission to shore up
the Catholic church in the 21st century amid distractions from
consumerism and competition from evangelical and other religious
sects.
</P>
<P>
   The pope will spend hours with the young participants on Tuesday
evening in St. Peter's Square, at the Saturday night vigil and at a
closing Mass on the campus Aug. 20.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 6, Devil Rays 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Magglio Ordonez had three RBIs,
including a go-ahead sacrifice fly, as the Chicago White Sox
rallied from a five-run deficit to beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
6-5 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez hit a two-run single in the fifth inning to tie the game
and gave Chicago the lead with his 11th sacrifice fly of the season
in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, who have an AL-best 69-46 record, are 14-14 since
the All-Star break. Tampa Bay lost for just the second time in
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Buehrle (2-1) got the final out in the sixth inning for the
win. Keith Foulke got two outs for his 20th save in 24 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays, assisted by four walks, took a 5-0 lead in the
second inning. With one out, Jim Parque walked the bottom third of
lineup: Russ Johnson, Steve Cox and Felix Martinez. Gerald Williams
then knocked in a pair with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Cairo walked to reload the bases. After Greg Vaughn
struck out, Fred McGriff cleared the bases with an opposite-field
single off the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff is 7-for-9 with 18 RBIs this season in bases loaded
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Parque, who threw just 40 of 91 pitches for strikes, lasted 3
2-3 innings. He allowed five runs, three hits, seven walks and hit
a batter.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox got two runs back in the third on RBI doubles by
Charles Johnson and Jose Valentin. Paul Konerko's solo homer got
Chicago within 5-3 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay loaded the bases -- on two walks and a hit batter --
with two outs in the fourth, but left fielder Carlos Lee made a
running catch on John Flaherty's liner. Ordonez's two-run single,
which deflected off the glove off a leaping Cairo at second, tied
the game at 5 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Ryan Rupe gave up five runs and seven hits in five
innings. Paul Wilson (0-1), who allowed Ordonez's sac fly, gave up
one run and one hit over three innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: A mild case of shingles will keep Hall of Famer Ted
Williams from taking part in Saturday's Salute to the 100th Season
of American League Baseball. ... Chicago DH Frank Thomas was
intentionally walked twice and leads the AL with 16. ... Former
pitchers Ken Kravec and Ken Frailing, who both played for the
Chicago White Sox and Cubs, threw out ceremonial first pitches. ...
The White Sox started a stretch of 13 games against Tampa Bay and
Baltimore. Both started the day 13-games under .500. ... Devil Rays

<HEADLINE> Mets 4, Giants 1  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS WASZAK Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Piazza and Edgardo Alfonzo each hit two-run
homers to lead the New York Mets to a 4-1 victory over the San
Francisco Giants on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Glendon Rusch (8-9) pitched five innings and got out of two
early bases-loaded jams to stop the NL West-leading Giants'
four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez pitched the ninth for his 28th save in 32
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In their only previous meetings this season, the Giants swept
four in a row from the Mets in a testy series at Pacific Bell Park.
The start of this game was delayed by rain for 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza gave the Mets a 2-0 lead in the fourth with his 31st home
run.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton led off with a double and went to third one out
later on Alfonzo's long fly to right field. Piazza, 1-for-4, then
turned on a 1-0 fastball from Mark Gardner (7-6) and sent it over
the picnic area in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Burks made it 2-1 with an RBI single in the fifth. Calvin
Murray led off with a single and moved to third on groundouts by
Russ Davis and Barry Bonds. Jeff Kent walked and Burks singled to
right to drive in Murray. Rusch got Rich Aurilia to groundout to
third to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton led off the sixth with a single. After Bell struck out
looking for the second time, Alfonzo followed with a two-run homer
over the picnic area in left -- in almost the exact spot Piazza hit
his -- to make it 4-1 and finish Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had a chance to get to Rusch early, but left the
bases loaded in the second and third innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kent opened the second with a double, and two outs later,
Rusch walked J.T. Snow and Doug Mirabelli. But Gardner hit a line
drive right at center fielder Jay Payton to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Davis hit a one-out single. After Bonds was called
out on strikes, Kent walked. Burks followed with a grounder down
the third-base line that Robin Ventura fielded.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura took a swipe with his glove at Davis, who was running to
third, but third-base umpire Scott Higgins ruled Ventura missed the
tag to load the bases. Replays showed Ventura's glove did miss
Davis, and the play was ruled a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine came out of the dugout briefly to
discuss the call, and Rusch got out of the jam as Aurilia was
called out on strikes.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The homers hit by Piazza and Alfonzo were both estimated at
411 feet. ... Rusch, who walked just 11 in his previous 56 2-3
innings, walked four in five innings. He allowed one run, five hits
and struck out five. ... Friday night marked the beginning of an
eight-game homestand for the Mets, who are 38-18 at Shea Stadium
this season -- one win behind San Francisco and Arizona for most NL
home victories.

<HEADLINE> 2 Found Dead in Navy Crash Search  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN K. STACK
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) -- A frantic, two-day search for
survivors of a Navy helicopter crash ended Friday when divers found
the bodies of two missing airmen among the helicopter's wreckage in
the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Four other airmen -- two dead and two injured -- were pulled from
the water Thursday after the helicopter crashed during a training
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a very difficult situation,'' said Cmdr. Bob
Riehl, commanding officer of the HM-15 mine countermeasures
squadron based at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi. ''It was very
important to us to bring those last crew members back, and even
more important to their families.''
</P>
<P>
   The MH-53E helicopter, also known as a Sea Dragon, was hovering
about 17 miles off shore on a minesweeping training mission
Thursday morning when it reported a mechanical malfunction and then
plummeted into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Floating wreckage was spotted 15 minutes after the distress
call, and the two survivors were found floating in a life raft
about 15 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Petty officers Jeremy J. Yaklin, 19, of Lapeer, Mich. and Shawn
R. Palyo, 20, of Stratford, Conn., were hospitalized in stable
condition Friday, said Lt. j.g. Chuck Bell with Naval Air Station
Corpus Christi. Yaklin suffered a broken pelvis and Palyo had cuts
to his face and upper body.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy identified the dead crew members as the pilot, Lt.
Shawn O. Jacobs, 30, of Jefferson City, Mo.; co-pilot Lt. Edward R.
Fassnacht, 31, of Akron, Ohio; and petty officers Jeffrey S.
Paschal, 40, of Phoenix, and David E. Rutherford, 27, of Masontown,
Pa. Fassnacht's and Rutherford's bodies were found Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy is putting together an investigation team, and
officials have closed about five miles of beaches as they continue
to recover debris from the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter's tail, main fuselage, engines and fuel tanks
were found by sonar equipment within a 200-square-foot patch of
sand about 55 feet below the surface, said Navy Cmdr. Barry
Coceano.
</P>
<P>
   The sunken craft will stay on the Gulf floor until investigators
inspect its position, Riehl said. He said an investigation team
could take months to determine the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unknown cause, none of the squadron's helicopters
has been grounded and flights will resume Monday, Riehl said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to continue to be confident in what we do and the
aircraft we fly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Six members of the same squadron, HM-15, were killed in the
Persian Gulf in 1991 when their Sea Dragon helicopter crashed after
take off.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Dragon is manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. in
Stratford, Conn. Besides mine-countermeasures, it can be used to
tow vessels or transport up to 55 passengers or cargo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very successful mine counter-measures helicopter,''
said company spokesman Bill Tuttle. He estimated the Navy has a
fleet of more than 40 MH-53Es.

<HEADLINE> Musician Daughter Death Said Plot  </HEADLINE>
By RON HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, Calif. (AP) -- The daughter of blues guitarist Elvin
Bishop may have been involved in a botched extortion plot that led
to her savage death and the slayings of four others, including her
mother, police say.
</P>
<P>
   Two brothers and their female roommate have been arrested on
drug possession and burglary charges, and police consider them
''potential suspects'' in the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Before her death, Selina Bishop, 22, may have joined the
suspects in a plot to extort $100,000 from two other victims, an
elderly couple, Concord police Lt. Paul Crain said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why and when Selina became a victim is unclear,'' said Sgt.
Douglas Pittman of the Marin County Sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento County coroner on Friday announced that the three
dismembered bodies found in gym bags in a river had been identified
as Bishop and Ivan and Annette Stineman, an elderly couple from
Concord.
</P>
<P>
   Police also recovered what may be Bishop's diary and are trying
to determine whether it is authentic, Crain said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Helzer, 30, who had dated Bishop, his brother Justin
Helzer, 28, and Dawn Godman, 26, were arrested Monday in their
Concord home and are being held on drug possession and burglary
charges. No one has been charged in the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know my two sons are totally innocent. They're innocent,''
their mother, Carma Helzer, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the crimes began around July 30, when the Stinemans
were last seen.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop -- or someone posing as her -- called a bank before two of
the Stinemans' checks, written to Bishop's name, were cashed last
week, Crain said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear who fell victim next. One police theory is that
Bishop fled in fear and was killed to cover up the Stineman's
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after Bishop was last seen with Glenn Helzer in a
Berkeley pub, her mother, Jennifer Villarin, 45, and friend Joseph
Gamble, 54, were shot dead in Bishop's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Police say a growing amount of evidence links the five deaths:
</P>
<P>
   -- Glenn Helzer, Bishop's boyfriend, once worked as a stockbroker
for the Stinemans, and either Bishop or someone posing as her
called a bank to negotiate $100,000 in checks drawn from the
Stinemans' account.
</P>
<P>
   -- Palm prints tie Justin Helzer and Godman to the Stineman's
van, which was found with a chain saw in the back.
</P>
<P>
   -- Stains believed to be human blood were found in their home,
The Contra Costa Times reported Friday. Investigators were
conducting forensic tests to determine the origin of the blood.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bishop set up one or more bank accounts in the area for Glenn
Helzer and deposited at least $25,000 in them, The San Francisco
Chronicle reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Elvin Bishop, best known for his 1976 pop hit ''Fooled Around
and Fell in Love,'' was devastated by his ex-wife's death and
daughter's disappearance, his record label said. He has not
commented on the case.
</P>
<P>
   A waitress at the cafe where Selina Bishop had worked and who
has known her for years told The Associated Press on Friday that
the young woman became infatuated with Helzer after they met at a
rave party around Easter -- but that it was a one-sided
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had no feelings for her,'' said the waitress, who said she
was too fearful to be identified. ''He just really had her
confused, because he was deceiving her. She couldn't accept that
because she had fallen for him.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the waitress, Helzer told Bishop he would inherit
between $100,000 and $125,000, and that she should open four or
five accounts to deposit the money where his wife wouldn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to published reports that the suspects and Bishop were
involved in the ''goth'' movement, Crain said investigators have
found no evidence of any occult role in the slayings.

	   HOLLEY, N.Y. (AP) - A village police officer was charged Friday
with endangering the welfare of three teen-age boys.
</P>
<P>
   Holley Police Chief Michael Grattan said Ronald Rowcliff is
accused of ''inappropriate behavior'' with two 16-year-olds and a
15-year-old. The teen-agers are members of the village Fire
Department's Explorer Program. Rowcliff is a member of the Fire
Department.

been suspended without pay for 30 days. Orders of protection have
been issued for the three boys.
</P>

<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Chipper Jones, battling the worst slump of his
career, hit a go-ahead double in a five-run eighth inning Friday
night as the Atlanta Braves rallied past the Los Angeles Dodgers
7-2.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga, who missed Atlanta's previous three games
because of soreness in his left thumb, added a two-run,
pinch-double in the big inning.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff's seventh-inning homer, his first for Atlanta, tied
the score at 2 against Chan Ho Park. Surhoff, acquired from
Baltimore on July 31, was 3-for-4 and has seven hits in his last 11
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones opened the eighth with a single off Terry Adams
(4-4) and scored on the double into the left-center field by
Chipper Jones, in a 1-for-27 slump before the hit. It was his first
RBI since Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Joyner's RBI single made it 4-2, Javy Lopez hit a
run-scoring grounder and Gregg Olson relieved. Galarraga, batting
for Mike Remlinger (4-2), doubled to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger pitched a hitless eighth, helping send Los Angeles to
its fifth loss in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Braves starter Kevin Millwood allowed two runs and five hits in
seven innings, striking out Gary Sheffield three times. Sheffield
also struck out in the ninth against John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Park gave up two runs and seven hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles took a 2-0 lead in the fifth when Eric Karros
doubled and scored on a single by Chad Kreuter, who scored on a
two-out double by Park.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, coming off a 4-5 road trip, got a run in the fifth when
Surhoff singled, Lopez walked and Keith Lockhart hit an RBI single.
Notes: Brian Jordan, who sat out Wednesday's game at Cincinnati
with a strained left groin, was in the starting lineup as was
Lopez, who missed Wednesday's game because of a sore left knee. ...
Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone, who fainted during Tuesday
night's game and spent the night in a Cincinnati hospital, had
additional tests Friday at Atlanta's Piedmont Hospital.
''Everything came back OK. I'm fine.'' ... The Dodgers signed their
12th-round draft pick, Travis Ezi, an outfielder from Southwestern
High in Baltimore. ... Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw, who struggled in
the first half, has converted all six save chances and has pitched
12 scoreless innings since coming off the DL July 13.

<HEADLINE> Clemens OKs $30.9 Mil. Yanks Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Roger Clemens and the New York Yankees
agreed to a $30.9 million, three-year contract extension Friday,
announcing a deal that had been rumored ever since he joined the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, 38, had been eligible for free agency after this
season. Now, the five-time Cy Young winner can remain in pinstripes
through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to know I have the opportunity to continue with a
great club,'' Clemens said before the Yankees played at Anaheim.
''My hopes were to have a chance to finish here, compete for
another championship and shoot for 300 games in this uniform -- the
whole nine yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''And at this point, it looks like the final stop. I'll have a
chance to pitch until I'm 40, which I never thought I'd have the
opportunity to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is unbeaten is nine starts since June 9, going 5-0 with
four no-decisions. He was the AL pitcher of the month for July.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is 9-6 and his 3.73 ERA is fourth-best in the league.
His 128 strikeouts tie him for seventh in the AL with David Wells --
Clemens was traded from Toronto to the Yankees in a package for
Wells before the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Roger right now is pitching like the Roger who won all the Cy
Young awards,'' manager Joe Torre said. ''He's going after people,
he's challenging people, he's intimidating people, and he's
throwing very hard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I mean, obviously, he doesn't throw as hard as he did 10 years
ago, but he is still a very high-quality pitcher. I'm pleased about
the contract. It's going to make him feel good. And if he feels
good, he's going to help our club.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has a $6.35 million salary this season, the option year
of a contract he signed with Toronto before 1997. That was part of
his previous deal that is paying him a total of $31.1 million over
four years.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens gets a $5 million signing bonus -- $2.5 million payable
next year and $2.5 million in 2002 -- plus yearly salaries of $7.8
million in 2001, $7.8 million in 2002 and $10.3 million in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander has the option of opting out of the third year,
in which case he would become eligible for free agency. But even if
he chooses to opt out, he would be paid the $10.3 million, in which
case he will have averaged $15.45 million for the first two years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Yankees have a $7.2 million option for 2004
with no buyout. There are no bonuses, and Clemens does not have any
provisions that allow him to block a trade.
</P>
<P>
   The average salary of $10.3 million becomes the sixth-highest
among pitchers, trailing Kevin Brown of Los Angeles ($15 million),
Randy Johnson of Arizona ($13.1 million), Pedro Martinez of Boston
($12.5 million), Yankees teammate David Cone ($12 million) and Greg
Maddux of Atlanta ($11.5 million).
</P>
<P>
   The two-time World Series champion Yankees have a record payroll
of $112.5 million this season. They currently lead the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens learned about his contract extension in a phone call
from his mother. He told her to rest up for October and another
trip to the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season with the Yankees, Clemens was the winning
pitcher as New York finished off its second straight World Series
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I want to win and I want to pitch well,'' he said.
''I don't want to say that there aren't any more challenges. I'm
not complacent, and I'll never be complacent in anything I do. If I
do get complacent, then I'll know it's time to go ahead and shut it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven-time All-Star is 256-140 lifetime with a 3.06 ERA. He
began his career with Boston in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is eighth in the career strikeout list with 3,444, just
65 behind Walter Johnson, and has won six ERA titles -- second only
to Lefty Grove's nine. He also won an AL MVP award in 1986 and has
struck out 20 batters -- tied for the major league record -- on two
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ''He takes such good care of himself. If you follow him around
during the course of the day, you'll get tired just watching him,''
Torre said. ''So if he doesn't break down, he's so competitive that
I think you're going to get your money's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have already begun talking to recently acquired
pitcher Denny Neagle about a contract extension. He's eligible for
free agency after this season.
</P>
<P>
   New York is also said to have an understand -- much like it did
with Clemens -- with second baseman Chuck Knoblauch. His contract
runs through 2001, and the extension is thought to be worth $18
million for two years.

<HEADLINE> Astros 7, Phillies 2  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Lance Berkman had four RBIs, including a
three-run double in a five-run ninth inning, as the Houston Astros
beat the Philadelphia Phillies 7-2 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Houston scored once in the eighth and five times in the ninth to
win the battle between the teams with the two worst records in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Valdes (3-4) pitched two shutout innings. He struck out
one, walked one and didn't allow a hit. Octavio Dotel pitched a
scoreless ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell was hit by pitch with the bases loaded to give
Houston a 3-2 lead with no outs in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Daryle Ward led off the inning with a single off Vincente
Padilla, and was removed for pinch-runner Glen Barker. After Julio
Lugo beat out an infield single, Tim Bogar reached safely on an
error by Padilla to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell was hit on the left shoulder on a 3-2 pitch to force in
Barker, and Padilla left the game with cramping in his left side.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gomes entered the game and got two outs before allowing
Berkman's bases-clearing double.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla (2-3) allowed four runs, all unearned. He gave up a
game-tying double to Berkman in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo got a one-out single off starter Bruce Chen,
moved to second when Moises Alou singled off Padilla and scored on
Berkman's liner to the gap in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla got Tony Eusebio to bounce into a double play to end the
inning after an intentional walk loaded the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Chen allowed two runs and six hits in 7 1-3 innings. He walked
four and struck out two in his first career outing against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old left-hander is 2-1 with a 3.74 ERA since coming
to the Phillies from Atlanta in a trade for Andy Ashby on July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Perez gave Philadelphia a 2-1 lead with an RBI groundout
in the sixth. Pat Burrell led off the inning with a walk, moved to
third on a double by Kevin Jordan and scored on Perez's grounder to
second.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elarton allowed two runs and seven hits in six innings. He
struck out a season-high nine and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton, who had won eight of his previous nine starts, has
allowed three earned runs or less in 10 straight starts and is 8-1
in that span.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, subbing for the injured Scott Rolen, gave the Phillies a
1-0 lead in the fourth with his third homer -- a liner just inside
the left-field foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   Houston tied it in the sixth on Alou's 18th homer -- a bolt to
left-center.
</P>
<P>
   Before Alou's homer, Bagwell, who led off the inning with a
double, was thrown out at third on a one-hop strike by Doug
Glanville while trying to advance on a fly out to center.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies stranded five runners in the first three innings,
and left the bases loaded in the third. Mike Lieberthal struck out
and Travis Lee bounced out to end that inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Chen's single in the third was his first hit of the season
after going 0-for-13. It was his second career hit, and first since
a single against Arizona on Sept. 20, 1998. ... Eusebio extended
his hitting streak to 15 games with the double in the fifth. ...
Alou robbed Lee of at least an RBI single with a diving catch on a
liner in the seventh.

<HEADLINE> ACLU Backs Scientist's Bid of Proof  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- An Asian-born scientist accused of
breaching security at Los Alamos National Laboratory should be
given any evidence of racial profiling and selective prosecution,
two legal groups said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union and the Asian Law Caucus
filed court papers Friday asking U.S. District Judge James Parker
to order the government to produce any evidence of racial profiling
in the prosecution of Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The government has denied selectively prosecuting Lee and urged
Parker not to order disclosure. A hearing on the issue is set
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, is charged with 59 counts alleging he downloaded
restricted data to unsecure computers and tape. He faces trial Nov.
6 and could be imprisoned for life if convicted. He is not charged
with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers contend the Taiwanese-born naturalized U.S. citizen
was singled out because of his ethnicity. They quote statements by
government officials admitting profiling occurred because China
typically seeks information from Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU says prosecutors had to know investigators were
profiling ''because the warrant application to search the
defendant's house apparently cited his race to satisfy the
probable-cause requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unconstitutional to prosecute based on race, the ACLU
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian Law Caucus, representing eight public interest groups,
said the Lee case recalls U.S. government internment of
Japanese-Americans during World War II. That stereotyping wrongly
suggested Asians were somehow less loyal than other Americans, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Hwang, managing attorney for the Asian Law Caucus, said
the Asian-American community believes motives for prosecuting Lee
include politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''By prosecuting him,'' Hwang said, ''the administration could
deflect criticism that they had been soft on Chinese espionage''
following a campaign contribution scandal that allegedly involved
money from China.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney George Stamboulidis, who has declined to
comment outside court on the case, filed his response to the
selective prosecution argument July 21 denying there had been any
ethnic profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lee has not been singled out because he is Chinese-American.
Lee was indicted because he put America's nuclear weapons secrets
at risk,'' Stamboulidis wrote.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Wins Reform Party Nod  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Pat Buchanan won the Reform Party
presidential nomination late Friday in a victory bitterly disputed
by party founder Ross Perot's supporters, who chose their own
nominee in a rival convention.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan and the nominee of the competing convention, physicist
John Hagelin, may be headed to court to determine which faction
gains control of the party and $12.5 million in federal campaign
funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't know this peasant army,'' Buchanan said in a
challenge addressed to his rivals during brief comments to his own
roaring delegates. On Saturday when he formally accepts the
nomination, he said, ''We march out of Long Beach and we take
America back.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Hagelin were nominated at rival gatherings at opposite
ends of the convention complex here after the party's mail-in
primary gave the nomination to Buchanan. Both factions rejected the
primary results as flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The Perot group walked out of the original convention earlier in
the week as Buchanan's majority among delegates neared 70 percent --
more than enough to lock in his nomination. Buchanan's campaign
wanted to blunt any legal challenges by nominating the former
Republican from the floor, rather than by what both sides believe
is a tainted system.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's name was put into nomination Friday night and he was
declared the winner on grounds that there was no opposition.
</P>
<P>
   At his convention, Hagelin declared himself the party's real
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I accept with humility and with pride the mantle of H. Ross
Perot,'' Hagelin told the delegates, who roared with approval.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle over the federal campaign funds, the Hagelin
faction filed a complaint earlier this week with the Federal
Election Commission in an attempt to block Buchanan from the money.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who quit the Republican Party 10 months ago, has been
getting between 1 percent and 4 percent in polls. His plans for bus
tour and modest advertising campaign after Labor Day could be in
jeopardy if he doesn't get the $12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Buchanan named Ezola Foster, a black Los Angeles
teacher, as his running mate, as he looked toward the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this campaign, she will be our ambassador to America ...
and she will contradict all the myths and nonsense about what this
new party is about,'' Buchanan told reporters at a dockside news
conference. ''It is open. We welcome everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin, also of the Natural Law Party, was considering as his
running mate Nat Goldhaber, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, and NASA
scientist Bob Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party officials said Buchanan received 49,529 votes to
Hagelin's 28,539 votes in the primary balloting. Hagelin won only
three states, Colorado, North Carolina and Hawaii, according to Mic
Farris, chairman of the Reform Party's nominations committee.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mangia, one of the leading anti-Buchanan party activists
attributed Buchanan's 63 percent to 36 percent victory to ''the
fraudulent submission'' of ballots. Only about 10 percent of the
887,925 ballots mailed out were returned with votes for the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who invited Foster to join the ticket two nights
earlier, called her a ''lifelong Christian'' who had been both a
Republican and a Democrat and co-chairman of his failed GOP
presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, 62, twice lost bids to the California state assembly to
Rep. Maxine Waters and was a supporter of California proposition
187, the 1994 ballot measure that sought to deny most forms of
state aid to illegal immigrants. That measure passed but was later
invalidated by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't care what party you came from, where you've been and
who you're running away from,'' Buchanan said. ''Come with us --
you're welcome in our party.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan introduced Foster as the first black woman on a ''major
party'' presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   After the second defeat to Waters, Foster founded an
organization called Black-Americans for Family Values that fought
such things as references to homosexuality in public schools. She
has also protested use of government money to promote safe sex
anti-AIDS programs.
</P>
<P>
   As for racial issues, Foster said Friday she believed ''the
Confederate flag is to be honored as a part of our history'' and
that she was only concerned with ''the race to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The two left their announcement for a cruise aboard a yacht
called FantaSea One.

<HEADLINE> Lightning Sparks New Fires in Mont.  </HEADLINE>
By BECKY BOHRER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Mont. (AP) -- With too many fires and not enough
firefighters, the Montana university system told students Friday
they can report for fall classes three weeks late if they stay on
the fire lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''These students are putting themselves at risk to protect our
environment, and it is appropriate that we assist them in their
efforts,'' said Richard Crofts, state commissioner of higher
education.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1,800 students, including National Guard members
and volunteer firefighters, are expected to qualify, a university
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The students will have until Sept. 25 to register. Those who
don't return to campuses by then can get full refunds of their
prepaid tuition. Classes are scheduled to start Sept. 5 at the
University of Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Large fires in the West burned on more than 900,000 acres Friday
-- 327,000 acres in Montana alone.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters have traveled to Montana from throughout the United
States and Canada. Military troops are on fire duty, and retired
fire managers have been asked to return. In Idaho, where fires are
burning on more than 423,280 acres, 79 firefighters from Australia
and New Zealand will join the crews this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   More fires were started by lightning late Thursday and early
Friday. The Forest Service said there were 2,200 known lightning
strikes in the southwestern area of Montana and in neighboring
Idaho. In northwestern Montana, the Kootenai National Forest had 70
new fires sparked by lightning, but only 18 firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, managers in Montana pulled all crews from a
3,050-acre fire near here to fight the bigger and more threatening
High Ore Road fire that forced the evacuation of homes in the
Jefferson City area and swept through the settlement of Wickes.
</P>
<P>
   The fire also knocked out two huge power transmission lines that
feed into the Pacific Northwest's power grid. Power supply has not
been interrupted, but the lines will be out of service through
Monday to allow for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern Bitterroot Valley, tempers flared when U.S.
Forest Service officials met with about 270 residents, some of whom
accused firefighters of incompetence for setting a backfire that
burned their houses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was careless disregard for life. It was arson and attempted
murder,'' said Joan Giles. Her house and about a dozen others
burned Sunday when fires blew up south of Darby.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service officials promised an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   East of town, a complex of fires continued to burn out of
control in the drought-parched forests of the Bitterroot Valley.
More than 104,000 acres had burned there by Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   More residents near Darby were forced from their homes Friday.
In Hamilton, about 600 people remain out of their homes because of
a 7,600-fire that was just 30 percent contained.
</P>
<P>
   Neither town was under evacuation order, but people remained
tense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are Darby and Hamilton in danger? Sure they're in danger,''
said Sheriff Perry Johnson. ''These fires can blow firebrands a
mile and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, fires in the Bitterroot Valley have destroyed more
than 50 homes and covered more than 175,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, there were signs of progress Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fire managers in New Mexico and Oregon reported all major fires
contained. In California, the 11,734-acre Pechanga Indian
reservation fire was contained late Thursday, and firefighters were
standing by in case the 74,439-acre Manter fire flared from high
wind.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, the Bureau of Land Management and other federal
agencies banned open campfires, charcoal fires, fireworks, outside
smoking and the use of equipment that could produce sparks on all
federal land.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reached a turning point in an unprecedented fire
season where firefighting needs have exceeded available
resources,'' Ann Morgan, BLM state director, said Friday. ''We
cannot afford a human-caused fire in Colorado.''

<HEADLINE> Swimmer Davis Breaks U.S. Record  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Josh Davis broke a 12-year-old American
record and B.J. Bedford finally broke through Friday night. But
Lenny Krayzelburg couldn't send a message to the Australians by
breaking his own world mark in the backstroke.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg was considered the best hope to set the first world
record of the U.S. Olympic trials, coming within 0.07 seconds
during the semifinals of the 100-meter backstroke.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old native of the Ukraine broke out his high-tech
''jammer'' bodysuit -- stretching from waist to knees -- and donned a
tight-fitting cap in the final, intent on breaking the time of
53.60 set last August. Earlier Friday, he said it was important to
show the Australians that ''we're ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The powerful Aussies, led by Ian Thorpe, set three records at
their own trials in May.
</P>
<P>
   With a sellout crowd at the Indiana University Natatorium
roaring him on, Krayzelburg went out too fast and faded at the end
to finish in 53.84. Still, he'll be heading to the Olympics for the
first time, beating Neil Walker by more than a second on Day 3 of
the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little disappointed, but I can't complain,'' said
Krayzelburg, who came to the United States in 1989 and gained
citizenship in 1995. ''I made the Olympics. It got a big monkey off
my back.''
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg looked in the stands toward his father, Oleg, who
held up his hands as if to say, ''What happened?''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's probably disappointed that I didn't get the record,''
Krayzelburg said. ''But we'll save that for Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was on world-record pace halfway through the men's
200-meter freestyle, then held on to finish in 1:47.26. That
eclipsed Matt Biondi's mark of 1:47.72 in the 1988 Seoul Olympics
but was still nearly two seconds off the world record, held by
Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 27, of Austin, Texas, won three gold medals in the 1996
Atlanta Games -- the most of any male athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing like wearing the red, white and blue,'' he
said. ''The USA is the best country in the world. It's only right
that we have the best athletes at the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedford failed to even make the Olympic team at her last three
trials, but she finally ended her 12-year wait in the women's 100
backstroke. The 27-year-old native of Etna, N.H., stretched for the
wall and immediately looked toward the scoreboard, pumping her fist
in exultation when the time of 1:01.85 was flashed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am overwhelmed,'' she said, after jumping up and down on the
pool deck. ''I never thought this dream of mine would come true,
but it has.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old swimmer began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   ''I probably won't be able to describe this for three or four
years,'' Bedford said. ''I'm overwhelmed, I'm ecstatic, I'm
effervescent, I'm in excruciating pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Bedford just missed the team by finishing third
in the 100 backstroke in the 1996 trials. She was bartending during
the Atlanta Games, pouring drinks while customers watched the
swimming on television.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was like, 'Get that crap off the TV,''' she said earlier in
the week, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Shealy of Columbia, S.C., made her first Olympic team,
hanging on for second at 1:02.05 to beat out high school teacher
Lea Maurer, the American record holder in the event. Maurer hung
over the lane line, covering her eyes in anguish when she realized
she had missed the Olympic team by 0.2 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I swam a good race plan and it just wasn't good enough,'' said
Maurer, 29, who won two medals in the 1992 Games. ''For some
reason, it was harder than it should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year-old Megan Quann of Puyallup, Wash., also is heading
to the Olympics for the first time after winning the 100
breaststroke in 1:07.26 -- just 0.14 off her American record set a
day earlier. Staciana Stitts of Carlsbad, Calif., took the other
spot on the team at 1:07.79.
</P>
<P>
   Shealy's more heralded teammate at the University of Georgia,
Kristy Kowal, came up short of the Olympic squad by one-hundredth
of a second. The 1998 world champion touched the wall at 1:07.80.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing Krayzelburg, Walker earned a spot on the Olympic team
at 54.85. Davis was followed by Scott Goldblatt of Austin, Texas,
who made his first Olympic team at 1:48.12. Chad Carvin and Klete
Keller, who already qualified for the team, finished 3-4 to earn
spots on the 800 relay in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning prelims, Tom Malchow made a run at his world
record in the 200 butterfly. Wearing a bodysuit with only his arms
exposed, he was a half-second under world record pace at 150 meters
before slowing to win in 1:55.67.
</P>
<P>
   Malchow, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist, took it easy in the
evening semis, moving on to the final at 1:56.67. He set the world
record of 1:55.18 in June.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little too aggressive in the morning and a little too
cautious in the evening,'' Malchow said. ''I've got to find a happy
medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Malchow said it's not important to set a record at the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be nice, but it's not crucial,'' he said. ''By and
large, the meet has been fast. Maybe we won't set any records here.
Hopefully, those will come in Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Arsenault of Peabody, Mass., heads into the final of
the 200 freestyle as the top qualifier at 2:00.16. Cristina
Teuscher, a gold medalist in 1996, was top qualifier in the 200
individual medley with a time of 2:14.21.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a good night for 1996 medalists:
</P>
<P>
   --Beth Botsford finished last in the eight-woman final of the 100
backstroke after winning gold in the same race at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   --Brad Bridgewater was seventh in the men's 100 backstroke; he
won the 200 backstroke at the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   --Amanda Beard, who captured a gold and two silvers in Atlanta,
placed last in the 100 breaststroke.

Clinton To Make Gov't User-Friendly
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- To make the federal government more user-friendly to
Americans who don't speak English, President Clinton on today directed federal
agencies to break down language barriers. Clinton's executive order aims to make
it easier for non-English- speaking citizens to gain access to federal programs

president.''If Al Gore has differences with the president, he ought to say them
loud and clear what they are,'' Bush said. The Texas governor said he wasn't
implying that Gore condoned such behavior.

   BOULDER, Mont. (AP) -- With too many fires and not enough firefighters, the
Montana university system told students today they can report for fall classes
three weeks late if they stay on the fire lines. An estimated 1,800 students,
including National Guard members and volunteer firefighters, are expected to
qualify, a university official said. The students will have until Sept. 25 to
register. Those who don't return to campuses by then can get full refunds of
their prepaid tuition. Classes are scheduled to start Sept. 5 at the University
of Montana. Large fires in the West burned on more than 900,000 acres Friday --
327,000 acres in Montana alone.

Vatican Predicts 1 M for Youth Day
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- A few lucky ones from as far as Tahiti will stay in Pope
John Paul II's summer villa and many others will sleep under the stars as least
1.2 million young people come to Rome next week for several days in prayer and
reflection. Key event of the Catholic church's World Youth Day is a vigil
service under the stars Aug. 19 on the sprawling grounds of a university campus
on the outskirts of Rome. At least 1.2 million participants, ''perhaps even 1.5
million,'' will be in Rome by vigil time, predicted Monsignor Cesare Nosiglia,
who is helping to organize the events. For the pontiff, young people are key to
his mission to shore up the Catholic church in the 21st century amid
distractions from consumerism and competition from evangelical and other
religious sects.

<HEADLINE> Royals 7, Orioles 6  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Rookie Mark Quinn kept up his
second-half surge with two homers and a double, driving in four
runs as the Kansas City Royals beat the Baltimore Orioles 7-6
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn's 18 homers and 56 RBIs lead all American League rookies.
Since the All-Star break, he is batting .359 (42-for-117) with six
homers and 18 RBIS.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sweeney also homered for the Royals, who won despite tying
a season high with four errors.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City broke open a 4-all game with three runs in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon's RBI double gave the Royals a 5-4 lead and
Sweeney's two-run homer with two outs and chased starter Mike
Mussina (7-12). Damon is the only player in the AL with more hits
(62) than Quinn since the break.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina gave up 11 hits in 6 2-3 innings, striking out three
without giving up a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reichert (6-6) gave up four runs on four hits over seven
innings, with three walks and four strikeouts. He is 3-0 with two
no-decisions in his last five starts.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Bottalico pitched the ninth for his 13th save. He gave up
Melvin Mora's RBI single with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Hairston, recalled Friday from Triple-A Rochester, gave
Baltimore a 1-0 lead with a leadoff homer in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn doubled home Jermaine Dye in the second to tie it. Dye
also had three hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles went up 3-1 in the third with the help of the first
of two errors by Royals third baseman Joe Randa.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Delino DeShields hit an RBI triple that fell out
of a running Dye's glove in right field. He then scored when Randa
threw high to first on Albert Belle's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn's two-run homer made it 3-all in the fourth. After Belle's
RBI double in the fifth put Baltimore up 4-3, Quinn answered with
his second homer, a solo shot in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   After the Royals' three-run seventh, Jeff Conine's RBI single in
the Baltimore eighth cut Kansas City's lead to 7-5. That hit
followed errors by shortstop Rey Sanchez and catcher Gregg Zaun.
</P>
<P>
   DeShields scored three times and had three hits.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Reichert threw his 14th wild pitch. That tied him with
Detroit's Hideo Nomo and Minnesota's Hector Carrasco for the most
in the AL. ... Before Friday, Randa had committed only one error in
his previous 34 games. ... Kansas City is 4-0 against the Orioles
this season.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules in Aetna's Favor  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN POET
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A federal appeals court agreed Friday with a
lower court judge that Aetna Inc.'s U.S. Healthcare unit doesn't
violate racketeering laws in its advertising and membership
materials.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said plaintiffs did not
support their assertion that they paid too much for health care.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court judge dismissed the lawsuit in October, saying
the company's advertisements were not fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawsuit said Aetna promised quality medical
care but encouraged widespread cost-cutting and penalized doctors
who didn't increase their patient load. The lawsuit, filed in April
1999 on behalf of nearly 6 million Aetna customers, claimed the
abuses were so widespread they constituted a pattern of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In fighting the case, Aetna Inc., the nation's largest health
insurer, admitted that its advertising claims of being committed to
''maintaining and improving quality health care'' were ''mere
puffery,'' but said that didn't amount to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said Friday that the plaintiffs hadn't alleged
or proved that they suffered medical injuries, received inadequate
care or were denied care as a consequence of the structure of
Aetna's HMO plan.
</P>
<P>
   David Carter, a spokesman for Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna, said
the ruling was significant because it showed that such claims would
have to be alleged and proven on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   Calls went unanswered Friday afternoon to the Foundation for
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a Santa Monica, Calif., consumer
group representing the plaintiffs.

<HEADLINE> Redskins 30, Patriots 20  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- The New England Patriots are having trouble
settling on a running back. Too bad they can't borrow one from the
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Davis made a solid return in his first game since knee
surgery. Adrian Murrell scored a touchdown and eluded at least four
missed tackles. Larry Centers caught a 34-yard pass out of the
backfield. Skip Hicks ran for 98 yards and a touchdown, and the
Redskins' first-team showed some regular-season form in Friday
night's 30-20 victory over the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The one scare for the Redskins came late in the first half when
defensive tackle Dan Wilkinson's left knee buckled after he hit
quarterback Drew Bledsoe. The initial diagnosis was a sprain, and
there was immediate word on how long Wilkinson will be sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   New England, led by its defense, won its first two exhibition
games under new coach Bill Belichick. This was the first game in
which the full first-team offense got significant playing time, and
the starters managed only three first downs and two field goals
from Adam Vinatieri in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick then brought the first-stringers back for two more
drives at the start of the second half, both times using a
no-huddle offense against the Redskins' second-string defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe went 5-for-5 and hit Tony Simmons with a 12-yard
touchdown pass on the first drive to tie it at 13, then was 4-for-4
on the second drive before his pass was tipped by Eric Whitfield
and intercepted by Matt Stevens at the 1.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick stuck with the no-huddle concept even when his second
unit, led by John Friesz, entered the game. Friesz hit Matt
Bumgardner for a 7-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots wide-open battle for the starting running back
position remained murky. Kevin Faulk gained 16 yards on five
carries and dropped a screen pass. Raymont Harris had another tough
week: His first four rushes went for 1 yard, minus-1 yard, 0 yards
and minus-1 yard.
</P>
<P>
   Third-round draft pick J.R. Redmond, expected to make his
Patriots debut, did not play.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins starters, who had a mediocre outing last week at
Tampa, played the first half. While the running game looked good,
quarterback Brad Johnson threw two interceptions and finished
11-for-22 for 175 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Davis nursed an ankle injury during the offseason after leading
the NFC in rushing, then reported to camp late because of a
holdout. He looked his old self on the first run from scrimmage,
taking the play wide for a 9-yard gain. He finished with 24 yards
on six carries.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell, signed as a free agent in the offseason, broke two
tackles to score on a 14-yard screen pass on Washington's opening
drive. He finished with 35 yards on 13 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight for Hicks, playing with the reserves in the second
half, was a 17-yard touchdown run that needed a replay review to
verify that he did indeed get the ball in the end zone with his
final dive.
</P>
<P>
   Even Chad Dukes, well down on the depth chart, joined in the
productive night for the backs with his 5-yard run in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Elezovic, baby-sitting the Redskins kicking job while
Brett Conway recovers from a strained quad, made field goals of 33,
22 and 44 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Smith, who sat out the Tampa game, had an impressive
Redskins debut, sacking Bledsoe on his first play and making the
tackle on an up-the-middle run on his second play.

By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Lisa Leslie had 20 points and 11 rebounds as the
Los Angeles Sparks beat the Phoenix Mercury 86-71 in Game 1 of
their Western Conference playoff series Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   DeLisha Milton scored 13 of her 19 points in the first half, and
the Sparks raced to a 19-point lead. Mwadi Mabika had 15 points and
Tamecka Dixon 14 for the Sparks, who won for the 13th time in 14
games.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy Reed led the Mercury with 17 points, Bridget Pettis had
14 -- all in the final 7:46 -- and Michelle Griffiths added 13.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 of the best-of-three first-round series is Sunday in Los
Angeles, where the Mercury have lost six straight.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles led 43-24 at halftime, and withstood a 10-3 surge
that got the Mercury within 51-40 on a 3-pointer by Reed 7:10 into
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Ukari Figgs hit a jumper, Leslie made a putback and Mabika
scored on a fast break during a 1:08 spurt, and the Sparks extended
their lead to 57-40 with 11:17 to play. Phoenix never got closer
than 14 points again.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks swept the Mercury this season, and their dominance
was apparent from the start in the first-ever playoff game between
the teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks, who never trailed, took a 33-16 lead when Leslie
made a putback with 7:42 to play in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Gillom went to the foul line four seconds later and
made a free throw. She missed the second, but got her own rebound
and made a layup, and the Mercury's Tonya Edwards made a free throw
with 6:02 remaining, cutting Los Angeles' lead to 33-20.

<HEADLINE> Cop Charged With Beating Deaf-Mute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- A police officer was charged with
assault Friday for allegedly beating a deaf-mute, homeless man
while the man was handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Alfonzo Whittington, 23, faces charges of misdemeanor
assault on a handicapped person, according to warrants.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Whittington pushed Dennis Ray Hunt, 40, off a bench
and punched him several times as he was arresting him July 31 for
allegedly assaulting a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''This guy can't speak or hear, therefore while he was being
assaulted he can't yell for help,'' said police Sgt. Roberto
Rivera. ''This is against our policies, our procedures, and it's
criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation included a videotape of the intake room that
evening. Interim Police Chief Philip Cannady said he has seen the
tape but wouldn't say what it shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are considering that as a piece of evidence that will be
used in the prosecution of this case, and I don't think it would be
right to comment on that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whittington was told Friday he would be fired and was given
seven days to appeal his dismissal. He has been on the force since
June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Whittington for comment Friday were
unsuccessful. His home phone number is unlisted.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton Takes on Leno  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton stopped in at
''The Tonight Show'' on Friday and got a laugh with a little help
from her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Host Jay Leno asked the first lady what would happen if Chelsea
Clinton changed affiliation and announced that the Republicans had
good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd miss her a lot,'' Clinton replied.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea Clinton, 20, gave her mom a laugh from the studio
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on leaving the White House, Clinton told Leno:
''People will have a new president and life will go on. The only
person I'm worried about is you. What are you going to talk about
when we're gone?''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, running for the U.S. Senate in New York against
Republican Rep. Rick Lazio, made the taping her first stop as she
arrived in California for the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   She had pre-taped a segment in which she walked around
Rockefeller Center and asked people if she should appear on Leno's
show, because ''sometimes he's kind of mean.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman advised her to go on the show because ''otherwise
he'll talk about you.''
</P>
<P>
   In a relaxed give-and-take with Leno, Clinton praised the
accomplishments of her husband's administration, outlined her own
platform and extolled the beauty of New York state. But she said
campaigning has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I get yelled at to go home in 62 different languages, but it's
part of the New York hazing experience,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after months of needling from David Letterman, appeared
on CBS' ''Late Show'' in January and received kid-glove treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to give this woman a tremendous amount of credit for
just showing up,'' Letterman said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Letterman underwent quintuple heart bypass
surgery. When he returned to the air five weeks later, Letterman
joked that he had new respect for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spent a half hour with Hillary and look what happened to
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is expected to appear on ''The Tonight Show'' later.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Leader Visits Indonesia  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Fresh from a visit to Iraq, Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez met Saturday with President Abdurrahman Wahid
to discuss boosting the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries's global clout.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is on a whirlwind tour of OPEC nations to drum up support
for a oil summit in Caracas next month. He is also seeking backing
for maintaining the price of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez arrived at the presidential palace in Jakarta on Saturday
morning, but did not speak to waiting reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's department of foreign affairs spokesman Sulaiman
Abdulmanan said the government strongly supports Chavez's call to
maintain the price of oil, saying ''a higher oil price is much
better for us as we want to earn more from oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, which is the Asia's only OPEC member, is just
starting to recover from its worst economic crisis in a generation.
Most of the growth is based on its oil exports.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Chavez met with President Saddam Hussein during a
visit to Baghdad. The trip raised the ire of the United States and
Britain who said they were concerned about giving the Iraqi
president credibility.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said Chavez's visit to Iraq, the first by a head
of state since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, has offered the Iraqi
media a propaganda field day.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said he was received warmly by Saddam, and the two men
dined and took a drive together.
</P>
<P>
   Abdulmanan said Indonesia was not opposed to Chavez's visit to
Iraq as ''it is up to the president himself where he goes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are also friends with Iraq,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This week's trip to 10 oil-producing countries is part of
Chavez's stated goal of strengthening the oil cartel as a global
force. Chavez hopes the price of oil will stick to around $25 a
barrel. It is currently selling on world markets at about $27.50 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   He also hopes to hold a Sept. 27 summit of the heads of state of
OPEC countries in Venezuela.

<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - A toddler was in critical condition late
Friday after falling out of a third-story window to the pavement
below.
</P>
<P>
   Two-year-old Keon Marks was being treated at Wilson Memorial
Regional Medical Center, a nursing supervisor at the Johnson City
hospital said.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor said the boy's aunt had just fed the child and turned
away for a moment. When the woman turned back, the boy and a window
screen lay in a blacktop alley 27 feet below her third floor
apartment, said neighbor Eric Ferris.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard her say she just turned around and the baby was
gone,'' Ferris told the Press &AMP; Sun-Bulletin of Binghamton. Ferris
sprinted down four flights of stairs when he heard screams.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I got there, he wasn't breathing,'' he said, adding that
the boy started to breathe again while he tended to him.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the screen appeared to have been properly installed.
They believe the boy, who had been running back and forth in the
apartment, charged into the screen and fell out the window.

<HEADLINE> Regulators Design New Tire Tests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Highway safety regulators are trying to update
30-year-old tests for automobile tires that would prevent surprises
like the problems that led to the Firestone tire failures.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say existing tests are insufficient and regulators were
blindsided by the Firestone tire failures, culminating in a recall
of 6.5 million tires this week.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the tire maker, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., nor Ford
Motor Co., which used the tires on its Explorer sport-utility
vehicle, has been able to explain what caused the failures.
</P>
<P>
   Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, confirmed that a new test is being designed to
detect flaws similar to those in the Firestone tires. The
Washington Post first reported the initiative on its Web site
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The current test checks for strength, endurance and how well the
tire stays in the rim -- but was designed for an earlier generation
of tire. The recalled tires passed that test in 1990 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also criticized existing reporting standards. Ford
wasn't required to disclose that the company had replaced 50,000
tires on its sport-utility vehicles overseas in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department has also complained to Congress
that the maximum civil penalty that can be levied against companies
for slow action on a recall is too low. The NHTSA fined Ford about
$425,000 after it determined that Ford delayed notifying regulators
of a problem with an ignition switch.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Does Events Hollywood-Style  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton on Friday shrugged off talk
that he's stealing the limelight from Al Gore with a weekend filled
with Hollywood-style fund-raisers, parties and tributes just before
the Democratic National Convention begins on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never heard him say that,'' Clinton said after greeting
supporters who met him at the Los Angeles airport.
</P>
<P>
   Later at a fund-raiser, Clinton gave Gore equal credit for the
nation's economic prosperity and praised him for his vision,
saying: ''This is a guy that I know will do what he thinks is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a ''huge'' election, Clinton said. Because of the
nation's economic progress, ''we have a chance to make sure that
not only the people who can afford to come to a fund-raiser, but
the people who work for a minimum wage can all send their kids to
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's pre-convention events include a brunch with Barbra
Streisand to raise money for the Clinton presidential library and a
concert to benefit first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign for
a Senate seat in New York. There also are thank-you dinners for
donors and a series of tributes to the president, leading some to
wonder whether the Clintons are siphoning money from other
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the weekend events
haven't bred animosity among the vice president, president and
first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normal people,'' Lockhart said, would find nothing suspect in
the president's desire to ''come out a few days early to say thank
you to a lot of people in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Senate campaign and the Gore campaign huddled in
recent weeks ''to make sure we weren't working at cross purposes,''
Lockhart said. ''Everybody's quite happy,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee leader Joe Andrew on Friday echoed
Lockhart's remarks, branding the comments of unnamed critics in the
media as overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a problem and it's not true,'' Andrew said. ''We are
very proud of the record over the past eight years. We are very
proud of the president's leadership in that record as well and
obviously that's why we want to make sure that'' the president and
first lady are in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dan McLagan, a campaign spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's
opponent, Rick Lazio, used the flap over the weekend fund-raisers
as an opportunity to take a jab at the first lady's west coast
fund-raisers. ''She's doubtless more comfortable in Los Angeles
with her left-wing pals and Hollywood stars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GOP spokesmen who are in Los Angeles to provide GOP rebuttal to
the Democrats' convention, say they're not getting involved. ''Our
focus is on Al Gore and the things he says and does,'' said Terry
Holt, communications director for the GOP's ''Victory 2000''
campaign. ''Our first concern is not whether there is friction in
their party.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's first appearance Friday evening is a fund-raiser for
Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., a Clinton ally elected to Congress
in 1992. About 275 people should attend the reception, organized by
the Becerra for Congress Committee, which expects to raise
$150,000. After that, Clinton went to dinner at Spago, a trendy
restaurant in Beverly Hills, to thank the 30 or 40 people who
underwrote the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend also includes the two-tiered fund-raiser and
celebrity-studded concert to raise an estimated $1 million for the
first lady's campaign and the Sunday brunch with Streisand to raise
millions for the Clinton presidential library.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will speak to the convention Monday and then join Gore
at a political event in Monroe, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton's address will not depart dramatically
from the themes he strikes almost nightly at Democratic
fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   The speech may not refer to GOP nominee George W. Bush at all,
Lockhart said. But it will reject Republican suggestions that the
current prosperity has nothing to do with the Clinton-Gore
administration, he said. ''They wanted you to believe it all
happened by accident,'' Clinton said at the fund-raiser. ''My own
daddy used to say, 'If you find a turtle on a fence post, chances
are it didn't get there by accident.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the address has three major themes: The changes
and improvements in America in the last eight years; the ''real
differences'' between the two political parties, and ''why this
election is important -- what's at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to give the speech and then give way, and let Al
Gore, Joe Lieberman and others go out and really talk about the
future,'' Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Adopts Simpler Health Forms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an effort to reduce paperwork, the
government has adopted simpler health care forms for doctors to
submit payment claims to insurers by computer.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, announced Friday, establishes standard formats for
submitting electronic claims and other administrative health
transactions. All health care providers will be able to use the
electronic format to bill for their services, and all plans will be
required to accept the forms.
</P>
<P>
   ''These standards are important steps toward a faster, simpler,
less costly and more efficient health care system,'' Department of
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   The department expects the new forms to save the health care
industry $29.9 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was required by the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996, and the HHS consulted with private
organizations and individuals to develop the standards. Shalala
said more than 17,000 public comments on the proposal were
received.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called the proposal a win for both patients
and health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we save money from the health care system, we succeed in
keeping premiums down,'' Clinton said in a White House statement.
''When we reduce paperwork requirements on our physicians, they
have more time to spend with their patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new regulation, providers will still be allowed to use
paper forms, but the department expects the standards to encourage
more electronic filing.
</P>
<P>
   Most insurers and providers that choose to use electronic forms
must comply with the rule within 26 months. Some small insurers
will have an additional year.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala cautioned that the rule is being released under the
assumption that privacy protections will be in place at the same
time the rule takes effect. The department expects the privacy of
medical records to be protected by either HHS regulations or
congressional action. But if the privacy protections are not in
place, the HHS said, the department will ''seriously consider''
suspending or withdrawing the electronic filing regulation.

<HEADLINE> Gore Courts Women's Vote  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Pa. (AP) -- Amid stockroom shelves piled with
handsewn dolls, Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman pitched their tax-cut
plan -- in dollars-and-cents, us-versus-them terms -- to women voters
whose sagging support in polls worries the Democratic presidential
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   On a Friday devoted to women and union workers, Vice President
Gore threaded his message with references to the performance record
he shares with President Clinton. But he also found himself again
juggling the hot potato of Clinton's personal conduct in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not asking for support on the basis of past performance.
I'm asking for your support on the basis of the better, fairer
America we can build in the future,'' Gore told working women and
their children at the Little Souls doll factory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since we've made so many important gains for working women in
the past eight years, I think it's important to tell you my bottom
line: You ain't seen nothing yet!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaigned his way toward next week's Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles as officials disclosed his daughter,
Karenna Gore Schiff, would deliver one of three nominating speeches
for the vice president on Wednesday night. The other two will be by
Lois DeBerry, a friend of the vice president and a member of the
Tennessee Legislature, and actor Tommy Lee Jones, a Harvard
classmate of Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   Women voters gave a decisive boost to Clinton's 1996 re-election
but polls show they aren't giving Gore much of a lift. The Gore
campaign hoped an endorsement Friday by the Business and
Professional Women USA would help.
</P>
<P>
   From Philadelphia, Gore detoured through Detroit where, at a
hastily arranged tarmac rally, he accepted the United Auto Workers'
endorsement after the union's months-long holdout over his
free-trade advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, reiterating his commitment to making worker rights and
environmental protections part of future trade deals, acknowledged
to some 500 auto workers ''how long and how hard I have worked to
earn your confidence and your support and your endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gore was making his way across the country and into the
spotlight of next week's Democratic National Convention, his
campaign flinched at Clinton's headline-making confessional
regarding the Monica Lewinsky affair to a conference of
evangelicals Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I appreciate what the president said. He's said it before. I
think that he also went on to say that this election, as all
elections, is about the future and not the past and I very much
agree with that,'' Gore told Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokesman Mark Fabiani said the campaign would ''stay
focussed on the positive Gore message. We can't be distracted by
things that are out of our control.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential rival George W. Bush sought to
capitalize on Gore's dilemma, telling reporters, ''Either you're
part of an administration or you're not part of an administration
is how I view it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If he's got a problem with what went on in the past, he ought
to explain what it is,'' Bush said of his rival.
</P>
<P>
   Also competing with Gore's appeal to women -- and the focus on
values that Lieberman brought to the ticket this week -- was a flap
over Democratic Rep. Loretta Sanchez's planned fund-raiser at the
Playboy mansion during the convention, which is in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told Fox he supports the Democratic National Committee's
decision to revoke the southern California congresswoman's speaking
slot at the convention. Organizers were scrambling to find an
alternative site to defuse the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW endorsement left another big holdout -- the Teamsters,
who also voted ''no'' when their parent federation the AFL-CIO
endorsed Gore last fall. Teamsters president James Hoffa met with
senior Gore aides at their Nashville, Tenn., headquarters last
week, campaign manager Donna Brazile said, but the session was a
convention briefing and not about endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Brazile said the UAW, which also boasts 600,000 retirees, would
especially help Gore in tossup states Illinois, Ohio and Michigan.

   Inside the suburban Philadelphia stockroom, where dolls priced
as high as $1,000 were cradled in plastic, Gore promoted his $500
billion tax-cut package, including a tax credit for child care
expenses and tax breaks for those taking care of elderly or infirm
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are tax cuts we can afford. They're tax cuts that fit
within a balanced budget and tax cuts that are targeted for working
families in every corner of America,'' said Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Using his own campaign's calculations, Gore maintained that
under the much broader tax-cut proposals of Republican George W.
Bush, ''for every $10 of tax relief that would go to the richest
one percent, middle-class families would get a dime and the poorest
families would get a penny.''

   While Gore jetted on to the Detroit rally, Lieberman quietly
peeled off. He took the train from Philadelphia to Washington in
order to be home by sundown and the beginning of the Sabbath, which
Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, observes through worship and no work.

   Gore finished in Manhattan with a $600,000 Democratic National
Committee fund-raising dinner with just 31 people. Event host Blair
Effron boasted of his success: ''To raise money to compete against
George Bush, that's easy. To raise money on a Friday, competing
with the Hamptons, that's hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, scolding Bush for a convention speech last week that
''strained belief'' and represented ''the illusion of inclusion,''
said the Democratic gathering in Los Angeles would demonstrate
''the reality of inclusion.''

	   ROSEBOOM, N.Y. (AP) - One person died Friday night when a small
plane crashed in a wooded area, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The crash of the Grumman aircraft happened at 8:20 p.m. in this
northern Otsego County town just south of Cherry Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Otsego County Sheriff's Inv. Richard Devlin said it is believed
only the pilot was aboard. Police confirmed the pilot died in the
crash but they called off the search late Friday because the
weather, the wreckage and damaged trees made it difficult to work
at the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Devlin said recovery efforts would resume at 7 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Roseboom is 50 miles west of Albany.
