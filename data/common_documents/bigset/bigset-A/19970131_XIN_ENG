<HEADLINE> US Calls for Sustained Peace Momentum in Mideast </HEADLINE>

<P>
CAIRO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Edward
Walker said today follow-up steps should be taken to push forward
the peace process towards a comprehensive and durable peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
here, Walker said that preparations are under way for the visits
of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Moussa to Washington in
March.
</P>
<P>
The White House said Wednesday the leaders of Israel, the
Palestinian Authority (PA), Egypt and Jordan will hold separate
talks with President Bill Clinton in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu would visit
Washington on February 13, PA President Yasser Arafat will make
his visit March 3, with Mubarak going to the U.S. on March 10 and
Jordan's King Hussein on March 18.
</P>
<P>
On his assessment of the present situation as regards the peace
process, he said that with initialing the Hebron agreement, a
major step towards peace has been taken.
</P>
<P>
"All parties are convinced that this step must be followed by
others towards achieving overall peace in the area," he added.
</P>
<P>
The hope restarting peace talks on the Israeli-Lebanese and
Israeli-Syrian tracks has been rekindled after the Palestinians
and Israeli agreed after months of delay on details of an Israeli
troop withdrawal from 80 percent of Hebron and a timetable for
further redeployment from the rural areas of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he expects the Syrian-Israeli negotiations be
shortly resumed, he said that he does not exactly know when the
talks would start, but "definitely there would be negotiations" on
this track so that overall peace in the area can be completed.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said the U.S. is trying to get the two
sides back to the peace talks suspended 10 months ago after a
series of suicide bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said in Haifa Tuesday that he was certain Israel and Syria
would find a "bridging formula" to restart the U.S.-brokered
talks. His refusal to hand back the Golan Heights has raised
Syrian suspicions whether he is committed to peace.
</P>
<P>
"There are many areas on which there is no agreement and one of
them is the Golan," Netanyahu said. "In the end we will find the
way to renew the negotiations and complete them."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has
ordered the army to examine the country's security needs should
Israel return parts of the Golan Heights to Syria in a peace,
security sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Syria urged Arab countries to step up
pressure on Israel to make it abide by previous agreements.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Vice-President Abdel-Halim Khaddam, on an ongoing Gulf
tour seeking support for Syria's peace stand, has brushed aside
Israeli suggestions their bilateral talks are about to resume
after a 10-month break.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief's Letter Delivered to Cyprus president </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General's
special envoy for Cyprus, Han Sung Joo, today delivered a
letter from U.N. chief Koffi Annan to Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides, showing his determination to find a solution to the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after an hour-long meeting with President Clerides,
Han, who was accompanied by the U.N. resident representative in
Cyprus Gustave Feissel, said the discussion focused on a
letter he conveyed to the President from Koffi Annan, the
U.N. Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
"The letter conveyed a very strong interest and concern of
the Secretary-General on the Cyprus issue and his determination
to find a solution to the issue. It is of a general nature
and deals with broad issues," he told the press.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cypriot President was "very constructive" and
was "thankful" for the letter which he read "carefully".
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy reiterated that all initiatives on Cyprus
should be supportive of U.N. efforts to reach a settlement in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said after the
meeting that President Clerides and Han "concentrated on the
content of the letter Annan sent to the President and the
reiteration of U.N. willingness to involve themselves actively in
the efforts to reach a political solution to the Cyprus
problem in the context of the good offices mission".
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Cypriot President "reiterated our own
political will to cooperate positively with the efforts to
reach a political solution and our willingness to go into
direct negotiations after a period of preparation which will
give opportunities to these direct negotiations to succeed".
</P>
<P>
"we are more than ready to enter into a discussion on
specific issues which relate to various aspects of the Cyprus
question," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the Greek Cypriot side has no
conditions for direct talks. "We just say that, for the sake
of the success of these negotiations, there is a need for
good preparations beforehand," he added.
</P>
<P>
Han, who arrived here Wednesday for a week-long visit, also
crossed today into the Turkish-controlled part of Nicosia to
meet the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Han's current visit is part of international community's
efforts to reduce the tension on this Eastern Mediterranean
island following Cyprus government's decision to buy Russian-made
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles early this month.
</P>
<P>
After his stay in Nicosia, Han will fly on to Athens
and Ankara for talks with the Greek and Turkish governments on
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus remained partitioned since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of
short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Govt to Buy More Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Land and Water
Resources Deputy Minister Cain Mathema said today the government
needs at least one billion U.S. Dollars over the next 10 years to
buy land for the resettlement of some 92,000 landless families.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a one-day ecumenical documentation and
information center for eastern and southern Africa seminar here.
</P>
<P>
Mathema said, his ministry has since acquired a total of 3.4
million hectares which have benefited over 70,000 families. Plans
are underway to buy six million more hectares of land to settle
the remaining 92,000 families.
</P>
<P>
He said in 1990, the government adopted a new land policy
seeking to resolve the land distribution imbalances between
blacks and whites and to improve the original objectives of the
resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
''In an effort to facilitate more black indigenous farmers who
have the means and resources to enter into large scale commercial
agriculture, some 64,500 hectares of land were subdivided into 90
productive units and advertized to agricultural graduates,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mathema added the government is also considering land taxation
as another way of making whites give up their land because it
does not have money to buy enough land on a willing
seller-willing buyer basis.

<HEADLINE> EU Jumps on Cheap U.S. Call-back Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
realized that there is a tax loophole which helps United States
companies make fortunes by offering Europeans cheap international
phone calls. It vowed yesterday to closed it.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission (EC), responding to requests from its
15 member states, proposed imposing a value-added tax on
non-European companies so as to undercut the advantage they had
gained over European operators by offering cheaper services.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the EC, the EU's executive body, allows the
member nations to impose the tax immediately while pending
approval of EU-wide legislation.
</P>
<P>
Users of the so-called call-back services offered by U.S.
operators can avoid higher local phone rates by dialing a number
in the United States. This then calls the customer back, so giving
the caller access to lower U.S. rates.
</P>
<P>
EC sources said that Britain alone estimated that it might lose
about 800 million pounds (1.29 billion U.S. dollars) in revenue
each year if foreign operators dominated the market.
</P>
<P>
France took the first step to curb the situation earlier this
month by announcing the imposition of a 20.6 percent value-added
tax on non-EU phone companies in order to bar call-back services
from offering lower U.S. rates.
</P>
<P>
Mario Monti, the EU commissioner responsible for the single
market, said the move aimed to "suppress an unjustified advantage
now enjoyed by operators in third countries."
</P>
<P>
An EC official said Wednesday that the tax would apply to all
calls, including the cost of linking up to the Internet. But he
added that it would not apply to service providers, such as
CompuServe, since their fees were already subject to value-added
tax.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Economy May Outstrip Predictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish Government is
expecting a faster growth of the country's gross national product
(GNP) in 1997 than an earlier predicted 2.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Finance Minister Erik Asbrink expressed this optimistic
view on Wednesday at a seminar hosted by the Swedish business
weekly, "Veckans Affarer."
</P>
<P>
A revised GNP forecast will be presented by the finance
ministry on April 15.
</P>
<P>
"We have stronger evidence now than we had in the fall of an
economic upturn," said Asbrink. He was referring to an improved
rate of new industrial orders and other developments.
</P>
<P>
But the latest economic forecast from the Swedish Federation of
Private Enterprise estimates that 20,000-30,000 jobs will
disappear during 1997, a prediction which clashes with the
optimistic forecast of 24,000 new jobs presented recently by the
Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The gloomy approach is prompted by the Federation's beliefs
that the recession has yet to hit rock bottom, and that 1997 will
be another week year financially.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Crops Threatened by Heavy Rains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's expected bumper
harvest is under threat from widespread rains which have pounded
the southern African country for nearly a month, farming leaders
warned today.
</P>
<P>
They told the Zimbabwe News Agency forecasts of more rains
during February, the month during which Zimbabwe traditionally
receives heavy falls, would have disastrous consequences on such
key crops as maize, cotton, groundnuts and soya beans.
</P>
<P>
President of the Commercial Farmers Union Nick Swanepoel said,
''we are getting worried because of the rains and we will have
reduced yields of some crops. Particularly affected are the
maize, soya bean and tobacco crops.''
</P>
<P>
He said on the positive side, the country's major dams were
either full or spilling, ensuring adequate irrigation water for
such winter crops as wheat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association has said while the
rains had affected the early planted crop, farmers were still on
target to achieving another record production of over 220 million
kilograms, one of the highest in recent years.

A report by the group was quoted by the Washington Post today
as saying that an estimated 1.46 million black men of a total
voting population of 10.4 million have lost their right to vote.
</P>
<P>
In 13 states, laws bar 510,000 black men from voting because of
felony convictions. A remaining 950,000 in 46 states are
ineligible to vote because of laws regarding felony offenders in
prison, on parole or probation, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the current African American incarceration
rate is 7.66 times that of whites, up from the 6.88 times in 1988,
largely because of the 465 percent increase in the number of
blacks imprisoned on drug charges between 1986 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
Marc Mauer, assistant director of the Sentencing Project, said,
"The goal of crime policy should be to strengthen community
institutions, and not to create greater barriers to community
development."
</P>
<P>
He said, "National policies should focus more on front end
solutions involving prevention and treatment, rather than pouring
more resources into imprisonment on the black end."

<HEADLINE> UK Women Set to Make Up 46 Percent of Workforce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Great changes are taking place
in the make-up of the UK population, according to Social Trends,
the annual look at life in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The report found that Britain is becoming a nation of older
people with an increasing number of women in work. By 2006, women
are expected to account for 46 percent of the workforce.
</P>
<P>
The biggest losers are likely to be men aged between 55 and 59,
those who gain the most will be women between 25 and 34.
</P>
<P>
The working age population will continue to grow until 2011,
but will then start to fall. After a slow rise to 2011, the
numbers past state retirement age will increase by more than half
to nearly 15 million by 2034.
</P>
<P>
The number of children under 16 is expected to start falling in
three years so that by 2034 there will be 15 percent fewer than in
the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
The falling numbers of children and rising numbers of elderly
mean that by 2016 those over 65 are expected to outnumber those
under 16 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
More than three in 10 of these older men are likely to be
economically inactive by 2006 against just over a quarter in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The economic activity rate for the younger women is expected to
rise by 10 percentage points to 81 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Britain has an increasing number of
single people households. In 1971 single people made up just 18
percent of households.
</P>
<P>
However, this figure had risen to 28 percent by last year and
is likely to reach 35 percent by 2011. Factors causing this are
rising numbers of elderly, greater independence among the young,
people staying single for longer, and rising divorce rates.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Chairman Expresses Support for lower CPI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
Chairman Alan Greenspan urged the U.S. Congress today to take
steps to trim the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, Greenspan said
Congress should set up an independent commission that would
periodically determine how much the CPI overstates U.S. inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Fed chairman's comments marked the most influential support
so far for the recommendations to trim the CPI in the U.S. put
forward by a five-member advisory panel headed by Stanford
University economist Michael Boskin.
</P>
<P>
That panel issued a report last December, which said that the
current CPI was overstating the U.S. inflation by 1.1 percentage
points annually and that should be corrected by lowering the CPI.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan cited a recent internal study done by the U.S. Fed
that supported the Boskin commission's view of the CPI. He said
that there was a "very high probability that the upward bias
ranges between 0.5 percentage point per year and 1.5 percentage
points per year."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan urged the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S.
Labor Department, which produces the CPI, to fix the bias problems
that could be addressed quickly, such as updating the "market
basket" of goods more frequently.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations by the Boskin commission became
controversial in the U.S. as the proposed cut of the CPI would
reduce cost-of-living increases for millions of Social Security
recipients.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the move have charged that it would harm senior
citizens and represented a backdoor attempt to cut Social Security
and raise taxes.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Immigrants Arrested in Greece for Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- An Albanian illegal immigrant
was arrested today after being found in possession of five
kilograms of hashish which police believe he smuggled into Greece.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, Kegi Perberi, 21, illegally entered
Greece and met with a Greek accomplice, George Sotiriadis, 32,
in the northern town of Kastoria.
</P>
<P>
Both men were arrested while traveling in a rented car this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police in Pieria, northern Greece, have arrested two
brothers -- illegal immigrants from Albania, whom police believe
to be members of a gang which has been smuggling hashish into the
country.
</P>
<P>
The two were arrested after agreeing to sell three kilograms of
hashish to an undercover policeman for 1 million drachmas (about
4,000 U.S. dollars). The brothers gave 18 grams of the narcotic to
the policeman as a sample.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, police arrested seven Albanian illegal
immigrants outside Kozani, a town in northern Greece, and seized
104 grams of heroin, a homemade explosive device and three
electronic detonators.

<HEADLINE> UN to Send Observers, Soldiers to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Ten out of the expected 60
U.N. military observers are here to work out ways of how to
oversee the disarmament and demobilization of the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) rebels, diplomatic sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
''The others and 720 peacekeeping U.N. soldiers will come as
soon as the RUF leader gives his support to the operation,'' the
source said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire on Wednesday,
the RUF said the U.N. should scale down the number to 100.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. observers will also work out plans to reduce and
restructure the Sierra Leone army which grew from about 3,000 to
over 16,000 troops between 1991 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a delegation of the U.S.-run Sierra Rutile
Company, President Tejan Kabbah said, ''the demobilization and
disarmament of rebel combatants will begin in February,'' but he
did not give the exact date or what number of combatants will be
involved.
</P>
<P>
However, informed sources said February 15 ''seems a likely
start for the over 2,000 RUF combatants'' to be encamped, and
that they are made up mainly of boys and girls whose ages are
between eight and 14.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N., interviews with over 2,300 street and
unaccompanied children in the southern town of Bo and Kenema in
the east showed that 28 percent of them had been associated with
the RUF.
</P>
<P>
the sierra rutile delegation spoke of plans to ''recommence
operations'' in march and will re-employ about 3,000 Sierra
Leoneans in addition to 60 expatriate staff.
</P>
<P>
The mines were overun by rebels in 1994 and a number of senior
staff and eight foreign nationals were abducted for months before
the foreigners were released in Guinea after the intervention of
the International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Sierra Leoneans abducted opted to stay with the
RUF, taking up senior positions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South African mercenary group, Executive
Outcomes (E0), have pulled out of the diamond mining town of Kono
in the east ahead of next month's deployment of U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace agreement signed last November in
Abidjan, the EO ''will be withdrawn five weeks after the
deployment of a neutral monitoring group.'' The entire EO group
will stay near the capital until their departure, observers said.

<HEADLINE> Zaire Accuses Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi of Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Zaire today accused Rwanda,
Uganda and Burundi of attacking its troops in eastern Zaire, where
fightings have been going on between Zairean government forces
(FAZ) and Tutsi rebels since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
"The military sources confirmed that the FAZ in the eastern
part of the country are attacked by the armed forces of Uganda,
Rwanda and Burundi," the Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted a
Zairean military bulletin as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean military said the troops of the three neighboring
countries are attacking on different fronts parallel to the
eastern frontier of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"The same sources specify that these troops have taken
position in the following way: the Uganda military forces combat
on the northern sector on the axis of
Beni-Buni-Watsa-Butembo-Isoro (in northern Kivu province); the
Rwandan troops attack on the axis of Walikale-Lubutu (in northern
Kivu and Upper Zaire)...; the Burundian troops move in the south
and attempt to reach Kalemie (south Kivu province)," said the
military bulletin, entitled "Depeche 002-Correspondence de
Guerre."
</P>
<P>
It said that despite the international arms embargo imposed in
Zaire, the Zairean government forces are more determined than ever
to recover the territories occupied by the "bad forces, which are
Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi."
</P>
<P>
Rwanda denied Wednesday an accusation by Belgium that thousands
of Rwandan troops are fighting in Zaire, while Uganda has denied
an allegation by Zaire over the attack launched by Ugandan troops
upon Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Leaves for Davos to Attend Forum, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides left here today for Davos, Switzerland, to attend the
annual World Economic Forum, where he will also have a meeting
with new U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking prior to his departure at the Larnaca Airport,
President Clerides said his Saturday meeting with the U.N. chief
had been requested by Annan himself.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious we will exchange views on the Cyprus
problem, its recent developments and future prospects, as well
as the humanitarian issue of the persons missing" since the
1974 Turkish invasion of the island, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that he will present the U.N. chief
with the government's negotiation points on the issue and that he
intends to ask him to meet with a delegation of relatives of
missing persons.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day stay in Davos, President Clerides is also
expected to discuss the Cyprus problem with other heads of state
and foreign ministers participating in the economic forum.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a letter conveyed to him earlier today by
U.N. chief's special envoy for Cyprus Han Sung Joo, President
Clerides said Annan expressed concern about the dangers of the
protracted de facto situation on the island.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also informed President Clerides he will convey
relevant letters to the Prime Ministers of Greece and Turkey,
Costas Simitis and Necmetin Erbakan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
U.N. chief's special envoy Han Sung Joo is currently on the
island for talks with leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities in an effort to bring them to negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained split since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island following an abortive
Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Denies Beating Jordanian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today denied a
Jordanian newspaper report which claimed maltreatment of Jordanian
prisoners in Kuwait prisons.
</P>
<P>
Adel Ibrahim, Director of Kuwaiti Interior Ministry's Public
Relations, said in a statement that Jordan's Al-Dostour newspaper
report was "baseless" and lacked credibility.
</P>
<P>
He also asserted the Kuwait is keen on maintaining human
rights in general and the rights of inmates in particular in
accordance with local and international norms and laws.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian newspaper said Wednesday Kuwaiti security men
recently beat Jordanians who have been jailed in Kuwaiti Central
Prison since the 1991 Gulf War, sending some to hospital with
serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim confirmed that security measures were taken recently
in the prison, but these were "not aimed at a certain
nationality, they were designed to enforce the prison
regulations which were violated by some prisoners."
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry allows teams of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit the prison
without any conditions and at any time. He accused the
Jordanian newspaper of tarnishing the image of Kuwait by
"publishing such a baseless report."
</P>
<P>
Some 34 Jordanians have been imprisoned in Kuwait for
supporting the Iraqi occupation forces in 1990.
</P>
<P>
They received visits recently by family members from Jordan.
Fifty one Jordanians came to Kuwait for three days around
January 20 to visit their relatives in prison on a trip
arranged by ICRC.

<HEADLINE> First Child Soldiers of Angolan Army Demobilized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government today
demobilized the first 213 group of child soldiers in its army
under an agreement it signed with former rebels in 1994 to end
two decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major step toward a lasting peace in Angola," said
Blondin Beye, the United Nations Special Envoy to Angola
overseeing implementation of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The child soldiers, aged from 13 to 17 years, were estimated
at 1,000 in the Angolan Armed forces and were demobilised in a
ceremony at a base in capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
They will be taken by the International Organisation for
Migration (IOM) to their homes, some in UNITA-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 1,000 child soldiers from the former rebel
movement, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), have been demobilized, a process which began at the end
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Angolan military officials said the use of child soldiers was
a "regrettable" result of the civil war, which erupted when
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
</P>

<HEADLINE> CBI Rejects Tories' Strike Curb Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Conservative government's
latest proposals to curb trade union power were rejected by the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the UK's biggest employer organization has
rebuffed a Conservative government effort to use legislation to
curb union action.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said in a statement released here today, employers
believed the current framework of industrial relations law,
established by the Conservative over the past 17 years, was a
"sound basis for good employee relations."
</P>
<P>
It said there was "no need now for a further major reform of
the law."
</P>
<P>
The members of the CBI were responding to proposals, published
late last year by Ian Lang, president of the Board of Trade, for
further legal action in industrial disputes.
</P>
<P>
In a green paper, the government proposed removing certain
union immunities and seeking reballoting on industrial action.
</P>
<P>
It also proposed repealing some of the remaining rights Labor
granted to unions in the 1970s, including time off for trade union
activity.
</P>
<P>
Adair Turner, CBI secretary-general, said member companies had
been consulted widely on their attitude to the government
proposals.
</P>
<P>
However, Colin Marshall, CBI president, denied the CBI's
decision was a "snub to the government."
</P>
<P>
"We are an apolitical organization. All we are doing is
responding to the views of our members," he added.

<HEADLINE> Ford Reports Higher Earnings for 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Ford Motor Company
reported higher earnings for the fourth quarter and all of 1996,
despite continued losses in the European and Latin American
markets.
</P>
<P>
Ford said it earned 4.4 billion U.S. dollars in net income for
the whole year, compared with 4.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
During 1996, Ford embarked on a global reorganization drive
called Ford 2000, meant to slash billions of U.S. dollars in
product development costs over the next few years. It expects to
cut as much as 1 billion U.S. dollars this year from the annual
105 billion U.S. dollars cost of running its operations, U.S.
newspapers reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the European market, the U.S. car market will pose
as another trouble spot for Ford. Its top-selling Taurus faces
stiff challenges from a restyled Toyota Camry and new Honda Accord
set for this fall, according to a report by the USA Today.
</P>
<P>
Japanese automakers are getting benefit from the weakened yen,
which makes it cheaper for them to develop and build vehicles in
Japan, allowing it to keep price increases to a minimum in the
USA, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts noted that 80 percent of Japanese cars sold
in the U.S market are built in the U.S., making the weak yen
less important than it was when Japanese automakers relied
heavily on imports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the company also faces similar challenges of General
Motors and Chrysler, who have found that domestic buyers are
obsessed with pick-ups, sport utilities and minivans.

PARIS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A Mirage 2000 D bomber-chaser of

Meurthe-et-Moselle, showed serious engine problems and refused to
follow command one hour after taking off.
</P>
<P>
A Mirage 2000 NK2 from the same 133 Air Base was shot down on

<HEADLINE> Water Utilization Runs Low in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia currently
utilizes no more than five billion of the total 110 billion cubic
meters of water resources at its disposal.
</P>
<P>
Kidane Assefa, an official from the Ministry of Water
Resources, announced the figures at a training course for water
engineers and technicians.
</P>
<P>
The inability to keep track of current technological advance
is a major constraint for the full utilization of water
resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country needs to promote the participation of private
investors in the water industry and the spread of modern
technological appliances in a bid to effectively use its water
resources, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has planned to install 40 automatic
water level recorders each year so as to raise the number of
hydrological gauging stations to 575 in five years, according to
the sources from the Ministry of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
Now there are a total of 375 hydrological gauging stations in
the country. enditem

<HEADLINE> Moscow to Deal With Chenchnya's Recognition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government will react
strongly towards any attempt at recognizing Chechnya as a sovereign
state, the Russian Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Foreign Ministry Mikhail Demurin told a
briefing that "there are forces which would continue to puff up
the issue of ripping the Chechen republic off the Russian
Federation."
</P>
<P>
Demurin warned that any "obviously unfriendly" actions towards
Russia, such as recognition of Chechnya or steps towards such
recognition, would be dealt with with "most strong" reaction from
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He also reminded the recent remarks by Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov about the issue, who had said the counter-measures
which Moscow could take may go as far as the severing of diplomatic
ties.
</P>
<P>
Moscow carefully monitored the world's reaction towards the
status of the Chechen Republic and held the view that "the
international community clearly understands that Chechnya is an
integral part of the Russian Federation," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
There was a sign showing that Chechen President-elect Aslan
Maskhadov intended to press for Chechnya's independence.
</P>
<P>
He told Itar-Tass in an exclusive interview Wednesday that
"although under the Khasavyurt accords the question about the
status of Chechnya was put off for five years, it would be
appropriate to begin solving it as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Moscow was unaware of any statements by executive
officials of any state that would contradict the principle of
Russia's territorial integrity, spokesman Demurin said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Chirac on NATO Before Chirac's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today called French President Jacques Chirac to discuss NATO's
relations with Russia prior to Chirac's trip to Moscow this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
"They talked about the importance that a NATO charter with the
Russian Federation will play as we adapt NATO for the future and
the challenges of the post-Cold War era," White House Spokesman
Mike McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"And it is important, because of the way NATO functions, for
the alliance to operate in harmony and in unison," he added.
</P>
<P>
French and the U.S. have differences over a series of issues on
NATO, ranging from the alliance's command structure and a NATO
charter with Russia.
</P>
<P>
However, McCurry said, "We've had a very good cooperative
working discussion within NATO about how the charter discussions
with the Russian Federation should unfold."
</P>
<P>
Reports say that France want a binding charter with Russia
while the U.S. does not want anything binding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Paris also demanded that the command of NATO's
southern European forces should be in the hands of a European,
which was strongly opposed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
During their 30-minute conversation, Clinton and Chirac also
discussed the agenda for the NATO'S summit in July in Madrid.

<HEADLINE> 2 Million Cairenes Swarm to Book Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 2 million or one out of
eight Cairenes have visited the 29th Cairo Book Fair in an
unrivaled show of interest in the colorful books and
entertainments offered at the cultural feast, which coincides with
the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Even Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi decided to share his
views tonight with local intellectuals on his new book "Long Live
the State of the Lowly" at a seminar held on the sidelines of the
two-week exhibition, which has been extended for five more days
until February 5.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi took on, via a satellite connection, a large audience
of Arab and foreign intellectuals, writers and critics who
debated his vision of a number of issues raised in his book.
</P>
<P>
As many avid book-lovers roam the place and ended up grudging
the price which is not uncommon ranging from 80 to 120 Egyptian
pounds (about 24 to 35 U.S. dollars), a large number of Arab and
Egyptian publishers expressed happiness over the rate of selling.
</P>
<P>
The General Egyptian Book Organization has alone sold books
worth one million pounds (294,100 dollars).
</P>
<P>
In a city of 15 million, the turnout has soared after artistic
soirees featuring Arab artists started in the Fair Ground, located
in the Nasser City of the Greater Cairo, where about 2,400
publishers from 79 countries have put up 3.6 million books in 27
pavilions.
</P>
<P>
In the Chinese pavilion, nearly 2,000 newly-published books
from 26 publishers are on display, the Chinese-language "A
biography on Mubarak" is conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
Among the wealth of books neatly laid out on shelves, the
Arabic versions of some Chinese literary classics and reference
books such as the Arabic-Chinese dictionaries have attracted large
crowd.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the bountiful varieties of intellectual fodder, an
amitious program of seminars and folk art performances add more
flavors to the annual fair, which was originated in the demand for
provision of proper culture at affordable costs for the majority
of low-income Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the book fair has a glimpse of the cultural
and folk art from seven Arab countries, Oman, Kuwait, Syria,
Libya, Morocco, Tunisia and Palestine at a series of special
soirees given by these participants.
</P>
<P>
It also becomes a rare place for a cluster of great Arab poets
to give solo soirees to recite their new works and conduct free
discussions with their fans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some of the 100 or so young talents from remote
provinces have got the chance to recite their works at mass
soirees.
</P>
<P>
Artistic elements apart, Cairo originated the book fair 29
years ago out of a pragmatic need to present local people with the
latest Egyptian and foreign books, encyclopaedias, dictionaries and
reference books at moderate prices.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the fair has grown into the second largest and
one of the most important in the world, with many publishing
houses competing to get a pavilion.
</P>
<P>
A string of seminars and discussions were centered on future
prospects of Egypt, the Arab world and the international arena,
with the participation of some cabinet ministers, intellectuals
and other celebrities.
</P>
<P>
To add a more cultural aroma to the event, 41 short,
documentary and cartoon films are being aired by the National
Cinema Center to give visitors a rare chance to appreciate the
development of the special genre of the Egyptian cinema.

<HEADLINE> HK SAR Preparatory Committee Session Opens in Beijing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qian said that the first Chief Executive and the Provisional
Legislative Council will start their work before June 30, 1997,
and that the Chief Executive will be responsible for all work
involved in forming the first SAR government before that date.
</P>
<P>
This includes nominating principal officials and reporting this
to the Central People's Government for approval, appointing
members of the Executive Council, and so on.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Preparatory Committee will offer full support
to Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, and will not interfere in any of
the Chief Executive's work.
</P>
<P>
He said that, according to the Preparatory Committee's decision
on establishing the Provisional Legislative Council, the laws
examined and approved by the council before July 1, 1997 will take
effect after the establishment of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Legislative Council is the legislature of the
Hong Kong SAR, and a different legal system from the Legislative
Council of the British Hong Kong authorities, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As for when the Provisional Legislative Council starts operation
and what its missions are, he said, these must accord with the
decisions of the National People's Congress and the Preparatory
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Just as in the case of the final Legislative Council of the
British Hong Kong authorities, Qian said, the final Urban Council,
Regional Council, and District Boards of the British Hong Kong
authorities will cease to exist on June 30, 1997, with the end of
British rule in Hong Kong, according to a motion put forward by 32
deputies, which was adopted by the NPC Standing Committee in
August 31, 1994.

<HEADLINE> HK SAR Preparatory Committee Session Opens in Beijing (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In order to ensure a smooth transition, the political panel of
the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee for
the Hong Kong SAR put forward a suggestion that provisional
regional organizations be established in the Hong Kong SAR, he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
He said the Preparatory Committee made the decision in a timely
fashion and passed on the suggestions to the first Chief
Executive for reference, adding that this move will no doubt help
form the provisional regional organizations.
</P>
<P>
In referring to handling existing Hong Kong laws, Qian said,
the general principle is to adhere to the Basic Law, that laws
previously in force in Hong Kong will remain basically unchanged
as stipulated by the basic law, and as few changes as possible
will be made.
</P>
<P>
He said that 1997 is a year with far-reaching significance and
that two great events will take place: One is the opening of 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China; the other is
China resuming exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Today's opening session was presided over by Wang Hanbin,
vice-chairman of the Preparatory Committee. Some 139 members were
present.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A leading newspaper in Vietnam
today strongly criticized the coming Vietnamese language
broadcasts by United States run Radio Free Asia (RFA).
</P>
<P>
Nhan Dan, the official newspaper of the Vietnamese communist
party, described the Vietnamese language broadcasts as an
escalation of the "peaceful evolution" strategy of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper pointed out in a commentary that "Washington's
strategy was to run Radio Free Asia to oppose any countries,
particularly socialist countries, which refused its impositions
and control."
</P>
<P>
The RFA was a product of the cold war, and an instrument of
ideological and cultural invasion, to interfere in the internal
affairs of Asian countries including Vietnam, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Despite protests from the publics of Asian nations, RFA
continued its plan to broadcast in Mandarin, Tibetan, Vietnamese,
Burmese, Korean, Laotian and Khmer, the newspaper said.

</P>

"This is the clear ideal of all our compatriots," he said. "If

our people would become poorer."
</P>
<P>
He called upon all people who illegally possessed weapons, and

"This means that you are contributing to creating in Cambodia a
society of peace, order, justice, lawfulness and security," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Justice Minister Urges Law, Order. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A top Cambodian justice
official appealed to all citizens today "to respect laws, and
observe public order."
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Chem Sngoun, speaking at a press conference,
urged the people to solve all problems through application of laws
instead of arms.
</P>
<P>
"If we try to solve problems by arms, the issues in focus will
become more serious and the construction and development of our
country will become impossible," Sngoun said.
</P>
<P>
"We are all trying very hard to build our country into a lawful
state and everyone should respect laws. If we solve problems by
using force of arms, all foreign aid we now survive on will be
cut," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that more than 4,000 cases were waiting to be
tried because of lack of judges, and the difficulties in creating
courts.
</P>
<P>
"There are only 135 judges actively presiding over the courts
throughout the country, and another 42 who have been trained and
waiting for appointment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sngoun complained that the delay in convening the Supreme
Council of Magistracy, a judicial body in charge of appointing and
replacing judges, was due to disagreement over its composition.
</P>
<P>
According to a royal cabinet statement days ago, the two prime
ministers of the Royal Government must agree on candidates for the
council before they are named by the King.

TOKYO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto left Tokyo today for Toronto, Canada, for talks with
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori on the protracted hostage
standoff at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima.
</P>
<P>
They will hold their first face-to-face talks since Peruvian
rebels took over the residence on December 17 during a party to
celebrate the Japanese emperor's birthday.
</P>

The rebels of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, who are
still holding 72 hostages, have demanded the release of some 400
comrades form Peruvian jails, but Fujimori has rejected the demand.
</P>

Hashimoto's primary goal is to urge Fujimori to ensure the
safety of the hostages and to show the world the close cooperation
between Tokyo and Lima through which they hope to bring about an
early end to the crisis, Japanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders may issue a joint statement after their summit
talks if they reach agreement on the matter, top government

LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Ultrasound, used to view unborn
babies, may help to treat leukaemia by activating anti-cancer
drugs, says the British medical journal, The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
The report says Japanese researchers have found that
photo-sensitive drugs, which are activated by having light shone
on them, can also respond to ultrasound.
</P>
<P>
Dr Katsuro Tachibana, from School of Medicine of Fukuoka
University, said: "Long duration of light exposure would be needed
to treat even a small amount of blood. Ultrasound, on the other
hand, is relatively easy to use for treating large volumes of
blood.
</P>
<P>
"The energy levels are also comparable to diagnostic ultrasound.
</P>
<P>
"Although more evaluation is needed to fully understand the
mechanism of this treatment, the use of ultrasound to activate
photo-sensitive drugs in the treatment of various diseases may be
anticipated," he said.

Legislative Council were chosen in Shenzhen by the Selection
Committee, and that the Council has been recognized by Hong Kong
society and media.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the excessive reaction of the British Foreign
Secretary and the British Hong Kong government one day before the
selection was unreasonable and unnecessary.

<P>
Qian congratulated Rita Fan on being elected President of the
Provisional Legislative Council, and expressed the belief that the
provisional legislature will work in an orderly way with the
common efforts of all its members.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Wins Right to Recover Large Oil Field in the Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- China has beat off fierce
international competition to recover oil from an extra-large
oilfield in the Sudan which has proven oil reserve of 220 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
It will be the largest oil field construction project China has
ever undertaken overseas, as well as one of the largest oil field
cooperation projects in the world, according to Zeng Xingqiu,
deputy-director of the International Cooperation Bureau under the
China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC).
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese oil field project to be launched in March covers a
total area of 50,000 square kilometers, and is expected to develop
an annual oil output of 15 million tons at the beginning of the
next century.
</P>
<P>
China is launching, or will start, a total number of 18
large-sized petroleum and petrochemical projects worldwide this
year. The projects have a total contractual value of 750 million
US dollars, with eight of them each exceeding 30 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The projects include an oil refinery in Malaysia, the oil field
in the Sudan, oil and gas fields, as well as trans-national oil
and gas transmission pipelines in Turkmenistan, a gas pipeline in
Thailand, oil and gas drilling wells in Mongolia and Bangladesh,
as well as an oil storage project and oil refinery restoration
project in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China is undertaking oil prospecting and production
in Canada, Peru, Thailand and Venezuela. China is also likely to
have other cooperation opportunities in Russia, the United States,
Pakistan, Kuwait, Mexico, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Argentina,
Ecuador, Indonesia and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that in Kuwait alone, China has passed
preliminary qualification examination for undertaking another five
petroleum and petrochemical projects this year, with total
investment topping three billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has undertaken over 30 large-sized petroleum and
petrochemical projects in 13 countries and regions, and has
established a worldwide reputation for building large engineering
projects, according to Qin Anmin, president of the China Petroleum
Engineering Construction Corp (CPECC).
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has given top priority to developing
petroleum markets in Asia, and has expanded petroleum undertakings
to the Gulf area, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Central Asia with
Kuwait, Pakistan, Malaysia and Kazakhstan as their bases.
</P>
<P>
However, China will continue to rely mainly on its own oil and
gas resources by drawing on foreign funds to quicken oil
prospecting in western parts, as well as offshore areas of the
country, in addition to further tapping oil reserves in the aging
oil fields in the eastern parts, stressed Zhou Yongkang, the
newly-elected CNPC president.
</P>
<P>
China, he added, will also try hard to ease its shortage of
domestic oil and gas supplies by exploiting overseas petroleum
markets, or importing limited amounts of oil and gas resources.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Market Suffers Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus stock market
accentuated its downward trend this week, since investor
psychology deteriorates as a result of the political turmoil on
the island.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued today by the Cyprus Investment
and Securities Corporation Limited (CISCO), its All-Share Index
closed Thursday at 372.3 points, having suffered weekly losses
of 19.3 points or 4.9 per cent. At current price levels, the
market registers a capital depreciation of 10.1 per cent in the
current year.
</P>
<P>
The report said it is quite evident that the main driving
force currently governing the market's direction is investor
psychology rather than company fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
The political turmoil caused by the island's government
decision to purchase the Russian S-300 air defense system still
preponderates market sentiment which is exacerbated by the fact
that the economic outlook for 1997 primarily in relation to the
prospects of the tourist industry remains quite blurred at the
time.
</P>
<P>
The report anticipates that the market will remain weak
until clearer messages on economic performance come forth.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports that Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE) hits
an all-time low, Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou
described Thursday the drop in share prices as "a corrective
move."
</P>
<P>
The minister said he had no reservations to state in public
that the stock exchange operates satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that during his meeting with the CSE board,
views were exchanged about the feasibility of introducing
specific tax-incentive measures to help boost the interest of
investors.

<HEADLINE> China Mulls Laws on Highway, Animal Epidemic Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council, the
country's cabinet, is preparing to present for approval two new
draft laws on highway and the prevention of animal epidemics to
the top legislature, the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The two drafts were discussed and passed in principle at the
54th executive meeting of the State Council, presided over by
Premier Li Peng here today.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, when China started its reform and opening up, major
progress has been made in highway construction. But in general,
the existing roads are of low technical level, road conditions are
poor, and planning of road construction is still not scientific or
good enough. Meanwhile, random fee collections and fines along
highways have been rampant, with parts of highways and their
subsidiary facilities occupied illegally. It is necessary to
further regulate construction, maintenance, protection and
management of the country's highways, and protect the legal rights
of all parties who invest in, manage and use the highways, the
State Council said.
</P>
<P>
The draft comprises of 100 articles in nine chapters.
</P>
<P>
Formulation of the law on prevention of animal epidemics aims
to safeguard the country's husbandry production, rural economic
development, and entry of husbandry products into the world
market, according to the State Council.
</P>
<P>
It is also imperative for the prevention, control and
extinguishing of animal epidemics to ensure public health, it said.
</P>
<P>
The seven-chapter draft law, with 56 articles, carries
stipulations on the prevention, control, extinguishing of animal
epidemics, quarantine of animal products, relevant supervisory
measures and legal consequences.
</P>
<P>
The two drafts will be revised before being submitted to the
top legislature for deliberation and approval.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Continue To Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Australian wool prices
continued to fall this week and were likely to be further tested
at sales next week, analysts warned today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) said the
eastern market indicator fell 7 cents to close at 598 Australian
cents (466.5 US cents) per kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
A total of 69,857 bales were offered with a pass-in rate of
12.6 percent, significantly higher than last week, ACWE said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Prices fell across most micron categories, with a sharp fall in
prices at the start of the week which eased on the final day of
sales.
</P>
<P>
"Market sentiment was positive at the close of sales, with
continuing interest from China reported at current price levels,"
ACWE said.
</P>
<P>
Another source held that there were signs of strength at sales
in Adelaide, particularly in the broader end of the market, and
suggestions of new Chinese business boosted by the falling
Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Next week 110,700 bales are rostered for sale in Goulburn,
Melbourne and Fremantle.

</P>
<P>
They also say that forest resources should be evaluated by

<HEADLINE> Israel Probes Claims About Inventor Edison's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli postal officials
are investigating allegations that the famous inventor Thomas
Edison was an anti-Semite, before he may appear in an Israeli
stamp.
</P>
<P>
The 3.50 shekel (about 1.2 U.S. dollar) commemorative stamp
depicting the U.S. scientist, who invented the incandescent
light bulb and the phonograph, is supposed to be featured at the
upcoming Asian Philatelic Exhibition in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Edison is only the fifth non-Jew to appear on an Israeli
stamp, after Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart and Raoul Wallenberg.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to include Edison on the stamp was made by
Israel Postal Authority's planning committee and approved over a
year ago by the Ministerial Committee on Symbols and Ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
But the Postal Authority and Israel Philatelic Service began
Thursday an investigation after being informed of the claims
that Edison could have been an anti-Semite.
</P>
<P>
Post Authority spokeswoman Cigal Galil said a philatelic
service research team had consulted an encyclopedia and found
nothing hinting at Edison's anti-Semitism. But she conceded the
team did not refer to any biographies.
</P>
<P>
Galil did not rule out the possibility of canceling the
issue of the stamp despite that this would entail a financial
loss and embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
The claims that Edison had anti-Semitic views were raised by
Steph Esrati, a philatelic journalist in Ohio of the United
States, and by Ken Lawrence, a vice-president of the
56,000-member U.S. Philatelic Society.
</P>
<P>
Some others pointed to the so-called indications over Edison's
anti-Semitic views. In the recent book The Invention of
Solitude, author Paul Auster states that Auster's father was
once hired as an assistant by Edison only to be dismissed the
next day because Edison learned that he was a Jew.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 1991 book What Did They Think of the Jews ?,
edited by Allan Gould, specifically deals with charges that
Edison may have hated Jews. "Was Edison anti-Semitic? There are
some indications that he was," Gould writes.
</P>
<P>
One example was that Motor Car developer Henry Ford, known
for anti-Semitic views, sent Edison a compete set of volumes of
the International Jew, "in a special leather presentation
binding. Edison graciously accepted with 'thanks,'" Gould said.
</P>
<P>
However, even Gould acknowledged that the evidence on
Edison's anti-Semitism is far from conclusive, since except for
the notes he wrote when Edison was an old man, he "never made an
anti-Semitic comment to anyone," according to Gould.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hebrew University's Sasson Center on Anti-Semitism
was also unable to provide concrete information on Edison's
anti-Semitic views.

<HEADLINE> Thai Doctors Commended for Research on Dengue Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Two Thai and one American
doctors were conferred the annual Mahidol Award here today for
their research in dengue fever and rehabilitation of drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand conferred them each with a
medal, a certificate of honor and a cash prize of 50,000 US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two Thai doctors, Dr. Prasong Tuchinda and Dr. Suchitra
Nimmannitya, were commended for their work contributing to a
decline in death from dengue fever in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The mortality rate has declined from 12 percent of the Thai
population 25 years ago to a mere 0.5 percent at present in
Thailand and 2.3 percent in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Based on his studies on children, Dr. Prasong found that the
fever caused leakage of blood from the blood vessels, leading to
loss in minerals and protein, which sent the body into a state of
shock.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that it was the shock that led to the death of the
children, not the bleeding, as previously assumed.
</P>
<P>
His findings significantly altered the basic treatment of
dengue fever.
</P>
<P>
The other doctor, Dr. Suchitra, categorized dengue fever into
different levels to improve its diagnosis, particularly in respect
to the resources available in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
She (rpt she) also played a major role in promoting the
adoption of international standards of procedures in diagnosis and
treatment of dengue fever in Asia and South America.
</P>
<P>
The studies of the American awardee, Dr. Vincent Dole, of the
Rockefeller Foundation, established a relationship between the
abnormal condition of the nerves and drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
His research is in the area of opiate receptor or methadone
maintenance treatment for drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
His pioneering work has directly and positively influenced the
lives of over 150,000 patients addicted to morphine and heroin
worldwide, restoring them from a criminal lifestyle and potential
death from drugs to a normal functional lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization has adopted many of the
principles developed by Dr. Dole and methadone maintenance therand regions.
</P>
<P>
The Mahidol award, named after Prince Mahidol, father of King
Bhumibol, is the most prestigious in the field of medical sciences
and public health in Thailand.
</P>

The award was institutionalized in 1992 as an international

<HEADLINE> HK Deposits, Loans Slightly Down in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Both deposits and loans and
advances decreased slightly during December 1996 as compared with
the previous month, according to statistics released today by the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
</P>
<P>
Total deposits fell by 1.1 percent in December, reversing the
rise of 3.6 percent in November. This resulted from decreases in
both HK dollar deposits and foreign currency deposits of one percent
and 1.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in HK dollar deposits was led by a 3.5 percent
decline in time deposits, which outweighed rises in both demand
and savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
Total loans and advances fell slightly by 0.2 percent in
December, following a rise of 2.5 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by currency, HK dollar loans fell by one percent while
foreign currency loans grew by 0.3 percent during the month.

FREETOWN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of factional
fighters in the west African state of Liberia are handing over
their arms before a United Nations deadline expires later today.
</P>
<P>
However, diplomats in Liberia's capital Monrovia disclosed
that barely 20,000 of a total of 60,000 fighters have handed in
their weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that some have kept their weapons in case fighting
erupts again," said a diplomat in a telephone interview by this
correspondent in Freetown, capital of neighboring Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"There were still long queues of soldiers waiting to exchange
their arms for food, educational vouchers and special identity
cards which could entitle them for additional assistance from
international aid agencies," said a U.N. observer.
</P>
<P>
"There is an air of optimism around and everybody hopes it
will be a lasting peace to end the seven-year-old war," he added.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Have All Sewage Water Treated by Mid-1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Government has vowed to
have all sewage water treated by mid-1998 following the
inauguration of a second large treatment plant in one of its two
islands called Taipa on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jose Alves Paula, secretary for transportation and public
facilities of the Macao Government, said that the government plans
to build a third sewage water treatment plant by mid-1998, when
all sewage water will be treated before releasing into sea.
</P>
<P>
The newly-operated plant, which cost the government 160 million
Patacas (about 20.3 million US dollars), is capable of disposing
of 70,000 cubic meters of waste water daily.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the plant can meet the demand for the next 20
years in the Taipa Island, where the Macao International Airport
is seated. Currently, it treats 12,000 cubic meters of water a
day.
</P>
<P>
Macao's first sewage water treatment plant started operation
in 1995 in the Macao Peninsula, where some 95 percent of Macao's
residents live, treating 75,000 cubic meters of water a day.
</P>
<P>
Paula said that bidding for the construction of the third
plant in the Coloane Island of Macao has finished, and the project
is expected to be started soon this year.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has 450,000 residents, but only a little more than
20,000 people live in the two islands. Population in the two
islands is expected to grow fast in the coming years.

LAGOS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government today
suspended the rescue work on the crash of an ADC flight which
claimed all 143 lives on board.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 727 aircraft crashed into the lagoon near Lagos,
Nigeria's largest business center, on November 7, 1996, 10
minutes before it was expected to land at the international
airport in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Rescue work on the lagoon has been difficult especially due to
the lack of sophisticated equipment. Only bits of human flesh and
the airplane were brought out of the water.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, the hull of the plane still lie in the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the black box of the plane was found and was sent
to a Boeing factory in the United States for analysis.
</P>
<P>
Details of the report, which had been submitted to the
Nigerian government, is still unknown, but Alex Ajuyah, chairman

up "with a categorical statement and proof of what actually
caused the accident."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President On Privatized Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga today said the country's several privatized ventures
had benefited only a few capitalists under the previous regime.
</P>
<P>
At a special press conference this afternoon, she said that the
government had under a special legislation re-acquired seven
failed privatized ventures by the previous government which were
today in dire liquidity straits and had retrenched workers.
</P>
<P>
The ventures re-acquired by the state were the Hingurana Sugar
Industries Ltd., Kantalai Sugar Industries Ltd., Mattegama Textile
Mills Ltd., Kahatagama Mines Ltd., Sri Lanka State Trading
Hardware Corporation, CCC Fertilizers Ltd., and the State Trading
Fertilizer Corporation.
</P>
<P>
She said that the investors that had purchased these ventures
had obtained huge bank loans from state owned banks and had not
repaid them. In fact they were not in a position to ever pay them
back.
</P>
<P>
She said the private sector had a role to play in Sri Lanka's
economy and will be invited even to participate in the form of
joint ventures to restructure the previously state owned ventures
which were repossessed recently.
</P>
<P>
All displaced employees will be re-employed and their living
standard guaranteed by the government, the President pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the extent of the fraud perpetrated on the country
by the privatization of these ventures, she said losses ran into
millions of rupees and purchases were made on false declarations.
</P>
<P>
She added that her government was for privatization for the
benefit of the country but through transparent transactions which
will benefit the country only.

BONN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The business adviser to tennis
star Boris Becker is being investigated for tax fraud, it was
revealed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But magistrate Manfred Wick declined to say if the action
against Axel Meyer-Woelden was linked to a search carried out in
Becker's house by tax inspectors shortly before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Last December the mass circulation Bild Zeitung revealed that
tax inspectors had searched Becker's home as part of a probe into
his tax situation for 1990 to 1993, when the former world number
one lived in the tax haven of Monaco.
</P>
<P>
Bild said four inspectors left his house armed with several
dossiers although a spokesman for Munich's tax authorities refused
to confirm or deny the story.
</P>
<P>
Becker himself was not at home at the time of the inspectors'
visit.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month a German court jailed Peter Graf, father of
women's world tennis champion Steffi Graf, for three years for tax
evasion on his daughter's earnings.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Leaders Sue Tang for Further Defamation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew are suing Tang Liang
Hong, a defeated candidate of the Workers' Party during the
general election early this month, for further defamation, local
television reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new case is brought up over comments Tang made in The
Straits Times on or about January 23 which was published the next
day.
</P>
<P>
The article reported Tang's views on the series of defamation
suits brought against him by the ruling People's Action Party
(PAP) leaders. The article was headlined "Tang asks court to
strike out three defamation suits."
</P>
<P>
Lee Kuan Yew is also suing Tang over his comments made in
another interview with The Straits Times on or about January 10,
which was published the next day. The Straits Times report was
headlined "I fled as I feared being arrested: Tang."
</P>
<P>
Both Goh and Lee gave notice of their legal action in
advertisements placed in The Straits Times today. They are
claiming damages as well as costs.
</P>
<P>
Tang fled the country soon after the general election of the
country held on January 2. He was called by the PAP leaders as an
"anti-Christian" and "Chinese-Chauvinist" during the election
campaign period.
</P>
<P>
The PAP leaders started suing Tang during this period towards
the end of last year over his comments made in an interview with
The Straits Times, in which he said the PAP leaders were telling
lies.

<HEADLINE> China's Vice-Premier On Hong Kong's Provisional Legislature (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said
today in Beijing that the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) will be responsible for all work
involved in forming the first SAR government before June 30.
</P>
<P>
In an opening speech for the eighth plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, Qian, who is chairman
of the committee, gave the opening date for the Provisional
Legislative Council's work and said that it must accord with
decisions of the National People's Congress and the Preparatory
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the "Decision of the National People's Congress on
the Method of Forming the First Government and the First
Legislative Council of the HK SAR", which states: "The Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong SAR shall be responsible for preparing
the formation of the first SAR government in accordance with the
Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
This preparatory work includes nominating principal officials
and reporting this to the Central People's Government for
approval, appointing members of the Executive Council, and so on,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Before June 30, the Chief Executive must assume other powers
authorized by the Basic Law, including drawing up government
policies, proposing budgets and bills, and submitting them to the
Provisional Legislative Council for approval, and appointing a
committee to recommend judges, he said.

<P>
The Chief Executive must also nominate members of the Basic Law
Committee with the President of the Provisional Legislative
Council and the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal, and
report this to the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress for approval, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian also said the Preparatory Committee will provide full
support to the Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, and will not
interfere in any of the Chief Executive's work.
</P>
<P>
In referring to the Provisional Legislative Council, he said
that it must finish preparatory work concerned with SAR
legislation before June 30.
</P>
<P>
Because the "through-train" arrangement has been sabotaged, a
certain amount of legislation is essential soon after the
establishment of the SAR, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the Preparatory Committee's decision on
establishing the Provisional Legislative Council, the laws
examined and approved by the Provisional Legislative Council
before July 1, 1997 will go into effect after the SAR is
established, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Provisional Legislative Council, the
judicial body of the Hong Kong SAR, is a different legal system
from the Legislative Council of the British Hong Kong authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to a decision by a meeting of the Preparatory
Committee's chairman and vice-chairmen, he said, suggestions from
some people of Hong Kong were accepted to decide on the work
of the first Chief Executive and Provisional Legislative Council
before June 30, 1997, at the eighth plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee.

TOKYO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Organisers of the 1998 Nagano
Winter Olympics were criticised Friday by a former national
Olympic committee head.
</P>
<P>
Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, billionaire businessman who headed the
Japanese Olympic Committee in 1990, complained that the Nagano
Olympic Organising Committee (NAOC) had refused to improve
ski-jumping facilities.
</P>
<P>
The committee had rejected a request by the International Ski
Federation (FIS) to install floodlights at ski jump venues in
Hakuba, citing financial and environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
Tsutsumi said such floodlights could be installed at a cost of
70 million yen (580,000 dollars), against an early estimate of 700
million yen.

<HEADLINE> China to Get Huge Loan for Petrochemical Technology Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- To boost the development of its
petrochemical industry, China plans to introduce from Germany, the
United States and Japan 430 million US dollars-worth of technology
and equipment for manufacturing ertalyte, an key chemical used in
fiber production.
</P>
<P>
Luoyang General Petrochemical Works in Henan Province and
Tianjin Petrochemical Co. today signed agreements with several
foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
The funding, which will come from cooperation loans from the
Export and Import Bank of Japan and export credits from Germany,
the United States and Japan, will benefit two key petrochemical
projects.
</P>
<P>
Each of the projects is designed to produce 200,000 tons of
ertalyte annually and is expected to help improve the industry's
structure, said senior officials from the China Petrochemical
Corporation (Sinopec), the parent company of the Luoyang and
Tianjin companies.
</P>
<P>
Polyester is useful in the production of polyester fiber,
packaging materials, film and audio and video products.
</P>
<P>
A Sinopec expert said 400,000 tons of ertalyte used for
chemical fiber production could equal the output from 533,000
hectares of cotton fields.
</P>
<P>
Both projects were started during the Eighth Five-Year Plan
period (1991-95) and are to be completed by 2000.
</P>
<P>
China is is capable of producing some 1.9 million tons of
ertalyte a year. By the turn of the century, the capacity will
increase to 2.6 million tons.

<HEADLINE> China's Car Makers Competing for Market Share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Sales of domestically-built
cars in China hit a dead-end in the past year - the third year of
stagnant sales.
</P>
<P>
Now the industry is fighting back on the road to success with a
series of measures to boost sales. Price-cuts and new-style car
bodies to make them more appealing to customers are just two of
the steps.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say China's auto market has remained stagnant
since 1993, with the country failing to reach its production
targets for three successive years.
</P>
<P>
Though the central government's policy on the automotive
industry is encouraging, some local governments in China have
placed unfavorable obstacles in the path of the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
Some cities have restricted road access to smaller economy cars
for various reasons, they said.
</P>
<P>
Industry observers also see the large numbers of imported and
smuggled cars into China as having a negative impact on the
country's fledgling domestic auto industry.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China has eight major car production bases.
Changchun-based FAW-Volkswagen, Wuhan-based Aeolus-Citroen
Automobile Corp., Shanghai Volkswagen Automobile Corp., and
Tianjin Automobile Industry Company are the four largest. They
have a combined capacity of producing 650,000 cars a year.
</P>
<P>
A price war broke out early last year among local car
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Volkswagen took the lead in cutting prices, with other
local car makers following close behind. Some companies axed their
prices by about 20,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, FAW-Volkswagen turned out some new products with
metallic body paint and other cosmetic changes to make their
models more attractive. But the output of Jetta cars, one of the
company's main models, was just 26,000 in 1996, far less than the
planned figure.
</P>
<P>
The economists noted that the increasingly fierce competition
will help enhance the quality of domestic cars as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Increasing production to achieve a better efficiency is now the
common goal for most domestic car makers in China, they said.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Marathon Champion Beaten in Roadside Scuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Olympic marathon champion
Josia Thugwane was sent to a hospital with a bloodied, bruised
face from a beating by another motorist in a roadside scuffle,
police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a series of problems for Thugwane, who
became a national hero in August by winning the marathon on the
final day of the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Thugwane, 25, was the first black to win a gold medal for South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
After his victory, though, Thugwane has been troubled by
jealous neighbors at home who have threatened to attack him or rob
him because of his success. Thugwane had to move his family for
protection.
</P>
<P>
He also had a legal wrangle after changing his mind about a
contract he signed with an agent in Atlanta. With the help of
South African sports officials, Thugwane got out of the contract.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Thugwane was driving a pickup truck near the town
of Bethal in Mpumalanga province east of Johannesburg when he
tried to pass a coal truck in his lane, police Capt. Doep du Plooy
said.
</P>
<P>
When he saw an oncoming car, Thugwane pulled across the road to
avoid it because he lacked room and time to get back behind the
coal truck. The car went between Thugwane's vehicle and the
truck, and the driver then stopped and punched Thugwane, dragged
him out of his pickup truck and beat him further, du Plooy said.
</P>
<P>
Thugwane, who stands about 155 centimeters and weighs 45
kilograms, was hospitalized with bruises, cuts and facial
swelling, according to police.
</P>
<P>
The other driver was arrested and could face assault charges,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, before his Olympic victory, Thugwane survived an
attempt to hijack his car as he drove near his home. He jumped
out and suffered a cut chin from a gun shot fired by one of his
attackers.

CIAE has blazed a new trail in putting scientific and research
institutes to industrial use, the senior official added.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei: Iran Ready to Confront US Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said here today that Iran is ready to
confront any potential U.S. military strike against the Islamic
republic.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a large group of Friday prayer worshipers on the
Tehran University campus, the 57-year-old Iranian leader said in
his strongly-worded speech that Iran is ready to defend itself
by all means at its disposal.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei termed some western reports in the past two months
on potential U.S. military strike against Iran as "rumors."
</P>
<P>
"The spread of such rumors is a psychological war waged by
the United States against Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "if they think wisely, they would understand that the
war will be in the interests of Iran and would be at their
loss."
</P>
<P>
While assessing the current situation, especially what he
called the potential military attack by the United States, the
Iranian leader said, "I don't believe it but it is possible."
</P>
<P>
"If anyone who thinks that this nation can be intimidated by
threat, that will be a big mistake," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the Iranian people would never change its
stand despite the threat.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States has never stopped its hostile
activities against Iran since the Islamic revolution in Iran in
1979.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States tried to harm relations between
Iran and other countries which insisted on dialogue with Iran,
but it failed.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader noted that no matter what kind of actions
the U.S. is trying to take, the Iranian people are firm in their
Islamic revolution and will never yield to any foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's remarks came apparently as the first response by
Iran's supreme leader to the latest report that the United States is
working out a special program to wage a military strike
against 19 Iranian targets, including extremist training camps and
nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Khomenei made the strong-worded
address in front of a large gathering in a bid to ease worries and
horror among the public.

<HEADLINE> Ratsiraka Comes Back as Madagascar's President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Didier Ratsiraka staged a
comeback today as the high constitutional court in Antananaraivo
declared him as president, having won 50.7 percent of the votes
in last December's election, a report from the island said.
</P>
<P>
Aged 60, Retired Admiral Ratsiraka ruled Madagascar, the
fourth largest island in the world from 1975 to 1992 this time
defeated Albert Zafy who got only 49.3 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
He was beaten in 1993 by Zafy in Madagascar's first
multi-party polls, ending his 16 years as military ruler.
</P>
<P>
Ratsiraka returned to Madagascar from two years in exile in
Paris to run against Zafy and campaigned on promises of a
"humanistic and ecological" republic in Madagascar, with a
population of 14 million people.
</P>
<P>
Ratsiraka, a slight, good-looking man, was born on November 4,
1936, into a wealthy family at Vatomandry on the east coast and
was brought up as a Christian. He remains a fervent Roman
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his failing eyesight, he said, "I have problems
seeing, but I am not blind."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A New Year's celebration was
held today at the Great Hall of the People for more than 1,100
overseas Chinese, including citizens who have returned from abroad
together with those who live abroad and have come home for the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Wan Guoquan, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
delivered a speech at the gathering.
</P>
<P>
He said China made many achievements in the reform, opening and
modernization drive last year, which laid a good foundation to
further implement the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and the
long-term target for 2010.
</P>
<P>
China is presently politically stable, the various ethnic
groups are united, and the society is also advancing, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese people who live overseas have been very
successful in activities involving the economy, politics, science,
and culture, and have also contributed to the development of the
countries where they live.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they have been actively helping with the
construction of their motherland through investment, and put
forward the principles "peaceful reunification", and "one country,
two systems", he said.
</P>
<P>
Wan said he hoped that those present at the gathering will
establish closer ties with compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Macao as well as overseas Chinese in the new year. He also urged
them to play a more active role in China's various construction
causes and the peaceful reunification, to greet the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China and Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
Today's gathering was held by the Overseas Chinese Affairs
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), and the Liaison
Subcommittee for Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao Compatriots and Overseas

<HEADLINE> State Council Holds Anti-corruption Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- China has resolved to continue
the fight against corruption and to build an honest government in
the new year, Premier Li Peng said this afternoon at the fifth
anti-corruption meeting of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Affirming the progress of the anti-corruption campaign in the
year past, Li noted that "the work on anti-corruption is
unbalanced," and that "some leading officials in some places still
have a poor sense of hard work and plain living."
</P>
<P>
"Corrupt phenomena are still serious, and are spreading," the
premier warned, adding that the number of cases involving big sums
of money is growing.
</P>
<P>
Building an honest government and deepening anti-corruption is
an important mission in building the Communist Party and state
power, and is a powerful test for governments at various levels,
according to the premier.
</P>
<P>
"Ideologically, we must be fully prepared for the long-term and
arduous struggle against corruption," he said.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the work to be done this year, Li said that priority
will be put on promoting self-discipline among officials, who
should not own unapproved housing, use public money for their own
enjoyment, engage in nepotism, or conceal their true income.
</P>
<P>
He warned governments at various levels and government
departments not to set excessive fees for farmers and enterprises,
especially those that are state-owned.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out the anti-corruption must be handled
comprehensively through education, prevention, supervision and
building a sound legal system. In particular, the supervision over
individual power must be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
He urged officials, especially at the senior level, to set an
example in observing the Party's regulations and state laws.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that during the Spring Festival period, officials
should limit their social activities and spend more time visiting
disaster-hit areas, poor families and enterprises facing
difficulty.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier On Handling Existing Hong Kong Laws (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- As few changes as possible
should be made to the existing laws in Hong Kong in order to
observe the provision of the Basic Law that the laws previously in
force in Hong Kong will remain basically unchanged.
</P>
<P>
This is the general principle of the suggestion put forward by
the legal panel of the Preparatory Committee for handling existing
laws in Hong Kong, Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the Eighth Plenary Session of the
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), Qian, who is chairman of the Preparatory Committee,
said that the Preliminary Working Committee has done a thorough
study of the existing laws.
</P>
<P>
From that, the legal panel of the Preparatory Committee studied
the laws and submitted suggestions on handling existing Hong Kong
laws to the Eighth Plenary Session for approval. In regard to this
he said that "the general principle is to reflect the Basic Law,
that laws previously in force in Hong Kong will remain basically
unchanged, and the fewer changed the better."
</P>
<P>
Solutions to various problems in existing laws which contravene
the Basic Law should be worked out according to individual
conditions and in a down-to-earth manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Western media have recently played up the matter to give
the impression that we made a sudden proposal to greatly revise
Hong Kong's laws, and even claimed that the laws on the mainland
will be moved to Hong Kong," he commented

<P>
In fact, things are exactly the opposite, he said, noting
that this is not a new question.
</P>
<P>
Several years of study of the Hong Kong laws, since the
Preliminary Working Committee, show that, of the more than 600
Hong Kong ordinances and over 1,000 subordinate legislative items,
most will remain in effect and be adopted by the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, except for a dozen of ordinances and
subordinate legislative items, and partial articles and clauses of
some 10 other ordinances and subordinate legislations, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The Bill of Rights Ordinance which people are concerned about
will be retained, and only articles and clauses overriding other
Hong Kong laws will be abolished, he said.
</P>
<P>
All in all, he said, the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region will only apply its Basic Law and retain the laws
previously in force in Hong Kong, basically unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Only a few national laws stipulated in Annex 3 of the Basic Law
will be implemented in the future Hong Kong SAR and they are
limited to national defence, foreign affairs, and those beyond the
limit of its autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"This completely conforms to the principle of 'one country, two
systems'," Qian said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A computer system that can
accurately tell the weight of a pig simply by looking at it has
been developed by British scientists.
</P>
<P>
The machine, called "Watch 'em Grow", uses a camera mounted
above the pig's trough to take a picture from which the animal's
size is calculated, says today's Daily Telegraph newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Computer software analyses the image and compares it with a
record of other pigs of known size and weight to determine the
animal's weight.
</P>
<P>
"It's as effective as a conventional farm weighing crate," said
Paddy Schofield, a research scientist who has developed the system
at the Silsoe Research Center, a food and agriculture institute.
</P>
<P>
"If you knew the breed of the pig at a county show and could
place the camera in the right place above the pig, then you could
certainly win the 'Guess the pig's weight' competition."
</P>
<P>
The next stage of the system would be able to tell the meat
properties of each animal. Schofield said: "We should be able to
know how much of the pig will be ham, bacon, chops and pork
joints."

<HEADLINE> Syrian Vice-President Rules Out Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice-President Abdul-
Halim Khaddam has ruled out the prospect of military
confrontation between Syria and Israel in case the peace
process stumbles, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam, who is currently on a visit to Qatar, said at a press
conference Thursday night that if the peace process stalls, it is
not inevitable that this will lead to military tension.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we do not believe the regional and international
community will accept the idea of Israel resorting to new
aggressive operations."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Israel's rejection to resume negotiations with
Syria from the point that had been reached, or in case of failure to
honor what the previous Israeli government had agreed upon, it
would mean a return to square one.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam said that it was up to Israel to adopt a different
political stand and move along the steps already covered in the
previous peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Arab mediation between Syria and Israel,
Khaddam said that Syria will not accept any mediation as this
will mean walking away from the all-Arab stand.
</P>
<P>
On a joint Egyptian-U.S. mediation between Syria and Israel for
the resumption of negotiations, Khaddam said Egypt was no broker
but a party in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the United States is a co-sponsor of the
peace process, and Syria is expecting fresh U.S. efforts for
the resumption of the process.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that U.S. President Bill Clinton would
be able to persuade Israel to abide by the negotiated agreements
already reached.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian vice-president reiterated the importance of an
effective European role in the Mideast peace process, because the
situation in the region would reflect either positively or
negatively on world security and peace.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question about Arab solidarity, he underscored
the need to enhance Arab solidarity, warning against external
dangers that threaten the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
On the developments in Sudan, Khaddam said his country
opposed any foreign interference in the internal affairs of
any Arab state.
</P>
<P>
He said that any foreign intervention in Sudan or any other
country was intolerable, adding that threat to Sudan was in fact
a threat to the Arab national security.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian vice-president, accompanied by Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara, arrived in Doha, Qatar Thursday for an official
visit.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam staged a seven-nation tour to the Gulf region this
week. He has already visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates, Oman and Bahrain and is scheduled to proceed to
Sanaa on a visit to Yemen to complete the tour.

<P>
HARARE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Sudan's special envoy Gabriel
Roric warned here on Thursday that its domestic conflict has
threatened peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Roric, whose government accused neighboring Ethiopia and
Eritrea of aiding Sudanese rebels who have captured several key
cities, warned that the Sudanese government would soon be forced
to defend its territory against the "invasion" by its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Both Eritrea and Ethiopia have denied involvement in the
conflict, while Sudan's northern Arab neighbor, Egypt, has
described the conflict in Sudan as an "internal affair".
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese envoy said his mission in Zimbabwe's capital of
Harare was to brief the Zimbabwean government on the gravity of
the situation before President Robert Mugabe assumes the
chairmanship of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in July
this year.
</P>
<P>
Roric said the Eritrean forces shot down a Sudanese military
helicopter inside Sudan on January 12, killing three crew
members.
</P>
<P>
"Our message to African leaders is that they should sit down
and see how the conflict can be possibly resolved," he said,
adding that the on-going peace initiatives between the government
and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army were likely to be
jeopardised by the "aggression".

<HEADLINE> Court Goes to Private Dwelling to Handle Cases for the Aged (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Living-room justice is helping
elderly people in China to use the country's legal system.
</P>
<P>
In the country's first system of its kinds, courts are holding
their hearings in the homes of old or house-bound plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
It means that if the elderly are unable to go to court - the
court will go to them, judges, jurors and all.
</P>
<P>
Gu from downtown Shanghai never dreamed that at his age he
could win a lawsuit without going to court. But the judges came to
him, and held their court in his own dwelling.
</P>
<P>
"I was lying in my bed, and I won the case," Gu said excitedly.
</P>
<P>
He had been run over by a bicycle and suffered broken legs. He
took out a lawsuit for compensation at the Court for Senior
Citizens in the Jing'an District of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Gu was unable to walk, and well above the age of 70, so the
bench specializing in litigation involving the aged decided to
hold the court hearing in his home.
</P>
<P>
Gu's 16-square-meter living room was crowed with judges,
jurors, the defendant, lawyers and Gu's neighbors. After a first
instance trial the defendant immediately reimbursed Gu.
</P>
<P>
It was one of the 1,200 lawsuits involving aged litigants that
the Jing'an court has handled since it set up a special bench
involving senior citizens in 1991. The bench is the first of its
kind in China.
</P>
<P>
"The court was set up to understand and specialize in the
physical and psychological characteristics of aged people, as well
as the specific features of their cases, and to protect their
legitimate rights," according to a senior judge in the court.

Second marriages for elderly people have been difficult in
China because children often object. Today, pensioners wanting to
get married feel safer under the protection of the district's
specialized court.
</P>
<P>
Wang, an elderly woman, was one potential bride-to-be in the
middle of a family turmoil. Her adopted daughter tried every
means to prevent her from remarrying. Wang asked the court to
sever the adoption ties with her daughter. The court ruled
according to law and obliged, and now Wang leads a happy life with
her new husband.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has become the first city in China to enter the
so-called "gray-haired" society. And Jing'an district, located in
central downtown area, has seen the fastest growing aged
population in Shanghai. Of 400,000 residents in the district, 24
percent are above the age of 60.
</P>
<P>
"The aging population has become a major social issue, as one
fifth of the civil lawsuits we handle involve senior citizens," a
judge at the Jing'an court said.
</P>
<P>
To cater to the needs of aged litigants, the local court decide
to prioritize cases put forward by senior citizens, offer home
services to people aged over 70 or other people unable to go to
the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
The local court has held court hearings outside the courtroom
over 50 times in the past five years. Jurors also go to the
streets once every week to receive lawsuits from the aged.
</P>
<P>
They have also provided consultation services to over 1,000
aged people in the same period of time.

JERUSALEM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Foreign Ministry
will soon consider proposals to close some embassies and
consulates around the world in order to cut down expenses,
reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the demand to cut 45 million shekels (some 13.5
million U.S. dollars) from its 1977 budget, the ministry has
already begun implementing a series of cutbacks at its
representative offices throughout the world, the report quoted a
ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Those involved in information, public relations and cultural
work will no longer be paid overtime. Attention is now turning
to the more crucial decision of which embassies and consulates
will be closed.
</P>
<P>
Senior ministry officials have a short list of 25
representative offices throughout the world, including the
consulates in San Francisco and Philadelphia of the United States
and the embassy in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry's Asian division believes it will have
to close more than one of its missions.
</P>
<P>
While Burma seems a likely victim, a source in the division
said it is not slated for closure. With the embassies in the
Philippines, India, Thailand, Japan and China seemingly safe,
attention is turning to the embassy in Vietnam and the
consulates in Bombay and Shanghai. "These could be downgraded to
economic offices, under the auspices of the Industry and Trade
Ministry," said the ministry source.
</P>
<P>
The cost of an Israeli embassy or consulate official is some
150,000 dollars a year. Small representative offices tend to have
two officials, with a back-up staff. It is estimated that a
medium-sized office's running cost annually totals 1.5 million
dollars, with the larger embassies running up bills for millions
of dollars.

<HEADLINE> East Chinese Port Ready for Direct Shipping With Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Xiamen City in east China's
Fujian Province has become one of the first ports to set up direct
navigational ties with Taiwan Province, which lies just across the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Since New China was born in 1949, all shipments between the
mainland and the Taiwan island have had to go in a roundabout way,
mainly through Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides reached an agreement in Hong Kong early last
year, and a dozen Taiwanese shipping companies have applied to the
authorities in Xiamen for direct shipping licenses.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen is a large port, ranking fifth in China in
container-shipping, and by the end of this century is expected to
have a yearly capacity of 30 million tons of cargo and one million
containers.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several decades, Xiamen has developed better
roads, railways, and sea transportation facilities and has become
a major transit point for bilateral trade between the mainland and
the island province. Local authorities have made an effort to
simplify handling procedures for goods shipped between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
They have also become more familiar with matters related to the
direct shipping, such as document-verification, customs duties,
currency clearance, customs supervision, and quarantine
procedures.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Employment gains were not
enough to cut into the jobless rate last year in Australia,
despite a fall in participation rates, the official Australian

<P>
In trend terms, full-time employment rose 29500 in 1996, 0.5

the ABS said.
</P>
<P>
For males, trend employment rose by 0.9 percent in 1996, down
from 2.2 percent in 1995, but many men were only able to find
part-time jobs, underlined by a 6.7 percent rise in the number of
males joining the 51,900 who became part-time workers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1996, Successful Year for Myanmar in Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Police Major-General Soe Win,
secretary of the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC)
of Myanmar, stated here on Thursday that Myanmar had made great
achievements in fighting against drug abuse in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The fact, that the fruit of these success will greatly benefit
not only the Myanmar people but also those of the world community,
cannot be denied," Soe Win emphasized at a narcotic drugs
destruction ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Observers here generally agreed with the official's statement.
</P>
<P>
Since January last year, former drug warlord Khun Sa and his
Mong Tai Army (MTA) have unconditionally surrendered to the
Myanmar government in succession, bringing the number of the
surrendered to 14,949 by the year-end.
</P>
<P>
Narcotic drugs, seized in 1996 by the authorities, increased in
quantity as compared with that of previous years. A total of 2,080
kilograms of narcotic drugs including 504 kilograms of heroin and
1,300 kilograms of opium was confiscated by law enforcement
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 5,540 persons were apprehended in 1996 in 3,771
cases and death sentences were passed on 20.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, more than 18,411 kilograms of narcotic drugs,
including 1,961 kilograms of heroin and 11,912 kilograms of opium,
have been burned and destroyed in Yangon, capital of Myanmar,
alone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 710 Kilograms of heroin and opium were destroyed in
border regions by ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, 14,197 hectares of poppy fields, secretly grown on
mountains, slopes and valleys in remote border areas, mostly in
Myanmar's Kachin, Chin, Rakhine and Shan states, have been
discovered and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar armed forces, in their military operations against
drug traffickers between 1994 and 1995, killed 468 men and they
themselves lost 272, the latest official figures revealed.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been cooperating not only with neighboring
countries but also those in the region in its drug control
efforts. Myanmar has signed bilateral agreements on drug control
with China, Thailand, India, Bangladesh, Laos and Vietnam, and
most recently, the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is also cooperating with the United Nations agencies.
</P>
<P>
A sub-regional action plan to control illicit trafficking and
abuse of narcotic drugs was agreed upon in Yangon last May by the
6 MOU countries --Myanmar, Laos, China, Thailand, Vietnam and
Cambodia, as well as the United Nations Drug Control Program
(UNDCP) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
Myanmar stressed that they are determined to continue their
endeavors against drug abuse even if such efforts and achievements
are not appreciated and no outside assistance is forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that despite the achievements made by
Myanmar in its drug control efforts, there remain serious
challenges which include the splinter groups of Khun Sa's MTA who
have not yet surrendered to the government.

meeting the costs for their food, clothing and general welfares.
</P>
<P>
The bill also demands that all 39 districts of the country
establish a family children's court which is empowered to order a
parent to provide money to maintain his or her children.
</P>
<P>
It also provides that the child maintenance order shall cease
to be valid on the child at the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
In February last year, Uganda's television launched a children
TV program aimed at developing self-awareness among children
through education and entertainment. The program was targeted at
children of the 1-15 age group.
</P>
<P>
Another purpose of the program was to give children a chance
to express themselves in an adult-free environment.
</P>
<P>
In March 1995, Uganda officially opened a SOS Village near
capital Kampala for about 100 would-be street children. It
consists of three nursery schools, a primary school #,a modern
clinic, several scholastic amenities and residential houses.
</P>
<P>
In April, 1995, the Ugandan government and the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) launched a Children Program 1995-2000.
The program, worth 110 million U.S. Dollars, was aimed at
improving children status in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
In September 1995, a non-government kids organization in
Uganda decided to build a new street children center at Mbarara
town, southwestern Uganda, in a bid to redress crime, poverty and
ignorance among street children. It will accommodate 2000
children, half of the street children roaming in the country's
big towns in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Further more, workshops and seminars have been held regularly
in the country to caution parents against exposing their children
to risky situation such as child abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's first Child Abuse Awareness Week ended here in June,
1995 with a strong "resolution" passed by the children that
anybody guilty of child abuse should be "sentenced to death".
</P>
<P>
The government also paid much attention to child immunization.
Since a child immunization program was launched by the United
Nations Environment Program several years ago, the country has
achieved over 70 percent immunization coverage against polio and
more than 70 percent coverage against measles.
</P>
<P>
As a key element to improve children's status, the government
has since last year registered over 4.3 million children in the
country for universal primary education. It is a system of free
primary education for four children of each family.
</P>
<P>
With the above measures taken by the government, the children
situation has been improving with infant mortality rate down from
122 per 1,000 live birth in 1991 to 97 per 1,000 live birth in
1995.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of the universal primary education
system this year, children enrolement rate in the primary school
will go up from 2.1 percent of 3.98 million 6-12-year-olds last
year to 81.6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Despite these achievements, the government is still facing
major challenges as the status of the Ugandan children is still
one of the worst in the world.
</P>
<P>
For instance, child mortality rate in Uganda remains one of
the highest in the world and chronic malnutrition among the
children is still very serious.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, due to the AIDS pandemic, the number of orphans and
street children affected has reached 1.9 million at present, up
from 1.5 million in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there is still a long way for the Ugandan
government to improve children's status in the country.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Hanbo Group Chairman to Be Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Supreme Public
Prosecutor's Office (SPPO) decided today to arrest Chung
Tae-soo, chairman of the Hanbo Group, charged of fraud and
embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
The decision was based on the outcome of cross-interrogations
of Chung and his former financial officer Kim Chong-kuk on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors confirmed that Chung has floated bad checks in an
attempt to raise funds and also diverted part of the bank loans
extended to finance capital investment in his steel company for
unauthorized purposes.
</P>
<P>
Chung, to be additionally charged with violating the bad check
control, mutual savings as well as financial company laws, was
found to have drawn bad checks totaling 57 million U.S. dollars
and drawn 52 million dollars in loans from Hanbo Mutual Savings
and Finance Company, where he is the controlling shareholder, far
beyond the limit to the controlling shareholder under the law.
</P>
<P>
After the arrest, the prosecutors will try to find out if he
had bribed bank or government officials for the privileged loans
and whether high-profile figures had pressured creditor banks to
give the loans to Hanbo.
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's questioning, the prosecutors asked Chung
about how he secured six billion U.S. dollars in bank loans since
1992 without sufficient collateral, and how his flagship firm,
Hanbo Iron and Steel Company, became insolvent.
</P>
<P>
Hanbo Iron and Steel Company was declared bankrupt by its
creditors on January 23 after failing to honor billions of
U.S. dollars in notes.
</P>
<P>
The Hanbo case has become a major political issue in South
Korea as the opposition parties claimed that the government headed
by President Kim Young-sam had imposed pressures on the creditor
banks to grant loans to the debt-ridden company.
</P>
<P>
Investigations into the Hanbo case started on January 27 and
offices of 16 Hanbo firms and the homes of Chung and his four sons
were searched on the following day.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Former security guard
Richard Jewell, 34, has signed a movie deal with Rupert Murdoch's
20th Century Fox for rights to the story of his ordeal in the
Olympic Park bombing.
</P>
<P>
According to Daily VarietyThursday, the deal, signed with Fox
and producer Linda Obst, covers rights to Jewell, his family and
attorneys and a Vanity Fair story titled "An American Nightmare."
</P>
<P>
The paper did not give the value of the deal, although previous
reports said Jewell had been negotiating with Fox for about
500,000 U.S. dollars a report said.
</P>
<P>
Lin Wood, an attorney for Jewell, could not immediately confirm
the report. But he acknowledged Fox had won the upper hand over
other Hollywood studios that were interested in telling Jewell's
story.
</P>
<P>
Jewell was named by the Atlanta Constitution as a suspect in
the July 27, 1996 bombing that killed two people and injured more
than 100 at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
For the next three months Jewell was hounded by television news
crews and federal agents, who searched his home but never found
any evidence against him. The Justice Department publicly cleared
Jewell in October of all suspicion in the case and he has since
embarked on a legal battle, suing various news organisations and
individual FBI agents, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Tightens Control on Use of Public Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, January 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 23 million
U.S. dollars of public funds were misused by government
institutions and state-run businesses last year, Mongolia's
procurators said.
</P>
<P>
The abuse was discovered after Mongolian procuratorial and
supervisory departments strengthened supervision on the use of
public funds.
</P>
<P>
The State Procuratorial and Supervisory Commission and
provincial departments checked more than 2,200 government offices
and state-run businesses across the country last year and found
out many cases involving misappropriation of public funds,
L. Zhavzmaa, head of commission told a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
Of the 16 billion tughrik (23 million dollars) discovered, more
than 6 billion tughrik (about 8.6 million dollars) have been
recovered and more than 400 people involved in the cases were
punished, Zhavzmaa said.
</P>
<P>
Social welfare accounted for the biggest individual area of
abuse, with more than 900 million tughrik (1.3 million dollars)
being misused, Zhavzmaa said.

<HEADLINE> India Allows FII Investment in Government Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to reform the
country's capital market, the Indian government has decided to
allow foreign institutional investors (FII) to buy government debt
instruments.
</P>
<P>
Foreign institutional investors are also allowed to make
portfolio investment in the Indian capital market out of their
"proprietary funds" and a stock lending scheme, with capital gains
tax exemption being introduced.
</P>
<P>
The decision is "yet another step toward the eventual full
convertibility of the rupee," Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Montek Singh Ahluwalia listed the safeguard
measures which the government proposed to take to ensure that
India's foreign debt remains within manageable limits and FII
investment in government securities does not lead to a debt trap.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government had earlier allowed foreign institutional
investors to invest in corporate debt instruments, without limits
placed on the amount of their investment in equities.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the decision to allow proprietary FII funds to make
portfolio investments, Chidambaram said foreign institutional
investors had been permitted to bring in only the funds they
manage (such as overseas pension, provident and mutual funds), but
now they could also bring in "their own funds."

<HEADLINE> Nepali Airline Staff Against Boeing Lease Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A workers' union of the Royal
Nepal Airlines (RNA), the country's national flag carrier, has
asked Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to intervene and stop the
airline's attempt to lease a wide-body jet, sources here said
today.
</P>
<P>
The RNA Employee Union handed over a memorandum to the prime
minister Thursday demanding that he direct the concerned
departments to prevent efforts being made to lease a Boeing-767
from a British broker.
</P>
<P>
Arguing that a deal on a lease-purchase basis would be better
for the long-term interests of the RNA, the union also asked the
government to provide the state-run airline with guarantees for
such a deal.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing-767 chosen by the RNA management for lease is too
expensive, raising concerns about whether it could be operated
profitably, union sources said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that five RNA officials last week went to
London to sign the aircraft leasing contract with the British
aircraft broker, which has agreed to lease a Boeing-767 jet to the
RNA for a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
However, so far no contract has been signed yet, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Statistics Highlight Bulgaria's Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's economic crisis which
triggered the current political unrest in the country was put into
stark relief today as official figures show the dire state of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The annual income of the average Bulgarian fell a staggering 70
percent in 1996, Zahari Karamfilov, head of the State Statistic
Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics for 1996 also indicated Bulgaria's gross
domestic product fell 8-10 percent last year to 1700 billion leva
(one U.S. dollar equals about 900 leva).
</P>
<P>
Farmers had left three quarters of the country's arable land
fallow. Although industrial production fell 1.1 percent over 1995,
it has fallen by 45.3 percent over the level seen in 1989. And the
production volume of diesel generators, once one of the country's
pillar industries, was only five percent its 1989 level
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade volume in 1996, excluding December, was eight
billion U.S. dollars, a 26 percent drop over 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
Karamfilov said that the output value of state-owned
enterprises fell 5.9 percent over 1995, while the private sector,
which account for 35 percent of manufacturing industry, dipped by
5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's currency, the leva, has plunged, inflation has
soared and new President Petar Stoyanov warned Western countries
this week that Bulgaria may have to default on its foreign debt of
10 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic crisis has plunged the country into
political chaos. Prime Minister Zhan Videnov resigned last
December over the situation.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Socialist Party, which is only half way through its
four-year term, has since run a caretaker government as outgoing
President Zhelyu Zhelev refused to give the party a mandate to
form a new government headed by their nominee Nikolai Dobrev.
</P>
<P>
Anti-government protests have swept the country daily since the
beginning of the year as students and opposition groups demand
immediate elections, accusing the socialists of mismanaging the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Workers launched a general strike on Wednesday as part of the
political protest but also demanding higher wages to compensate
for the soaring inflation.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's new President Petar Stoyanov finally gave Dobrev a
mandate to form a new cabinet on Tuesday after the Socialists
refused to agree to immediate elections.
</P>
<P>
Dobrev at first appeared to reject repeated calls by opposition
parties to surrender the mandate and hold elections immediately.
</P>
<P>
But he said Thursday that he step down if anti-government
demonstrations would agree to a compromise, but said the cabinet
must still be run by a Socialist.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's ruling Socialists have appealed for talks with
opposition parties to fix a date for early elections. They have
indicated they are prepared to bring forward the polls - due at
the end of 1998 - to the autumn, while agreeing to form a
coalition government in the interim.

things on all other countries in the region.

"That is wrong, it is a lack of respect, a lack of courtesy for
a foreign diplomat to intrude in the affairs of a country. I
reject the attitude of Ambassador Leslie Alexander," said Verduga.
</P>
<P>
If an Ecuadoran ambassador made such statement in the United
States, he would be back home next day," he said.

MOSCOW, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian scientists have
developed a more environmentally friendly car engine system
generated by hydrogen power, Rossiskaya Gazeta reported.
</P>
<P>
The hydrogen, held in a tank similar in size to a normal car
tank, reacts with oxygen in the air through a special
electrochemical dynamo, turning the hydrogen into electricity to
power the car.
</P>
<P>
As a result, this new car engine emits vapor instead of
exhaustion.
</P>

Scientists say that besides being "clean" and environmentally

<HEADLINE> Never Again to Squander Public Funds For Feasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper,
the "People's Daily," today carried a front page letter in its leading
article position in which a young rural cadre attacks squandering
of public money on banquets.
</P>
<P>
The paper also adds an editor's note on the letter, agreeing
with the sentiments of the reader's letter.
</P>
<P>
The note said: "We can read from the letter that squandering
public funds on the holding of feasts, as one manifestation of
corruption, has become a severe social scourge that harms the
relations of the Chinese Communist Party and the people, and we
can no longer allow such a phenomenon to spread continuously."
</P>
<P>
Jiang zemin, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee, has emphasized that the phenomenon of
lavishness and squandering of public funds must be halted.
</P>
<P>
Now it is time to eliminate the wicked phenomenon. Efforts
against wasting public funds on so-called junketing has been
listed as a major part of the current anti-corruption drive by the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We publish this letter in a bid to enhance people's awareness
of the danger of such a malpractice, and show people's support to
the anti-corruption campaign," the note says.
</P>
<P>
Huang Fu, who is working in Xiamen, east China's Fujian
Province, said in the letter: "I am a young cadre who has just
begun a working career. Here I want to express my apprehension
about such a social phenomenon as squandering public funds on
feasts, which is becoming an increasingly common social phenomenon
nowadays.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I was born into a farmer family. So, I always bear in
mind the harshness of rural life led by residents in the
countryside. I have an instinct against extravagance."
</P>
<P>
He added that he is convinced that the Chinese Communist Party,
a long-tested and great party, is determined and fully able to
eliminate the phenomenon of squandering public money on
feasts.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Rejects U.S. Aid but Claims for Embargo Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Cuba did not need any
U.S. donation but demanded a reparation of the losses caused by 35
years of U.S. economic blockade, a Cuban official said today.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Robaina, Minister of Foreign Relations, issued the
statement, via Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso, after
meeting President of the Jamaican Parliament Winston Jones.
</P>
<P>
Robaina noted that there was nothing new in the U.S. project
concerning an alleged financial assistance to the island on the
condition that the revolutionary process in force be liquidated.
</P>
<P>
The only new thing was that U.S. President Bill Clinton was
fulfilling belatedly the mandate of a Congress dominated by
extremists and the absurd laws he himself promulgated, he said.
</P>
<P>
He observed that the real purpose under the seemingly
good-intentioned proposal was to implement the globally denounced
Helms-Burton Act approved by U.S. Congress early last year.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban sovereignty was not allowed to be auctioned to the
highest bidder, because the country took long ago the risk of
living in freedom and without a price tag, said Robaina.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that such project, which infringes
upon the Cuban sovereignty and nationality, requires a profound
legislative and political study to issue a complete answer.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a U.S. presidential document, which includes a
central condition for granting an assistance of millions of
U.S. dollars, Robaina said it was the U.S. centenarian desire to
design and fabricate from its offices what the Cuban nation ought
to be.
</P>
<P>
To the chagrin of its promoters, it could never happen, he
assured, saying that "what Clinton must pay Cuba was a figure many
times over what he offers, to retribute the damage caused to its
people by economic and trade embargo and dirty war of 35 years."

<HEADLINE> Chile to Invest 3 Million Dollars in Cooperation Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government plans
to provide three million U.S. dollars this year for cooperation
programs involving Central America, Cuba and the Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
The programs, to be carried out by the International
Cooperation Agency of Chile (AGCI), is an invaluable instrument of
the country's foreign policy, said a government official today.
</P>
<P>
Their implementation is expected to "promote the capabilities
of our country, promote its image and increase effective
exchanges," according to AGCI Director Francisco Vio.
</P>
<P>
Chile invested between 1991 and 1996 more than 4 million
dollars in cooperation programs with Central America.
</P>
<P>
Vio said the programs this year aim to promote the ability of
recipient countries to solve their development problems and
support their transition toward more open market economies.
</P>
<P>
The main areas where Chile will invest, he said, are poverty
alleviation, and the training and development of small and medium
agro-industrial and commercialization projects.
</P>
<P>
Chile will also invest in environmental planning and
management, housing, foreign trade, infrastructure and public
services, and the support for women and for the peace process in
Guatemala.

<HEADLINE> NBA Loses Statistical Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 30 (Xinhua) -- American National Basketball
Association (ABA) lost a lawsuit to a Chicago-based sports
statistics service Thursday to allow transmition of NBA scores and
statistics without its permission.
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel unanimously overturned a July ruling by US
District Court Judge Loretta Preska, whose injunction prevented
STATS Incorporated and Motorola Incorporated from providing
in-progress scores on pagers, according to a report.
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was important to take a stand to supply real-time
statistical information and to defend this position so the fans
could continue to have immediate access to this data," STATS
president John Dewan was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
An NBA spokesperson said the league would not comment on the
matter until its lawyers had a chance to review the 30-page
decision. The NBA could appeal the decision to the United States
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Following the earlier ruling, the NBA also filed suit against
America Online, a computer service that was developing a score
service with STATS, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Iodine Deficiency Cases Drop Sharply in Hunan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The number of cases of child
thyroid enlargement in central China's Hunan Province has dropped
significantly since iodine was added to cooking salt.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of the condition has fallen to less than 15
percent from over 30 percent in the early 1980s, according to an
official at the Hunan Provincial Department of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s over 600,000 iodine thyroid cases, including
8,000 cases of cretinism, and over one million subclinical
cretinism cases were reported. Thyroid cases caused by iodine
deficiency were very common in 70 counties in the province.
</P>
<P>
The official said the province worked to reduce iodine
deficiency diseases from the 1980s by adding iodine to edible
salt. Iodine-salt supplies are now widely accepted in all parts of
the province.
</P>
<P>
The province has provided more than one million kilograms of
iodine-salt free of charge for 250,000 people each year in the
iodine deficient areas, and offered free iodized oil pills to
70,000 patients suffering severe deficiency.
</P>
<P>
He said his province is to increase the supply of iodine-salt
and iodized oil pills in the coming years in an effort to
eliminate iodine deficiency diseases in the province.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Foreign Trade Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Foreign Trade
Minister Jose Rossi and two of his officials resigned today
because of differences with the government over a regional free
trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Rossi, who has held the post since May 1992, told a press
conference, "Since the government defined priorities that do not
agree with those of the ministry, I have decided to offer my
resignation."
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister Francisco Chacon and director of international
commercial negotiations, Anabelle Gonzalez, announced their
resignations along with Rossi.
</P>
<P>
The disagreement has been fomenting since last November, when
Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo announced that Costa Rica would
negotiate a free trade agreement with Caribbean countries. At the
time, Rossi warned that no studies had been carried out to
assess such a deal.
</P>
<P>
President Jose Maria Figueres has made no public reply to
Rossi's resignation.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday in Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras, presidents of
Central American countries decided to push forward with a free
trade agreement with Caribbean countries and sign it by the end
of the year.

<HEADLINE> Panama Plans to Stop Trade With El Salvador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Panama said today it was
considering suspending trade exchanges with El Salvador in
retaliation for the latter's recent ban on Panamanian cheese.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture and Livestock Development Carlos Sousa
Lennox told the press he had filed a request to the Commerce and
Industry Ministry to sever Panama's trade ties with El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
The Salvadoran government recently imposed a ban on the import
of Panamanian cheese products on the ground that their raw
materials failed to meet established quality standards.
</P>
<P>
Calling it a "very radical" move on the Salvadoran part, the
Panamanian minister said the cheese dispute had a fairly long
history but the ban was still beyond comprehension.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Panamanian cheese producers' export
revenues decreased from 900,000 U.S. dollars in 1994 to 600,000
dollars in 1995, and then to 550,000 dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The shrinking market has already affected Panama's dairy
industry and the dispute with El Salvador could undermine the
diplomatic and trade ties between the two countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> New Unrest Erupts in West Java, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A riot erupted Thursday morning
in the town of Rengasdengklok, Indonesia's West Java Province, and
in the process, cars, churches, banks and shops were burned or
damaged.
</P>
<P>
Life in the historic little town was disturbed by the riot
involving masses of people but security agencies quickly gained
control over the situation, the Antara News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The incident came after a non-Muslim tried to stop the beating
of drums by people at Warudoyong Village to announce the time for
"sahur" (night-time meals during the Muslim fasting month of
Ramadan).
</P>
<P>
"Gio (the non-Muslim) wanted the drum beating stopped because
he felt disturbed by the noise although he was actually not the
only person in the neighborhood who could feel disturbed while
drum-beating during Ramadan is a common happening," Sobana Nur,
secretary of the local branch of the Indonesian Council of Lemas,
said.
</P>
<P>
"The riot was perpetrated by thousands of people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Troops carrying automatic weapons patrolled the town after the
rampage as sporadic looting and burning were still going on late
in the afternoon. Law enforcement units were on full alert, while
a police helicopter hovered over the town, telling residents to
stay indoors, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Three people are reported to have been arrested so far, but
there were no reports on casualties during the riots.
</P>
<P>
Rengasdengklok, 50 kilometers east of Jakarta, earned fame in
Indonesia's struggle for independence as the place where the
nationalist movement's top leaders, Soekarno and Mohammed Hatta,
were briefly held by young independence fighters shortly before
the two proclaimed Indonesia's national independence in Jakarta on
August 17, 1945.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has lately been rocked by violent clashes, which have
often been described as "primordial" by officials and scholars
because of their ethnic and religious tones.
</P>
<P>
Three large riots with religious and ethnic overtones have
erupted since last October, leaving more than 12 people dead and
scores injured.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture of official concern, President Soeharto earlier
appealed for restraint, but ordered the establishment of riot
alert posts in the 240 district military command centers in a bid
to prevent further disturbances.

<P>
KIEV, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine is speeding up reform of
its justice system after the Council of Europe (CE) threatened to
delay the country's membership of the body if it continued to
execute criminals.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Justice Minister Sergey Golovaty said it was working
to pass legislation to abolish capital punishment as promised to
the Council.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference the cabinet had handed draft
revisions on Ukrainian criminal law to parliament for approval on
January 28.
</P>
<P>
The draft revisions made recommendations on reforming
Ukraine's justice system to meet the CE's criteria, Golovaty said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine pledged to abolish capital punishment within three
years when it joined the CE on November 9, 1995. It also announced
the immediate suspension of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
However, 89 people were executed in the country during the
first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The CE warned on Wednesday that Ukraine's CE membership would
be held up if it continued to carry out capital punishment. The
body will assess Ukraine's progress in fulfilling its pledges at a
meeting in April.

investigating the role played by a U.S. military base in northern
Honduras during the so-called dirty war in Nicaragua in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The "El Aguacate" base in Olancho was set up with U.S.
taxpayers money and was used as a war materials depot for the
U.S.-backed Nicaraguan counterinsurgency movement, the Contras,
against the regime of Sandinista President Daniel Ortega.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. government now believes the installation was also
used as a base to smuggle large quantities of cocaine into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Officials of two Honduran government anti-drugs agencies will
travel in the next days to the United States to collaborate with
the U.S. authorities.

<HEADLINE> China Promulgates Regulations for Punishing Copyright Violators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A new regulation goes into
effect in China tomorrow to reinforce the status of government
departments in punishing copyright violators.
</P>
<P>
The Implementation Regulations On The Administrative Punishment
of Copyright Violators define the power and functions of
government departments in fighting piracy, as well as relevant
procedures.
</P>
<P>
A complete system of statements, argument and hearings is
included in the regulations.
</P>
<P>
The regulations state that copyright officials will take a
bigger responsibility in protecting copyrights, and introduce a
mechanism to supervise government officials who enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the State Copyright Administration said today
that the promulgation of the regulations will be a major event in
China's copyright sphere, and will help fight copyright
infringements more effectively.
</P>
<P>
It will also help ensure that administrators operate in an
honest way, he said.
</P>
<P>
In China government departments will play a bigger role in
protecting copyrights, in addition to courts.
</P>
<P>
Copyright bureaus have been created at both central and
provincial levels to oversee major crackdowns. They are designated
as the organs responsible for revoking the licenses of copyright
violators and publicizing copyright knowledge to the public.

<HEADLINE> Tomba Takes Schladming Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, Janaury 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian Alberto Tomba,
three-time Olympic and two-time world champion, came back to win
the last World Cup slalom in Schladming, Austria, on Thursday
before the world Alpine championships.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old has struggled this year with illness and injury
that have kept him off of his peak form. And the victory couldn't
have come at a better time, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Tomba rallied from third place after the first run to clock a
second run of 48.93 seconds and a total time of 1 minute, 35.87
seconds.
</P>
<P>
That was 0.16 seconds ahead of the first-round leader,
Austria's Thomas Stangassinger, who finished second in
1:36.03. France's Sebastien Amiez was third in 1:36.19, 0.32
seconds behind the Italian.
</P>
<P>
The victory, Tomba's 33rd slalom and 48th overall World Cup,
put the Italian ace in fourth place with 292 points on the slalom
standings.
</P>
<P>
The slalom at the world championships will be run under the
lights, and the Schladming race was a chance for skiiers to get
used to night conditions.
</P>
<P>
Norway's Kjetil-Andre Aamodt, who finished 11th at Schladming,
retained his lead in the overall World Cup standings with 741
points. Luc Alphand of France has 737 and Sykora is third with 668.
</P>
<P>
Sykora leads the slalom standings at 666 points, followed by
Stangassinger with 490 and Amiez with 328.

<HEADLINE> MBAs Still Popular in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The master of business
administration is still a hot item in China, with 25 more
universities adding MBA courses to their curricula this year.
</P>
<P>
This brings the number of schools with MBA programs to 51, out
of China's total of 1,035 institutions of higher learning. Last
year, 1,500 students were studying for MBA degrees.
</P>
<P>
The State Council's Academic Degrees Committee implemented MBA
programs on a trial basis at nine universities in 1991, including
well-known schools, such as Qinghua University, Shanghai Jiaotong
University, and Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
Before then, many Chinese were not familiar with the MBA, which
was designed to train senior management personnel for industry and
commerce. It was first introduced in Western countries after World
War II when economic growth demanded a large number of
professionals.
</P>
<P>
The National MBA Education Supervisory Committee has tried to
standardize the examination for incoming students this year, and
people from 26 universities helped draft a unified examination,
which was given last week.
</P>
<P>
The examination, known as the Guanli Ruxue Kaoshi, evaluates
students' English and Chinese ability, and knowledge of logic,
mathematics, management, and political economy.
</P>
<P>
China's MBA education has attracted international interest. The
US's Webster University and China's Shanghai University of Finance
and Economics (SUFE) established a joint program last year,
offering Webster University's MBA degree on the SUFE campus.
</P>
<P>
Seventy Chinese students now enrolled in the
Sino-U.S. educational program at SUFE will get their MBAs from
Webster in two years, after they qualify.
</P>
<P>
The Webster-SUFE cooperation is the first of its kind in China,
which has approved eight joint-MBA programs with other foreign
countries.

<P>
ROME, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Swedish international Tomas Brolin
has rejoined his Italian former club Parma on loan from English
premier league club Leeds, according to local reports on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brolin, who has been training with Parma since the beginning of
the month, left the serie A side in 1995 for Leeds but clashed
with the then-manager Howard Wilkinson and was unable to agree
terms with new boss George Graham.
</P>
<P>
The midfielder, who played for Parma for five years, was on
loan until the end of the season when the club could exercise an
option to buy him, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Government Says School Strike Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government said on
Thursday that present strike in some Serbian primary and secondary
schools and Belgrade university colleges were in contrary to the
law on strikes.
</P>
<P>
A government statement issued from a session chaired by Premier
Mirko Marjanovic said the strikes, were also in violation of the
law on employment, the law on primary and secondary schools and
the law on university.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of school teachers went on a strike earlier this week
to demand the payment of their overdue salaries. They joined the
opposition demonstrations and peaceful marches in Belgrade over
the past two days, adding momentum to the pressure on the Serbian
government to recognize the victory of the opposition coalition in
November local elections.
</P>
<P>
To end the teachers' strike, the government decided that the
Education Ministry of Serbia apply the relevant laws in the cases
of the schools and colleges that have stopped classes contrary to
the law, Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted the statement as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"This means that the colleges and schools on strike cannot draw
on the budget and funds in the period of the strike," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The decision will remain in force until the schools and
colleges draw up a program to make up for the lost classes and
other obligations left undone and until the program is approved by
the Education Ministry, it added.

<HEADLINE> New Chips to Reach Computer Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Computer memory chip makers
now have an opportunity to regain some of their lost grounds by
offering the market with a new product.
</P>
<P>
Standard memory chips built into PCs are called dynamic
random-access memories, or DRAMs. But PC magazine advertisements
now are touting a faster kind of memory chip, which is called
synchronous DRAMs, or S-DRAMs. These chips retrieve data more
quickly and speed up demanding graphics and video.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Investor's Business Daily, S-DRAMs
can have a performance hike of up to 20 percent, although the
price will be about 10 percent higher than today's commonplace
16-megabit DRAMs.
</P>
<P>
The S-DRAMs will account for 40 percent of the 25.7-
million-U.S.-dollar memory market and it may help improve chip
maker profits later this year, according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, however, S-DRAMs will grab 65 percent of the market,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Chip makers Samsung Group and Hyundai Group, both from the
Republic of Korea, and Japan's Hitachi Ltd. are making a big push
in S-DRAMs this year.
</P>
<P>
Texas Instruments Inc. of the U.S. is gearing up with fast
memory chips, too. It expects that about half of the memory chips
it ships will be S-DRAMs by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> World Decision-makers Urged to Act Fast in Digital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Founder and
President of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Klaus Schwab here
today called on business and political leaders all over the world
to act fast in the emerging digital revolution.
</P>
<P>
"1997 is the last chance for them," Schwab warned in his
opening address at the WEF annual meeting in Davos situated in
eastern Switzerland. "The winners at the beginning of the next
century will be those who ensure that the digital dimension
permeates everything they do: products, services, communications,
strategic alliances. The losers will be those who wake up too
late."
</P>
<P>
Schwab said that there would be no limitations of time and
space in the digital revolution whose impact on society, business
and individuals would be even more dramatic than that of the
industrial revolution at the end of the last century. "Networking
will become the key success factor for everything we do," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2000 business and political leaders, experts, academics

<HEADLINE> Kuchma: Ukraine Wishes to Establish Special </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma said today that Ukraine wishes to establish a
special relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), if it cannot join the military alliance in near future.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted him as telling French
President Jacques Chirac that Ukraine supports the eastward
expansion by NATO, and that Kiev wishes to be treated by Brussels
with the same terms as Russia.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his wish that Ukraine can sign with NATO an accord
on such a special relationship, before a NATO summit is held in
Madrid in July.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who will make a visit to Russia on Sunday, said that
France and Ukraine share many similar points of view on European
security and NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
"We have largely convergent points of view, first of all on a
new architecture of European security, and agree that the
enlargement of NATO could be made within the framework of a
general agreement... with Russia and Ukraine," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
France also promised to financially help Ukraine to close down
the Chernobyl nuclear power station by 2,000, and substitute its
power supply with with the building of two new nuclear power
centers.

<HEADLINE> SFOR Seizes Unregistered Bosnian Croat Army Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led Stabilization
Force (SFOR) said Thursday they had discovered around central
Bosnian town Zenica weapons that Bosnian Croat Army had failed to
report to SFOR.
</P>
<P>
At a regular news conference in the Serb town Doboj in northern
Bosnia, spokesman for SFOR's Nordic-Polish brigade, Major Magnus
Edvinson of Sweden, said the SFOR patrol had discovered the
weapons during a routine check near Zepce. The patrol had taken
the weapons to its camp.
</P>
<P>
Zepce is situated 25 km southeast of Zenica, on the road to
Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital.
</P>
<P>
Edvinson said Bosnian Croat Army troops had failed to report
the weapons, as called for by accords signed earlier. Under the
agreement, the three ethnic groups must report their weapons to
SFOR and put heavy weaponry under SFOR control. Unregistered
weapons, if found, would be confiscated and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said SFOR had seized scores of different
anti-personnel and anti-armour mines and bombs this time.

<HEADLINE> Chirac, Clinton Talk on Telephone on Questions of NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
and U.S. President Bill Clinton had a 30-minute telephone
conversation on the questions of NATO expansion and reform, as
well as NATO's relations with Russia and Ukraine, said French
presidential office this evening.
</P>
<P>
French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said that
Clinton wished to talk about NATO with Chirac, on the eve of the
latter's visit to Moscow on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that the conversation went on "in a
constructive spirit," and that the two leaders agreed to keep in
touch.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted French presidential
sources as saying that "the climate of Franco-American
conversations" is improving since the beginning of the year,
after some skirmishes took place between French Foreign Minister
Herve de Charette and former U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher in December.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that France regards as positive the
declaration made on Wednesday by Sandy Berger, the new national
security advisor of President Clinton, that Washington will
continue to discuss with France on their dispute over the
Naples-based NATO South Command.
</P>
<P>
Washington rejected last week a French proposal on sharing the
commanding post of South Command between a European officer and an
American admiral.
</P>
<P>
Berger said that this proposal is unacceptable "in its
specific formulation," but that the U.S. will continue to discuss
with France.
</P>
<P>
France, which links the reform of the NATO with the partial
take-over by Europe of its South Command, said that the process
has already begun for the reform, and that France and the United
States would have deep-touched dialogue over the South Command.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Rally Boosts European Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
surged sharply and all ended firmly ahead Thursday, boosted by the
Dow's rally, with the Paris market leading the way higher to close
at a new record level.
</P>
<P>
Comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan
suggesting U.S. inflation was overstated heartened Wall Street,
and boosted London, too.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London ended up 20.9 points at 4,228.4,
helped by the resumption of the Wall Street rally. However,
trading volumes were kept subdued by concerns on the Dow's recent
volatility.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt market in Germany, which ended before Wall Street
opened, also finished the session in positive ground with moderate
trading, supported by overnight gains in New York and the dollar's
recovery, with the DAX-30 index breaching the 3,000-point level at
3,017.32, up 18.12 points.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 index extended their gains after the Bank
of France said that it was cutting its intervention rate to 3.10
percent from 3.15 percent to close at a new record high of
2,503.06, a rise of 38.05 points and surpassing the 2,500-point
level for the first time.
</P>

London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended 20.9
points higher at 4,228.4. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index closed up

industry news.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 83.12 points at
6,823.86. The Dow was slowly moving toward its all-time closing
high of 6,883.90 on January 21.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 5 to 3 on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume was strong at over 520 million
shares, above Wednesday's pace. Broad-market indexes were higher
as well.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 11.67 to 784.17, and

</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index advanced 12.34 to 1,367.51, and the

</P>
<P>
The 30-year Treasury bond was up 7-32 point, pushing its yield,
which moves opposite the price, down to 6.87 percent, after the
Labor Department said first-time state jobless claims rose by
10,000 to 351,000 in the week ended January 25.
</P>
<P>
Technology stocks rose as Intel shares were up in Nasdaq
trading. Intel said late Wednesday that it would cut prices of its
most powerful microprocessors less than most analysts had
anticipated, suggesting that demand for computers and computer
technology is strong.
</P>
<P>
Technology stocks Micron Technology and Texas Instruments were
boosted on the Big Board when Korean rival Samsung Electronics Co.
said it will cut production of its 16 megabit dynamic random
access memory (DRAM) chips.

<HEADLINE> Lilic Calls on Serbia to Recognize Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
said on Thursday that Serbia must recognize the victory of the
opposition Zajedno coalition in last November's elections in line
with the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Lilic, a top leader in Yugoslavia, has
made a direct reference to the political crisis that began 70 days
ago.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic in
Podgorica, the capital of Yugoslavia's Republic of Montenegro,
Lilic said that in order to defuse the crisis in Serbia, it was
important to "firmly respect the voters' will manifested in the
voting and positive regulations and by fully honoring proposals by
international institutions, primarily the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)," according to
Yugoslavia's official news agency Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
OSCE delegation, which paid a two-day fact-finding visit in
late November, has confirmed in its report to the OSCE chairman
that the Serbian opposition coalition had won 14 major cities in
the November 17 local elections.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, both Lilic and Bulatovic agreed that the
prolonged dispute, triggered by the annulment of the local
election results in November, "has badly affected the political
and economic life of Yugoslavia and its republics of Serbia and
Montenegro," Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
They called for a settlement of the dispute in a democratic,
legal and efficient manner as that will significantly contribute
to Yugoslavia's overall stability and its current and future
international status.
</P>
<P>
Lilic, who is paying a one-day visit to Montenegro, also
discussed with Bulatovic Yugoslavia's full and quick reintegration
into the international community, saying it would be the country's
top priority in 1997, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which is comprised of
Serbia and Montenegro, has not been admitted into the United
Nations and other key international financial institutions after
the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition Zajedno staged another massive rally
in Belgrade on Thursday to protest over the annulment of the local
election results, demanding the full recognition of its victory in
the local elections. Their demonstration was joined by middle and
primary school teachers who went on a strike for the overdue
payment.

<HEADLINE> Major Says No Deal with Spain on Gibraltar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major said here today that the British government was not prepared
to accept a deal with Spain to share the sovereignty of Gibraltar.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at British parliament this afternoon, Major said that
Britain would stick to its commitment towards the inhabitants of
Gibarltar on any change in the sovereignty of the British colony.
</P>
<P>
"We will not be entering into arrangements under which the
people of Gibraltar would pass under the sovereignty of another
state against their freely-expressed wishes," Major said.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office confirmed on Wednesday that Spanish
Foreign Minister Abel Matutes last week "raised informally with
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind the matter of joint
sovereignty over Gibarltar, as he has done on a previous
occasion."
</P>
<P>
"The Foreign Secretary rejected the idea because such a
proposal did not have the consent of the people of Gibarltar," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Spanish proposal, Spain would share joint sovereignty
of Gibarltar with Britain for up to 100 years and then London
should hand back the control of the territory to the Spanish
government.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-15th century, Gilbraltar was ruled by Spain and
merged into Spanish territory in 1501. In 1704, Austria captured
Gibraltar with the joining of Britain and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The treaty of Utrecht, which was signed in 1713, formally
recognized Gibarltar as British and it became a British colony in
1830.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Renews Mandate of Observer Mission in Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council renewed on Thursday a 125-member observer mission in
Georgia for a further period of six months, until July 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimously adopted resolution, the Security Council
reiterated its deep concern at the continued deadlock in achieving
a comprehensive settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia
and reaffirmed its commitment to the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of former republic of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Fighting began in 1992 when Abkhazia, strategically located on
the Black Sea in northwestern region of the Republic of Georgia,
began with social unrest and the attempts by the local authorities
to separate from the Republic.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. military observers were sent to Georgian in 1993 to
verify compliance with a cease-fire agreement between the Georgian
government and the Abkhazian rebels. Now both sides can not agree
on the political status of the Abkhazia in the future Georgian
government.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the council condemned the continued laying
of mines, including new types of mines, in the Gali region, which
has already caused several deaths and injuries among the civilian
population and the peacekeepers and observers of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The council called upon the parties to take all measures in
their power to prevent mine-laying and intensified activities by
armed groups and to cooperate fully with the U.N. Observer Mission
in Georgia and the CIS peacekeeping force in order to honor their
commitment to ensure the safety and the freedom of movement of all
personnel of the United Nations, the CIS peacekeeping force and
international humanitarian organizations.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Committee Approves Balanced Budget Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Judiciary Committee of
the U.S. Senate approved a balanced budget amendment today,
starting a new round of battle over the issue between the two
parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
The amendment passed the committee with a vote of 13-5 after a
fierce debate over whether the Social Security trust fund should
be excluded in future budget calculations.
</P>
<P>
Democrats seeking to put Social Security off-budget tried but
failed to amend the bill or approve a substitute for the bill and
they promised to resume the fight when the constitutional
amendment goes to the Senate floor next month.
</P>
<P>
They said that if Social Security is not taken off budget,
deficit-cutting proposals will surely focus on cutting the Social
Security program.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle released
Wednesday, U.S. President Bill Clinton again voiced strong
opposition to the amendment, saying that it "could pose grave
risks to the Social Security system."
</P>
<P>
But Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said today that
the trust fund was strong enough to fend for itself and "we think
there is little or no reason at all to take Social Security off
budget."
</P>
<P>
Daschle and other Senate Democrats have offered their own
version of the amendment that would exempt the Social Security
trust fund from budget balancing calculations.
</P>
<P>
Both the Clinton administration and Republican's proposals for
balancing the budget by 2002 consider the Social Security trust
fund as a source of general revenue, and exempting the trust fund
from budget calculations would require budget writers to find
hundreds of billions in new savings or revenues.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, a balanced budget amendment by Republicans passed the
U.S. House of Representatives but failed by just one vote in the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican leaders predicted that they could have 68
votes in the Senate of the current 105th Congress, one vote more
than needed to pass the amendment.
</P>
<P>
A amendment to the U.S. Constitution needs to be passed by a
two-third majority in both U.S Senate and the House and has to be
ratified by three-fourths of state legislatures to take effect.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Raises Taxes on Sugar Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
raised the valued added tax and introduced an ad valorem tax on
imported sugar so as to protect the domestic sugar industry, the
Kenya News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Agriculture Minister Darius Mbela as saying
in the port city of Mombasa that the value added tax on imported
sugar has been raised from five to eight percent.
</P>
<P>
The sugar industry is one of the main targets of the ongoing
reform program carried out by the Kenyan government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Privatization has played a leading role in the sugar sector,
and the government has stopped further investment in the industry
and will provide good roads, adequate water and electricity to
enable businessmen run their business effectively, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The official Kenyan Sugar Authority, in charge of coordinating
the industry's development, has set aside about 40 million U.S.
Dollars, through its financial arm Sugar Development Fund, for
the loans to sugar cane farmers, factory rehabilitation and road
improvement, Mbela said.
</P>
<P>
The area under sugar plantation increased from 104,675
hectares in 1994 to 123,628 hectares in 1995 due to heavy
investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kenya consumed 570,000 tons of sugar last year, 180,000 of
which were imported.
