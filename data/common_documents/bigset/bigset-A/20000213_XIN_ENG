<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Sees Clinton's Visit Great Event  By Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The press, people and
politicians in Bangladesh take U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit
to Dhaka on March 25 as a great event which is significant on all
counts, both in short and long terms.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here pointed out that once seen as an
impoverished nation with disease and hunger haunting it, now
Bangladesh has been able to draw the attention of the president of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's Dhaka tour is part of his foray to South Asia that
will first land him in India on March 20.
</P>
<P>
The New Nation daily said on Saturday that "Bangladesh remains
committed to peace and its economic indicators are positive."
</P>
<P>
It said Dhaka and Washington are now enjoying "the heyday of
bilateral relationships," adding that a qualitative change in this
relationship is turning Bangladesh into a development partner from
a mere aid-recipient nation. The United States is now an important
trade partner of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet clear which issues Bangladesh would highlight
during talks with the U.S. president. But several matters may
figure largely, including free access of Bangladeshi exports to
the U.S. market, technical assistance for information technology,
more development aid and an amnesty to Bangladeshi nationals
staying in America without valid documents.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the government and the opposition have
agreed on the point of welcoming Clinton to Dhaka, although they
disagree on all national and major external issues amid their
political standoff.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led opposition alliance
may give a breather in its agitation for a week or so before the
arrival of Clinton. The White House reportedly is examining
Bangladesh's request for extending Clinton's stay in Dhaka into
March 26 to enable him to attend the Independence Day celebrations.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Wants UNCTAD to Promote Development for All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday that he hoped the 10th Session of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X)
would help to promote development for all peoples.
</P>
<P>
Wishing that "UNCTAD X will move us closer to a consensus on an
agenda of survival and development for all peoples and all nations
in this new decade and beyond," Estrada said the rules for
globalization should be level and fair, from the starting block to
the finish line.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the opening of the 10th Session of
UNCTAD in Bangkok, Estrada urged all the UNCTAD members attending
the conference to avail of the "auspicious start" of the new
century to lay the foundation of a true global development
partnership.
</P>
<P>
He referred to a shift for development cooperation, the
continuous updating of the global economic structures themselves
in support of development, the fulfillment of old promises and an
unequivocal orientation to the future as the cornerstones of the
new global development partnership.
</P>
<P>
He also urged efforts to strengthen the international financial
architecture, calling for minimizing the volatility induced by the
speculative capital, encouraging the shift in the orientation of
international financial institutions from traditional fiscal
austerity programs to those that incorporate social safety nets,
and participating in regional and global efforts to strengthen
financial systems and develop capital markets, particularly in
developing economies.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Leaders Focus Attention on Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Globalization is attracting
the attention of all the leaders of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), who agreed at the ASEAN-U.N. summit here
Saturday that the issue will dominate the debate of the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said that in recent
years, there have been many mergers between large multi-national
corporations and large banks, which are part of the globalization
process.
</P>
<P>
With the entry of these companies into domestic markets, social
safety will become a major concern, he said.
</P>
<P>
If they give no importance to social safety, there could be
backlash against globalization.
</P>
<P>
He also called for taking measures to ensure globalization does
not create income gaps between nations and other negative impacts.
</P>
<P>
His view was shared by other ASEAN leaders, who hoped the 10th
Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD X), which opened in Bangkok later in the day, would offer
new ways of thinking to ensure that the process of globalization
benefits all, developed and developing countries alike.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN leaders also called on UNCTAD to initiate a new
General System of Preference (GSP), saying many ASEAN countries
had made achievements in development thanks to the old GSP.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN countries were also concerned about the Mekong river
basin development, as Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai proposed
that the United Nations declare this decade a "decade for Mekong
river basin development."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan praised the collective
response by ASEAN to the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Diversified as it is, ASEAN takes a common position on many
issues on the environment, good governance and fighting against
poverty.
</P>
<P>
Annan also wished ASEAN become an observer for the United
Nations, as it is the only regional organization which does not
have an observer's status for the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural ASEAN-U.N. summit was held hours prior to the
opening of the UNCTAD X, which will last till February 19.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Around 800 Pakistani troops
left here Saturday for Dili to join the United Nations
peacekeeping mission in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The troops will participate in repair, reconstruction and
rehabilitation projects which are conducted by the United Nations
Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), according to
the local press.
</P>
<P>
Since its independence in 1947, Pakistan has been one of the
major contributors in U.N. efforts for global peace. The Pakistani
Army has contributed more than 17,000 troops for U.N. peacekeeping
assignments in many countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Feature: U.N. Meeting to Be Remembered for Its "Mega-ness"  By Xu Haijing, Hu Guangyao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- "Mega-ness" may be the first
thing people will think of the 10th Session of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X), which kicked off
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Big names such as Kofi Annan (U.N. Secretary-General), Michel
Camdessus (Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund),
James Wolfensohn (President of the World Bank), Michael Moore (
Director-General of the World Trade Organization), appear on the
list of participants, making the meeting a heavy-weight in the
world economic arena.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nine heads of state or government from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) were also present
here Saturday, adding political importance to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of ASEAN and the United Nations also held their first
summit Saturday here, marking the new beginning of cooperation
between the two organizations. ASEAN is the only regional group
that is not an observer of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Heavy-weight figures came with reasons.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD X is expected to discuss a wide range of issues,
including trade liberalization, trade in services, electronic
commerce and competitive policies.
</P>
<P>
But the most important of all is the "mega" issue of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Aware that globalization can be a bane or a boon, countries are
trying to find strategies to manage its process so that it can
benefit all countries, developed and developing alike.
</P>
<P>
The trend of mega-mergers like the recent one between America-
On-Line and Time Warner in recent corporate history, rang a
warning bell for people from the developing countries that if
their domestic markets were penetrated by these big companies, the
small ones at home might face the fate of being "swallowed up."
</P>
<P>
The importance of UNCTAD X is highlighted by the collapse of
the World Trade Organization (WTO)'s Third Ministerial Meeting in
Seattle last December.
</P>
<P>
During that meeting, trade ministers failed to kickstart a new
round of trade talks, leaving many pessimists worrying about the
fate of the multilateral trade system.
</P>
<P>
Thus, UNCTAD X offers an immediate opportunity for the world to
reconsider the issue of trade liberalization and the benefits and
challenges it may bring.
</P>
<P>
The conference is also much broader in its dimensions compared
to the Seattle meeting.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of a great number of international organizations
in the conference allowed a chance for different voices to be
heard.
</P>
<P>
The non-governmental organization (NGO) caucus and the Inter-
Parliamentary Union meeting held ahead of UNCTAD X gave the
conference a human face, bringing closer UNCTAD and ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
The broader dimension is conspicuous in light of the limited
demonstrations and protests outside Queen Sirikit National
Convention Center, the main venue of UNCTAD X, because, according
to some experts, those who voiced protests in Seattle had been
invited inside.
</P>
<P>
The peacefulness certainly is a great relief for the 6,600 Thai
policemen deployed to make sure that all the VIPs and the 3,000 to
4,000 delegates would leave the week-long conference safe and
sound.
</P>
<P>
Just over two weeks after a hostage crisis in a hospital in
western Thailand, security for the UNCTAD has become a major
concern.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the incident has in no way dampened the high
spirits of the host country, which has decided to give a "mega"
embrace of the meeting, the largest international conference it
has ever hosted.
</P>
<P>
Upon their arrival, participants were met by posters with
welcoming messages along the expressway from the airport to the
convention center at the heart of the "City of Angels."
</P>
<P>
They were told a flyover was built over the crossroads near the
venue and its construction was completed just in time for the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Floods of cars disappeared as the government made February 11,
a day before UNCTAD X was inaugurated, a public holiday.
</P>
<P>
Bangkokians were encouraged to spend the long weekend out of
the city and leave the big stage of Bangkok to the delegates, over
1,000 journalists and 3,000 spouses of the delegates.
</P>
<P>
Mega as it is, UNCTAD X is surely to have a place in people's
memory as the "first global gathering of the new millennium."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Globalization a Hot Subject on First Day of UNCTAD X </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The 10th Session of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X) kicked off
here Saturday with heads of state and government, the U.N. chief
and heads of U.N. agencies and related institutions vying with one
another in talking about globalization a demon or a dear to the
developing economies.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 people, including delegates from 188 UNCTAD
members, officials from key U.N. agencies such as the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the World
Trade Organization (WTO), and representatives of non-governmental
organizations, national parliaments and civil society attended the
opening ceremony of the week-long conference.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the opening speech, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan asked the Conference to discuss a series of questions on how
to make the poor benefit from globalization.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference should consider how to make the poor
benefit from trade work and how to make all developing countries,
especially poor people within them, benefit from the growth of
private investment and can borrow at affordable rates.
</P>
<P>
He asked the conference to think about how can new technologies
be made more widely available and better used and how to make
external assistance in helping small-scale corporations in
developing countries to find their way around in the international
markets.
</P>
<P>
Annan also urged the delegates to think about how to develop
new partnerships, reaching beyond old-fashioned inter-governmental
cooperation, to advance the cause of development, how to ensure
the voice of developing countries not only be heard but also
listened to in future discussions on international trade rules and
how to enable the least developed countries to take their place on
the "upward escalator of world growth."
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai urged UNCTAD X to provide the
moral and ethical leadership for the building of a new Global
Compact for Development. Chuan said the compact should be based on
justice, equity and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said the timing of UNCTAD X has its symbolic importance,
since it provides the international community an opportunity to
exchange views on how to forge a common vision of development for
the new millennium in the face of the challenges of globalization.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization has brought with it both opportunities and
challenges. Undeniably, its negative effects -- together with our
own weakness -- had led to a severe and far-reaching economic
crisis in our region," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that UNCTAD X will help understand the lessons of the
Asian financial crisis even better for the benefits of all
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the first major U.N. conference of the new
millennium, the gathering offers the first opportunity to assess
what is lacking in the present international trade and financial
system that has yet to provide common prosperity and economic
security for all.
</P>
<P>
Globalization is attracting the attention of all the
Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) leaders, who agreed
at the ASEAN-U.N. summit, held before the inauguration of UNCTAD X,
that the issue will dominate the debate of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong called for taking
measures to ensure globalization does not create income gaps
between nations and other negative impacts.
</P>
<P>
His views were shared by other ASEAN leaders, who hoped UNCTAD
X would offer new ways of thinking to ensure that the process of
globalization benefits all, developed and developing countries
alike.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session, Thai deputy prime minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi assumed the presidency of UNCTAD X.
</P>
<P>
"It is not an easy task that has been conferred on the
presidency given the rapidly evolving global economic environment,
" he said in his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
He said UNCTAD must strengthen its role in such a way that
enables it to satisfy its raison d'etre, that is, the promotion of
economic development of the developing countries in the midst of
changes.
</P>
<P>
The current UNCTAD conference is expected to set the right
conditions for constructive dialogue and to help shape the trade
and development agenda of the 21st century, he said. The
conference, lasting till February 19, will address the broad theme
of "applying the lessons of the past to make globalization an
effective instrument for the development of all countries and all
peoples."
</P>
<P>
As the first global economic gathering in the new millennium
and the first major economic conference after the failed WTO
meeting in Seattle, UNCTAD X has been expected to serve as "a
healing process" for the Seattle meeting.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Considering Moratorium on Nandrolone Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Amateur
Athletic Federation (IAAF) was meeting for a special session on
Saturday in Monte Carlo, Monaco, with the controversy over recent
positive tests for the banned steroid nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
IAAF chiefs are considering during their two-day session
whether to put disciplinary proceedings on hold against athletes
accused of taking the banned steroid, reports said reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Jamaica's Merlene Ottey, Britain's Linford Christie and German
Dieter Baumann are among those to have tested positive recently
for the drug.
</P>
<P>
But speculation is mounting that nutritional supplements could
be producing the positive findings and that athletes may be taking
the banned substance inadvertently.
</P>
<P>
David Moorcroft, chief executive of UK Athletics, met with
IAAF president Lamine Diack and other officials this week to press
for a moratorium on disciplinary action until the end of May,
pending an independent inquiry into the surge of nandrolone cases.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, athletes facing hearings for nandrolone
would not take part in competition during the inquiry phase. They
would also undergo screening tests to help solve the mystery.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Keep Pressure on Iraq: U.S. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said
Sunday in the Qatari capital of Doha that Washington will continue
to keep pressure on the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
Iraq "should not ignore the red lines set by the United States,"
said Edward Walker, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near East
Affairs, at a press conference before ending his two-day visit to
Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Walker warned Baghdad against entering its Kurds-populated
northern regions, but he avoided elaborating on possible U.S.
reactions in case of violations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. used to resort to missile attacks against Iraqi targets
in response to what Washington termed as Baghdad's violations of
the "no-fly zones" in northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The two zones were unilaterally imposed by the U.S. and Britain,
without authorization from the United Nations, after the 1991 Gulf
war, allegedly to prevent Iraqi troops from attacking ethnic Kurds
in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south.
</P>
<P>
Walker declined to discuss the U.S. policies toward Iraq, saying
that they come within consultations with the leaders in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said his tour, which will also take him to Kuwait, Oman,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, is aimed at "
consulting with countries in the region over whether there are gaps
that demand change in the current policy."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Walker met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani on bilateral ties and the troubled Middle East
peace process, according to reports reaching here from Doha.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official visited Tunisia and Morocco before arriving in
the Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Reformers Call for "House-cleaning" in Iran's Majlis by Rong Song </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's reformers on Sunday
called for a massive turnout in Friday's sensitive parliamentary
poll to make a "house-cleaning" in the country in order to push
forward reformist programs of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
"The country needs a 'house-cleaning' to set up a new Majlis
(parliament) to push forward the reforms initiated by President
Khatami," a reformist said at a large student gathering in support
of the pro-Khatami Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF).
</P>
<P>
Saeed Hajarian, a member of the IIPF central council, said that
those Majlis deputies who have gained power but lost their role of
people's representatives must be cleaned out of the parliament
like "worn-out things" in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
"House-cleaning" is an Iranian tradition which is usually
carried out on the eve of the Iranian new year on March 21.
</P>
<P>
Hajarian's speech was frequently interrupted by pro-reform
slogans chanted by more than 7,000 university and high school
students gathered inside the Shiroudi Stadium, close to the former
U.S. embassy in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"Freedom, Forever! Forever!" "Khatami, Khatami, We Support You!"
the students shouted, waving Khatami's pictures and posters of his
speeches.
</P>
<P>
Hajarian said that Iran needs a parliament to help the president
accelerate his political, economic and cultural reforms and uphold
democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Half of the project of political developments was finished in
the presidential elections on May 23, 1997, in which Khatami won a
landslide victory over the conservative Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq Nouri, he said, and the rest of the project should be
completed on February 18 in the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mohammad Reza Khatami, brother of the president and a
senior IIPF member, promised to make efforts to safeguard freedom
and security and to speed up the reform process if the IIPF wins a
majority in the future parliament.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Iranian people to actively participate in the
parliamentary poll, which is believed to create a new power balance
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Your presence (in the elections) will create another May 23 and
will play an important role in the country's reconstruction," Reza
Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the "Khatami" in the slogans means two
Khatamis, the president and his brother, giving the hint that the
reformers hope Reza Khatami to be elected the future Majlis
speaker.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Khatami will be elected the speaker," a university
student said, "we hope the future Majlis will help the government
to safeguard freedom and democracy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a high school teacher said that she expected the
future Majlis would support the President to carry out his reforms
and safeguard the people's rights under the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the candidacy of former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani in the coming elections, the teacher, who declined to be
named, said that Rafsanjani's turn was over and he should give the
way to newcomers.
</P>
<P>
"Rafsanjani may be elected into the parliament, but I do not
think he would be able to win the post of Majlis speaker," an
Iranian newspaper reporter said.
</P>
<P>
The students at the gathering also showed strong opposition to
Rafsanjani's candidacy and chanted slogans such as "With Hashemi
(Rafsanjani), eternal freedom impossible, with Hashemi, political
development impossible."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani has registered to run in the election and observers
said he expected to regain the post of Majlis speaker, which he had
held after the 1979 Islamic revolution till he was elected
president in 1989.
</P>
<P>
However, the leftist and reformist groups refused to put
Rafsanjani in their lists of candidates and regarded Rafsanjani's
return to the Majlis as a hindrance to Khatami's reform process
because of his close ties with the powerful conservatives who
dominate the country's most sensitive organs.
</P>
<P>
The disputes over Rafsanjani's candidacy caused a split inside
the moderate camp between the pro-Khatami leftist and reformist
groups and the pro-Rafsanjani central-rightist parties, which
excluded Reza Khatami in their lists in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the leftists and reformers are seeking to
recreate a coalition of Islamic intellectuals, women and young
people by excluding pro-Rafsanjani parties.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said that the formation of the future
Majlis would be more complicated with the split inside the moderate
camp and the active participation of political parties, the first
time in the history of the Islamic Republic.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes over 3 Tons of Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces seized
3,291 kilograms of various drugs throughout the country during the
past one week, the evening newspaper Kayhan reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The drug haul included 1,737 kilograms of morphine, 1,117.4
kilograms of opium, 304.7 kilograms of heroin and 132.2 kilograms
of hashish, the daily reported, quoting a report issued by the
security forces.
</P>
<P>
The forces also confiscated 18 guns and a number of bullets
during their anti-drug operations in the period.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Iranian anti-drug headquarters Mohammad Fallah
said last month that the country seized over 253 tons of various
narcotics since beginning of the current Iranian calendar year to
end on March 20.
</P>
<P>
He said that 740 drug smugglers were killed in the period while
the country lost 183 anti-drug personnel.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from
Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, and neighboring
Pakistan to Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
It started strict anti-drug campaigns in 1989 after the Majlis,
or Parliament, passed an anti-drug law authorizing capital
punishment for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
A commander of the Iranian security forces said last November
that the country has spent 1 billion U.S. dollars on combating drug
trafficking since the Islamic revolution in 1979.

PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- France denied that one of its
soldiers serving in the U.N. Kosovo Force (KFOR) was killed in the
fighting which broke out on Sunday in the northern Kosovo city of
Kosovska Mitrovica between the KFOR and "snipers.''
</P>
<P>
The official Serb television RTS said on Sunday that a French
soldier of KFOR was killed and another injured in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
KFOR announced earlier that two French soldiers were injured by`
`snipers'' on Sunday in Ksovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted the general staff of the French
army in Paris as saying Sunday evening that no French soldier was
killed and the situation of the two injured soldiers is out of
danger.
</P>
<P>
KFOR also announced that during the fighting between ``snipers
'' and the multinational peacekeeping force, one ethnic Albanian``
sniper'' was shot dead and five were injured in the northern party
of Kosovska Mitrovica by French troops.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of KFOR, Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick Chanliau, said
that all the six Albanian snipers were ``terrorists who have the
purpose of putting into question what the international community
has done.''

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Suggest Skipping Framework Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- As Israel and Palestinians
failed to meet a key deadline for a framework agreement on a
permanent peace Sunday, a senior Palestinian negotiator called for
skipping over the framework accord and instead focusing efforts on
a final treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Why don't we make the two things together and go directly to
negotiations on this (final) treaty?" said Yasser Abed Rabbo, chief
Palestinian negotiator on the final status talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sunday was the deadline Israel and the Palestinians set in the
Sharm el Sheikh memorandum to draft an agreement on final status
issues, to be sealed in a detailed final accord by September. But
the day passed with nothing on the paper.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo blamed Israel for the failure to meet the deadline, saying
the reason was the lack of real interest by the Israeli side on the
peace talks with the Palestinians in the last several months.
</P>
<P>
"This was a very negative signal. The Israeli government should
have shown more interest and willingness to achieve what has been
agreed upon in the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement," Rabbo said in an
interview with Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Since launching the final status talks in September, Israel and
the Palestinians have made little headway on the thorniest issues
between them, such as the final borders, the status of the
Palestinian entity, the future of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The talks have even ground to a halt since February 3 when a
summit between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat broke down over a range
of issues.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was angered by Barak's refusal to hand over Arab suburbs
of Jerusalem as part of an overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from
the West Bank under the Sharm el Sheikh agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Israel was supposed to transfer 6.1
percent of the West Bank to Palestinian control in January at the
last stage of the second further Israeli redeployment in the
interim phase. But its implementation was delayed by the dispute
over which areas to be handed over.
</P>
<P>
Arafat refused to accept the withdrawal map Israel presented to
him since it did not include populated Arab areas surrounding
Jerusalem as the Palestinians had demanded.
</P>
<P>
"This was a map imposed on us without discussing with us," Rabbo
repeated the Palestinian position in the radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Another contentious issue concerned the third, or the last,
further redeployment in the interim phase. The two sides have been
disputing over the time and depth of this withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo said the final status talks with Israel could be resumed
after the dispute over these two issues was resolved, but he
suggested that the two sides abandon their efforts to reach a
framework agreement and focus on the final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
"We don't see the need to have two documents or two separate
steps in the direction, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have never liked the idea of dividing the final
status negotiations into two stages. It was Barak who insisted that
the two sides reach a framework agreement before clinching a final
deal.
</P>
<P>
Therefore the Palestinians were especially angry when Barak
proposed to Arafat at the botched summit that he wanted to delay
the framework agreement till September and postpone the final peace
deal for nine months.
</P>
<P>
They were deeply concerned that Barak might try to put off the
talks on their track in order to concentrate his efforts on the
negotiations with Syria, which would help him fulfil a key promise
to pull Israeli troops out of south Lebanon by July this year.
Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resumed last December after a
four-year break, also plunged into an impasse last month following
a dispute over the fate of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
There have been no signs of an early resumption of the talks.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for International Efforts to End War in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Sunday called for the international community to make
efforts to end the domestic war in Afghanistan and establish peace
in the Middle Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The international community should focus efforts on encouraging
various Afghan groups to hold negotiations and accept peaceful
means to end the fratricide in the country, Kharrazi told Frances
Vendrell, special envoy of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran is anxiously following up the situation in
Afghanistan where war has inflicted abundant damage, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Pacific
Affairs Mohsen Aminzadeh said that Iran is highly interested in
establishment of peace, stability and security in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran has always been supporting all the measures adopted both
regionally and internationally for restoration of calm and finding
a political solution to Afghan dilemma, he said in a separate
meeting with Vendrell.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly called for a broad-based government in
Afghanistan with the participation of all political and ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official, who arrived here on Saturday, expressed the
hope that a way would be found to end the war and establish a
lasting peace in Afghanistan through contribution of all Afghan
groups and regional states.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Iran's "effective role" and that of other
regional countries in solving the Afghan issue, saying that Iran
has had positive cooperation with the United Nations on the Afghan
issue.
</P>
<P>
Vendrell and Iranian officials emphasized close relations and
cooperation between the U.N. and the Organization of the Islamic
Conference in solving the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan has been torn by a bloody civil war since the
Islamic factions toppled the former pro-Soviet government in 1992.
The government headed by President Burhanuddin Rabbani was ousted
in 1996 by the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban militia, which has
won control over 90 percent of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Clashes are continuing between the Taliban and the Northern
Alliance headed by Rabbani, who enjoyed Iran's support during the
past years.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Wants to Keep on Improving Ties with Greece  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit on Sunday stressed the importance to maintain a steady
development of relations with Greece, reported the Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Bucharest, capital of Romania,
where he attended a summit of the Southeast Europe Cooperation
Project, Ecevit said that the earthquakes unified the Turkish and
Greek peoples.
</P>
<P>
NATO members Greece and Turkey, locked in disputes over Cyprus
and the Aegean Sea, have cashed in on the mutual sympathy produced
by devastating earthquakes in their two countries last summer in a
process now dubbed earthquake diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that earthquakes prepared psychological
infrastructure of closer relations between the two Nato allies.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rapprochement gained new momentum with the nine
agreements signed by foreign ministers of the two countries in
Ankara and Athens.
</P>
<P>
"I held a brief but very beneficial meeting with (Greek Prime
Minister) Mr. Kostas Simitis yesterday. We invited him to Turkey. I
think that this visit will take place probably after the elections
in Greece (in April), and I believe that this visit will bring
about much closer atmosphere between Turkey and Greece," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 20-minute meeting between the two leaders, on the fringes of
the Balkan summit, was widely viewed as another sign of the new
diplomatic warmth between the traditional rivals.
</P>
<P>
Simitis expressed backing for Turkey's bid for the European
Union composed of 15 countries including Greece.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit noted that technical dimension in the EU membership
process is very important and Greece is experienced in this field.
He expressed thanks to Simitis for his good gesture in offering
Greece's experience, saying that "We consider this as a friendly
approach."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and Greek Foreign
Minister George Papandreou, who were also in Bucharest for the
Balkan meeting, held a brief meeting. They discussed confidence-
building measures in the Aegean and Turkey's package of proposals
on the issue.

JERUSALEM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinians
failed to sign a framework agreement on final-status issues before
the targeted date of February 13, as their talks made no
substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed last September,
Israel and the Palestinians ceremoniously launched their final-
status talks on September 13, 1999, to solve the thorniest issues
such as the fate of Jerusalem, borders, Palestinian refugees,
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and water.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides seriously entered into negotiations only on
November 8 last year, after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
announced his long-delayed appointment of Oded Eran as Israel's
chief negotiator for the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the two negotiating teams held dozens rounds of
talks, spending a lot of time on setting the agenda, debating which
issue should be discussed first, presenting their respective
positions on the key issues to be addressed in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Striving hard to push the talks forward with an aim to reach the
framework agreement on schedule as stipulated by the peace deal,
the two sides began their closed-door marathon talks on January 30.
But the talks broke down again several days later as the two sides
blamed each other for not being ready to make compromise on all
issues discussed in the talks.
</P>
<P>
To push the final-status talks forward and solve all these key
issues require high-level decision-making. For this, Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have met secretly for several
times since the beginning of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Their latest talks, held on February 3 at the Erez Checkpoint
between Israel and the Gaza Strip, ended with Arafat walking out
and refusing to hold a joint press conference with Barak.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was angered by Barak's proposal that he wanted to delay
the signing of the draft accord till September and put off the
final peace treaty, slated for September in the peace deal, for
nine months.
</P>
<P>
Arafat termed such a move as unacceptable, although he does not
mind a short delay of reaching the framework agreement. The
Palestine Liberation Organization Central Committee therefore
decided on the same day to set September as the deadline for the
declaration of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as
its capital.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Wants to Keep on Improving Ties with Greece  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit on Sunday stressed the importance to maintain a steady
development of relations with Greece, reported the Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Bucharest, capital of Romania,
where he attended a summit of the Southeast Europe Cooperation
Project, Ecevit said that the earthquakes unified the Turkish and
Greek peoples.
</P>
<P>
NATO members Greece and Turkey, locked in disputes over Cyprus
and the Aegean Sea, have cashed in on the mutual sympathy produced
by devastating earthquakes in their two countries last summer in a
process now dubbed earthquake diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that earthquakes prepared psychological
infrastructure of closer relations between the two Nato allies.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rapprochement gained new momentum with the nine
agreements signed by foreign ministers of the two countries in
Ankara and Athens.
</P>
<P>
"I held a brief but very beneficial meeting with (Greek Prime
Minister) Mr. Kostas Simitis yesterday. We invited him to Turkey. I
think that this visit will take place probably after the elections
in Greece (in April), and I believe that this visit will bring
about much closer atmosphere between Turkey and Greece," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 20-minute meeting between the two leaders, on the fringes of
the Balkan summit, was widely viewed as another sign of the new
diplomatic warmth between the traditional rivals.
</P>
<P>
Simitis expressed backing for Turkey's bid for the European
Union composed of 15 countries including Greece.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit noted that technical dimension in the EU membership
process is very important and Greece is experienced in this field.
He expressed thanks to Simitis for his good gesture in offering
Greece's experience, saying that "We consider this as a friendly
approach."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and Greek Foreign
Minister George Papandreou, who were also in Bucharest for the
Balkan meeting, held a brief meeting. They discussed confidence-
building measures in the Aegean and Turkey's package of proposals
on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Algerian President Ends Visit to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika on Sunday concluded his three-day visit to
Saudi Arabia after exchanging views with Saudi leaders on a number
of key regional issues and inter-Arab ties.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika, who arrived in the Gulf kingdom on Friday, held
talks on Saturday with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown
Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Algerian Ambassador Mohammed Takkiya said both sides expressed
profound anxiety over the recent wave of Israeli air raids on
Lebanon and urged Israel to halt the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel's warplanes on Tuesday attacked a number of Lebanon's
civilian installations, including three power stations, in
retaliation for the recent killing of six Israeli soldiers by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The attacks have drawn strong condemnation from the Arab world
and aroused deep concerns among the international community, which
fears the Israeli practices will destroy all efforts aimed at
pushing forward the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the Gulf region, Takkiya said the two
leaders agreed on the necessity to protect Iraq's integrity and
sovereignty, while hoping Baghdad to abide by legitimate
international resolutions in order to have the sanctions imposed on
the country lifted.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed harsh economic embargo on Iraq after
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arab diplomats in the Saudi capital of Riyadh said
that Bouteflika and his Saudi hosts also reviewed the Saudi efforts
to bridge discords between Algeria and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats expressed belief that Algerian-Moroccan
relations "are now ready to bypass differences and head toward
constructive tracks," reported the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Algeria and Morocco, two members of the North African Arab
Meghreb Union which also comprises Libya, Tunisia and Mauritania,
have been maintaining a cool relationship since mid-1990s following
some border incidents.
</P>
<P>
Bouteflika is currently on a three-nation regional tour, which
also includes Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. He has left
Riyadh for Amman of Jordan.

developing traditional friendship and cooperation with Russia in
various areas.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Vietnam is an important strategic partner of Russia
in Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
They also voiced their determination to promote bilateral
cooperation in the fields of oil and gas, energy, and science and
technology, and discussed ways of strengthening and expanding
cooperation between the two countries in culture, science,
education and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that Vietnam and Russia have full potential to
bring bilateral cooperative relations up to a new high, which
conforms to the common wish the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Nien said Vietnam supports Russia's position on disarmament,
opposing nuclear proliferation, opposing international terrorism
and safeguarding state sovereignty and the country's territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Russia supports Vietnam's foreign policy of
independence, sovereignty, multilateralization and diversification.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Putin Hails Debt-Cut Deal With London Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting President
Vladimir Putin on Sunday welcomed the outcome of talks with the
London Club of creditors that would make Moscow pay about 16
billion U.S. dollars less of its debts.
</P>
<P>
Under the understanding secured Friday by Russian First Deputy
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov in Frankfurt,
the club would write off 36.5 percent of Russia's Soviet-era debt
to the tune of 31.8 billion dollars and rescheduling repayment for
30 years.
</P>
<P>
Given the reduction of interest payments, Russia's debt burden
has been eased by about 50 percent. As a result of the deal the
principal debt will be cut by 10.6 billion dollars, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Putin, spending Sunday at the Krasnaya Polyana mountain skiing
resort in the Caucasus, described the London Club's decision as"
very positive."
</P>
<P>
Aside from the write-off, the London Club will also extend the
debt payment to 30 years, including a seven-year grace period. As
the interest rate would be lower than the market one, Russia will
save an additional 6 billion dollars in interest payments.
</P>
<P>
Russia's total foreign debts stood at 158 billion dollars at
the beginning of the year, account for 84.3 percent of its gross
domestic product of 187.5 billion dollars, the Vremya MN newspaper
reported last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Besides the 31.8 billion debt it owes to the London Club,
Russia also has to pay 44 billion dollars to the Paris Club of
foreign creditors, 26 billion dollars in official bilateral and
banking loans, 16 billion dollars to the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
It also has to pay 16 billion dollars in Eurobonds, 9 billion
dollars to the World Bank, 9 billion dollars to foreign holders of
Russian bonds and 6 billion dollars in commercial loans.
</P>
<P>
Russia needs to pay 10.2 billion dollars in debt principal and
interests this year, 4 billion dollars of which is expected to be
paid by new debts.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Crime rate rose by 11.6 percent
last year in Moscow, with more felonies such as murders,
kidnapping robberies registered, a city prosecutor said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, law enforcement agencies of the Russian capital solved
80.4 percent of the cases, up from 79 percent a year earlier, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported, quoting Moscow Deputy Prosecutor
Yuri Andreyechev.
</P>
<P>
Moscow registered 1,206 murders, 138 abductions and 5,500
burglaries in 1999. Andreyechev said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the rising crime partly on the daily visits of some 3
million people from outside the capital. About 46,000 homeless
people were brought to criminal responsibility last year, the
prosecutor said.

<HEADLINE> Addis-Khartoum Direct Telephone Project Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia and Sudan have
begun work on installing telephone lines between Addis Ababa and
Khartoum, the capitals of the two countries respectively, a senior
official disclosed at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Ayenew Bitewligne, vice minister of transport and
communications, told mass media that the telecommunication project
is part of implementation of an earlier agreement signed by the
governments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese experts recently paid a visit to Ethiopia and had
consultations on technical matters with Ethiopian counterparts,
Ayenew said, noting the telephone link will apparently enhance
economic operation between Ethiopia and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
According to Ayenew, existing telecommunication facilities in
northern cities of Bahir Dar and Gondar on the Ethiopian side, and
Gadarif in Sudan will make the installation task easier.
</P>
<P>
Bahir Dar is situated at about 350 km northwest of Addis Ababa,
while Gonder is further north and about 150 km away from Bahir
Dar.
</P>
<P>
Gadarif, an eastern border town of Sudan, is some 120 km away
from Ethiopian western border.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Addis Ababa and Khartoum, which soured
for years, have greatly improved since leaders of the two
countries agreed in May 1997 that they would give no support to
exiled opposition parties from either side.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmed Al Bashir also visited
Ethiopia last December.
</P>
<P>
In addition to on-going telephone project, Ethiopia and Sudan
have also agreed to open the road that links the two countries.

MAPUTO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican police have
detained three people in connection with a drug manufacturing
operation in Maputo, capital of Mozambique, according to a report
by Mozambique News Agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The detentions followed three months of investigations into the
 operations of a plastic manufacturing factory in the Maputo
suburb by the Mozambican police, in coordination with their
Southern African Development Community (SADC) counterparts and the
local community.
</P>
<P>
Plasmex was a factory with a licence to manufacture plastic
products, however, the factory also ran a scam involving the
manufacture of drug mandrax.
</P>
<P>
The police were first aware of Plasmex's shady operations last
October but had waited to collect enough evidence to storm into
the place on Friday and sealed the factory.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the conventional machinery for the production of
plastic substances, the police found that the factory was equipped
with a mandrax manufacturing plant, including machines, a
laboratory, a drying cauldron, an electric generator and an
ice-making device for cooling purposes.
</P>
<P>
Other evidence of the clandestine operations were 12 bags of
powdered mandrax.

<HEADLINE> Barak to Make Decision on Lebanon in Two Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said Sunday that he would take a decision on a possible Israeli
withdrawal from southern Lebanon in April or May in accord with
progress in the peace talks with Syria, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the comments at a weekly cabinet meeting, which
focused on the situation in southern Lebanon in light of mounting
tensions between the Israeli army and Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
One Israeli soldier was killed in the Israeli-occupied border
zone in south Lebanon last Friday, bringing to seven the number of
Israeli soldiers died in fighting with guerrillas in less than
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Barak told the cabinet meeting that if by April or May no
agreement was reached with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon,
or there was no agreement on the horizon, he would make a decision
on what to do with an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised to pull Israeli troops out of the border zone
Israel carved out in 1985 by July this year, preferably through
negotiations with Syria. The latest escalation of violence there
and the impasse on the talks with Syria, however, have led to
rising calls in Israel for an immediate unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Communications Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer said at the cabinet
meeting that Israel should move up the deadline to April if it
becomes clear that an agreement could not be reached by then, the
radio report said.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Yossi Sarid, who is from the left-wing Meretz
party, opposed the idea of a unilateral withdrawal, saying this
move would only force Israel back to southern Lebanon several
months later, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Barak did not reveal what kind of decision he would take on
Lebanon if no breakthrough is made in the talks with Syria by
April. The local daily Haaretz said Sunday that Barak still does
not intend to announce a unilateral pull-out in fear that such a
declaration could harm chances of successful negotiations with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted officials close to the prime minister as saying
that Barak is determined to carry out the withdrawal by the July 7
target date.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resumed last December after a
four-year freeze, broke off last month following a dispute between
the two sides over the agenda. Syria wanted the talks to focus on a
full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights, while
Israel wanted to talk about security arrangements first.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the latest Hezbollah attacks, the cabinet refrained
from ordering a harsh response similar to that it made last week.
Israeli combat planes bombed power stations inside Lebanon and
wounded more than 20 Lebanese civilians in that retaliatory
attacks.
</P>
<P>
After the latest killing of the Israeli soldier in south
Lebanon, Barak chose to order routine air bombing of Hezbollah
targets inside the border zone although the army had suggested a
severe attack inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Barak took the restrained policy in an apparent
effort to avoid totally destroying the chance of resuming talks
with Syria and sparking Hezbollah rocket attacks on towns and
villages in northern Israel.

<HEADLINE> Israel Blamed for Missing Deadline for Framework Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat on Sunday blamed Israel for THE failure to reach a framework
agreement on the final status issues by Sunday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
Terming the passing of the deadline as "regrettable," Erekat
accused the Israeli side of repeatedly failing to honor or fulfill
agreed-upon deadlines during its negotiations with the
Palestinians. Erekat, who has been leading negotiations on the
interim issues including West Bank land transfer, expressed the
hope that the Israeli side will take September 13 seriously to
reach a final peace agreement, the Voice of Palestine radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed last September
between Israel and the Palestinians, the two sides should work out
a framework agreement by February 13 and complete a final peace
accord by September.
</P>
<P>
Erekat stressed that so far the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) has not received any response from Israel concerning the
issues discussed during last week's three-way meeting held at the
residence of Martin Indyke, the U.S ambassador in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians side raised three questions at the meeting
about the fixed date of the third phase of the Israeli pullout from
6.1 percent of the West Bank, implementing obligations under the
transitional phase and the date of reaching an accord on the final
status, said Erekat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed that the PNA had sent letters to all
countries of the world, especially those concerned with the peace
process, to clarify its attitude towards the latest developments of
the Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
held a meeting at the Erez Crossing on February 3 in a bid to
narrow the gaps between the two sides over the long-delayed third
phase of the Israeli withdrawal, which was originally scheduled for
January 20, and reaching a framework agreement for the final
status.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting failed after Barak insisted that Israel
alone should determine the pullout maps and demanded that the fixed
date for final status accord should be postponed for six months.
</P>
<P>
Barak had ordered the Israeli army to unilaterally withdraw
before February 10 regardless of the Palestinian request that it
should cover Abu Dis and other Palestinian-populated areas near
Jerusalem. However, such a withdrawal has not yet started.

<HEADLINE> Indian FM: No Third Party Mediation on Kashmir Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Indian External Affairs
Minister Jaswant Singh Sunday firmly ruled out third party
mediation on the Jammu and Kashmir issue and asserted that U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to India in March has "no linkage
with non-proliferation issues."
</P>
<P>
Soon after addressing a conference on contributions by People
of Indian Origin here, Singh told reporters: "There is no
possibility of mediation, inter-mediation or facilitation when it
comes to the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir."
</P>
<P>
His remarks came a day after Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee asserted that India will not brook any interference in
its internal affairs or "allow others to meddle in our bilateral
relations or problems."
</P>
<P>
The Two Indian leaders' categorical remarks came close on the
heels of statements by U.S. President Clinton, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen and senior
American officials that Washington was prepared to offer its
assistance to resolve the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has maintained that it would not accept
any third-party mediation, involvement or outside interference in
bilateral issues including Kashmir which had to be resolved only
by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Singh made it clear that Clinton's visit to India
next month "has no linkage with non-proliferation issues."
</P>
<P>
He said a decision on signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT) will be taken only after achieving the "widest-possible
consensus" in India and having a "full-fledged" debate in India's
parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said India had abided by its decision not to go for further
tests after the nuclear tests in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder to Invite Castro to Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany will invite Cuban
leader Fidel Castro to take part in the German Expo 2000
Exhibition in Hannover, the capitol of the state of Lower Saxony
this summer, the German Bild am Sonntag weekly magazine reported
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bild am Sonntag cited informed sources as saying that Castro
would accept the invitation and was expected to visit the Expo
2000 site on July 26.
</P>
<P>
On July 26, 1953, Castro led a revolutionary revolt to attack
the Moncada military camp and afterwards the day was set as the
National Day of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Cuba will present a national exhibit under the motto, "
Education, Cocktails and Cigars" at the Expo 2000 in Hannover,
according to the magazine.
</P>
<P>
When incumbent German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was the
Premier of the state of Lower Saxony, he made a visit to Cuba in
November 1996. During the visit, he promised to invite Castro to
visit Germany if he came in power.
</P>
<P>

JAKARTA -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid has asked
Attorney General Marzuki Darusman to set up a team to investigate
the case of Coordinating Minister for Political and Security
Affairs General Wiranto, Cabinet Secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto will keep his cabinet post until the team is set up,
Marsilam said, adding that the team will decide whether Wiranto
was responsible for human rights abuses in the breakaway province
of East Timor last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Marsilam, the decision was made by Wahid after
meeting Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri, Marzuki Darusman
and Wiranto here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wahid has denied there was any compromise in making the
decision.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto had been requested by the president to resign from his
cabinet post after a government-sanctioned inquiry team on East
Timor post-ballot atrocities formally implicated him in the mayhem.
</P>
<P>
However, Wiranto, who refused to resign, has firmly rejected
allegations that Indonesian servicemen had not done much in
maintaining security before and during the process of the August
30 U.N.-organized vote which was won by the anti-integration camp.

<P>
NINGBO, Zhejiang Province, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Center Wang
Zhizhi contributed 49 points and added seven blocks as defending
champions Bayi Rockets held off a second-quarter run by Jiangsu
Dragons for a 119-104 first game win in the best-of-three play-
offs at the Chinese basketball league on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dragons, shaking off the absence of key forward Hu Weidong who
allegedly had a heavy cold, opened for a 12-8 lead and only
trailed by four points after the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Rockets recovered quickly in the second quarter and led by as
many as 10 points for early sections. But Dragons erupted for a
14-5 run, which gave the visitors a five points ahead.
</P>
<P>
The game was tied 51-51 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
The defending champions owed their thanks to Wang, who turned
on the style in the last quarter and finally settled the game for
the home side.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other action, Shanghai Sharks took full advantage
of playing on the home court to beat Beijing Ducks 82-72.

Shangdong Flaming Bulls turned around the game by coming back
from a 39-42 first half deficit to defeat Vanguards Aoshen 79-69.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Australia and Singapore Win Opening Matches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand, Australia and
Singapore all scored convincing victories as the qualifying games
of the Thomas and Uber Cup 2000 World Badminton Team Championship
started in the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand won a straight 5-0 victory over Nepal in the Thomas
Cup preliminary Group A while India and Australia beat Singapore
and Sri Lanka respectively by an identical score of 4-1 in the
Uber Cup.
</P>
<P>
The eight-day competition has drawn players from 14 countries
and regions, including the world's badminton giants China and
Indonesia. While the New Delhi venue was supposed to mainly host
qualifying games for Asian teams, Mauritius from Africa and
Australia also sent in their players.
</P>
<P>
Teams participating in the Thomas Cup Men's Team World
Championship have come from Australia, China, Chinese Taipei, Hong
Kong, India, Iran, Japan, Mauritius, Nepal, the Democratic People'
s Republic of Korea (DPR), Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Women's teams taking part in the Uber Cup qualifying include
Australia, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, the
DPR Korea, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions of the Thomas and Uber Cups, the Indonesia
men's team and Chinese women's team, were absent from the
qualifying rounds due to their privilege to enter the final stage
of the championship directly.
</P>
<P>
As the host of the championship finals due in May, Malaysia
also had its men's and women's teams exempted from the qualifying
stages.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men's team, which has always been longing to
recapture the Thomas Cup since losing it to Malaysia in 1992, sent
most of its best players this time to New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
They include world ranking No.2 Sun Jun and No.11 Chen Hong,
veteran player and now world 17th ranked Dong Jiong, and China's
best men's doubles players Zhang Jun and Zhang Wei, who are now
seeded 14th in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese team will not have a chance to display
their might until Wednesday, when they will meet the qualifier of
the preliminary Group A, which consists of Thailand, Nepal, Sri
Lanka and Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese Taipei men's team, one of the six seeded
teams in the Thomas Cup qualifying, saw their hope to squeeze into
the championship finals turn extremely dim as their top singles
player, world ninth seeded Fung Permadi was forced to withdraw
from his team due to an arm injury.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese women's team, which bagged six berths on the
latest world top 10 singles ranking, didn't turn up, the highest
ranked players in the Uber Cup qualifying competition are Japan's
Yasuko Mizui and Kim Ji Hyun of the ROK, ranked 8th and 10th in
the world respectively.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Questioned by Police Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman was questioned again by police investigators on Sunday over
his alleged financial irregularities of accepting a large sum of
cash gifts from a French millionaire.
</P>
<P>
Six detectives of National Fraud Squad, led by anti-white-collar
crime unit head Miri Golan, arrived at the presidential residence
Sunday morning and began their second interview with Weizman
immediately, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The police declined to provide details of Sunday's questioning.
</P>
<P>
Weizman was charged by investigative journalist Yoav Yitzhak at
the end of last year with receiving French millionaire businessman
Edousrd Saroussi about 453,000 U.S. dollars "cash gifts" between
1988 and 1993, when he was a Knesset (Parliament) member and
cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
Police investigators, who want to determine the nature of
financial transactions between Saroussi and Weizman, had questioned
Weizman last Thursday, the first of its kind against a reigning
president in Israel's 52-year history.
</P>
<P>
Saroussi was also questioned by Israeli police at his residence
in Geneva, Switzerland on a two-day period last week.
</P>
<P>
Comparing two versions of the stories provided by Weizman and
Saroussi about the generous donation, police reportedly had noted a
number of inconsistencies.
</P>
<P>
For example, according Israeli Channel Two television reports,
Saroussi declared to the tax authorities of German and Swiss, the
two countries he has business, that a part of the funds he
transferred to Weizman was "in exchange for advisory services."
</P>
<P>
However, Weizman insisted his old claims in the first
questioning session that he did receive money from Saroussi, but
only as a personal gift without political or business purpose.
</P>
<P>
Channel Two said that the police posses evidence that Weizman is
alleged to have received 1.5 million shekels (about 375,000 U.S.
dollars) for advising two companies owned by Saroussi between 1982
and 1984; in 1990, he was paid 91,000 dollars for advice in
purchasing or starting an English-language newspaper in Israel; and
80,000 dollars for marketing caviar.
</P>
<P>
The criminal probe against Weizman was launched by Israeli
Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein and State Prosecutor Edna Arbel
last month, after a special police team presented them "alleged
evidence of a relationship of business" between Weizman and
Saroussi.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Weizman's wife Reuma, his top aide and Director-
General of his office Aryeh Shumer, his lawyer Hanina Brandes, who
managed the president's accounts related to Saroussi's money, and
acquaintances of the president had also been questioned.
</P>
<P>
Arbel said Saturday night that the investigation should be ended
in a week or two. After that, She and Rubinstein will discuss the
affair with National Police Chief Yehuda Wilk and other senior
investigators to compile a summary report on the affair.
</P>
<P>
Some legal experts worried that the investigation will lead to
allegations against Weizman over tax evasion, crimes against the
law of state service (regarding the receiving of gifts), and
failing to report money received in his declaration of capital as a
member of Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they said, even when evidence seems to indicate
that a crime has been committed, no legal steps will take against
the president as he had immunity from criminal prosecution
according to the Basic Law of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Weizman dismissed widespread rumors that he would resign or at
least step aside temporarily from his highly ceremonial post in a
dramatic televised speech to the whole country last month, saying
that he did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
Elected president in 1993 and re-elected in 1998, Weizman was
one of the most outspoken and popular politicians in Israel. The
fighter-turned-peacemaker firmly committed to supporting peace
talks with Arab countries. He will end his second-term as president
in 2003,if not resign because of the investigation.

JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Trott Moloto has not been
dismissed as coach of the South African national soccer team and
no action is to be taken against him for at least the next month,
South African Press Association reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Raymond Hack, South African Football Association (SAFA) chief
executive, said that Moloto's contract was officially due to
expire one month after the conclusion of the African Cup of
Nations tournament.
</P>
<P>
Hack explicitly denied a local newspaper that Moloto had been "
fired" as Bafana Bafana coach.
</P>
<P>
"To say that Trott has been fired is utter rubbish. Trott
Moloto is still the national coach," said Hack.
</P>
<P>
"And until SAFA have been advised by our technical committee
and until we have studied their report on the African Nations Cup,
as well as the coach's, SAFA will continue to defend and support
Trott Moloto in his role as national coach.
</P>
<P>
"Both SAFA and the coach have to be given the opportunity to
state their cases on the team's and the coach's performances
during the tournament. " added Hack.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkey Plays Stronger Role in Mideast Water Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- As the stalled peace talks
between Syria and Israel once again put Turkey on the spot with
regards to the water issue, Turkey is playing a stronger role in
the Middle East water diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
One major topic on the agenda of the Syrian-Israeli talks is
water, as the Golan Heights, which Israel seized in 1967 from
Syria, is rich in water resources and key to any water
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Syria ever signaled that it may make some concessions on the
Golan water arrangement if it could be supplied with more water
from other sources, thus automatically turning all eyes towards
Turkey which has more water than other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the logic goes like this: Turkey should supply
more water to Syria, thus enabling the signing of a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Some suggested that, Turkey, the upstream country of Euphrates,
provide more water from the river to Syria which in turn concede to
Israel on the Golan water allocation, trading for Israeli
withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
As water gets more scarce in the Middle East, Turkey, which has
relatively more water resources has become pivotal for any future
water arrangements in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, a few days ago, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel took
an objection to the sale of water from rivers in southern Turkey,
saying Turkey has been facing a water shortage for irrigating its
Amik Plateau due to Syria's refusal to allow water of the Orantes
River, near Hatay on the Syrian border, to flow into the region.
</P>
<P>
He said, therefore, as an alternative, Turkey will need waters
from its southern rivers to irrigate the Amik Plateau.
</P>
<P>
At a private water company's meeting in Antalya last week,
Turkish Minister of Agriculture Husnu Gokalp said, "Oil belongs to
our Arab brothers, water belongs to Turkey." He suggested there
should be pipelines, running parallel to those carrying Turkish
water to the region, to carry oil to Turkey, stressing this must be
a pure commercial matter.
</P>
<P>
When speculation emerged that Damascus asked both Israel and the
United States, two countries enjoying good relations with Turkey,
to press Ankara to supply Syria with more water at the recent talks
in Washington, Ankara immediately declared that it would not accept
any Middle East peace deal that would be reached over Turkish
water.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that water in the drought-torn Mideast, which
is becoming a strategic asset in the region, might be used as a
weapon in case of escalating tension.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD Should Help Developing Nations Benefit From Trading System: Thai Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has a special responsibility to
assist developing countries in maximizing the opportunities and
benefits from the evolving multilateral trading system (MTS),
Supachai Panitchpakdi, president of UNCTAD X, said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said UNCTAD should assist developing countries, particularly
the Least Developed Countries, in their accession process to the
World Trade Organization as well as in developing the supply
capacity required for an effective integration into the global
economic system.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, who is also Thailand's deputy prime minister and
commerce minister, made the remark on the second day of UNCTAD X,
which will last till February 19.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said many developing countries face particular
handicaps due to their small size and vulnerability, which is
often accompanied by excessive dependence on the export of one or
two primary commodities.
</P>
<P>
"The benefit these countries can derive from the multilateral
trading system is a function of the extent to which they are able
to diversify, enhance their export capacity and increase their
integration," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said UNCTAD can provide support through technical
cooperation programs and analytical work so that developing
countries can participate effectively.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that developing countries are better prepared and
become equal partners in the MTS, UNCTAD should gear the policy
debate toward attaining practical and concrete approaches in
meeting the development challenges.
</P>
<P>
It should also undertake analysis and research as the basis for
consensus on global development-related issues and include various
members of society in the elaboration of strategies, understanding
of emerging issues and in technical and capacity building
activities.

<HEADLINE> hke021321 --Multilateral Trading System Should be Reformed: China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The multilateral system must
be reformed and developing countries should play a greater role in
formulating the international trade system, a senior Chinese
official said at the 10th session of the United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X) here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The lesson from the Seattle meeting is that agenda items that
are closely linked with the interests of developing countries must
be fully considered in any new round of negotiations and a
balanced agenda is the very first step for the success of new
negotiations," said Zhou keren, head of the Chinese delegation to
the current UNCTAD conference.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegations holds that the new multilateral trade
negotiations should have a starting point, which should be "
development," said Zhou, who is also Chinese deputy minister of
trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Without economic development, he added, attractive markets
cannot be formed and market-opening will have no real commercial
value.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese delegation believes that any new round of
multilateral trade negotiations should be "a round of development.
"
</P>
<P>
Globalization should be an effective tool for the development
of all the countries and peoples of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation holds that economic globalization is a
necessary outcome of the fast growth of the world economy and
science and technology, a development trend that countries of the
world have to face," the Chinese deputy trade minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, economic globalization is a "double-edged sword," he
said, noting that while providing opportunities for mankind's
prosperity and development, it will inevitably bring about severe
challenges and risks.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a reform for the existing international economic
system, Zhou said the world needs a sound and effective
international financial system and a "fair, safe, non-
discriminatory and predictable" multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
"Developing countries should keep a sober mind and take
effective measures to face up to the challenges and risks posed by
economic globalization and actively participate in the reform of
international economic system," Zhou noted.
</P>
<P>
He urged the developed countries, as the biggest beneficiary of
economic globalization, to shoulder more responsibility and
obligation in this area.
</P>
<P>
Along with the constant development of the globalization trend,
there is increasing economic interdependence and mutual influence
among countries of the world, Zhou said, adding that the
developing countries need a sound international environment and
help from the international community under such circumstances.
</P>
<P>
He also urged all members of the international community to
conduct extensive and effective international coordination and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that in the new century, the international community
can formulate new comprehensive development for developing
countries, ensure sufficient development funds for them and
promote investment and technology transfer to developing countries,
" Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD X opened on Saturday and will last till February 19.
During the meeting, participants are expected to address the broad
theme of "applying the lessons of the past to make globalization
an effective instrument for the development of all countries and
of all peoples."

<HEADLINE> Indian Oil Corp Draws Up Big Investment Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Indian Oil Corporation (IOC)
said Sunday that it has drawn up an investment plan of 600 billion
rupees (13.95 billion U.S. dollars) to meet the country's growing
demand for petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
IOC Chairman M. A. Pathan told an international seminar in
southwest India that this was by far the largest investment
proposed by an Indian corporate and the IOC was not only confident
of converting its strategic investment program into reality, but
the road map to emerge as a major, diversified, transnational
energy company has also been well charted out.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum consumption was expected to touch a level of 155
million tons by 2006-2007, necessitating large investments in
upstream and downstream facilities, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said an investment of 3,000 billion rupees (69.77 billion
dollars) would be required by 2010 to meet India's projected
petroleum demand.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- South African Sports
Minister Ngconde Balfour lauded the national soccer team Bafana
Bafana for their stout efforts in the African Nations Cup
tournament in Nigeria and Ghana, despite their failure to make the
finals, local newspaper City Press reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was beat by Nigeria 2-0 in the semifinals in Lagos
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I realize there is a probably a terrible feeling of
despondency in the camp after our defeat to Nigeria in the
semifinals. It was a tough call but let us acknowledge that on the
day the Nigerians had the ball rolling for them," Balfour said.
</P>
<P>
"Defeat is never easy to absorb, but I admire the boys for not
giving up against great odds. There is nothing wrong with defeat
in a match such as this one. There were elements that were not in
your favour and it is understandable that you will be bitterly
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
"However, there was enough skill and talent in the team for you
to lift yourselves when you played Tunisia in the play-off last
night," Balfour said.
</P>
<P>
Bafana Bafana beat Tunisia in the play-off for the third place
in Accra Friday night.
</P>
<P>
"As sports minister, I wear my Bafana Bafana jersey with pride
and dignity. I want the boys to do likewise. Now is not the time
for recriminations and finger-pointing. The team gave its all and
we are just proud of that," Balfour added.

MACAO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Macao SAR beat Brunei 1-0 while
Japan whitewashed Singapore 3-0 here Sunday on the first day of
the Group Ten matches of the Asian Cup soccer preliminary
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Macao SAR and Brunei seemed to be matching each other on the
whole, but the former were better in terms of both individual
skills and comprehensive organization. In addition, Macao SAR
players had the home advantage and were more familiar with the
court.

The later contest between Japan and Singapore was lopsided,
with the Singaporeans being no rival to the Japanese and the
latter taking control of the field throughout the match.

<HEADLINE> Movements of Ice on Yellow River Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) --According to the State Flood
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, more than 1,000 km of the
5,400 km Yellow River froze this winter. Chinese provinces and
autonomous regions along Yellow River recorded the lowest average
temperature in the past 13 years.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 430 million cu m of the River froze in
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The Flood Control Office is closely
monitoring developments around the clock. Plenty of materials and
equipment are ready in case of any unexpected emergencies.
</P>
<P>
In Shanxi Province, more than 200 people used earth and straw
bags to build a 1,500-meter-long embankment to contain the outflow
of iced water from the Hejin section of the Yellow River bank
which burst in the afternoon of February 9.
</P>
<P>
While sending more people to patrol both banks along the Yellow
River, Shanxi police were called in to help.
</P>
<P>
According to sources in Shandong Province where the Yellow
River flows downstream, the threat of large ice movements is
unlikely due to warmer temperatures in the past several days.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that up until February 12, ice at some section of
the river in Shandong were as thick as 20 cm.
</P>
<P>
Flood control officials in Shandong will continue to keep a
vigilant eye on the river and are well prepared for any
emergencies that might arise.

<HEADLINE> China Restructures Its Rural Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to make
further efforts in restructuring its rural economy and improving
the daily life of the farmers this year.
</P>
<P>
In a "Proposal on Agriculture and Rural Economic Work" made
public today, the Communist Party of China Central Committee and
the State Council stress that China's agriculture and rural
economy are facing new challenges and problems.
</P>
<P>
The proposal states, among other things, that it is imperative
to comprehensively improve the quality and efficiency of
agriculture and rural economy, and increase the income of farmers.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring efforts will primarily be focused on improving
the quality of agricultural products by increasing marketable
crops, accelerating the development of animal husbandry and farm
produce processing, and optimizing the layout of agricultural
regions.
</P>
<P>
Cultivated land must be put under strict protection to ensure
grain production, while there will be drastic restructuring in the
rural labor force, with efforts being made to vigorously develop
small towns and township enterprises in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels are required to concentrate on four
major tasks during the restructuring. These include building a
rural market system, popularizing agricultural technology among
the farmers, and protecting the environment in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also calls on efforts to develop rural
infrastructure facilities, including the construction of water
conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
As part of the government's poverty elimination work, the
proposal says efforts are needed to help another 10 million rural
people get out of absolute poverty this year, while promoting
socialist cultural and ethical development in the rural areas.

CAIRO, February 13 ( Xinhua ) -- The following are economic
briefs from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The total tax revenues from tourism sector in Egypt
during the fiscal year 1998/1999 amounted to about 670 million U.S
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the Egyptian ministry of
tourism, the volume of inflows of foreign currencies, during the
same period, reached some 3.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt is expected to participate in the 17th session of
Khartoum exhibition which will be held from 17 to 28 this month in
the Sudanese capital. Egypt will be represented in this exhibition
by some 60 companies that will display their various products.
</P>
<P>
The Arab economic daily, Alalm El-Yom, on Sunday quoted the
chairman of the public authority for exhibitions, Mohamed Saeed
Saleh, as saying the economic gathering will certainly help boost
the trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Lebanese ministry of industry said the number of
companies that passed the quality control tests, ISO, till the end

purchases from both domestic and foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
Alalm El-Yom, Arab daily on Sunday quoted the deputy general

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Economy Grows 3.5 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's real gross
domestic products (GDP) grew 3.5 percent in 1999 compared with
1998, thanks to the good performance of the mining, animal
husbandry and energy sectors, according to figures released
recently by the statistics office.
</P>
<P>
The growth was attributed to the increase in the production of
refined copper concentrates, gold and energy, and the stable
development of the livestock-farming, communication and transport
sectors.
</P>
<P>
One third of the total GDP was produced by the animal husbandry
sector. It grew only 1.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The government's revenues reached 207 billion togrogs (190
million U.S. dollars), up 29 percent from 1998. The rate of
togrog to the U.S. dollar remained stable in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The number of registered unemployed was 39.8 thousand at the
end of 1999, down 20.2 percent from the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the country's total external trade volume stood at 761.
4 million dollars, with exports hitting 335.6 million dollars.
China replaced Russia as Mongolia's largest trading partner.

<HEADLINE> Britain Moves to Remove ex-Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain has asked Russia and
Pakistan if they could take in 125 former hostages from the
hijacked Afghan airliner, a Home Office spokesman said late on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The hijack ended peacefully last Thursday after the hijackers,
who had forced the Ariana Boeing 727 to fly to London's Stansted
airport, surrendered after a four-day stand-off.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office spokesman said that just 17 of the 142 freed
hostages, who have been moved to an immigration holding center in
Gloucestershire, had said they wanted to return home to Taliban-
controlled Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The British government has taken a tough line on the former
hostages.
</P>
<P>
"The government has contacted some other governments with a
view to whether they would accept these people, including
countries with large Afghan communities," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"We have made contacts with Pakistan and Russia, but so far
there has been no decision from them," he added, "Only 17 of the
freed hostages want to go home."
</P>
<P>
So far, 74 of those originally on the hijacked plane have
claimed asylum, while a chartered aircraft is waiting at a Royal
Airforce Field at Brize Norton, west of London, to take back home
those who want to return to Afghanistan. It could leave as early
as Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The British government has denied passengers are being put
under pressure not to claim asylum, but Home Secretary Jack Straw
has said he wanted to see those who had been on board the Afghan
plane removed from the country "as soon as practicably possible."
</P>
<P>
The Home Office spokesman said that the Afghans would be able
to appeal against any decision to deport them against their will.
</P>
<P>
Late on Saturday, the hostages were driven in a coach convoy
from Stansted to an immigration holding center in Moreton-in-the-
Marsh, where they will be interviewed by immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
Refugee organizations have urged Straw not to deport those
wanting to stay in Britain after their ordeal.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two people arrested after the hijack ended are still
being questioned by police and are expected to appear in court
early next week to be charged under the Prevention of Terrorism
Act.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers said today that the
eleven missing miners in a gas explosion last Wednesday at Tong'an
Coal Mine in northeast China's Jilin Province have little hope of
surviving after five days.
</P>
<P>
Wei Rongguo and nineteen other miners went down the mine on
February 8 to extinguish a fire. All miners evacuated the mine
after failing to contain the fire at 8:00 the next morning.
Ventilators stopped running because of power cut.
</P>
<P>
Two gas explosions occurred after the miners went down again at
13:30 February 9 when power supply was resumed. Wei and five of
his colleagues fled being slightly injured. Four bodies, and one
with serious burn were found during rescue operations, and there
was no sign of the remaining eleven miners. Rescue crew said that
as the fire continued to blaze, rescue operations had to be
aborted.
</P>
<P>
Leading provincial Party and government officials and the mayor
of Changchun rushed to the scene to organize rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Railway Sector No Longer Losing Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- According to the latest
statistics, the railway sector carried 976 million passengers and
1.57 billion tons of cargo in 1999, earning a total income of 99.8
billion, an increase of 8.3 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
The railway sector, dubbed "the last bastion of China's central
planned economy," was known for low-efficient operational and
management systems as China embarked on a track of reform in the
late 1970s and early 1980s. The sector suffered continual losses
since 1994. By the end of 1997, losses amounted to 15.6 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
In early 1998, leading officials of the Ministry of Railways
decided to take drastic measures and ensure that losses would turn
into profits.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China spent 57 billion yuan on
railway construction in 1999, building 1,087 km of new lines and 1,
041 km of double track lines. Some 607 km of electrified railway
lines were also put into operation.

<P>
LANZHOU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The General Hospital of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) Lanzhou Military Area Command has
succeeded in removing a huge rare pearly tumor from a patient's
skull.
</P>
<P>
Before surgery, the patient, a 42-year-old woman from the city
of Baiyun in northwest China's Gansu Province, had difficulties in
walking and speaking due to the tumor's pressure on her brain and
cervical vertebra.
</P>
<P>
After careful examination of the patient, doctors at the
hospital performed microsurgery, taking more than seven hours.
Neural surgery succeeded in completely removing the 1,500-cubic-
centimetre tumor, larger than a person's fist.
</P>
<P>
The patient has been discharged from the PLA hospital after
recovery from the surgery.

<HEADLINE> Former Falun Gong Head Turns Over A New Leaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Ye Maiyan, former deputy head of
the Anqing Falun Gong Instruction Group has turned a new leaf
after breaking away from the banned cult.
</P>
<P>
Ye is a doctor at the Anqing College of Traditional Chinese
Medicine in Anhui Province, east China. He was introduced into the
cult in 1996 believing that Falun Gong can help cure illnesses and
terminal diseases.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 Ye was promoted to the fourth deputy head of the Falun
Gong Instruction Group in Anqing City and became a leading member
of the Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
After the April 25 incident last year in which thousands of
Falun Gong practitioners besieged the Zhongnanhai government
compound in Beijing, Ye continued his illegal activities. On July
21, 1999, he was seized by the public security department while
organizing illegal activities in the provincial capital of Hefei
and was sent back to Anqing.
</P>
<P>
With the help of colleagues from his college, Ye began to learn
more about the true nature of Falun Gong and the cult's pernicious
influences. Realizing his errors, Ye requested the college that he
be relieved from his post of a department head. However, the
college decided not to do so because he has repented.
</P>
<P>
Ye now devoted nearly all of his time and energy into his
profession and continues to play an integral role at the college.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 13 ( Xinhua ) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
will visit Morocco on Monday and Italy on Tuesday to give a impetus
to the Palestinian track in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of Palestine reported Sunday that Arafat will attend
the meetings of the Jerusalem Committee, which will be held on
Monday in Rabat. Sixteen ministers of finance from the member
states in the Jerusalem Committee will also participate in the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will leave Morocco for Rome on Tuesday to meet the
Italian president and other leading officials.
</P>
<P>
During his tour, Arafat will discuss the latest developments of
the peace process, particularly the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations recently fell into a deadlock after the two
sides failed to conclude an agreement on the final status before
the February 13 deadline, which was stipulated in the Sharm el
Sheikh memorandum signed by the two sides last September.
</P>
<P>
The memo obliges the two sides to reach a framework agreement on

issues such as refugee, border, water, Jewish settlement and
Jerusalem by February 13, 2000, and a final peace treaty on
those issues by September 2000.

<HEADLINE> Manila Sets up One-Stop Center to Spur Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Sunday that it has set up a one-stop action center to cut red tape
in setting up new businesses, along with other measures aimed at
spurring the entry of more foreign investments in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Aprodicio Laquian, chief of staff of the Office of the
President, said in a radio-TV program here that the one-stop
center is under the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).
</P>
<P>
"If you are an investor, you just go there and everything will
be taken care of," Laquian said.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, President Joseph Estrada signed an executive
order revitalizing an investment center at the DTI to make
investing in the Philippines hassle-free.
</P>
<P>
Laquian said the center provides prospective investors with
information, guidance and advice regarding Philippine customs,
trade, taxes and other laws.
</P>
<P>
It has personnel from the DTI, Board of Investments, Bureau of
Immigration, Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of
Environment and Natural Resources, Bureau of Internal Revenue,
Bureau of Customs, and even local government units, according to
Laquian.
</P>
<P>
DTI Undersecretary Zenaida Maglaya, who was one of the
panelists in the program, said the one-stop center is now fully
operational, helping investors set up their businesses with a
minimum of red tape.

according to the Reserve Bank of India.
</P>
<P>
The 0.43 percentage fall in the annual rate of inflation to 2.
88 percent from 3.31 percent the previous week was triggered off
by a 0.2 percent fall in the Index of Primary Articles.

The country's inflation was way higher at 4.82 percent during
the corresponding week in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate rose to a 32-week high of 3.31 percent for

<HEADLINE> Djibouti Port to Be Administrated by Dubai: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Djibouti is to hand over
the entire port administration to the Port of Dubai, the United
Arab Emirates, local Capital weekly reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations over the matter have been going on for about two
months between officials from the two ports.
</P>
<P>
A 20-year lease agreement is about to be signed in the coming
three weeks, an unidentified source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti chose the Port of Dubai for its good reputations and
excellent record in port administration.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Port of Dubai also administers, among
others, Saudi Arabia's Port of Jidda, Lebanon's Port of Beirut and
one port in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Djiboutian government decided to give the business of its
port to a third party in order to efficiently handle the
ever-increasing cargo that is arriving at its port, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
With Dubai taking over the management, efficiency at the
Djibouti port will be improved and new facilities will be
available to increase the volume of traffic, Djibouti port
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Thus, there will be a good possibility for tariff to lower down,
the officials added.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the Port of Djibouti handled four million tons of
cargo, 70 percent of which was Ethiopia's import and export
shipments.

<HEADLINE> Most UK Forces' Equipment Is Late Or Faulty: NAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Two-third of the 65 major
weapons and equipment orders placed by the Ministry of Defense in
the past five years failed to arrive on time or didn't work,
according to an inquiry by the National Audit Office.
</P>
<P>
The revelations come just two weeks after it was disclosed that
troops in Bosnia were forced to contact each other by mobile
phones because their Army radios didn't work.
</P>
<P>
In some instances, NAO said, sub-standard equipment was
accepted and put into active service by the Ministry of Defense
merely to avoid further delays in delivery.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Navy was even forced to take delivery of the Royal
Fleet Auxiliary Fort Victoria despite knowing that there were no
fewer than 13,000 defects, NAO added.
</P>
<P>
The all-party Commons Public Accounts Committee is reported to
launch an inquiry into the NAO's findings -- the latest in a
series of highly critical accounts of defense procurement.
</P>
<P>
David Davis, the committee's Conservative chairman, criticized
the lack of rigor on behalf of the Ministry of Defense, saying "
This has a real impact on the armed forces."
</P>
<P>
"Each year the Ministry of Defense accepts into service 13
major new or significantly modified equipment, yet in more than
half of the cases equipment does not fully meet operational
requirement," he added.

<P>
MACAO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Beginning from next Monday,
deposit rates in Macao will rise by 0.25 percent, according to
sources with the Macao Association of Banks.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made right after the Hong Kong Association of
Banks announced Friday that the deposit rates in Hong Kong would
be raised 0.25 percent across the board.
</P>
<P>
As the Macao currency of pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong
dollar, banking rates in Macao normally fluctuate following
relevant changes in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Analysts with the financial sector in Macao said that the rise
in deposit rates may affect local economy in the short term, but
will not pose a blow to the economy in the long run because the
scope of change is slight.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Disqualification of Hopefuls for Iranian Elections Slated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 13(Xinhua) -- Iran's Interior Minister
Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari on Sunday denounced the illegal
disqualification of some hopefuls for the forthcoming crucial
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Lari told a press conference that the Guardians Council, the
country's powerful watchdog on elections, rejected some hopefuls
without clear proofs and even after the deadline set by the
election laws for it to screen the qualification of candidates.
</P>
<P>
"We have handed over the list of hopefuls illegally rejected by
the council," he said, declining to mention the exact number.
</P>
<P>
Lari warned that his ministry would publish the list of the
disqualified candidates if the Guardians Council did not change its
stance.
</P>
<P>
"The Interior Ministry, as an executive body, pledges to defend
the rights of candidates and the electorate and will follow up the
case, if even a single hopeful is disqualified illegally," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had sent a letter to the arbitrate State
Expediency Council (SEC) headed by former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, urging it to settle the differences between his
ministry and the Guardians Council.
</P>
<P>
Lari said that a total of 6,860 people had registered to run for
the parliamentary polling slated for February 18, a sensitive one
which will create a new power balance in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said about 400 hopefuls were rejected by the executive boards
assigned by the Interior Ministry, 370 other rejected by the
supervisory boards assigned by the Guardians Council, and over 80
people were disqualified directly by the council.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the Guardians Council should offer clear
and documented proofs to support its move to disqualify hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
The Guardians Council has claimed that the disqualified hopefuls
were mainly from illegal political groups or those who have been
convicted of various charges.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian moderates, the main supporters of the reformist
policies of President Mohammad Khatami, have accused the council of
disqualifying their key hopefuls, including the former reformist
Interior Minister Abdullah Nouri, who was jailed late last year for
insulting the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the participation of political parties and groups
in the elections, Lari said that all the parties and groups which
had received official permission would have the rights to take part
in the polling.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Freedom Movement of Iran which did not
obtain official permission is regarded as illegal political group
in the view of the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, over 38 million people above 16 years
old are eligible for casting votes and the result would be
announced within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Iran's moderate and conservative factions have started their
campaigns months ago, though propagation for candidates were kicked
off officially on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The moderates expected to win a majority in the Iranian
legislative body to push forward the reformist policies of
President Khatami while the conservatives, who control the
country's most sensitive bodies, vowed to strengthen their
domination in order to safeguard the values of the Islamic
revolution.

<HEADLINE> Help Needed for Developing Nations to Explore Low-Cost Factors: Cambodian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Much needs to be done to
encourage and enable developing countries to reach their full
potential and use their advantages in low-cost productivity
factors, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Attaching unreasonable and stringent conditionalities to use
such factors and to achieve standards which took centuries to be
reached elsewhere, thwarts and negates the under-lying principle
of growth and free trade," Hun Sen told delegates to the 10th
Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
Free trade has been acting mainly in favor of those who seek
abundant resources, markets and profits, he said.
</P>
<P>
But for those who want to get on the band-wagon of fast growth
and prosperity and sell goods to developed markets, this free
trade philosophy also comes with domestic-policy based barriers in
the consuming countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked for more transfers of financial, technical and
technological resources and free opportunities for trade to
developed markets without hidden conditionalities and domestic
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
He called for steps to be taken to write-off the huge debt of
outstanding loans to some of the poor countries including Cambodia
and ensure that more "grant" rather than "loan" funds flow to them
till they reach a minimum threshold.

<HEADLINE> 13,600 Tamil Rebels Killed in S.Lanka's Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 13,602 Tamil Tiger
rebels had been killed in Sri Lanka's civil war, the Island
newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry said Sunday another 10 rebels
had been killed in fresh fighting in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Island said 13,602 separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) cadres had been killed from 1983 to December 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper based its figures on a special magazine
Sooriyappudalvargal (Sons of Sun) issued by LTTE's London
Secretariat to mark last year's Heroes Day in late November.
</P>
<P>
The magazine did not mention LTTE cadres killed during 1999.
But the military believed that the LTTE had lost at least 600
cadres last year in its continuous fight for an independent Tamil
state in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said 10 rebels had been killed on Saturday
in fresh fighting in the northernmost Jaffna peninsula, the former
stronghold of LTTE rebels until 1996.
</P>
<P>
A ministry statement said troops engaged a group of LTTE rebels
with machine guns and small arms at Kelairetam.
</P>
<P>
Four LTTE rebels were killed in the fighting while one soldier
was injured, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In another incident at Muhavil, troops engaged a rebels' bunker
with rocket-propelled grenades, killing three rebels and injuring
two others.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, troops sniped and killed three rebels in two
separate confrontations at Sankatharavayal and Thanankilappu.

<HEADLINE> IOC Warns Athletes of Pre-Sydney-Olympics Drug Testing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Athletes competing at the
Sydney Olympics will be subject to out-of-competition drug testing
anywhere in Australia two weeks before the Games, the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) said in Sydney on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Rogge, head of the IOC's coordination commission which
finished a three-day meeting on Sydney's Games preparations, said
the doping policy had been finalized with athletes to be randomly
tested from September 2.
</P>
<P>
The IOC and the Australian Sports Drugs Agency (ASDA) will test
between 200 and 400 accredited athletes.
</P>
<P>
The testing is not limited to the official athletes village but
to all private training venues across Australia, and possibly New
Zealand and New Caledonia.
</P>
<P>
The tests will be on top of the 2,000 tests to be conducted in
competition.
</P>
<P>
Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates said the out-
of-competition tests would be under the control of the Sydney
Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), which was
contracting ASDA, and under the procedures and protocols of the
SOCOG/IOC medical commission.
</P>
<P>
He said ASDA would include blood tests if they were approved by
the IOC.
</P>
<P>
Rogge also said transport was the biggest concern for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
He said an extra 1.8 million trips would be added to Sydney's
regular transport system.
</P>
<P>
"To augment transport by 1.8 million trips a day is a major
challenge," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If Sydneysiders are disciplined and they want and agree to
take to take public transport, then there will be no problems," he
said, adding "if everyone wants to take their car, then we will
have a problem."

<HEADLINE> Japan Wins Asian Women Beach Volleyball Tournament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Japan team No. 1
stamped its class to beat Australia team no. 1 by 15-11, and
claimed the top honors in the First Nestea Asian Women Beach
Volleyball Invitational Tournament here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Japanese volleybellers Teruko Nakano and Kaori Tsuchia made a
good start and enabled to survive the last-ditch rally of
Australian pair Summer Lochowicz and Sue Himbeck to bring home the
top prize money of 1,500 U.S. dollars in this three-day tournament
that serves as a kickoff leg of the Annual Asian Circuit.
</P>
<P>
From a 3-0 start, former Atlanta Olympics veteran Nakano and
Tuschia, used their experience and teamwork to squander a
commanding 11-1.
</P>
<P>
But the Australian pair of Lochowicz and Himbeck did not lose
their fighting form to cut the lead to 4-12. As they regained
their confidence, the Australian pair further trimmed the deficit
to 7-13 as highlighted with two service aces of Lochowicz.
</P>
<P>
Lochowicz and Himbeck, who ranked no.3 in Asian Circuit,
exchanged good spikes and kills with Japanese duo Nakano and
Tsichia that gave more delight to the local spectators.
</P>
<P>
From an 13-8, the score came closer to 14-11 before the
Australians
finally yielded to the Japanese' killing spikes.
</P>
<P>
"We are a little bit nervous. The pressure is on us as they(
Japanese) enabled to make a good start but anyway we are happy to
place runner-up in this leg," said Australian volleybellers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian pair of Timy Yudhani and Yohana Elizabeth
settled for third place after beating Australian second team--Emma
Prowse and Cindy Godwin, 15-8.
</P>
<P>
Rounding up the final rankings i this tournament organized by
the Philippine Amateur Volleyball Association (PAVA) are Australia
team No.2 (4th), New Zealand (5th), Japan 2 (6th), Thailand 1 (7th)

<HEADLINE> Hornacek Defends Title in Long Distance Shootout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OAKLAND, California, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Utah Jazz guard
Jeff Hornacek defended his title as the NBA's best shooter with a
lackluster showing in the normally pulsating event at All-Star
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hornacek entered with the lowest 3-point percentage of anyone
in the eight-man field and may have been a bit fatigued from
winning the 2ball competition just minutes earlier. He actually
shot much better in that event.
</P>
<P>
"Too bad they didn't have a surrender flag or I would have
waved it," Hornacek said. "It's hard to do, to shoot the 3-
pointers."
</P>
<P>
Planning to retire after this season, Hornacek made 11-of-25
shots in the
final round to defeat Milwaukee Bucks All-Star guard Ray Allen and
Dallas Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki, who played in the Rookie
Challenge this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Allen went first in the final round and made just six shots
for 10 points. Hornacek was next and managed 13 points, making his
final shot worth two points.
</P>
<P>
Hornacek watched as Nowitzki got off to a quick start but
quickly faded. After two racks, Nowitzki had six points and looked
ready to dethrone Hornacek. But he made just 3-of-15 shots
thereafter and came up two points short.
</P>
<P>
"You're not counting, you're just shooting, trying to focus on
your shot," said Nowitzki, the only forward in the field. "But I
heard somebody in the back shouting that I needed three or four.
But I just couldn't make it."
</P>
<P>
Hornacek became the fourth repeat champion, joining legendary
Larry Bird (1986 88), Craig Hodges (1990-91) and Mark Price (1993-
94).
</P>
<P>
After winning 2ball, Hornacek opted to go last in the first
round and scored 17 points, wedging his way between Nowitzki (18)
and Allen (16), who were competing in their first shootout.
</P>
<P>
NBA scoring leader and All-Star guard Allen Iverson was unable
to complete his final rack and managed just 10 points. Cleveland
Cavaliers guard Bob Sura was even worse, managing nine.
</P>
<P>
"For a lot of guys, it was the first time," Hornacek said. "
The first time out is a tough time to do it. You don't realize
that the first 10 shots of that are pretty easy. You have energy,
then you do get tired."
</P>
<P>
A surprising early exit came from Mavericks guard Hubert Davis,
who in 1998
finished second to Hornacek. The only player shooting better than
50 percent from 3-point range this season, Davis scored just 14
points, one less than Vancouver Grizzlies guard Mike Bibby and San
Antonio Spurs guard Terry Porter.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this afternoon, this year's rookie team beat the
second-year players 92-83 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
Elton Brand of the Chicago Bulls scored 16 points and grabbed
21 rebounds to win the MVP. Paul Pierce scored 18 points and Dirk
Nowitzki added 17 for the sophomores.
</P>
<P>
Hornacek also won the 2ball competition with partner Natalie
Williams. Hornacek's final 19-footer snapped the tie and gave Utah
68 points. That was enough to defeat Jason Kidd and Jennifer
Gillom of Phoenix, who posted a score of 61 in the final round.
</P>
<P>
This was just the second year of 2ball, which was installed in
1998 as a replacement event for the Slam Dunk Contest. Eight duos
of players from NBA and WNBA teams from the same city were entered.
</P>
<P>
The All-Star Game will be held tomorrow's afternoon here.

<HEADLINE> NBA Commissioner Delivers News on Rockets, Rodman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OAKLAND, California, February 12 (Xinhua) -- NBA commissioner
David Stern said Saturday that the Houston Rockets are certain to
move to a new city if they don't get a new arena by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Voters in Houston turned down a referendum last fall to
publicly finance half of the cost of a new building.
</P>
<P>
"As far as them moving, it's more than probable, it's certain
that the team will be relocated" if plans are not in place for a
new arena by the time the Rockets' lease at the Compaq Center
expires following the 2002-03 season, Stern said.
</P>
<P>
Stern also disclosed that the NBA had reached agreement with
its referees on a new four-year collective bargaining agreement
that kicks in next season. Officials will receive raises of
roughly 10 percent per season, a league attorney said.
</P>
<P>
Also, the league ruled that Dennis Rodman will have to move out
of the guest house he is renting from prospective Dallas Mavericks
owner Mark Cuban.
</P>
<P>
Rodman had agreed to pay Cuban 3,000 U.S. dollar per month for
use of the house, but the league ruled it to be a violation of
salary cap rules. Rodman signed with Dallas earlier this month and
played his first game last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It was a fairly innocent error,'' deputy commissioner Russ
Granik said, "Under the assumption that as long as it was a fair
rental, it wasn't a benefit under the salary cap. But we don't
want to get into deciding in every case is it fair, is it not fair,
is it the right value. Those kinds of arrangements are just
prohibited. So I think in due course Mr. Rodman will be moving out.
That would be Tuesday," Stern said.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Invites Bid for Liquefied Gas Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province will welcome overseas investors with fine qualifications
to compete in a public bidding for the right to construct a local
liquefied natural gas (LNG) project.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the detailed documents for the
public bidding will soon be worked out. The LNG project will cost
30.6 billion yuan (3.68 billion U.S. dollars) and will be built in
two stages.
</P>
<P>
Domestic investors of China will have a controlled share of the
stake, with the proportion of the investment making up 65 percent
of the total, while overseas investors will be allowed to take up
35 percent of the entire spending, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project, which has been approved by the
State, will cover Guangzhou, the provincial capital, Shenzhen,
Foshan and Dongguan, all in Guangdong, and will be completed in
2005.
</P>
<P>
When the project becomes operational, about three million tons
of liquefied natural gas will be shipped and sent to Guangzhou,
Shenzhen, Foshan and Dongguan via a specially erected dock in
Shenzhen annually, of which, 30 percent will be used for cooking
by local residents. The remainder will be used for industrial
power generation.
</P>
<P>
The project will later be expanded to cover five other cities
in the province of Guangdong and the extension will be finished in
2010.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Teachers Don't Have to Report AIDS Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Teachers' Service
Commission, the employer of public school teachers in Kenya, has
withdrawn a controversial decree for a list of AIDS-afflicted
teachers after a teachers' union threatened a nationwide strike
last week.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the commission will seek the necessary statistics on
the impact of AIDS on the population from the newly established
National AIDS Council, secretary of the commission Benjamin Sogomo
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The statistics will be used to predict student population
trends and the resultant number for adequate teachers, the Sunday
Standard newspaper quoted Sogomo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sogomo explained how the contentious decree came out by saying
that the effects of HIV/AIDS had caused a shortage of teachers and
therefore a survey was proposed to find out exact extent of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
In mid-December last year, a circular was issued to ask all
district and municipal education officers to submit monthly
reports on HIV/AIDS-status of teachers on the 15th day of every
month.
</P>
<P>
The order has triggered a heated debate over the protection of
privacy and rights of teachers since then.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister for Public Health Sam Ongeri said Friday that
it was up to AIDS victims to decide whether to make their HIV
status public.
</P>
<P>
Ongeri added that his ministry would not interfere with the
employment policies of other government departments and private
companies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Airlines Make Two Unscheduled Landings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A Continental Airlines DC-
10 made an unscheduled landing Saturday in the capital of
Newfoundland after a light went on, indicating the possibility of
smoke in the cabin, AP reported.
</P>
<P>
Fires trucks, ambulances and police vehicles were scrambled to
the runway before a Continental Airlines DC-10 touched down safely,
and there were no injuries, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"A light did go on, but there was no smoke, no fire. It was a
misindication, a false signal. The plane is getting ready to go
back into service," AP quoted Catherine Stengel, a spokeswoman for
the Houston-based airline.
</P>
<P>
The plane's pilot reportedly asked to land at St. John's
Airport, saying an air-conditioning unit in a cargo hold beneath
the cockpit apparently overheated, sending smoke into the cabin.
</P>
<P>
There were 172 passengers on board, according to Stengle.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, a CNN report revealed that a minor hydraulic
problem caused a TWA MD-80 to make an emergency landing Friday
night at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The fault was reportedly repaired in about one-and-a-half hours
and the aircraft with its 149 passengers continued to San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
"The plane landed without incident, however a 'tug' had to come
out and tow it to a gate," CNN quoted Suzanne Luber, an airport
spokeswoman, who claimed no one on the flight was injured.
</P>
<P>
Concern about the MD-80 series jets is high after an Alaska
Airline MD-80 crashed off southern California on January 31,
killing all 88 people on board.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Former heavyweight champion
Oliver McCall spent only two minutes and 22 second to stop Ric
Lainhart in the first round of the WBC heavyweight title Saturday
night in Pembroke of Florida.
</P>
<P>
McCall (35-7, 25 KOs) knocked down Lainhart (21-26) with a
right to the head and body shot. Lainhart, who had taken hard
combinations from McCall prior to the knockdown, didn't convince
referee Bill Connors that he could continue fighting.
</P>
<P>
McCall has won six consecutive fights since being disqualified
for failing to fight during a bout with Lennox Lewis three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
However, McCall, 34, remains the only fighter to defeat Lewis.
McCall stopped the reigning heavyweight champion in two rounds in
1994 to win the WBC heavyweight crown.

<HEADLINE> Biodegradable Plastics Developed in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Yangling Agricultural High-
tech Zone in northwestern Shaanxi Province has developed a kind of
biodegradable plastic sheeting, which is environmentally friendly.
</P>
<P>
The technology involved in making the product has passed
technical appraisals by the China National Packaging Corp. under
the auspices of the State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision.
</P>
<P>
The research group led by Prof. Li Anhua has turned out a dozen
plastic products including dinner sets and ground-covering plastic
sheeting, all made of biodegradable starch.
</P>
<P>
Repeated experiments conducted over the past five years have
shown that the starch-made products can be decomposed into water
and carbon dioxide in a matter of 70-90 days. The cost for making
such biodegradable plastic products is roughly the same as that in
making traditional plastic goods.
</P>
<P>
"Biodegradable products made with the new technology are
expected to replace traditional plastic wears, thus opening up a
new way to do away with 'white pollution'," said Prof. Li Zhenqi,
an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
At present, an estimated 11 million tons of plastic garbage
were disposed of in China annually and the figure in the world as
a whole reached 170 million tons every year.
</P>
<P>
Ground plastic sheeting is used extensively on about 30 percent
of China's arable land, and, if a hectare of arable land is left
with 500 kg of plastic wastes, soil fertility will be lost
completely, as indicated by a recent agricultural survey.

<HEADLINE> Ecological Environment at Qinghai Lake Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The ecological environment of
the famous Qinghai Lake in northwest China, the country's largest
inland saltwater lake, has kept improving thanks to protective
measures taken in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The flock of birds on the vast lake's Bird Island multiplied by
approximately 20 percent last year. And the variety of birds rose
40 percent as compared with the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
The resources of a rare yellow croaker species native only to
Qinghai Lake has been protected effectively over the past two
years, with its average weight having reached 300 grams each,
nearly 180 grams more than that in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A local provincial government official, named Gao Xiren,
attributed the marked environmental improvement to an effective,
ecological drive initiated over recent years. And the central
government has earmarked more than five million yuan (330,000 US
dollars) to afforest some 330 hectares of land around the bird
island and grow grass at used grazing yards.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Qinghai provincial fishery department has beefed

<HEADLINE> hke021311 --IMF Chief Talks about Paradox of Present Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund Michael Camdessus said here Sunday
that the present situation is both "promising" and "cruel" under
the circumstances of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an interactive debate of the 10th session of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X),
Camdessus said the present situation is, on the one hand,
promising because of unprecedented prospects in certain fields,
but on the other hand, it is cruel to the poorest because of the
financial instability and "exclusion which has caused anxieties of
many people in the world."
</P>
<P>
He said that people should recognize that there are serious
reasons for the anxiety even if the world has recently overcome
with unprecedented speed the most severe crisis of the last 50
years and even if the world today enjoys better prospects for
sustainable growth, with global output slightly over three percent
for advanced countries and about five percent for developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said UNCTAD X is an unique opportunity to try to identify
the dynamics present in recent history offering a new chance to
improve the well-being of mankind, to recognize that poverty is
the "ultimate threat" to stability in a globalizing world and that
the all-out effort needed to overcome world poverty requires a
reinvigorated multilateralism.
</P>
<P>
In his speech Camdessus refers to globalization and poverty
reduction as a multiple approach that needed to be sought in the
global dimension.
</P>
<P>
It is a farewell speech of Camdessus since he will quit his
office for personal reasons on February 15.

<HEADLINE> Camdessus "Pied" by Belgo-Thai Bakery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus was "pied" by
Patissiers sans Frontieres (PSF), a Belgo-Thai bakery, according
to a statement issued by PSF here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday morning, a man threw a cream pie on Camdessus'
face before he addressed delegates attending the 10th Session of
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X).
</P>
<P>
It is Camdessus' final important speech as the IMF chief will
leave his job for "personal reasons" on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
PSF said in its statement that the bakery "regards a cream pie
on the face as a slight -- and sweet -- embarrassment compared to
the tremendous suffering that the IMF has inflicted on the people
of the South under the leadership of Camdessus."
</P>
<P>
"The cream pie was thrown in solidarity with the people
resisting in Thailand, Southeast Asia, South America, Africa and
former Soviet Union," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
PSF claimed in the statement that millions of people in these
areas lost their jobs and access to food, education and health due
to structural adjustment policies of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF has exacerbated inequalities and undermined the right
of the people to implement their own forms of development," PSF
said.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, an IMF official said that Camdessus was "OK.
"
</P>
<P>
Camdessus later delivered a speech on the second day of UNCTAD
X in which he said the crisis-hit economies were recovering and
gross domestic product in South Korea and the Philippines already
exceeded the pre-crisis levels.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the man who threw the pie is a white male from
Washington D.C. of the United States.
</P>
<P>
He was said to use a journalist card to enter the Convention
Center and the Plenary Hall.
</P>
<P>
The man is now being questioned by the security officers of the
conference, said UNCTAD Spokesman Habib Ouane.
</P>
<P>
An article on Saturday's Bangkok Post predicted that Camdessus
would not have "a smooth and glorious end to his career," saying
that civil groups had threatened to protest against Camdessus for
his "crime against humanity."
</P>
<P>
They said IMF's fiscal austerity programs and policy mistakes
add grievance to the people in the countries hit by the financial
crisis.

"The widening gaps between rich and poor within nations and the
gulf between the most affluent and most impoverished nations are
morally outrageous, economically wasteful and potentially socially
explosive", Camdessus said at an interactive debate of the 10th
session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
He urged the world to work together to build up the capacity of
developing countries to fight against poverty and to mobilize the
necessary resources to support their efforts.
</P>
<P>
He urged the developed countries to support the efforts of the
poorest countries by assigning the highest priority to providing
unrestricted market access for all exports from the poorest
countries, by working strenuously to encourage flows of private
capital to the lower-income developing countries and by backing up
all the pledges to reduce poverty with financial support.
</P>
<P>
It is a farewell speech of Camdessus since he will quit the
office on February 15 for personal reasons.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Constitution Cannot Work Without National Consensus: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi said that the constitution cannot work in the absence of
mutual understanding and respect among communities.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks Saturday when referring to the country's
constitution review process.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's parliament is now undertaking the constitution review
process, in which the ruling Kenya African National Union and
other parties and institutions are debating about the procedures
on how to conduct the review process.
</P>
<P>
Even a changed constitution arrived at without national
consensus will not serve any useful purpose, the Sunday Nation
newspaper quoted the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moi called for unity among Kenyans if problems facing the
country are to be tackled, noting that understanding and respect
among the people will firmly take root in an environment of peace,
love and unity in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
He also asked local communities to take responsibility of
protecting the environment for the sake of present and future
generations, and attach importance to education as the population
continues to grow in the country.

<HEADLINE> Financial Rules on Zambian Election Campaigns Urged to Set up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia electoral Commission
Chairman Justice Bobby Bwalya has urged politicians to establish
financial regulations on election campaigns in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
This is designed to "curb real or imagined acts of corruption",
Zambia's leading newspaper Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a public debate on elections, Bwalya noted that at
the country's independence in 1964, 200 pounds sterling was the
maximum amount of money each parliamentary candidate was allowed
to spend on campaigning.
</P>
<P>
He admitted there are attempts of corruption during election
campaigns everywhere and regretted that this seemed to be free for
all matter.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to allegations from some leaders of political parties
that voters were given fertilizer, food and clothes in the
country's on-going by- election to woo their support, Bwalya
suggested that a tribunal be established to hear complaints from
aggrieved parties during the election campaigns to prevent corrupt
practices.
</P>
<P>
Bwalya said there was already mechanism of discussing election
complaints, but there was no provision for a tribunal under the
law.
</P>
<P>
He said although gifts should not be allowed during election
campaigns if they were intended, party agents all over the world
have to be funded by candidates and political parties.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Firms Required to Get Environmental Impact Clearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- An Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) clearance is now needed for Tanzanian firms
applying for industrial licenses, newspapers here reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The move was aimed at ensuring sound environmental management
in industries, Joshua Doriye, permanent secretary in the Ministry
of Industry and Commerce, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the requirement for EIA clearance for industrialists
was also in line with the Sustainable Industrial Development
Policy launched by the ministry in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
The policy, to be implemented between 1996 and the year 2020,
calls for public sensitization on environmental management and
application of environmentally sound technologies in the
industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
The contribution of the industrial sector towards environment
has started to emerge, Doriye said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is facing serious environmental problems at its
crucial stage to achieve economic growth. Examples of industrial
pollution cases include petroleum refineries, breweries, cement
factories, fertilizer production, textiles, paper mills and
pesticides factories.
</P>
<P>
The government has made cleaner production processes mandatory
in order to ensure that the country does not suffer the
consequences of uncontrolled emissions.

<HEADLINE> No Violence in Zimbabwe's Referendum on Draft Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- No incidents of violence have
been reported in Zimbabwe's first referendum on the draft
constitution by Saturday evening, police said.
</P>
<P>
Voting to either adopt or reject the proposed draft
constitution started peacefully throughout the country Saturday
with thousands of Zimbabweans of all races casting their votes,
the Sunday Mail weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
The National Constitutional Assembly also said it was happy
that there were no incidents of violence in the two-day poll which
ends Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The assembly, a grouping of civil organizations, trade unions
and opposition political parties, has been urging Zimbabweans to
vote "No" in the draft constitution referendum.
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Chairperson Lovemore Madhuku told a press
conference in Harare Saturday that the assembly was disappointed
by the low voter turn- out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said he feels
that the majority of Zimbabweans will vote for the draft
constitution because it gives them a chance to become fully
independent.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabweans for the first time since independence in 1980 vote
in such a plebiscite which will see whether the 12.5 million
people reject or adopt the draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
For the past two decades, the southern African country has been
using the British-authored Lancaster House constitution of 1979,
which most people say was a compromise document and does not
represent the interests of Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
Despite the early morning rains that fell in most parts of the
country, the voter turnout was much higher than expected, Sunday
Mail reported. Most of the 3,600 polling stations throughout the
country opened as early as 7:00 a.m. and remained open until 7:00
p.m.
</P>
<P>
The referendum has assumed racial connotations with white
Zimbabweans turning out in unusually large numbers last seen in
the 1980 general elections, the weekly noted.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Fund Plane Crash Probe in Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will give financial
assistance to Cote d'Ivoire to help it speed up investigations
into the cause of Kenya Airways jet crash on January 30, which
killed 169 people on board shortly after its takeoff from the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
The government was willing to extend financial aid to Cote
d'Ivoire for the probe, Kenyan Information, Transport and
Communications Minister Mudavadi, was quoted by the Sunday
Standard paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
So far only 108 bodies had been recovered while 61 others were
still missing, Mudavadi told the press Saturday upon his arrival
in Nairobi from Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi attributed the delay in repatriation of the recovered
bodies to bureaucracy in Cote d'Ivoire and urged it to speed up
documentation for bodies to enable the bereaved families to get
back to their homes soon.
</P>
<P>
"Family members got so traumatized when the documentation is
delayed. Some of them even become hysterical," said Mudavadi.
</P>
<P>
A language barrier also hampers the probe since Cote d'Ivoire
is a French-speaking country while Kenyans speak English, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Two burial sites had been designated by the government of Cote
d'Ivoire for bodies of victims who had not yet been identified by
their families, according to Mudavadi.

<HEADLINE> 21 Planes Found Irregularities With Tail Wing Jackscrews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 12 (Xinhua) - Twenty-one planes have been
found to have irregularities with tail wing jackscrews since last
Thursday, when the U.S. government ordered to examine tail wings
for a problem that may have caused an Alaska Airlines jet to crash
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Bureau has not
determined whether jackscrew damage caused the January. 31 crash
that killed all 88 people aboard, but after similar damage was
found on other Alaska Airlines jets, the Federal Aviation
Administration ordered all airlines to inspect their MD-80s, MD-90
s, Boeing 717s and DC-9s - about 1,200 planes in all.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Saturday, the FAA said 13 planes had been
grounded for jackscrew problems, though some were back in service.
Others were found to have metal shavings on the jackscrew or other
irregularities, such as metallic residue in screw grease or a lack
of lubricant.
</P>
<P>
Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Ware said his company had
grounded eight aircraft, including four Saturday. The FAA said
Alaska Airlines had reported a total of four planes with problems.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Northwest Airlines reported replacing the jackscrews
of three aircraft, including two Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The other airlines that had planes with problems included
AirTran, with two aircraft grounded, and American, Continental,
TWA and Hawaiian Air, with one each, FAA spokesman Eliot Brenner
said.
</P>
<P>
Brenner said his agency is looking specifically for slivers of
metal along jackscrews while airline mechanics are reporting
anything unusual they find.
</P>
<P>
The FAA has ordered that the inspections be completed by Monday
and gave airlines until Wednesday to report their findings,
Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
The significance of the problems being reported would not be
known until detailed inspections took place, the FCC said, adding
that some of the aircraft with damage in the jackscrew area had
already been repaired and put back in service.

<P>
JAKARTA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid agreed on Sunday that Security Minister General
Wiranto would keep his cabinet post pending a probe into his
alleged involvement in East Timor violence last year.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after Wahid held an emergency meeting
Sunday at the presidential palace with Wiranto, who repeatedly
rejected his demands to resign.
</P>
<P>
"An agreement was reached to give a chance to the attorney
general's office to further investigate" human rights violations
in East Timor, spokesman Marsilam Simanjuntak said.
</P>
<P>
Simanjuntak said "there will be no decision" on Wiranto's
future before the initial investigation report.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Wahid returned from a 16-day tour of the
Middle East, Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto has denied any wrongdoing and repeatedly insisted he
will not step down until he has a chance to present his case to

<HEADLINE> Carter Wins NBA Slam Dunk Contest in Spectacular Fashion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OAKLAND, California, February 13 (Xinhua) -- In the most
spectacular performance ever, Vince Carter returned the NBA Slam
Dunk Contest to prominence with an unmatched array of soaring
slams that had the other contestants going as wild as the crowd at
the Oakland Coliseum Arena in California Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Known as "Air Canada," the All-Star forward of the Toronto
Raptors reminded everyone why the Slam Dunk Contest was so popular-
- and made everyone wonder why it was discontinued three years ago.
He did it single-handedly, double-handedly, through his legs and
hanging on the rim -- by his elbow.
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, I made some of these dunks up on the fly before I
actually did them," Carter said.
</P>
<P>
In the 15-year history of the event, there have been
spectacular individual dunks by competitors such as Michael Jordan,
Dominique Wilkins, Spud Webb, Isaiah Rider and Cedric Ceballos.
But not even Air Jordan had a series of dunks to match those by
Carter, who was both powerful and innovative.
</P>
<P>
"He's a breakthrough," said legendary dunker Julius Erving. "He
's got extension, he's got imagination."
</P>
<P>
"I remember back in the days me and my friends used to tape
them and watch them all, just watch them over and over again,"
Carter said.
</P>
<P>
Carter began with a reverse 360 windmill that received a
perfect score of 50 from the five-judge field and told everybody
in the six-man field they were competing for second place. His
next dunk registered a 49 as he bounced from out of bounds into
the lane and completed a cuff slam.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to come out with a bang and just get that first one
out of the way, and hopefully everything would fall into place,"
Carter said. "I was going for a 50 all night."
</P>
<P>
His final dunk of the first round may have been his best.
Distant cousin and Raptors teammate Tracy McGrady bounced the ball
in the lane and a soaring Carter caught it while airborne, put it
through his legs and hammered it home for another perfect score.
</P>
<P>
"The one between the legs, when Tracy bounced it, I made that
up right before," Carter said. "I was just doing it off instinct."
</P>
<P>
McGrady and Houston Rockets rookie guard Steve Francis advanced
to the final round but could only watch in awe as Carter displayed
that he is head and shoulders above the rest -- literally.
</P>
<P>
What began as a rather ordinary one-hand hammer dunk was
punctuated by Carter jamming his entire forearm into the rim and
hanging there for several seconds by his elbow, registering
another perfect score.
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to do dunks tonight that I've never seen guys try,
or at least never seen done before or heard of being done," Carter
said.
</P>
<P>
Carter completed his assault with a flying slam from about two
feet inside the foul line for a 48, capping All-Star Saturday. His

final-round total of 98 was second-best in history, trailing only
Webb's perfect 100 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Since arriving as a rookie last season, Carter has been a
nightly highlight package on the sports news shows and is
acknowledged as the best dunker in the game. Until today, however,
he had not had a chance to prove it.
</P>
<P>
Francis finished second and was impressive, especially
considering his 6 a.m. wakeup call and participation in the Rookie
Challenge and 2ball events. His best dunks were a couple of angled,
leaning slams after he had tossed the ball high in the air and
jumped to catch the bounce.
</P>
<P>
McGrady had a perfect dunk in the first round, tossing the ball
high to himself, catching it in mid-air and putting home a two-
handed jam.
</P>
<P>
Eliminated in the first round were Detroit Pistons All-Star
guard Jerry Stackhouse, Philadelphia 76ers guard Larry Hughes and
Charlotte Hornets guard Ricky Davis.
</P>
<P>
The last Slam Dunk Contest in 1997 was won by Los Angeles
Lakers All-Star guard Kobe Bryant, who was not entered this year.
The event was replaced by 2ball in 1998 but fans clamored for its
return and the NBA obliged.

<HEADLINE> Air-Raid Shelters in Coastal City Open for Commercial Use </HEADLINE>

<P>
FUZHOU, February 13 (Xinhua)-- Fuzhou, capital of east China's
Fujian Province, which faces Taiwan across the Taiwan Straits, has
opened nearly half of its air-raid shelters for commercial
purposes over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
These tunnels are now being used as parking lots, shopping
centers, storage houses and various entertainment venues.
</P>
<P>
A total revenue of some 10 million yuan (1.2 million US dollars)
has been generated from these tunnels, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou City began to build air-raid shelters in the early 1970s,
and as tension along the Taiwan Straits eased in the past years,
the local government has decided to put them to commercial use as
part of its effort to solve the problems of a swelling population,
limited space and growing traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city has already made a comprehensive plan to
fully exploit its underground space for commercial purposes in the
years to come.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Contractors Scores Big Growth in Overseas Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua)-- Chinese contractors witnessed
two-digit growth in overseas markets in 1999 as the global economy
recovered from the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Project contractors and labor service providers from China
scored a combined business income of 11.23 billion U.S. dollars
last year, up 10.9 percent from the previous year, the
International Business Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
They also signed 13 billion dollars worth of new contracts on
overseas engineering and labor service projects in 1999. By year-
end, a total of 382,000 Chinese were working on the contracted
projects abroad.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributes the growth to the rising world economy in
1999, governmental support and the growing strength of Chinese
contractors.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese firms got more project opportunities overseas
thanks to the economic rebound in Hong Kong, East Asia and
Southeast Asia, major markets for China's contractors, the booming
U.S. economy, economic recovery in Europe, and economic stability
in Latin America, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Big Chinese contractors have enhanced their prestige in the
international market. In 1999, 30 Chinese companies were listed
among the world's top 225 contractors, and 3 Chinese design firms
were included in the world's top-200 designers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese contractors signed close to 200 new contracts each
involving over 10 million U.S. dollars in 1999, with an
accumulated value of 6.13 billion U.S. dollars, according to paper.

<HEADLINE> Cemetery Guards Vigilant During Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wielding a flashlight and a club, the 22-year-old farmer roams
catlike through the headstones at the foot of Mt. Jishan in
central Hubei province. It's not an ordinary graveyard, but the
resting place for royalty of the Chu Kingdom who lived some 2,300
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Wen is joined by his father and some friends, all members of a
relics police squad formed of volunteer Jishanians to fight
against rampant graverobbing.
</P>
<P>
"It is the time of the lunar New Year, when everybody goes back
home to attend banquets and get drunk -- except for the ghouls,"
Wen said solemnly.
</P>
<P>
The 12-square-kilometer cemetery is home to 297 graves, and is
a key historical site under state protection.
</P>
<P>
"Stick a shovel into the ground anywhere here and you'll find
enough relics to make you rich overnight," said archaeologist Cui
Renyi.
</P>
<P>
Many serious thefts have been reported, and three villagers
convicted of graverobbing three years ago were sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, archaeologists have recovered 800 bamboo slips
recording Confucian and Taoist documents swiped from a Mt. Jishan
grave.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, to curb the alarming trend of tomb theft, Jishan town
officials asked for volunteers to patrol the cemetery "round the
clock." Wen is one of the 140 men who signed up.
</P>
<P>
He receives 200 yuan (about 25 U.S. dollars) a year for the job,
which he takes quite seriously.
</P>
<P>
"The tombs belong to our country. As neighbors of the
graveyards, we have a responsibility to protect them," he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, villagers have not profited in any way from the
valuable tombs, according to town head Quan Chunjin. In fact,
standard farming practices are limited so that any yet-to-be-found
relics will not be harmed, and as a result, grain yields here are
low and the villagers are poor.
</P>
<P>
In a move to make up for the villagers' losses and develop the
local economy, the local government has decided to open the
cemetery to tourists. Wen said this means he and the other relics
cops would have to be especially vigilant for sticky fingers.
</P>
<P>
The Spring Festival holiday has added even more stress to Wen's
job. "The fireworks are deafening. The robbers might use the
chance to set off a bomb to open a tomb, I suppose."

<HEADLINE> Hackers Use University Computers to Attack Major Web Sites: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Computers at a remote
marine research campus operated by Stanford University near
Monterey, California, were among those fooled last Tuesday into
helping hackers attack some of the Internet's most heavily used
sites, CNN reported Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
About 50 Stanford computers were fooled into helping route the
denial of service attacks on Web sites, including eBay.com, CNN.
com, Amazon.com, Buy.com and Yahoo!, Stephen Hansen, head of
Stanford's computer security department, told CNN in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we were able to find it quickly and were able to deal
with it in short order," Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts believe that universities can be sitting ducks
to these attacks, since schools want professors, researchers and
students to have easy access to computers to share research and
swap information.
</P>
<P>
Stanford joins the University of California at Santa Barbara (
UCSB) as victims of so-called zombie computers -- unmanned
machines perhaps unknowingly enslaved to the command of hackers.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Schmidt, the UCSB campus network programmer, said, "If
you go to a university, you have many different constituent groups.
You've got research groups, you've got people here for one year,
you've got visiting research faculty."
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the first defense against hackers is a
software block called a firewall -- but that may also keep out the
very people for whom the system is intended.
</P>
<P>
One of the Internet's original uses was to link scholars around
the world easily, they explained, adding that research projects at
universities typically make it difficult to implement an effective
firewall, since a large number of openings are needed for people
to go through.
</P>
<P>
They predict the recent spate of attacks may force universities
to choose between academic freedom and system security.

<HEADLINE> hke021305 --Roundup: Cambodia's Traffic Cleanup Achieves Good Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The effort to improve Phnom
Penh's chaotic traffic has achieved good results with a more clean
road and less traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, Phnom Penh municipality has been
implementing new directives, trying to clean up the city's busiest
streets and to have a safer traffic.
</P>
<P>
First the city hung traffic signals, painted lines on major
thoroughfares, banned sidewalk vendors and then sent police to
educate cyclo and motorcycle drivers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chea Sophara, Phnom Penh governor, signed new
rules for cyclo and motorcycle drivers, such as to limit their
ages between 18 and 55, and not allow them to smoke or drink
alcohol while they drive through Phnom Penh's oft-crowed streets.
</P>
<P>
Other restrictions for cyclos include a limit on the number of
passengers and a 100 -km weight limit.
</P>
<P>
As for motorcycle drivers, the governor's new directive said
anyone riding a motor should wear a helmet and only two people are
allowed on one motor. It also said no one under the age of 16 can
drive a motor, and that those aged 16 to 18 can only drive small
motors with an engine size of 100 cubic centimeters or smaller.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, drivers of motorcycles are not allowed to
travel three abreast.
</P>
<P>
And the latest effort has been the deployment of municipal
traffic and military police for traffic education among citizens.
</P>
<P>
Armed with whistles and new guidelines, several hundreds of
police have been deployed along the city's main routes, and some
stand at the corners of the streets, shouting with a microphone at
motorists who do not obey the newly-strengthened traffic laws.
</P>
<P>
Drivers have to learn traffic laws, including parking, obeying
traffic signals and making proper turns. In addition, all
motorbike owners are required to have registration cards and
license plates.
</P>
<P>
So far, 10,000 city employees, cyclos, motor drivers and
students have received traffic education. The new initiative seems
to work well as accidents in the city have reduced to none in the
past few weeks, according to the municipal traffic bureau.

<HEADLINE> Camdessus meets with Cream Cake in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus met with a
cream cake Sunday on his way to address the delegates attending
the 10th Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD X).
</P>
<P>
A man threw a "half-palm-large" cream cake on Camdessus' face
when the IMF chief was chatting with UNCTAD delegates inside the
Plenary Hall of the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
An IMF official told his colleagues that Camdessus was "OK" and
just needed to wash his hands.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the man is a white male from Washington D.C. of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
He was said to use a journalist card to enter the Convention
Center and the Plenary Hall.
</P>
<P>
The man is now being questioned by the security officers of the
conference, said UNCTAD Spokesman Habib Ouane.
</P>
<P>
It is not known yet whether the man belongs to any organization
and why he did that.
</P>
<P>
An article on Saturday's Bangkok Post said civil groups had
threatened to protest against Camdessus for his "crime against
humanity."
</P>
<P>
They said IMF's fiscal austerity programs and policy mistakes
add grievance to the people in the countries hit by the financial
crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund Michael Camdessus said here Sunday
that globalization and poverty reduction is a multiple approach
that needed to be sought in the global dimension.
</P>
<P>
"Strong dynamics are at play in our history, carrying the
promises of more financial stability, of a new paradigm of
development and of a better chance of humanizing globalization,"
Camdessus said at an interactive debate of the 10th session of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
He said these dynamics can make it possible to fulfill the
universal pledges to reduce poverty and through a reinvigorated
multilateralism to better address the problems in the global
dimension.
</P>
<P>
It is a farewell speech of Camdessus, who will quit his office
for personal reasons on February 15.

KATHMANDU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Deputy Prime Minister
Ram Chandra Paudel Saturday called on all political parties to
unite to combat the escalating violent activities in the country,
The Kathmandu Post reported Sunday.

<P>
"Nepali Congress (the ruling party) alone can't resolve the
issue, all the parties should work hand in hand to resolve this,"
said Paudel at a talk program organized by a non-governmental

"The government has done a lot of constructive work, but due to
the lack of positive publicity, people are dissatisfied and have

Paudel stressed that the path pursued by the ultra-leftists to
fulfill their aim through violence and killings is wrong and is

<HEADLINE> Wild Animals Increasing in Gansu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Both the number and species of
wild animals living in the nature reserves in northwest China's
Gansu Province have increased now that the ecological environment
in the area is improving.
</P>
<P>
According to the local wild animal protection department, the
number of white-lipped deer that live in northern and southern
parts of Gansu has surged from just 300 to over 1,000.
</P>
<P>
The number of argali has risen from 2,000 to more than 5,000
and that of wild camel from 70 to over 400.
</P>
<P>
So far, Gansu has set up 33 nature reserves that cover a total
area of 3.82 million hectares, accounting for 8.4 percent of the
province's total territory.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the province has clamped down on wild
animal poaching. Eighty-four cases involving poaching of
endangered animals have been handled and 70 people have been
convicted of poaching in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The province also spent more than 60 million yuan to establish
10 wild animal protection stations and research centers in the
cities of Zhangye, Jiuquan, Tianshui and in Longnan Prefecture and
in the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Gannan.
</P>
<P>
Gansu is home to 112 kinds of state-protected animals,

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Former Military Chief on his Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Coordinating
Minister for Political and Security Affairs Gen. Wiranto said on
Saturday that the question of whether he would keep his cabinet
post fully depended on President Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the president would decide, he would remain consistent
with his commitment to fighting for democracy and the upholding of
the 1945 constitution, Antara news agency Sunday quoted the
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The former military commander was recently requested by
President Wahid to resign from his cabinet post after the
government-sanctioned East Timor post-ballot atrocities inquiry
team formally implicated him in the mayhem.
</P>
<P>
However, Wiranto, who refused to resign, firmly rejected
allegations that Indonesian servicemen had not done much in
maintaining security before and during the process of the August
30 U.N.-organized vote which was won by the anti-integration camp.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a legal adviser to Gen. Wiranto said here on
Saturday his client would not resign from his position.
</P>
<P>
Ruhut Sitompul, member of a team of lawyers defending Wiranto
and several other senior military officers accused of
responsibility for atrocities in East Timor last year, said
Wiranto had agreed to follow the team's advice not to resign.
</P>
<P>
The team had insisted that Wiranto should quit the cabinet only
if he was proved guilty in a court of justice, he said.
</P>
<P>
The team also urged Attorney General Marzuki Darusman to expose
their cases in detail to allow other parties to have access to
witnesses and evidence.
</P>
<P>
The showdown between President Wahid and Wiranto which has
lasted for about two weeks is set to climax next week with cabinet
changes likely to occur whether or not Wiranto resigns.
</P>
<P>
Before returning to Jakarta Saturday night from Bangkok,
Thailand, President Wahid revealed that he and Vice President
Megawati Soekarno Putri would meet the former military chief on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"You can expected that the day after tomorrow, there will be an
announcement of the decision on Gen. Wiranto," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Please don't print that I will fire him because I respect him
very much and I will give him a respectful place, but not in the
cabinet," Wahid added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mission to Increase Police Forces in Troubled Kosovo Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Police forces will be
increased in the ethnically-divided Kosovo town of Mitrovica to
ease the high tension there after clashes between local Serbs and
ethnic Albanians, said the United Nations Interim Administration
Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted a UNMIK statement as
saying that the number of international police will rise to 600
from 300 in the Mitrovica region, with most of them deployed in
the town of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
In addition, UNMIK chief Bernard Kouchner decided to expand the
security zone on both sides of the Ibar river -- the main northern
Kosovo town's natural border separating Serb-dominated north from
the south.
</P>
<P>
Kouchner also defined areas barring demonstrations. Moreover,
the international peacekeeping forces will beef up control over
the border between Kosovo and the Serb republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The security measures were introduced in the aftermath of days
of riots in Mitrovica, triggered by a grenade attack late February
3 on a Serb cafe leaving 15 young people injured.
</P>
<P>
The incident provoked indignation from Serbs and led to
overnight street protests and clashes with ethnic Albanian
residents in the north, which left two Turks and two Albanians
dead, and six other Albanians and 15 Serbs injured.
</P>
<P>
A night curfew beginning on the second day failed to improve
the situation. The night was followed by two days of ethnic
Albanian rioting on the central bridge over the Ibar. A total of
11 French peacekeepers were injured on February 5 in clashes with
hundreds of Albanians, who were later dispersed by tear gas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Austrians Stage Mass Protest Against Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000 Viennese Saturday
swarmed onto the street to continue the protest against the
participation of the extreme-right Freedom Party in the new
coalition government inaugurated last week.
</P>
<P>
Shouting slogans against racism, the demonstrators gathered at
Vienna's main railway station in the early afternoon and marched
down to one of the city's busiest shopping centers and the
parliamentary building.
</P>
<P>
Such peaceful demonstrations, which the organizers had said
would last for a long time, also took place in other main cities,
such as Salzburg, Innsbruck and Bregenz.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of the new government on February 4, which
permitted the entry of the right-wing Freedom Party of Joerg
Haider, has provoked a wave of protest in Austria and abroad.
Vienna is perturbed by not only continuous domestic protests but
also international isolation.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Prime Minister Wolfgang Schuessel on Saturday
criticized its 14 EU partners for their collective threat to
freeze political relations with Austria, saying such move "lacks
careful consideration" and is "unfair to Austria."

The drive is being undertaken to sharpen the SOE's competitive
edge in a fast-changing cyber era, according to the State Economic
and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
The SETC recently began working with the Ministry of
Information Industry and Ministry of Science and Technology to
launch the computerization campaign.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the government has promoted the use of
computer know-how throughout all its SOEs.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the drive will help make the SOEs the most vigorous
force in China's economy in China's economy in the new century,"
said Shi Wanpeng, deputy minister in charge of the SETC.
</P>
<P>
He said computerization will focus on establishing information-
sharing networks among the main SOEs and government
administrations, improving the SOE's internal management and
opening their own websites.
</P>
<P>
Only 0.3 percent of the top 300 SOEs' fixed-assets investment
was used for computerization in 1998, according to a survey
launched by the SETC.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicated that the country's main 300 SOEs
invested 1.71 billion yuan in computerization last year,
increasing by 15.5 percent from 1998.

China's State-owned enterprises, suffering from an outmoded

<HEADLINE> Chinese Insurer to Take on Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The People's Insurance Company
of China (PICC) earned 85 percent of the country's national
property insurance premium income and about 60 percent of the
industry's profits last year.
</P>
<P>
But the company reports it is not resting on its laurels, China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
With the light at the end of the tunnel representing a fast-
moving and competitive World Trade Organization (WTO) locomotive,
the company is rapidly adjusting to new foreign and domestic
competitive pressure.
</P>
<P>
The country's No.1 property insurer said it is moving ahead
with the all-out reform of its operational and management systems
to sharpen its competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
Despite a gloomy earnings picture for state-owned enterprises (
SOEs) last year, this large scale SOE reaped 44.1 billion yuan in
premium income and realized a profit for the fourth consecutive
year, its largest ever.
</P>
<P>
However, "domestic insurance companies will face challenges
than opportunities when China joints the WTO," Sun Xiyue, PICC's
general manager, said during a recent national conference.
</P>
<P>
Although PICC holds an advantageous position in terms of brand
name, networks, its staff, sand its understanding of the local
culture, it lags behind foreign counterparts in capital funds
availability, its solvency margin, operations mechanisms, cost
control, technology and funds management experience, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pressure is coming also from domestic players.
</P>
<P>
In the coastal city of Shenzhen, where financially strong
foreign and domestic insurers have congregated, PICC feels the
threat clearly.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the U.S.-based AIU Insurance Co. which was
recently licensed to operate in Shenzhen, Ping An Insurance
Company of China and Hua An Insurance Co. have also been making
big strides in recent years," said Wang Yincheng, general manager
of PICC's Shenzhen Branch.
</P>
<P>
Ping An has won the support of international intermediary
organizations and is planning to list abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must speed the optimization of our management system, lower
costs and improve computerization levels to compete," said Sun.
</P>
<P>
One major task would be improving service quality.
</P>
<P>
PICC is expected to introduce the ISO9000 quality system to its
branches nationwide this year to bring the company's operations
into line with international standards.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the company will establish a nationwide service
hotline at 95518 this year to settle remote claims.
</P>
<P>
To transform PICC into a real commercial company, the company
set up fund and coast management systems to improve efficiency of
funds utilization.
</P>
<P>
It expects to improve its assets structure by collecting non-
performing assets and by controlling its scale of fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
Profitability will become a prime consideration in appraising
the achievements of branch managers.

<HEADLINE> Fee Cuts Replace Fuel Tax Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- An unexpected hike in oil
prices has forced China's tax authorities to shift their attention
from a controversial fuel tax towards a fee-cutting campaign in
rural areas, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
"The focus of our plan for this year has been shifted to a fee-
for-tax drive in the countryside," said Cheng Faguang, vice
director of the State Administration of Taxation (SAT).
</P>
<P>
An increase in gasoline prices, mainly due to an abrupt
shortfall in oil supply that began during the fourth quarter last
year, has stymied efforts to eliminate the long-anticipated fuel
tax in the near term, the official said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the government is zeroing in on the rampant
illegitimate fees imposed on Chinese farmers, another major target
in its fee-elimination campaign.
</P>
<P>
A pilot rural program will be implemented this year in selected
provinces and cities before the reform is spread nationwide, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the trial program, unreasonable fees collected by
township governments, including those collected in the name of
education, road construction, militia training, family planning
and allowances, will be merged into a 5 percent agricultural tax,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
The 5 percent tax compares to a 15.5 percent nominal rate in
existing agricultural taxes, which have virtually been levied at
merely 2.5 percent thanks to China's pro-agriculture policy,
sector insiders said.
</P>
<P>
The refocused tax campaign coincides the perceived need to
alleviate farmers' burdens, which could therefore boost spending
in rural areas and assist the country's economic growth goals,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fees that have been out of control in the countryside
have been eroding the buying power of farmers, making the rural
market a backwater in the battle to kickstart domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted in 1997 among 5,000 of rural
households in 12 provinces across the country, a farmer paid 149
yuan in various fees each year, out of a total per capita burden
of 195 yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, the SAT official said that the plan has encountered
discontent from local governments, who fear that the 5 percent
agricultural tax rate will not be enough to fund local budgets. "
They are worried that the new tax rate is too low to raise
adequate funds," he added.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural tax has been a major source of local revenues
since the government revamped its tax system in 1994. But local
governments have complained that the pro-agricultural policy --
largely represented by the 2.5 percent virtual tax burden -- has
narrowed sources of funds needed to develop local economies. This
has given rise to various fees, tax insiders said.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural specialty tax, levied on the purchasers of
some items such aquatic products, will be shifted onto raisers or
producers, insiders said.
</P>
<P>
"But that will not harm the producers since the lighter tax
will bring more purchasers and therefore push up the prices for
agricultural specialties," the SAT official said.

</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the figures was amazing when compared to
earning of other industries last year under lackluster domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
"The sustainable development of the sector is a reflection of
people's increasing demand for a more digitalized life," said the

extended to 213,000 kilometer by the end of the last year.
</P>
<P>
Local switching capacities and long-distance automatic
switching capacities has rose to 158 million units and 4.93

</P>
<P>
"The action in IP phones and the Internet are two of the most
eye-catching forces in the sector's growth last year," said the
report.
</P>
<P>
So far, 210,000 IP dialup ports were established. Multi-media
bandwidth networks have been established and put into operation in
17 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The government's on-line project also moved a stride forward
with 68 ministries, offices and bureaux at the country level
linking with Internet.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,300 websites and 17 industrial information networks
were unveiled.
</P>
<P>
In addition, e-commerce and remote education via data
telecommunications developed smoothly, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The international telephone circuit reached 33,000 lines by the
end of last year. The bandwidth for international gateways for the
Internet increased by 225 megabytes last year, bring the total
bandwidth to 345 Megabytes last year.
</P>
<P>
The government stimulus program unfolded last year was a
driving force behind the growth, the report indicated, adding that
the successful maintenance of network operations also boost the
growth.

<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The expected withdrawal of the
third version of the renminbi currency from circulation in July is
resulting in a buying spree by collectors in the sluggish note and
coin market in China.
</P>
<P>
According to He Jingfu of the China Collectors Association, the
version has been in circulation for 37 years, but is already
becoming rare as banks are withdrawing it from the market.
</P>
<P>
Its rarity in numbers and special features is pushing its price
higher.
</P>
<P>
The five yuan note, for example, with a steel worker as the
main character on the front side, has won the special favor among
overseas collectors.
</P>
<P>
At the Beijing Funite stamp, coin and card market, one of the
biggest of its kind in the country, the price of a 0.1 yuan note
of the third issue, with a red or green back pattern in particular,
is now valued at more than 500 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The version will be withdrawn from circulation soon. With
people holding on some for themselves, the note is already rarely
seen in the market," said market administration official Yuan Li.
</P>
<P>
At Baoguosi Collectors' World, dealers reported getting five or
six calls per day about the price of the third renminbi version
last month. They planned to order more sets to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
The money frenzy has injected new energy into a money
collecting market that reported poor activity last year, insiders
said.
</P>
<P>
They warned that buyers should beware of speculative behavior
and should be prudent in entering the market and choosing
investment species.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government said Saturday that it would increase army and police
presence at public roads across the country to protect civilian
vehicles against guerrilla attacks, which had run high in the past
week.
</P>
<P>
"The public force and the police are controlling the main
highways," Interior Minister Nestor Humberto Martinez told the
press following a security meeting called by President Andres
Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
The National Liberation Army (ELN), the country's second
largest guerrilla group after the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC), staged a blockade last week at a main highway
linking Bogota to the major city of Medellin. The rebels also put
up minor roadblocks at other highways, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The ELN demands the demilitarization of a part of the northern
department of Bolivar as a precondition to start peace talks with
the government.
</P>
<P>
President Pastrana has so far rejected the ELN's demand
although he agreed to pull out his troops from a stronghold of the
FARC.

<P>
PARIS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- World track and field stars
Linford Christie, Merlene Ottey and Javier Sotomayor were
suspended from competition from midnight Sunday after the IAAF
changed its doping regulations on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Monaco, the new rules
state that as long as a doping case is referred to an arbitration
panel by the IAAF, the doping violator is immediately suspended.
</P>
<P>
All three had tested positive for banned substances and had
their cases referred to an arbitration panel by the IAAF.
</P>
<P>
Britain's former Olympic 100 meters champion Christie, world
high jump record holder Sotomayor and Jamaican sprinter Ottey were
cleared by their respective national athletics bodies and allowed
to compete although they had been found positive in doping tests.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the IAAF also announced that British pole vaulter
Mike Edwards tested positive for drugs last year.
</P>
<P>
His case was not made public because he was subsequently
cleared by his national federation, the IAAF added.
</P>
<P>
IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said Edwards had tested positive
for a cocktail of drugs including the anabolic steroid stanozolol
on March 3 last year.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Bamboo Slips Found in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have discovered
more than 100 ancient bamboo slips covered with writing in north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, the first in the region, is highly valuable for
the study of ancient history, said Wei Jian, a research fellow at
the regional Archaeology Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
The bamboo slips, belonging to the Han Dynasty (B.C.206-A.D.
220), are inscribed with characters representing account-keeping,
personal letters, personnel changes and other daily activities.
</P>
<P>
Although archaeologists have discovered many ruins of the Han
people, they had never found any bamboo slips inscribed with
Chinese characters, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the cultural relics were discovered in a beacon tower
at the Juyan ruins from the dynasty. Juyan, stretching for 200
kilometers of desert land, was an important frontier region
occupied by the Han nomads and a key area where the Han government
sent garrison troops and peasants to open up wasteland and grow
grain.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners have pilfered a number of valuable cultural relics
from the Juyan ruins in the last century. The site is now under
state protection.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Accelerates Development of High-Tech Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial
city of Shanghai has set its information technology (IT)
industrial output value at 100 billion yuan (about 12 billion U.S.
dollars) this year, aiming to make the sector, along with
automotives, its top two industries.
</P>
<P>
The city generated 80 billion yuan in output value from the IT
industry in 1999, an increase of 23.8 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
An official with the municipal government said that
accelerating the development of the IT industry is a major step by
the city to turn high-tech industries into key growth areas of the
local economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the combined output value of the IT
industry, bio-pharmaceuticals and new materials will reach 150
billion yuan this year, accounting for 21 percent of the city's
total industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai first decided to give priority to high-tech industries
in 1995. By the end of 1998 these industries reported nearly 100
billion yuan in output value, 16.5 percent of the city's overall
industrial output the same year.
</P>
<P>
The city will focus on the development of major high-tech
products including integrated circuits, telecommunication
equipment, computer and software products, digital audio and
visual products, new medicines, and rare-earth metals.

<HEADLINE> Old Industrial Bases Turning Eco-Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Establishing an ecologically-
friendly economy will be the focus of northeast China's Jilin
Province this century, said Hong Hu, the provincial governor.
</P>
<P>
"The 21st Century will be an environmentally-green age. An eco-
friendly environment will ensure sustainable economic development,
" said Hong.
</P>
<P>
Eco-friendly farming experimental areas set up in the mid-1980s
have seen substantial progress in the province. The income of
farmers has increased as their produce has sold well across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Jilin has made efforts in auto manufacturing and tail gas
discharges by intensifying research into using more efficiently
natural gas, electricity and solar energy.
</P>
<P>
Hong said that such efforts are necessary. Otherwise, chemistry,
auto, and food processing industries will not be able to survive
fierce competition after China's accession into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Jilin is abundantly rich in resources. It has a 42 percent
green coverage rate. The neighboring province of Liaoning has
also set to promote and develop an ecologically-friendly economy.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has sophisticated manufacturing techniques and a
surfeit of talented personnel in designing, scientific research,
and management.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that Liaoning spent 5.7 billion yuan (
about 684 million U.S. dollars) last year on environmental
protection endeavors.

<HEADLINE> Opening-Up Efforts Pay Off In China Coastal City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- New opening-up efforts have
paid off in the coastal city of Qingdao in Shandong Province, as
local economic development can be attributed mainly to foreign
economic trade and cooperation, according to Mayor Wang Jiarui.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, the city had approved 8,964 overseas-funded
enterprises, using 12.48 billion US dollars of contractual
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Of this total, 3,142 overseas-funded enterprises have become
operational and have a total of 350,000 employees, accounting for
35 percent of all local employment.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded businesses paid 15.8 percent of local taxation
and reaped as much as 43 percent of all local industrial sales.
</P>
<P>
These companies also handled 74 percent of all local exports,
which totaled 4.46 billion US dollars last year, a rise of 8.9
percent compared to 1998, and accounted for 37.3 percent of the
local GDP in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao has now spent 28 billion yuan to construct local
economic and technological development zones, bonded zones, and hi-
tech industrial parks, and 42 percent of the overseas money
introduced into Qingdao has been flowing into the economic zones
and parks, which jointly contribute 16 percent of the local GDP.
</P>
<P>
Local township enterprises have so far used 1.92 billion US
dollars of actual overseas investment, 28.4 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
There are now seven overseas financial organizations in Qingdao,
which is also home to 300 hi-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao is seeking new economic spurs by opening wider to the
outside world, and intends to increase the use of overseas money
in agriculture and the service sector, and attract more investment
from multinationals.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Capital Expected to Face Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's low supply of water
may turn into a big problem for the city this year, an official
source revealed today.
</P>
<P>
The municipal water administration said that due to less
precipitation last year, which was only 349.1 mm or 60 percent of
the normal amount, the long-existing water scarcity in the Chinese
capital may be much worse this year.
</P>
<P>
There are currently some 14 million residents living in Beijing,
including tens of thousands of foreign diplomats, businessmen and
students.
</P>
<P>
"Last year Beijing's 16 major reservoirs lost a total of 800
million cubic water due to the lack of rain, which will be enough
for all Beijingers' daily life use in a whole year," a municipal
water administration official said.
</P>
<P>
"If the dry weather continues this year, we'll soon see a water
shortage," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since Beijing became the capital city of the People's Republic
of China in 1949, it has experienced three water emergencies, one
during the mid-1960s, another in the mid-70s, and the third at the
beginning of the 80s.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that Beijing's water use has increased 40
times over the figure of 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the growing population and dry climate factors,
water pollution also contributes to Beijing's water woes, experts
say.

signed an agreement with a chemical company in Jiangsu Province,
east China, for joint development of thenardite resources in
Hongze County.
</P>
<P>
In line with the agreement, the registered capital of the Sino-
Spanish joint venture will reach 143 million yuan (17.2 million U.
S. dollars ), with the Spanish company investing 53 million yuan (
6.39 million dollars), and the Jiangsu Nanfeng Chemical Share
Holding Co. Ltd contributing the rest.
</P>
<P>
A production line with an annual output capacity of 200,000
tons will be built to increase the county's annual thenardite
output to 600,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangsu Nanfeng Chemical Share Holding Co. Ltd is China's
second largest producer of thenardite, with an annual output
capacity of 400,000 tons. Crimidesa is able to export 700,000 tons
of thenardite to 68 countries and regions every year.

<HEADLINE> Green Belt to Surround Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A green ribbon will surround
the urban area of Beijing with the addition of another 240 sq km
of greenery this year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the grass and trees will be planted at the edge of the
metropolis and will act as the city's "lungs," while at the same
time form a barrier for the city's blind expansion, said Zhao
Zhijing, in charge of the Beijing Planning Association.
</P>
<P>
He said that such green belts are usual in other world capitals
such as London, Moscow, Paris, and Singapore, whose forests and
woods help modulate the climate, adjust the humidity, and lower
the temperature.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution has been worsening in Beijing due to the ever-
increasing number of urban dwellers, and automobiles. To fight
against this, the local government has endeavored to add more
green space over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Last year's statistics show that the wooded area in Beijing
reached 687,000 hectares, and a per-capita green area 8.18 sq m.
Altogether, 270,000 trees were planted along the city's main
artery, Chang'an Avenue, and 322,000 sq m of grassland was created
along the avenue.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is now applying to host the 2008 Olympic Games, and the
selection committee is expected to give major consideration to the
applicant city's natural environment.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Restructuring Viewed as a Must: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- China's small mines located
within the boundaries of state key mines and those using
underdeveloped technologies will be completely shut down this year
to help cut coal output by 130 million tons.
</P>
<P>
China is reorganizing its entire industrial structure to
prepare for across-the-board increases in market competition
expected to come with China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, according to the State Economic and Trade Commission
(SETC).
</P>
<P>
The reorganization is marked by the setting of serious
production ceilings in many sectors and the closing of numerous
small plants that operate inefficiently and are sometimes the
source of heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
"Because of market conditions, controlling the overall
production of some important products has become a very urgent
matter if we are to adjust our economic structure and improve
economic efficiency," said SETC minister Sheng Huaren, adding that
many of the country's industrial departments have faced an awkward
dilemma in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Serious oversupply of many industrial products has reduced
market activities and has exerted downward pressure on prices.
</P>
<P>
The specific production capacity of some enterprises is too
small to reach a rational economic scale which is affecting their
earnings performance negatively.
</P>
<P>
Outdated technologies and equipment are hindering the progress
of the industries. "Such fragile industrial structures are
incapable of competing with international firms," Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
To salvage the ailing industries, the SETC has taken a
comprehensive approach to the problem in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The textile sector is a successful example. It reduced cotton
yarn production capacity by 9.06 million spindles over the past
few years. And in 1999, the sector ended its six years of
successive losses and cashed in to the tune of 800 million yuan in
profit.
</P>
<P>
Still, the Chinese government is making favorable loans to
support large textile works and assist them with technical
upgrading.
</P>
<P>
A formidable money-losing trend in the coal industry is another
headache for China's macro-economic supervisors.
</P>
<P>
Though annual coal production has decreased in recent years,
oversupply is still a major problem within the sector, Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
China should do all it can to fulfill its task of producing no
more than 900 million tons of coal next year, which will lay a
sound foundation for reviving the industry, he said.

<HEADLINE> Steel Giant to Stay in Beijing: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's latest Olympic bid
and related moves to clean up the city will not force the Capital
Iron and Steel Corp out of the city, today's Business Weekly
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to stay in Beijing," the paper quoted Wu
Jianxin, a company spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wu dismissed as "rumors" speculations that the giant
corporation would move to Rizhao, a harbor in east China's
Shandong Province, by 2003, to avoid environmental protection
rules in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is striving for the rights to host the 2008 Olympic
Games, adding urgency to its drive to clean up the local
environment, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Some believe the corporation, China's steel giant is one of the
city's major polluters for many years, and must leave Beijing to
alleviate local pollution.
</P>
<P>
But Wu said the corporation's withdrawal from Beijing would be
impossible in the next several years.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided to provide the corporation
with 138 million yuan (about 16.62 million U.S. dollars) in low-
interest loans for technical upgrades of its environment-relief
projects this year, Wu said, further reducing pollution output.
</P>
<P>
From 1995 to 1998, the corporation channeled more than 400
million yuan (about 48.19 million US dollars) into 165 pollution-
relief projects.
</P>
<P>
"The amounts of soot and sulfur dioxide the corporation emits
decreased by more than 50 and 40 percent last year, when compared
with 1995," he said, older, environmentally unfriendly equipment
has largely been discarded.
</P>
<P>
The corporation has decided all new production projects must
include environmental protection equipment, Business Weekly said.

BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people are spending
more on their weddings than before and they are spending
differently, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that more than 60 percent of the 414
interviewees said they could spend as much as 20,000 yuan (about 2,
400 U.S. dollars) to 50,000 yuan on wedding expenses.
</P>
<P>
And who is expected to food the bill? Twenty-one percent said
wedding expenses will be paid by their parents, according to the
survey conducted by the China Economic Climate Monitoring Center
in Beijing and Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
Most of the spending goes for purchasing furniture, home
appliances and apartment decorations, the China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
An emerging item is the wedding dress photo session that is
increasingly popular among young couples. About 19.8 percent of
females interviewed said they want to wear a traditional Western
wedding dress during the commemorative shoot.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a big wedding meal, a traditionally
important part of a wedding ceremony, is losing popularity among
young couples.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asia to See Firm Export Growth This Year  by Chen Hegao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- After spurring a regional
economic recovery in 1999 from a two-year old crisis, Asia's
export is expected to grow firmly this year with a more favorable
environment and wider world markets.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the upturn in the world electronic market fuelled
the growth of Asia's export, which had slowed down for three
consecutive years since 1996. The robust economic expansion in the
United States and a mild economic recovery in Japan in the year
also helped improve Asia's export picture.
</P>
<P>
Although the growing pace was very slow compared with the pre-
crisis level, Asia's export performance was better than expected
in 1999. The Philippines' export increased by 19 percent last year,
Singapore 9.5 percent, Thailand 7.2 percent, and Malaysia 10
percent in the first 11 months of the year.
</P>
<P>
As a main engine for growth in the region, Asia's export
expansion enabled the gross domestic product in the developing
Asia to rise 5.7 percent in the year from 2.3 percent in 1998, a
year after the financial crisis swept across the region.
</P>
<P>
While Asia has a series of problems for further export
expansion, the strong demand of electronics in the world market
could help the region maintain the growth firmly, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
"The electronics cycle is just starting to pick up (and) we
expect a very strong cyclical upswing," said Rober Rountree, chief
strategist of Prudential-Bache Securities in Hong Kong
</P>
<P>
Recently, the U.S. Semiconductor Association forecast a 23-
percent increase in Asian semiconductor sales in 2000, and a 25-
percent increase in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that overall U.S. consumption may slow down
after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates early this
month, but demand for the electronics components that Asia
supplies should hold steady.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring and upgrading of information technology in
the United States, Europe and Japan should make those components
the last area to cut back, they said.
</P>
<P>
"The year 2000 looks like it will be pretty strong year for the
worldwide semiconductor industry," said Ron Bohn, a U.S. expert of
semiconductor research.
</P>
<P>
As Asia is a major supplier of electronic products to the world
market, the strong demand would maintain its export growth this
year.
</P>
<P>
Except electronics, the brisk rebound in Japan's trade with
Asia will also stimulate the region's exports this year. Thanks to
Japan's economic recovery and the yen's strengthen against the U.S.
dollar, Japan's imports from other Asian countries rose to the
highest level in 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the Japanese Finance Ministry, 3.6 percent of
Japan's total imports came from Asia in the first 11 months of
last year, up from 29 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Asia could become the largest trading
partner of Japan if the U.S. economy gets weak in the near future.
</P>
<P>
However, the over-dependence of electronics could weaken Asia's
competitiveness in the world markets in the long run. Asia's
export growth rate declined steeply from 22 percent in 1995 to 7.1
percent in 1996 when the world electronic market experienced a
cyclical slowdown.
</P>
<P>
But Asian countries till now have not undertaken serious
adjustments in their export products. At present, electronics
still comprises 66 percent of Singapore's total exports, 60
percent of Malaysia's and 51 percent of the Philippines'.
</P>
<P>
If a cyclical downturn comes round again, Asia's exports would
collapse again, experts warned.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Asia's position as electronics workshop to the world
is under threat from countries such as Mexico and Hungary, as they
are closer to major markets in the United States and Europe, where
buyers want their goods delivered quickly, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, even if Asia could maintain a steady growth in
exports this year, economies in the region must find ways to meet
the new challenges.

MEXICO CITY, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's Popocatepetl

The National Disaster Prevention Center, responsible for the
monitoring of the 5,452 meter high volcano, said that the seismic
movements were caused by the shifting of the lava inside the

The Popocatepetl is located on the line that divides the states
of Mexico, Puebla, and Morelos, some 75 kilometers southeast of

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's First Insurance Broker to Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial
city of Shanghai, which aims to become an international financial
center, is now busy making preparations for the establishment of
Dongda Insurance Brokerage Company, the first of its kind in the
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say the company, to be funded by Shanghai
Automobile Industry Group, Jinjiang Group and several other
investors, will help standardize the fast-growing insurance market
in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Dongda is also one of China's first three insurance brokerage
firms recently approved by the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The other two firms will be located in Beijing and Guangzhou,
and preparations for their formal launching have already begun as
well, according to industry sources here.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance sector has been growing at a rate of more
than 20 percent since insurers were allowed to resume business in
the country in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The nation's premiums were worth some 139 billion yuan in 1999,
compared to 13.1 billion yuan in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is home to 16 insurance companies, nine of which are
backed by overseas investors, and its insurance premium income
topped 11.52 billion yuan last year, over 10 percent more than in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia's Foreign Trade Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The import and export volume
of the land-locked Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest
China hit record 382 million U.S. dollars in 1999, up 22 percent
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the regional foreign trade and economic
cooperation department showed that exports reached 316 million
dollars, an increase of 12 percent on 1998, and imports stood at
66 million dollars, 2.14 times that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The achievement was attributed to a series of measures adopted
by the regional foreign trade department last year, including
holding trade fairs and business promotions in Hong Kong, the
United Arab Emirates and other countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia's exports to Asian countries rose by four percent last
year, and those to the European market including Germany, France
and Britain increased by 11.6 percent, and exports to the United
States rose by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the country's largest tatanlum producer, Ningxia's export of
tantalum accounted for 58 percent of the region's total, and the
exports of calcium carbide, tyre and cashmere and related products,
up 102 percent, 77 percent and 30 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ningxia approved more than 50 overseas-funded
projects, with contractual investment exceeding 100 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Stranded Whale Found Dead After Return to Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A whale which swam aground a
beach in Beigang village, Hainan Province in south China, on
February 5, and later was returned to the sea by a rescue team was
found dead Friday at the nearby village of Xingang.
</P>
<P>
The stranded whale, found by a fisherman on the first day of
the Chinese lunar New Year, spent four days in just 1.5 meters of
water and suffered a severe sunburn which became infected and
ultimately caused its death, according to animal experts.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers succeeded on February 8 in tugging the whale
back into the ocean with nets and thick ropes and two powerful
fishing vessels.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers built a plastic tent to shelter the whale from the
scorching sun, but failed in their initial attempts to tug the
animal back to sea with a fishing boat.
</P>
<P>
The whale, weighing at least 15,000 kg, was about 11 meters
long (36.3 feet), and 1.4 meters tall.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists guessed that the rapid currents in the Qiongzhou
Strait may have affected the whale's sense of direction.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Raps Israel for Continued Attacks on Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said here Sunday that continued Israeli attacks on Lebanon
would be "very harmful" to stability and peace prospects in the
Middle East, the official Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Moussa blamed Israel's attacks
on Lebanon for further compounding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is making contacts with the U.S. on the issue, he said,
adding that it was exigent not only to put an end to such
aggression but also to stop Israel's intransigent policies toward
the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Israel's continued occupation of south Lebanon leads to
resistance and the basis of the peace process on the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks is to end such an occupation, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978 and carved out
a self-styled security zone there in 1985 with the claimed aim of
protecting its north from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
On Israel's purported message to the Arabs through hitting
Lebanon that the Jewish state had the longer arm, Moussa said
neither Egypt nor the rest of Arab states would buy that.
</P>
<P>
Such a long arm only incited anger and could lead to reactions.
</P>
<P>
Israel on Tuesday launched air raids on a number of Lebanon's
civilian installations, including three power stations, in
retaliation for the recent killing of six Israeli soldiers by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the Arabs will stick to their demands for ending
Israel's occupation and attacks and honoring signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world now stands as one in the face of Israel's
policies, said Moussa in response to a query as how Arabs would
confront such policies without first uniting themselves.
</P>
<P>
The important thing now for the Arabs is to forge a collective
and effective stand vis-a-vis the deteriorating situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa reiterated his argument that occupation fed the spirit of
resistance while answering a question on accusations levelled at
the Hezbollah that it was responsible for the current situation in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He again warned that the peace process was in danger of losing
out to the gloomy situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
He urged for an immediate halt to hostilities in Lebanon and a
prompt return to the negotiating table with Syria and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The minister asserted the necessity of implementing U.N.
Resolution 425 on Israeli troop withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted in 1978, must be carried out
irrespective of the so-called "long arm", he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa hailed the Arab League's stance in this regard as quite
sound and said Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid's demands
for stopping the Israeli aggression were being made in the name of
all Arab states.
</P>
<P>
On a proposal to convene an Arab summit periodically, Moussa
said the coming Arab foreign ministers meeting in March will likely
discuss the relevant mechanism and determine the Arab position on
the deteriorating peace process.

by police investigators on Sunday over his alleged financial
irregularities of accepting a large sum of cash gifts from a French
millionaire.
</P>
<P>
Six detectives of National Fraud Squad, led by anti-white-collar
crime unit head Miri Golan, arrived at the presidential residence
Sunday morning and began their second interview with Weizman
immediately, Israel Radio reported.

JERUSALEM -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday that he would
take a decision on a possible Israeli withdrawal from southern
Lebanon in April or May in accord with progress in the peace talks
with Syria, Israel Radio reported.

Barak made the comments at a weekly cabinet meeting, which

GAZA -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat on Sunday
blamed Israel for the failure to reach a framework agreement on the
final status issues by Sunday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
Terming the passing of the deadline as "regrettable," Erekat
accused the Israeli side of repeatedly failing to honor or fulfill
agreed-upon deadlines during its negotiations with the
Palestinians. Erekat, who has been leading negotiations on the
interim issues including West Bank land transfer, expressed the
hope that the Israeli side will take September 13 seriously to
reach a final peace agreement, the Voice of Palestine radio
reported. (Palestine-Israel-Accusation)

JERUSALEM -- As Israel and Palestinians failed to meet a key
deadline for a framework agreement on a permanent peace Sunday, a
senior Palestinian negotiator called for skipping over the
framework accord and instead focusing efforts on a final treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Why don't we make the two things together and go directly to
negotiations on this (final) treaty?" said Yasser Abed Rabbo, chief
Palestinian negotiator on the final status talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sunday was the deadline Israel and the Palestinians set in the
Sharm el Sheikh memorandum to draft an agreement on final status
issues, to be sealed in a detailed final accord by September. But
the day passed with nothing on the paper. (Israel-Palestine-Talks)

TEHRAN -- Iran's reformers on Sunday called for a massive
turnout in Friday's sensitive parliamentary poll to make a "house-
cleaning" in the country in order to push forward reformist
programs of President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
"The country needs a 'house-cleaning' to set up a new Majlis
(parliament) to push forward the reforms initiated by President
Khatami," a reformist said at a large student gathering in support
of the pro-Khatami Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF). (Iran-

<HEADLINE> Austria's Haider to Attend EU Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Austrian far-right Freedom
Party leader Joerg Haider is expected to attend a European Union (
EU) meeting next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He is due to attend a Brussels session of the EU's Committee of
the Regions since he is a member of the committee as governor of
Austria's southern region of Carinthia.
</P>
<P>
European Commission President Romano Prodi and Portugal's
Secretary of State for International and European Affairs
Francisco Seixas da Costa will also attend the plenary.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the committee's plenary session may well be
overshadowed by Prodi's address and the presence of Haider.
</P>
<P>
Austria's 14 EU partners have frozen bilateral ties with Vienna
amid an international outcry over the new coalition government,
but agreed to keep working relations within the EU.
</P>
<P>
Haider, whose far-right Freedom Party has just entered the
Austrian government coalition, was appointed to the Committee of
the Regions in May last year, shortly after he was elected
Governor of the State of Carinthia.
</P>
<P>
At that time, few thought much when his name was proposed by
the then Austrian government, a coalition of Socialists and
Conservatives, and later approved by EU foreign ministers. Haider
attended all but one of the committee's plenary sessions since his
appointment.
</P>
<P>
There is inevitably speculation about his possible meeting with
Prodi, who will be there to present the EU executive's strategy
for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Belgian evening newspaper Le Soir said Saturday that a group
led by former Belgian deputy prime minister Elio di Rupo was
considering legal action to stop Haider's visit, his second
foreign trip since his far-right party entered the coalition.
</P>
<P>
But Belgian political leaders doubted Sunday that Haider could
be barred from visiting the country next Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> French Communist Leader Stresses Fight Against Fascism in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The National Secretary of the
French Communist Party Robert Hue said on Sunday that the people
of Europe should use every means to fight fascism in Europe after
the coming to power of the extreme-right in Austria.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview with Europe 1, Hue praised the boycott by
French and Belgian ministers of employment and social affairs of a
speech by their Austrian counterpart during an informal European
Union meeting last Friday in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
``There is no small or big thing in the fight against fascism...
We should absolutely avoid a recognition of those who are in power
in Austria with all the means. And we have already begun to do so,
'' said Hue.
</P>
<P>
He also defined the Austrian extreme-right Freedom Party of
Joerg Haider as one ``which defends the theories of xenophobia,
anti-Semitism and racism.''

<HEADLINE> Chirac Regards Punishing Crimes Against Humanity As Top Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
has stressed the fight against genocide and crimes against
humanity, action to stop fighting between countries, fight against
AIDS in developing countries, and giving education to all as the
priorities of a hypothetical ``world government.''
</P>
<P>
In an answer to questions given on internet by a group of young
people in direct dialogue with leaders of the seven most
industrialized nations, Chirac said that to arrest those
responsible for crimes against humanity and genocide is the
priority of all priorities for a ``world government.''
</P>
<P>
Sending international intervention forces to countries at war
to stop fighting and engage in reconciliation, and the canceling
debts of the poorest countries to help them get into the road of
development should be two other major tasks of such a global
government.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said that to let developing countries have access
to modern medical means to treat AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis,
and the launching of a program on universal access to education
are two other prior tasks.

<HEADLINE> Seventy-two Afghan Hostages Set to Leave for Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 72 hostages involved in
last week's Afghan plane hijack are expected to leave Britain for
Afghanistan on a chartered plane at Sunday mid-night.
</P>
<P>
Three coaches full of the former hostages had arrived at a
Royal Air Force base near London from an immigration center, a BBC
report said.
</P>
<P>
A Home Office spokeswoman said the chartered aircraft was
expected to leave the air base at around 2400 GMT with the
hostages.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, only 17 of the 142 hostages freed at Stansted airport,
had expressed a wish to go home. But the Home Office said the
number had since risen to 72.
</P>
<P>
The rest were reported to be applying for political asylum in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate explanation from officials for the
increase in the number going home.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Afghanistan's foreign minister is in
Kandahar, an Afghan city, to welcome the returning hostages.
</P>
<P>
The Taleban authorities in Kabul, who have no diplomatic
relations with Britain, have asked for the return of all the
hostages.
