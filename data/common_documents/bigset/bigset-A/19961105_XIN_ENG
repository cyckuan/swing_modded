<HEADLINE> Unusual Situation, But Stability, Primakov Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today that Russia's situation is under control
despite President Boris Yeltsin's approaching heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a news conference on his talks with visiting
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Echussel.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said even though the situation was unusual, with the
President in pre-surgery preparation, Russia was "under control of
the president and his team."
</P>
<P>
"We do not have any doubt that unconstitutional methods of
changing the situation on the top and at the helm are
impossible. The country would not accept this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov stressed that how the government acted was of great
importance in keeping stability.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin doctors are to meet this evening to discuss
preparations for Yeltsin's bypass surgery and fix the date of the
operation.
</P>
<P>
The press service of the Russian President announced in a
bulletin: "The condition of Boris Yeltsin is quite satisfactory.
His temperature remains within the norm on all (recent) days. His
blood pressure is stable, not going beyond the range of 120/80
millimeters. His pulse measures 64-68 beats per minute."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's heart operation will be performed in the cardiology
research center by a group of surgeons led by Professor Renat
Akchurin, who performed a similar operation on the present Russian
Prime Minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, eight years ago.

<HEADLINE> US Pilot Fires Second Missile on Iraqi Radar Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. F-16 pilot fired at
an Iraqi radar site today when perceiving his jet-fighter was
targeted by a mobile surface-to-air missile system, Pentagon
officials said.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time in three days that U.S. pilots launched
missile attacks on Iraq's air defense installations. The first was
on Saturday when a pilot, misreading indications that his plane
was locked on to, fired a missile on an Iraqi radar site.
</P>
<P>
As regard to the second firing, the Pentagon officials said the
pilot "followed standard procedure" when he got indications that he
was lit up. "He fired a HARM (high-speed nti-radiation missile) and
he got out of there," one of them said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, campaigning in New Hampshire, was briefed
on the second incident and asked for further analysis, White House
spokesman Nike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously U.S. pilots have the right to protect themselves, and
they will continue to do so," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The two incidents took place in the no-fly zone in southern
Iraq which was unilaterally enlarged by the United States after it
staged two missile attacks against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
in early September as a way of retaliation for his troops entering
the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has denied that any incident occurred. Its official news
agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying, "Fabricating
this false report is part of American-style electioneering."
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it remained committed to a decision it made in
September not to fire on U.S. warplanes enforcing no-fly zones both
in the northern and southern parts of its territory.

<HEADLINE> Greeks Work More Hours Than Other Europeans to Buy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The difference in work hours
needed by the working Greeks to buy food and other consumer goods
is larger compared to corresponding figures for other European
countries, according to an announcement by the Greek Consumers'
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Giving an example, the institute said that to purchase 185
products a worker in Greece must work for almost a year, while a
German worker does his job only 179 days.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, a worker in Greece has to work 95 hours, 46
minutes to buy 100 types of foodstuffs, while 57 hours, 10 minutes
are required in Britain, 58 hours in France, 48.5 hours in Germany
and 69 hours, 12 minutes in Italy.
</P>
<P>
To buy 50 household and personal care products, a worker in
Greece must work 53 hours, 15 minutes, while the average in the
other European countries ranges from 30 to 43 hours.
</P>
<P>
The institute further pointed out that a persisting phenomenon
is a major difference in prices for standardized goods from one
city to another and from one store to another.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Opposition MPs Support No-Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Forty opposition members of
the Punjab Assembly of Pakistan have assured their support to the
no-confidence motion against reinstated Chief Minister Manzoor
Wattoo, which was put forward by the ruling parliamentary group of
the Pakistan Democratic Front (PDF), a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
The PDF consists of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) led by
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, the Pakistan Muslim League (Junejo
group) (PML-J) led by Hamid Nasir Chatta, and several small
parties.
</P>
<P>
Malik Mushtaq Ahmed Awan, PPP President of Punjab province,
said that 40 members of the Provincial Assembly belonging to the
Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz group) (PML-N), the major opposition
party in Pakistan, had expressed their "utter disliking for the
policies being pursued by their party."
</P>
<P>
Awan said the 40 parliamentarians expressed the hope that the
no-confidence motion against Manzoor Wattoo, who was reinstated as
the Punjab Chief Minister by the Lahore High Court on Sunday, is
bound to succeed.
</P>
<P>
According to the court, Wattoo, who was ousted from office in
September 1995 by the president, must seek a vote of confidence
from the Punjab Assembly in ten days.
</P>
<P>
Wattoo, a member of PML-J, must get support from at least 125
parliamentarians in the 248-member assembly.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, there are 147 parliamentarians for
PDF, 91 for PML-N and ten independents in the assembly.
</P>
<P>
So far, only two PML-J members formally expressed support to
Wattoo.

<HEADLINE> Chip Sales to Jump in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The world's chip sales were
predicted to increase by more than 7 percent next year, to 138.8
billion U.S. dollars, but with a continuous decline of computer
memory chips.
</P>
<P>
This was indicated by a semiannual industry forecast prepared
by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, an international
organization of 70 chip manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The group predicted that double-digit growth should return in
1998, with sales increasing 17.1 percent, to 162.6 billion
dollars, and 21.6 percent in 1999, to 197.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the global semi-conductor market was just 50.5
billion dollars in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The industry forecast is less optimistic than the one issued in
mid-October by Dataquest Inc., a market-research company.
Dataquest said that worldwide chip revenue will rise about 13
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Chip sales this year will fall 10.5 percent to 129.2 billion
dollars, according to the forecast, though fourth-quarter sales
should increase a bit. That will make this year the first to
witness a worldwide decrease since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Semiconductor revenue soared 41.7 percent in 1995 and 31.8
percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said that an oversupply of DRAMs (dynamic
random access memory) chips sent prices tumbling. Sales of DRAMs,
which represent 19 percent of the world's market, are expected to
decline nearly 40 percent this year from 1995, to 24.6 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decline in DRAM sales will likely continue in the following
years, according to the industry forecast.

<HEADLINE> US Carmakers Work on New Air Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. automakers are trying to
reduce the inflation speed of air bags to minimize the danger to
children, but safety administrators worry about the protection for
adults.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, the redesigning of the air
bags would be cheaper and quicker for car companies than some more
complex alternatives.
</P>
<P>
The General Motors, Ford and Chrysler all agreed to a request
from Canada's Ministry of Transport for less-powerful air bags in
cars sold there. In return, car companies want Canada to insist on
the same bags in the U.S., citing the North American Free Trade
Act.
</P>
<P>
The NAFTA encourages governments of Canada, Mexico and the U.S.
to adopt identical standards so that cars and trucks can be sold
in all three countries without expensive redesigns.
</P>
<P>
Air bags aren't required in Canada, but are in the U.S. Bags
must inflate forcefully enough to protect a 165-pound man not
wearing a safety belt in a 30 mph head-on crash, according to
American standards.
</P>
<P>
The impact of passenger air bags has killed 30 children in the
U.S. since April 1993. But the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration worries that lower-power bags might endanger
larger adults.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Reassess Rwandan Arms Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, November 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would
reassess its 87 million Rand (about 18.5 million US Dollars) arms
sale to Rwanda#,Chairman of the National Conventional Arms
Control Committee (NCACC) Kader Asmal said today.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the countries in the Great Lake region were
scheduled to hold a special summit in Nairobi, Kenya, on Tuesday
to discuss the situation in eastern Zaire, said sources here.
</P>
<P>
Asmal said the South African government would reassess the
position on its Rwandan arms deal after Tuesday's Nairobi summit,
following the advice from the great lakes leadership.
</P>
<P>
The regional summit, chaired by Kenya, would be attended by
representatives from Uganda, Zambia, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Rwanda and
Cameroon, which presently chairs the Organisation of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Cape Town, Asmal said there was no
evidence, even circumstantial, that Rwanda had been using its
arms or military formations in strife-torn eastern Zaire, and it
would be gross impertinent to unilaterally suspend the deal
without consultation with the countries involved.
</P>
<P>
The NCACC recently decided to authorise the sale of "certain
defensive materials" to the Rwandan government.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is strongly criticised by some African countries,
especially the Great Lakes region, for its arms deal with Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
However, President Nelson Mandela recently rejected the criticism,
saying Rwanda should be "able to defend itself against armed invaders
intent on committing a massacre".
</P>
<P>
Fighting between Zairean troops and Zairean Tutsi rebels in
eastern Zaire has caused concerns to the region that a regional
war might break out if nothing is done to ease the tention.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Asian and African
Legal Consultative Committee (AALCC) has made important
contributions to the promotion of the development and codification
of international law and to the world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Chen Shiqiu made the statement here today at
the U.N. General Assembly on cooperation between the U.N. and the
AALCC.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that since its establishment 40 years ago, the AALCC
has become a significant and unique regional intergovernmental
organization in the international arena, with its formal member
states increasing from seven to the present 43.
</P>
<P>
Since the AALCC became an observer of the U.N. General Assembly
in 1980, the two organizations have enjoyed ever closer
cooperation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The AALCC has made efforts to adjust its program of work, in
order to give priority consideration to matters of current concern
at the U.N., and has taken initiatives to carry out activities
with a view to enhancing the role of the U.N.," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has attached great importance to the
work of the AALCC. Since becoming a formal member in 1983, China
has actively attended all the annual sessions of the organization
and successfully hosted the 29th session in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government will continue, as always, to give its
full support to the work of the AALCC, and will do its share in
furthering its role and influence, and its closer cooperation with
the U.N.," he said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Reiterated Stands on Accession to EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government today
reiterated its position on accession to the European Union (EU) by
rejecting the view that Cyprus will not be able to join the EU
without prior solution of the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The position was stated by Government Spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides, who stressed that Cyprus is not prepared to
sacrifice the interests of its people for the island's accession
prospects.
</P>
<P>
"Those who tell the Turkish side that Cyprus will not join
the EU if a Cyprus solution is not found are doing the worst
service to efforts toward this goal," the spokesman told his
daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said such an attitude encourages Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash to stick to his intransigent positions,
which aim at blocking a resolution on the problem.
</P>
<P>
His remarks echoed an earlier statement by Foreign Minister
Alecos Michaelides, who warned that actions or moves casting
doubt or expressing reservations about EU decisions on Cyprus are
damaging the prospects for a solution.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides' comments came in response to the press reports
that the German Foreign Ministry, in an internal report,
questioned the validity of the EU decision to start accession
negotiations with Cyprus on grounds that Cyprus is not politically
ready to join the union.
</P>
<P>
"Certain messages are out of tune with the general spirit of
the EU decision to start accession talks and Germany must
understand that Cyprus' application for accession will help the
applications of Central and Eastern European countries,"
Cassoulides said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Cyprus' accession prospect will not overshadow
the content of a settlement. "Cyprus will not reach the stage
when it will have to choose between EU accession and concessions
toward a Cyprus settlement," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, which has been divided since Turkish invasion in
1974, applied for full membership of the European Community in
July 1990. It signed an association agreement in 1972 and a
customs union agreement in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided on March 6, 1995, to start accession talks with
Cyprus.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel renamed the defense
ministry compound in downtown Tel Aviv today to mark the first
anniversary of the assassination of former Premier Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
The army headquarters, known as the Kirya since the
beginning of the Jewish state, was renamed as Rabin Camp where the
late Labor party chairman had spent 22 years as Army Chief of
Staff, Defense Minister and Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Rabin's widow Leah Rabin, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai,
Army Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin Shahak and other senior defense
officials attended the ceremony, in which a bust of Rabin was
unveiled.
</P>
<P>
Leah said that among all the ceremonies she had attended in
honor of her husband, this was the most difficult one because
the Rabin family was so closely connected with the place, "a
home for so many years."
</P>
<P>
Mordechai praised Rabin as the man who not only helped build
Israel's Army but also forged the close relations between the
army and the nation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two civilian helicopters flew over Tel Aviv this
morning displaying a gigantic banner of 640 square meters to
commemorate Rabin. The poster, regarded to be the world's biggest,
read: "We will remember you always."
</P>
<P>
Today's ceremony is the latest in a series of memorial
services in honor of Rabin, who gunned down by a radical Jew on
November 4 last year when he left a Tel Aviv peace rally.
</P>
<P>
Various forms of massive mourning services have been held
across the country since October 24, the first anniversary of
Rabin's murder according to the Jewish lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, 100,000 people thronged the Rabin Square,
also renamed after the former premier following his assassination
there, to mark the great man who spearheaded the Israeli-Arab
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a monument marking the spot where Rabin was
murdered was unveiled near the City Hall, which is lit 24 hours
a day by underground lighting.

<HEADLINE> Israel Pins High Expectation on Economic Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel expects to get away with
lucrative deals on some joint projects with its Arab neighbors at
the upcoming Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference, if
the Arab countries are willing, an Israeli diplomat said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli expectations of the conference are high if Israel
and Arab countries manage to create common interest. If we
cooperate better we would feel more need for peace," Lijor Ben
Dor, the Israeli diplomat, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Updating the Israeli representation level at the gathering, he
said ministers of finance, communications, transportation,
commerce as well as governor of the Central Bank of Israel are
expected to come.
</P>
<P>
It is possible that the Israeli foreign minister will also
attend the gathering, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 50 government officials and representatives
from financial and commercial institutions as well as 50
businessmen from the private sector have confirmed their
participation, doubling the size of the representation compared to
the two previous conferences, held in Casablanca 1994 and Amman in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Despite the many new faces in the team, he said the projects
they are expected to present at the conference are old, such as
the Aqaba-Taba-Eilat tourism belt and the railroad linking Jordan,
Israel, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli official hinted that lack of enthusiasm on the
Arab side has caused a delay in implementing the projects.
</P>
<P>
"It's regrettable that we have not received much readiness....
the Arab world is making a direct connection between these
projects and peace, between the success of the meeting and
progress on Hebron and Golan Heights," he deplored.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat reaffirmed Israel's long-held belief in security
before peace, saying that closer regional trade and economic
cooperation would promote better understanding and mutual
interest, which benefits Israel as well as the whole region.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that more economic cooperation should first of
all be conducted, from which both Israelis and Arabs will
benefit. In this way, he said, more and more people from both
sides will be inclined to support peace.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports show that Israel and Palestine are increasingly
optimistic about clinching a deal on the Hebron redeployment
before or at the conference, which was time and again postponed
for unfavorable atmosphere stemmed from the Israeli intransigence
on renegotiating concluded peace accords signed with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under the previously-signed accords between the two sides, the
Israeli troops should have redeployed from the West Bank town of
Hebron by March 28. The former Israeli government led by the Labor
party delayed the moves following a series of suicide bombings in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
After the May 29 general elections, the new Israeli government
led by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu retrogressed from the
position of its predecessor, especially regarding the Hebron
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The economic conference, slated to be held in Cairo on November
12-14, aims to promote a regional development process integrating
the countries of the Middle East and North Africa into an economic
community, in parallel with the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on developing infrastructure, attracting
international capital for investment projects in the region and
encouraging industrial and commercial development.

significant role played by the Arab League in both international
and regional affairs and to the friendly cooperation with the
member states of the organization," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected the Sino-Arab relations, which are closer
over the recent years, would make a giant leap forward.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief congratulated China on the great achievement it
has made in the economic, social and technological domains.
</P>
<P>

<P>
JOHANNEBURG, November 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has renewed
its call for a ceasefire in the strife-torn Great Lakes region on
the eve of Tuesday's regional summit to discuss situation in
eastern Zaire, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
The summit, scheduled to be held on Tuesday in Nairobi, Kenya,
will be attended by leaders from Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia,
Zambia, Eritrea, Rwanda and Cameroun, which currently chairs the
Organization of African Unity, said the source.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Cape Town, Foreign Minister Alfred
Nzo said the Nairobi summit is an important step towards ending
hostilities in the region.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said the South African government "wishes to reiterate its
previous appeal to all parties to cease hostilities forthwith and
to participate in discussions which could seriously address the
issues which gave rise to the conflict".
</P>
<P>
South Africa's call coincided with an announcement by Tutsi
rebels in eastern Zaire that they will observe a unilateral
three-week ceasefire starting today so that refugees in the area
could be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between Zairean troops and Tutsi rebels in eastern
Zaire in the past few weeks has caused serious concern to the
region that a regional war might break out.

when they went to their offices and found they were raided by
robbers.
</P>
<P>
According to the News Agency of Nigeria today, a gang of armed

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Reiterated Stands on Accession to EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government today
reiterated its position on accession to the European Union (EU) by
rejecting the view that Cyprus will not be able to join the EU
without prior solution of the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The position was stated by Government Spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides, who stressed that Cyprus is not prepared to
sacrifice the interests of its people for the island's accession
prospects.
</P>
<P>
"Those who tell the Turkish side that Cyprus will not join
the EU if a Cyprus solution is not found are doing the worst
service to efforts toward this goal," the spokesman told his
daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said such an attitude encourages Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash to stick to his intransigent positions,
which aim at blocking a resolution on the problem.
</P>
<P>
His remarks echoed an earlier statement by Foreign Minister
Alecos Michaelides, who warned that actions or moves casting
doubt or expressing reservations about EU decisions on Cyprus are
damaging the prospects for a solution.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides' comments came in response to the press reports
that the German Foreign Ministry, in an internal report,
questioned the validity of the EU decision to start accession
negotiations with Cyprus on grounds that Cyprus is not politically
ready to join the union.
</P>
<P>
"Certain messages are out of tune with the general spirit of
the EU decision to start accession talks and Germany must
understand that Cyprus' application for accession will help the
applications of Central and Eastern European countries,"
Cassoulides said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Cyprus' accession prospect will not overshadow
the content of a settlement. "Cyprus will not reach the stage
when it will have to choose between EU accession and concessions
toward a Cyprus settlement," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, which has been divided since Turkish invasion in
1974, applied for full membership of the European Community in
July 1990. It signed an association agreement in 1972 and a
customs union agreement in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided on March 6, 1995, to start accession talks with
Cyprus six months after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental
Conference, which is scheduled for 1997.

rescue more than one million refugees faced with unprecedented
human disaster, French foreign ministry spokeswoman Catherine
Colonna said today.
</P>
<P>
Citing a declaration adopted during a meeting between President
Jacques Chirac and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar held in

</P>
<P>
Chirac and Aznar also urged the Security Council to hold an
emergency meeting to accelerate the organization of such an
operation.
</P>
<P>
More than one million Rwandan and Burundian refugees and
Zairean civilians are still on the move today in eastern Zaire,
waiting for the international community to rescue them from
hunger, disease and violence.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette today also called on
the United Nations to send a "security force" to eastern Zaire
to rescue the refugees.
</P>
<P>
He invited the United States to join a meeting of the 15
European Union countries to be held in Brussels on Tuesday to work
out a plan of international intervention in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He said that a multinational intervention in Zaire must be
participated by the United States, European countries and African
countries with "a mobilization by all."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Israel Pledge to Continue Rabin's Vision for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Israel pledged
today that they will continue the vision of peace as laid
down by late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
In a memorial service on the first anniversary of Rabin's
assassination, Cyprus Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides paid
tribute to the late premier, along with his partner Shimon Peres,
for his rare political courage and unswerving dedication to the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"They embarked on the mission to change the Middle East
from an area of confrontation, hatred and belligerency into a
region of stability, tolerance, understanding and common
prosperity," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although Rabin is dead, "his vision, his
achievements and his messages will always shine, not only to
his own people and to the peoples of the Middle East, but
to all who are suffering from long-standing conflicts."
</P>
<P>
Quoting Rabin's pledge that the "time of peace has now
come," Michaelides said peace for the Middle East, peace for
Cyprus and peace for the world has come. "We in Cyprus, will
continue to share Rabin's vision for peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli ambassador to the island Shemi Tzur said the
bullets which killed Rabin "will remin in the memory of every
Israeli."
</P>
<P>
"The historic process of reconciliation and peace in the
Middle East has reached a point from which there is no
return," the ambassador pledged.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Israel and Cyprus and all democratic nations
of the world must learn a very difficult lesson from this
terrible assassination, which is "never to allow violence to
influence our actions or use of violence to influence our
actions, or use violent means to enforce our way of thinking
upon others."
</P>
<P>
During the service, a video clip entitled "Last Farewell to
Yitzhak Rabin" was screened, highlighting the most significant
moments of Rabin's career and the last moments of his life.

<HEADLINE> China Calls on States to Support African Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese deputy
permanent representative, Ambassador Wang Xuexian on Monday called
upon the international community to "talk less to Africa and do
more to support African efforts" in development areas.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the General Assembly, Ambassador Wang described
ruthless exploitation the Africans suffered in the past, as well as
poverty and underdevelopment caused by the grim international
environment today, as main factors hampering their efforts to
achieve economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
"Under these circumstances, African countries need the active
support and cooperation of the international community so that
they can be free from the vicious circle of underdevelopment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that international support based on
partnership and shared responsibility should be reflected in the
following aspects:
</P>
<P>
1. To do more solid work to help resolve pressing problems
confronting African countries. It should be particularly
emphasized that the official development aid remains the main
source of external funds for many African countries.
</P>
<P>
2. To take concrete actions in support of the efforts for
development cooperation between African countries, including the
regional economic integration process in Africa and sub-regional
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
3. To respect the choice of road of development by African
countries. Imposing a specific model on Africa in disregard of
its actual situation can only aggravate its difficulties.
</P>
<P>
4. The U.N. should continue to play a primary mobilizing and
monitoring role in the effective implementation of the follow-up
to the U.N. New Agenda for the Development of Africa in 1990s.

<P>
Abdel Aziz Bin Diaa, Secretary General of the Tunisian

and regionalism," "social repercussions of globalization of
economy on Mediterranean countries" and "horizons of

<HEADLINE> UK Government Denies Secret Talks with Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
flatly denied that it had been involved in secret talks with Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA),
according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew said
earlier today that the British government insisted that the IRA
call an unequivocal cease-fire to its bombing campaign before Sinn
Fein is allowed to attend the all-party peace talks on the future
of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Speculation about the so-called secret talks between the
British government and the Sinn Fein mounted after John Hume,
leader of an Irish nationalist party, confirmed that he had been
in touch with with British government and Sinn Fein in an effort
to secure a new cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
"Categorically there is no question of negotiations with Sinn
Fein, no deals with the IRA, no deals with Sinn Fein," Mayhew told
a session of the Ulster peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that any new IRA cease-fire would have to
be accompanied by proof that Sinn Fein was committed to democratic
methods alone and renounced violence.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing else on offer. If it does not help Sinn Fein
to do what they should do, which is to secure a cease-fire, an
unequivocal cease-fire, then it is bad news," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish governments have banned Sinn Fein from
the on-going Northern Ireland peace talks since the IRA ended a
17-month truce in February by staging a series of bombing attacks
against British targets.

OTTAWA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government today
welcomed the achievement of "a major step" in implementing the
Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
</P>
<P>
The CWC bans the development, production, stockpiling, transfer
and use of chemicals and regulates the means of their destruction.
</P>
<P>
It opened for signature at the 1993 Conference on Disarmament
in Geneva, and would enter into force 180 days after the 65th
ratification by a Signatory State.
</P>
<P>
As Hungary became the 65th country to ratify on October 31, the
convention will enter into force on April 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Ratification by the 65th country marks an important step in
the pursuit of international peace and security," said Canadian
Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
"The CWC is unique for being the first global verifiable
agreement to ban an entire class of weaponry," Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Canada signaled the importance of the CWC by
becoming one of the first countries to ratify the convention in
September 1995.
</P>
<P>
Canada encourages other countries, particularly the United
States and Russia, to ratify the convention before its entry into
force next year, and to work for its effective implementation,
Axworthy noted.

<HEADLINE> Boom in US Corporate Earnings Appears Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The great boom in US corporate
earnings, which buoyed the economy for the past four years, seems
to be over, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wall Street estimates, the third quarter saw the
weakest gains in operating earnings. That would mean that for this
year, earnings grown is likely to be the smallest since profits
actually fell in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The earnings slowdowned from 15 to 18 percent average rate from
1992 through 1995. And the earnings for 1997 are forecast to grow
from flat to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The analysts attributed the slowdown to an inability to raise
prices, the slowing productivity of workers, the moderating pace
of growth in the economy, corporate cost-cutting and downsizing.

<HEADLINE> President Mobutu to Return to Zaire in A Few Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- President Mobutu Sese Seko of
Zaire will return to Zaire in a few days, local media quoted
Zairean presidential spokesman Kabya Lumuna as saying this
evening.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zairean government formally recognized this
evening that Zairean troops are no longer controlling Goma and
Bukavu, two major towns in the Kivu region of eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Mobutu arrived in his private villa in southeast France today
from Switzerland, where he had a prostate cancer operation on
August 22.
</P>
<P>
In another development, French President Jacques Chirac and
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar today jointly launched an
appeal to the international community to stage a multi-national
humanitarian operation in eastern Zaire to save one million
refugees from an imminent human disaster.
</P>
<P>
While expressing their will to ``contribute to'' such an
operation, the two leaders, who met today in Marseille, insisted
that it must be decided by the U.N. Security Council and be joined
by the United States and the Organization of African Unity, apart
from European countries.
</P>
<P>
Reading the declaration adopted by Chirac and Aznar this
evening, French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said
that France's participation in a military operation is not
excluded.
</P>
<P>
She said that France and Spain are ready to share their
responsibility, but will not act alone.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Aznar also urged the holding of an international
conference of the Great Lakes region to seek lasting peace in the
region, and the holding of an emergency session of U.N. Security
Council to accelerate the organization of an intervention.

<P>
LONDON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- London has been voted Europe's
best city for business for the seventh year running in the latest
annual survey of directors from 500 top European companies.
</P>
<P>
The European Cities Monitor 1996, published by international
property specialist Healey/Baker, also shows the UK capital's
urban transportation system as better than that of any other city.
</P>
<P>
Britain as a whole was expected to continue as one of Europe's
leading manufacturing locations over the next five years, second
only to Germany in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
The survey covers all factors that decision makers consider
when assessing a location's potential as a center for business.
London remained in first place, followed by Paris, Frankfurt and
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish city of Glasgow also came in the top four for its
public transport system.
</P>
<P>
It came top in five key criteria: easy market access, internal
transport, external transport links, quality of
telecommunications, and office space availability.
</P>
<P>
Paul Orchard, senior partner with Healey/Baker, said: "London
has always had a special role in Europe and it is not surprising
that our survey shows European businessmen want the role to
continue."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends Envoys to Africa for Cease-fire in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States will send
envoys to central Africa to join in world efforts in putting an
end to the fighting in Zaire, the State Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special negotiator Howard Wolpe will fly to Nairobi for a
conference on Tuesday to discuss with all the major players in the
region on what could be done to resolve the crisis, State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher will send his special
coordinator for policy in that region, Richard Bogosian, to meet
with leaders of Zaire and Rwanda for consultations on the same
issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in eastern Zaire broke out in September when the
Zairian army conflicted with ethnic Tutsis who migrated from
Rwanda decades ago. The conflicts have evolved into fighting as
Rwanda, governed by Tutsis, provided military aid to their ethnic
brethren and participating in some of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the United States will be pursuing two objectives:
"To promote an immediate cease-fire to end the fighting that
caused the tremendous flow of refugees" and "to work with the
international relief agencies to make sure the food and medical
supplies and water can be made available to those hundreds of
thousands of refugees who need it."
</P>
<P>
In addition to those envoys to be sent to the war-torn region,
a team of White House, State Department and Pentagon officials
will depart for Geneva this week for talks with the United Nations
on managing the delivery of relief supplies to at least 700,000
refugees who have fled their camps in eastern Zaire to escape
hostilities, Burns said

<HEADLINE> US Big Three Auto Makers Seek to Reduce Danger of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. big three auto
makers--Chrysler, Ford and General Motors--are seeking to reduce
the risk of injury deaths among infants, children and short adults
when air bags inflate at up to 200 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990 about 30 children, including infants, have died when
they were struck by passenger-side air bags, which are only now
coming into common use. Safety officials say that the number of
such deaths is likely to rise rapidly, because passenger air bags
are nearly universal on new cars now.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the three big auto makers have asked the
Federal safety authorities for emergency permission to switch to
air bags that inflate more slowly. The slower air bags will be
very similar to the ones used today, but with less of the
explosive propellant that inflates them.
</P>
<P>
There are 22 million vehicles equipped with passenger air bags.
The auto makers said that they would begin installing the slow air
bags within months in cars sold in Canada, where no government
permission is needed.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The 1996 campaign for
presidency is drawing to a close Monday, with President Bill
Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole making stops in a dozen
cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, maintaining his lead over Dole in national polls,
began his final stretch of compaigning through six states in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Dole is continuing his 96-hour campaign trip that has
taken him to quite a few states.
</P>
<P>
The two were running on little sleep. Dole still held out the
hope for a come-from-behind victory, while Clinton was making
efforts to turn out the vote, hoping to win a majority of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was joined by his wife Hillary, Vice-President Al Gore
and his wife, Tipper, in Ohio, according to media reports. They
are headed to Kentucky, Iowa and South Dakota before flying early
Tuesday to Little Rock, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Campaigning through six states, beginning with Arizona, Dole
was accompanied by his wife Elizabeth and his close friend Senator
John McCain.
</P>
<P>
In Phoenix, Arizona, Dole cited one poll that put the race at a
dead beat, claiming that victory is still possible, according to
media reports.
</P>
<P>
Dole was scheduled to spend the early hours of Election Day
tomorrow in Independence, Missouri, before going to his hometown
of Russell, Kansas.
</P>
<P>
Dole's campaign partner Jack Kemp and his wife, Joanne, focused
on vote-rich California, stopping in San Hose, Long Beach, and
Oceanside in the hope to win the state's 54 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, questions remain on the control of the
Republican-controlled Congress.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Left Leader Expresses Pleasure at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Mirjana Markovic, leader of
the Yugoslav United Left (JUL), said Monday that JUL was pleased
with the preliminary results of elections held in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Markovic, wife of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, told
Belgrade Radio channel one that, over the next few months until
parliamentary elections in the Yugoslav republic of Serbia is
held, JUL planned to consolidate its party bodies and organize a
complete network in Yugoslavia's other republic -- Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of 7.6 million eligible voters in
Yugoslavia, comprised of Serbia and Montenegro, cast their ballots
to choose the lower house of the federal parliament, municipal
authorities and Montenegro's republican legislature.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results have shown that the leftist coalition,
formed up by the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia, JUL and New
Democracy, have won more than 60 percent of the 138 seats in the
federal parliament.
</P>
<P>
Markovic said there was an increasing number of young
intellectuals close to JUL today, and that the ideas advocated by
this party were equally important to all people.
</P>
<P>
"The ideas of equality and peace cannot be achieved separately,
because they concern all citizens," Markovic stressed, adding that
during the election campaign, she had separately addressed
individual sections of the populace: workers, pensioners and
women.
</P>
<P>
"The lives of the workers do not depend on memories of the
past, but on material, social and cultural conditions that they
and their children enjoy in the present," she said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing pensioners, or "the most senior citizens" as she
called them, Markovic said "They deserve to receive from society
everything that should allow them to spend the rest of their lives
in peace and dignity."
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the position of women in Yugoslavia, she said
that women, who make up one-half of the population on earth, were
living in conditions unsuited to the times.
</P>
<P>
According to Markovic, radical changes must be made if the
position of women were to be improved and men and women made
completely equal economically, socially, politically, culturally
and humanly.

BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Finland's Nokia Corporation has
brought forth a new type of Chinese-display mobile phone at the
Beijing International Post and Telecommunications Exhibition which
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The new 8110 mobile phone is the first of its kind to display
both the simplified Chinese characters and the original complex
form of Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
Hans Ehrnrooth, director of Nokia Mobile Phone Company (North
Asia), said that the phone displaying the simplified Chinese
characters is designed for users of Singapore and China which is
among the world's top five honeycomb mobile phone markets, while
the one displaying the complex Chinese character is for users of
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that Asia will be the world's biggest market
of honeycomb mobile phones in 1998, and countries speaking Chinese
will have been the largest customer group of mobile phones by then.
</P>
<P>
That is why world-renowned mobile phone producers including
Nokia, Motorola and Ericsson, have all devoted themselves to the
development of Chinese-display mobile phones, experts say.

<P>
KATHMANDU, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Renowned companies of the
United States and India are showing interest in investing major
hydropower projects in Nepal, a senior Nepali official said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on hydropower development here today,
Nepali Minister of State for Water Resources Sarbendra Shukla said
that companies from the two foreign countries have intentions to
invest a total amount of 10 billion US dollars for Arun III
project in east Nepal and Karnali project in west Nepal with an
estimated generating capacity of 10,800 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
However he did not disclose the names of the companies
proposing to invest Nepal's hydropower sector.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers recently reported that Enron corp., an
American power company, has put forth its proposal to invest 9
billion dollars for the two major projects on
build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis to the Nepali government.
</P>
<P>
Several other reputed international entities are also
approaching the government for the promotion of different
hydropower projects in the country, the minister said today.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Nepal currently only harnessed
less than one percent of its more than 83,000 megawatt hydropower
potential.

<HEADLINE> to Mr James Lilley  by Wen Ming  (part one) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The recent relaxation in
Sino-U.S. relations may possibly lead to improved bilateral ties
between the two nations. This is not only in the long-term
interests of both China and the United States and expected by the
two peoples, but also beneficial to peace and stability in the
Asian-Pacific region as well as the world over.
</P>
<P>
So this has been welcomed by the world community. People of
insight ought to conform with the current world trend and make
efforts to push it forward.
</P>
<P>
Some people in the United States who are still indulged in the
way of thinking of the Cold War, however, are trying every means
to slander China and distort its image in the world so as to
undertake their attempt to contain China.
</P>
<P>
Among them is Mr James Lilley, the former U.S. ambassador to
China who recently published an article in "the New York Times."
</P>
<P>
In his article, Lilley said, "Communism's appeal is gone" in
China, and accused the Chinese government of arousing nationalist
xenophobia to fill the "vacuum," in order to counteract the
regional decentralization and to divert attention from
inequalities including the unequal distribution of wealth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking evasively, Lilley mentioned the 1900 "Boxer Rebellion"
one moment and the "Red Guards" during the "Cultural Revolution"
(1966-1976) the next, telling Chinese leaders to learn lessons
from history and to realize the harm nationalism may bring about,
otherwise, "When you ride a tiger, it is hard to dismount."
</P>
<P>
What Lilley said is nothing new. China advocates patriotism,
and that has caused reproach from some people in the West. In
their view, patriotism of the Chinese people is parochial
nationalism, which will result in a catastrophe to the West and,
therefore, should immediately be averted.
</P>
<P>
The weird logic here is much the same as that of the so-called
"China threat."
</P>
<P>
Patriotism has always been a lofty principle and is promoted in
any country throughout the world. Every country is striving for
its own development nowadays, and so long as a country does not
vanish from the earth, patriotism should be promoted and carried
forward.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries which are faced with threat and aggression
by big powers, in particular, should hold higher the banner of
patriotism to resist any pressure from outside.
</P>
<P>
Patriotism has been a fine tradition of the Chinese nation, and
numerous stories of patriotic and heroic deeds have been passed on
from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
At present, patriotism is both a great driving force to
encourage the Chinese people to revitalize the nation and a banner
to unify the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
In the face of attempts to "Westernize" and "split" China by a
few Western countries, led by the U.S., it is highly necessary
that the Chinese people get more closely united and more
vigorously promote patriotism.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary that the Chinese people carry forward the
national spirits of "self-respect, self-confidence and
self-improvement," regard as the greatest honor to devote
themselves to building and safeguarding their socialist
motherland, and view as the biggest disgrace to damage the
interests and dignity of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Why are Lilley and his like so disgusted with China's
patriotism? The reason is simple: the more efforts the Chinese
people are making to promote patriotism, the faster China can
develop, and the more closely the Chinese people are united, the
more likely the attempts of the West to contain China are to fail.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the United States has been pursuing
confrontationist policies toward China and a few people in the
U.S. media have spared no effort to attack and slander China. As a
result, the policies have inevitably evoked strong aversion from
the Chinese people.

<P>
In his article in "the New York Times", Mr. James Lilley
bantered, "In the Chinese view, America blocked China's bid for
the Olympics in 2000, NBC maligned China's beautiful athletes in
Atlanta and Washington has bullied China on trade, human rights
and nuclear proliferation, while encouraging separatists in
Taiwan," so "the United States fits the role of villain well."
</P>
<P>
Can't we say all of these are facts against China? There have
been even more facts that the U.S. threatened and pressured China.
</P>
<P>
In March, the United States, flustered and exasperated, made a
show of its force by flagrantly sending an aircraft carrier to the
waters around Taiwan to interfere into China's internal affairs,
when China conducted military exercises in its territorial
waters. Such a move by the United States terribly hurt the
self-respect of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
It is the very pressure from the United States and other
Western powers that has aroused the Chinese people's patriotic
enthusiasm and strengthened their solidarity in working harder to
make China a powerful and prosperous country.
</P>
<P>
This strong repercussion against the external pressures is a
demonstration of the Chinese people's patriotism rather than the
result of the so-called "instigation" by the Chinese
government. How can it be equal to "nationalist xenophobia?" It is
a natural and normal reflection by a sovereign state, particularly
by people whose motherland was once invaded and enslaved by
imperialists.
</P>
<P>
China is becoming an open, progressive and rational state. The
Chinese nation, thanks to the humiliation suffered from the
imperialist powers for more than one century, knows how to wisely
adhere to patriotism and keep away from blind xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
The public indignation in China was aroused in July when
Japanese right-wing forces deliberately made provocations on the
China's Diaoyu Islands, plotting to make their attempted
occupation of the islands fait accompli.
</P>
<P>
However, the great majority of the Chinese people showed their
rational self-control. They know that patriotism does not mean
simply giving a vent to their grievances but means down-to-earth
work.
</P>
<P>
At present, the top priorities for the Chinese people are to
grasp opportunities to carry forward the policies of reform and
openness, do their own jobs well and turn their noble patriotism
into actual deeds for the prosperity of China. Only a strong China
can prevent and resist external interferences and invasion.
</P>
<P>
Mr. James Lilley appears to be disgusted with nationalist
xenophobia. But everybody knows that in this world there is a
state well-known for its nationalist xenophobia, arrogance and
overbearing insolence.
</P>
<P>
Resorting to its economic and military power, the country
frequently threatens other countries by suspending their
most-favored nation trading status and imposing economic sanctions
and military blockade. The country, through daily propaganda of
the Cold War, meddles in other countries' internal affairs and
imposes its values upon others.
</P>
<P>
It is very strange that Mr. James Lilley failed to utter a
sound about the happenings by his side, but launched wilful
attacks against the Chinese people for their just anti-hegemonist
reactions.
</P>
<P>
Mr. James Lilley, a so-called "China hand," is a representative
who devotedly encourages the United States to poke its nose into
China's Taiwan issue and gives unprincipled protection to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
We may ask James Lilley, "which internationally accepted norm is
your proposition in conformity with?"
</P>
<P>
Doctor Henry Kissinger, former U.S. secretary of state, once
pierced to the truth with one pertinent remark that the greatest
mistake by the United States in its China policy resulted from
Americans' self-opinionated "natural mission." The remark would
have been quite suitable for James Lilley.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Does Not Support Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda today rejected a French
proposal for an international military-humanitarian operation
along the Zairean-Rwandan border to rescue more than one million
refugees in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan Foreign Minister, Anastase Gasana, told Agence
France Presse (AFP) that Rwanda saw little point in such an
operation.
</P>
<P>
"If a force will rescue the refugees who are the prisoners of
the Zairean army and authorities, all the world will support it,"
said Gasana during his visit to Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"But if this is for coming to the rescue of the Zairean army,
or flying to the aid of (Zairean) President Mobutu, it is not
worth the pain," he said.
</P>
<P>
France, supported by Spain, Monday called on its Western allies
and the Organization of African Unity to launch a military
operation along the Zairean-Rwandan border to maintain security
there, and guarantee access of humanitarian aid to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Gasana said that if such a multinational force was dispatched,
"it will be fought with all means by the sub-region."
</P>
<P>
"We distrust intervention forces in Africa under humanitarian
cover. We know the price it cost us in the Turquoise operation
which was a self-claimed humanitarian operation but, in fact, was
an operation to offer cover to those who committed the genocide
and massacres," said the Rwandan foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The "Turquoise" humanitarian operation was undertaken by French
troops in the wake of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
French troops rescued more than one million Rwandan Hutu
refugees from epidemic diseases which broke out among them after
they fled their homes in Rwanda in the summer of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Gasana said that since 1994, Rwanda had asked for an
international force to arrest those responsible for the 1994
genocide among the 1.1 million refugees in eastern Zaire, but to
no avail.
</P>
<P>
He said what was happening today in eastern Zaire was the
result of the ``Turquoise'' operation which transported 1.1
million Rwandan refugees from southwest Rwanda to Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan foreign minister also said there were no Rwandan
soldiers in Zairean territory. Rwanda wanted the refugees to come
home and would guarantee their security.

<HEADLINE> EU Unemployed Should Be Offered New Skills: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Only 7 percent of the European
Union's unemployed are offered new skills, half of the workers
over 55 have left the labor market and 20 percent of the youths
entering the labor market have no recognized qualifications, a EU
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Padraig Flynn, EU commissioner responsible for employment and
social affairs, made the remarks while launching the opening
session of the Employment Week '96 here.
</P>
<P>
"The debate about employment is, in fact, nothing less than the
debate about the modernization of Europe -- both economically and,
above all, socially," said Flynn.
</P>
<P>
He said social policy must be considered as a productive factor
and an integrated approach to work organization needed to be
developed, taking into account the good practices in this area as
well as new skills and new technology.
</P>
<P>
The key role of social policy as a productive factor in
enabling change was not yet fully recognized and there were
serious flaws in the functioning of the employment systems of EU
member states, Flynn said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests Against US Inspection of Fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has lodged a protest with
the United Nations against last month's inspection by U.S. forces
of an Iraqi fishing vessel in its territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
The protest, contained in a letter, was delivered to
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali by Iraqi permanent
representative to the United Nations Nizar Hamdoon, the official
Iraqi news agency (IRNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the agency, the Iraqi diplomat said that on
October 17, 15 U.S. soldiers on a frigate boarded the fishing
vessel Jriw and searched for two hours and a half. The incident
occurred in the Iraqi territorial waters near Al Bakr and Al-Ameeq
oil terminals.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi vessel was ordered to leave its territorial waters
for inspection, it added.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the soldiers found nothing in the vessel
in violation of a ban by the U.N. Security Council resolutions,
the ship was then allowed to return to Iraqi territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon described the U.S. acts as a flagrant violation of
Iraq's sovereignty, saying that the move was a crystal-clear
breach of the rules of the international law, which increases
tension and instability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iraq has the right to demand compensation for
the damage caused to the vessel during the search.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Speaker Welcomes Visit by Chinese NPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Upper House of
the Jordanian Parliament Ahmad Al Lawzi welcomed here today a
forthcoming visit to the kingdom by Qiao Shi, Chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua in the parliament here,
the Senate speaker voiced appreciation of China's open policy
and the great achievements made under the economic reform since
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
He thanked China for its support towards Jordan's foreign
policy of making peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said he appreciated the political support and economic
assistance China has rendered to the Arab state for the past
decades.
</P>
<P>
The speaker cited a saying in Koran that "if you want to
attain knowledge and wisdom, go to China."
</P>
<P>
The Senate speaker praised the Sino-Jordanian relations,
describing them as "very, very important and strategic."
</P>
<P>
He pledged that King Hussein and the Jordanian government, the
parliament and the Jordanian people will "by every means and ways"
to support the strategic, historic, friendly ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
On the Sino-Jordanian economic cooperation and trade exchange,
Lawzi said that the potentials for cooperation between Jordan and
China are great in various fields ranging from tourism, industry
to mining.
</P>
<P>
He said that Beijing and Amman had already cooperated in
the field of phosphate and potash industry.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi's visit would greatly promote the friendly ties at
all levels between the two countries, the two parliaments in
particular, and deepen the mutual understanding and cooperation
not only between China and Jordan, but also between China and the
Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Market Critical to Rural Economy: Chinese Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A complete market system should
be set up step by step to ensure the sustained and stable
development of agriculture and the rural economy, Chinese
Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun said during a tour of east China's
Zhejiang Province from November 1-5.
</P>
<P>
"To develop agriculture and the rural economy under the
conditions of the socialist market economy, the market must be
regarded as the first step in the process, and farmers must be
guided to raise their awareness about the market," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Province has led the country in its market-oriented
rural reforms, Jiang pointed out. To some extent, the vitality of
its rural economy and the farmers' prosperity resulted from the
market, Jiang said, who is also a member of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers have become rich by integrating agriculture with
the processing of rural products, industrial enterprises and
trade. In this way, the masses of farmers have been connected with
the market both at home and abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on local officials to help raise the
competitiveness of farmers under the market economy, saying that
large-scale farms are effectively increasing the efficiency of the
land.
</P>
<P>
The competitiveness of agriculture in the market economy relies
greatly on the use of science and technology to improve
agricultural products, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also urged local agro-technicians to publicize new
technology and new crop varieties.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Make Big Passenger Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- China will join hands with
European and Singaporean companies to produce 100-seat Air Express
jet planes, and will put the first aircraft into operation before
2002, a senior Chinese aviation official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
A joint-venture company will be set up by the three sides to
control the 1.7-billion-US-dollar project, according to Zhu Yuli,
president of the China Aviation Industry Corporation (CAIC).
</P>
<P>
"This is not only the largest international cooperation project
for China's aviation industry, but also the world's first
jet-production project based in Asia," Zhu said at the Zhuhai
International Air Show, which opened today.
</P>
<P>
The company and aircraft assembly line will be located in
China, Zhu noted, adding that the AE100 project proves China is
capable of designing and producing large passenger planes -- not
simply producing parts for foreign aircraft manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China produces Y7 50-seat passenger planes.
</P>
<P>
The CAIC will make up 46 percent of the total investment of the
joint-venture. Aero International Asia, co-established by
Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace and Alenia of Italy,
will contribute 39 percent; and Singapore Technology Private
Ltd. will invest 15 percent, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"The three sides will join hands to develop the market and will
share intellectual property rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
The AE100 project is considered to be the second step in
China's ambitious plan for civil aircraft production.
</P>
<P>
Chinese aircraft manufacturers first produced MD82 passenger
planes for the McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC) in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
"The new project indicates that China will be able to design,
produce and sell advanced passenger planes through cooperation,
and it will help us to produce even more advanced aircraft in the
future," said Tang Xiaoping, director of the International
Cooperation and Trade Bureau under the CAIC.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that by the year 2002, 3,000 passenger planes
will be in demand around the world; of that number, 1,000 will be
for the new 100-seaters.
</P>
<P>
Major aircraft manufacturers in the world, such as Boeing, MDC,
and Airbus, are presently developing new 100-seat planes. China
wants to enter the field of competition through international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most promising air transportation markets in the
world, China is attracting more and more foreign aircraft
makers. The annual increase rate of air transportation volume has
surpassed 20 percent, two times the world average, according to
statistics from the Civil Aviation Administration of China.

<HEADLINE> Cairo Economic Conference Will Succeed: US Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The American ambassador to Egypt
has said the Cairo economic conference has all the elements to
success, foremostly, Egypt's economic reforms that have set the
basis for economic surge and investment attraction.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Edward Walker made the remarks at a press conference
Monday night on the upcoming third Middle East and North Africa
Economic Conference, slated for November 12-14.
</P>
<P>
He said that Washington lends great importance to Egypt's
prospective role as the hub of regional economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo economic conference will be somewhat different from
the preceding Casablanca and Amman summit conferences in that it
will devote to business rather than political speeches, the
U.S. envoy said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign or American investor who chooses Egypt as a future
market, wants to expand his business to all countries in the
Middle East, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
He also strongly linked the realization of peace and stability
in the Middle East with economic development and investment

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Stresses Detection of Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
stressed the importance of searching for water and scientifically
exploiting water resources in northwest China to achieve
sustainable economic growth in the area.
</P>
<P>
The region has abundant water resources, but its insufficient
water supply for agriculture has become a major obstacle for local
economic and social development, Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua
said Monday at a seminar on water exploitation in the area.
</P>
<P>
The search for water must be viewed as a strategy that will
boost the local economy and raise people's living standards, he
said, adding that the exploitation of water must be managed
according to a comprehensive plan in order to avoid waste and
improve ecological circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier pointed out that efforts must be made to
coordinate agricultural and industrial development, as well as the
exploitation of water resources and protection of the ecological
environment.
</P>
<P>
He called on technicians in various departments to rely on
advanced science and technology as they look for underground water
resources. He emphasized that such supplies must not be over-used
or polluted.

<HEADLINE> to Mr James Lilley by Wen Ming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The recent relaxation in
Sino-U.S. relations may possibly lead to improved bilateral ties
between the two nations. This is not only in the long-term
interests of both China and the United States and expected by the
two peoples, but also beneficial to peace and stability in the
Asian-Pacific region as well as the world over.
</P>
<P>
So this has been welcomed by the world community. People of
insight ought to conform with the current world trend and make
efforts to push it forward.
</P>
<P>
Some people in the United States who are still indulged in the
way of thinking of the Cold War, however, are trying every means
to slander China and distort its image in the world so as to
undertake their attempt to contain China.
</P>
<P>
Among them is Mr James Lilley, author of the article in "the
New York Times" and former U.S. ambassador to China.
</P>
<P>
In his article, Lilley said, "Communism's appeal is gone" in
China, and accused the Chinese government of arousing nationalist
xenophobia to fill the "vacuum," in order to counteract the
regional decentralization and to divert attention from
inequalities including the unequal distribution of wealth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking evasively, Lilley mentioned the 1900 "Boxer Rebellion"
one moment and the "Red Guards" during the "Cultural Revolution"
(1966-1976) the next, telling Chinese leaders to learn lessons
from history and to realize the harm nationalism may bring about,
otherwise, "When you ride a tiger, it is hard to dismount."
</P>
<P>
What Lilley said is nothing new. China advocates patriotism,
and that has caused reproach from some people in the West. In
their view, patriotism of the Chinese people is parochial
nationalism, which will result in a catastrophe to the West and,
therefore, should immediately be averted.
</P>
<P>
The weird logic here is much the same as that of the so-called
"China threat."
</P>
<P>
Patriotism has always been a lofty principle and is promoted in
any country throughout the world. Every country is striving for
its own development nowadays, and so long as a country does not
vanish from the earth, patriotism should be promoted and carried
forward.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries which are faced with threat and aggression
by big powers, in particular, should hold higher the banner of
patriotism to resist any pressure from outside.
</P>
<P>
Patriotism has been a fine tradition of the Chinese nation, and
numerous stories of patriotic and heroic deeds have been passed on
from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
At present, patriotism is both a great driving force to
encourage the Chinese people to revitalize the nation and a banner
to unify the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
In the face of attempts to "Westernize" and "split" China by a
few Western countries, led by the U.S., it is highly necessary
that the Chinese people get more closely united and more
vigorously promote patriotism.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary that the Chinese people carry forward the
national spirits of "self-respect, self-confidence and
self-improvement," regard as the greatest honor to devote
themselves to building and safeguarding their socialist
motherland, and view as the biggest disgrace to damage the
interests and dignity of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Why are Lilley and his like so disgusted with China's
patriotism? The reason is simple: the more efforts the Chinese
people are making to promote patriotism, the faster China can
develop, and the more closely the Chinese people are united, the
more likely the attempts of the West to contain China are to fail.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the United States has been pursuing
confrontationist policies toward China and a few people in the
U.S. media have spared no effort to attack and slander China. As a
result, the policies have inevitably evoked strong aversion from
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
In his article published recently in the U.S. newspaper "the
New York Times", Mr. James Lilley bantered, "In the Chinese view,
America blocked China's bid for the Olympics in 2000, NBC maligned
China's beautiful athletes in Atlanta and Washington has bullied
China on trade, human rights and nuclear proliferation, while
encouraging separatists in Taiwan," so "the United States fits the
role of villain well."
</P>
<P>
Can't we say all of these are facts against China? There have
been even more facts that the U.S. threatened and pressured China.
</P>
<P>
In March, the United States, flustered and exasperated, made a
show of its force by flagrantly sending an aircraft carrier to the
waters around Taiwan to interfere into China's internal affairs
when China conducted military exercises in its territorial
waters. Such a move by the United States terribly hurt the
self-respect of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
It is the very pressure from the United States and other
Western powers that has aroused the Chinese people's patriotic
enthusiasm and strengthened their solidarity to work harder to
make China a powerful and prosperous country.
</P>
<P>
This strong repercussion against the external pressures is a
demonstration of the Chinese people's patriotism rather than the
result of the so-called "instigation" by the Chinese
government. How can it be equal to "nationalist xenophobia"? It is
a natural and normal reflection by a sovereign state, particularly
by people whose motherland was once invaded and enslaved by
imperialists.
</P>
<P>
China is becoming an open, progressive and rational state. The
Chinese nation, thanks to the humiliation suffered from the
imperialist powers for more than one century, knows how to wisely
adhere to patriotism and keep away from blind xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
The public indignation in China was aroused in July when
Japanese right-wing forces deliberately made provocations on the
China's Diaoyu Islands, plotting to make their attempted
occupation of the islands fait accompli.
</P>
<P>
However, the great majority of the Chinese people showed their
rational self-control. They know that patriotism does not mean
simply giving a vent to their grievances but means down-to-earth
work.
</P>
<P>
At present, the top priorities for the Chinese people are to
grasp opportunities to carry forward the policies of reform and
openness, to do their own jobs well and to turn noble patriotism
into actual deeds for the prosperity of China. Only a strong China
can fully prevent and resist external interferences and invasion.
</P>
<P>
Mr. James Lilley appears to be disgusted with nationalist
xenophobia. But everybody knows that in this world there is a
state well-known for its nationalist xenophobia, arrogance and
overbearing insolence.
</P>
<P>
Resorting to its economic and military power, the country
frequently threatens other nations by suspending the most-favored
nation trading status and imposing economic sanctions and military
blockade. The country, through daily propaganda of the Cold War,
meddles in other countries' internal affairs and imposes its
values upon others.
</P>
<P>
It is very strange that Mr. James Lilley failed to utter a
sound about the happenings by his side, but launched wilful
attacks against the Chinese people for their just anti-hegemonist
reactions.
</P>
<P>
Mr. James Lilley, a so-called "China hand," is a representative
who devotedly encourages the United States to poke its nose into
China's Taiwan issue and give unprincipled protection to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
We may ask James Lilley, "which internationally accepted norm
is your proposition in conformity with?"
</P>
<P>
Doctor Henry Kissinger, former U.S. secretary of state, once
pierced to the truth with one pertinent remark that the greatest
mistake by the United States in its China policy resulted from
Americans' self-opinionated "natural mission," which is believed
quite suitable for James Lilley.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch 30 Satellites in Next 15 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- China will launch 30 satellites,
using Long March rocket carriers, for other countries over the
next 15 years -- some as soon as in 1997.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference today in south China's Zhuhai Special
Economic Zone, Wang Liheng, vice president of the Aviation
Industries of China (AIC), said China has successfully lifted off
48 man-made satellites, including 38 manufactured in China, for
various countries.
</P>
<P>
They include the Asiasat-1, Asiasat-2, Asia-Pacific 1
Satellite, Apstar 2 satellite, Echostar 1, two Australian
telecommunication satellites, and a piggyback service for an
experimental scientific satellite for Pakistan, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Eight models of Long March rocket carriers have been put into
operation, carrying out 43 launches with a success rate of 87
percent, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
As for the reliability of commercial satellite launching, an
AIC official said this is an industry which requires high
technology and involves great risks. Some developed countries that
have attempted the procedure have experienced failures to certain
extent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese aviation and aerospace industry has built a
complete system for the research, design, production and
experimental use of satellites, he said, adding that the Long
March rocket carriers have attained a high technological level.
</P>
<P>
The retrievable scientific exploration and technological
experiment satellite sent into pre-set orbit by Long March-2 on
October 20 successfully returned to earth at 10:58 yesterday,
after fulfilling its scheduled tasks.
</P>
<P>
Wang said aerospace technology involves a complex engineering
system which is difficult for an individual country to
accomplish. China will enhance technological cooperation with
other countries in this regard, he added.
</P>
<P>
The land satellite co-produced by China and Brazil will soon be
launched. Work on the telecommunication satellite for transmitting
commercial network data, a joint venture involving China, Germany
and France, is near completion, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Cooperation with Latin-American Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- China will spare no efforts to
further its cooperation with Latin-American countries, a senior
Chinese official today told a delegation from the Venezuelan
Movement to Socialism (MTS), led by its chairman Marguez Marin.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the group, Hu Jingtao, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, said that China appreciates
Venezuela's efforts to enhance the unity and cooperation among
developing countries, and to safeguard world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries forged diplomatic relations in 1974,
their bilateral ties have developed smoothly, according to Hu, who
is also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote the development of the ties between the two
countries, Hu said, CPC would like to pursue friendly cooperation
with MTS and other willing parties in Venezuela, on the basis of
the four principles of independence, equality, mutual respect and
mutual non-interference into each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Marguez spoke highly of China's reform and opening drive, and
said that his party values its ties with CPC, and would like to
consolidate the bilateral ties through exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is here at the invitation of the International
Department of the CPC Central Committee.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Heart Surgery Ends Successfully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's heart by-pass operation was completed successfully at
14:00 Moscow time (GMT 11:00) today, his spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky announced.
</P>
<P>
Four Russian surgeons and eight experts performed the
seven-hour operation at the Russian Cardiological Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Professor Renat Ckchurin, head of the center's surgical
department, played the main role in the operation. He performed
similar surgery on the present Russian Prime Minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
Foreign medics joined the team of Russian doctors at 11:00
Moscow time (GMT 08:00) today. Famous U.S. surgeon Michael DeBakey
with his assistant and a group of U.S. and German experts were
present as consultants.
</P>
<P>
Just minutes before the beginning of the operation, Yeltsin
signed a decree temporarily transferring presidential powers,
including control over the so-called nuclear button, to
Chernomyrdin "in accordance with the Russian Constitution."
</P>
<P>
The by-pass operation helps to restore normal blood supply to
the heart muscle. A by-pass of the impaired blood vessel is
created with the help of various vascular transplants. The
impaired vessel is by-passed, usually with a vein removed from a
lower limb.
</P>
<P>
Artificial blood circulation is maintained during the
operation, which is not unique.
</P>
<P>
Every year, up to 400,000 such operations, including about
1,000 in Russia, are performed in the world, experts here said.
</P>
<P>
The by-pass surgery is preventive in character, the experts
said. It averts a heart attack and guarantees another 20 to 30
years of life. If the operation succeeds, the patient can return
to work later and withstand considerable physical and
psychological loads.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that everything will proceed normally," Yeltsin
said in his address to the Russian people before the operation.
</P>
<P>
He said he had no intention of staying in the hospital for a
long time. "I believe that I will soon be working as before --
putting all my strength in my work," he noted.

with Panama, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-Existence, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that CPC is also willing to develop friendly ties with
DRPP, on the basis of the four principles of ties between parties.
</P>
<P>
Doens said that China's economy has developed rapidly -- a
great achievement which has attracted worldwide attention.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Main Opposition Party Further Divided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Laban ng Demokratilong
Pilipino, the biggest opposition party in the Philippines, was
further divided as its party Secretary-General Hernando Perez
resigned here today.
</P>
<P>
Perez announced his severance of party affiliation with the
Laban at a press conference, saying that he "is resigning from the
Laban as secretary-general" and a member of the party.
</P>
<P>
Joining Perez are all the local officials of Batangas province
which Perez is representing in the House of Representatives. These
officials include Batangas Governor Hermilando Mandanas.
</P>
<P>
Perez said he resigned in protest against party chairman
Edgardo Angara, who had promised to protect Laban party-mates but
instead inflicted upon his colleagues irreparable damage and
degradation.
</P>
<P>
Angara ousted Senate president Neptali Gonzales on October 10
and instead installed Secretary General Ernesto Maceda of the
Nationalist People's Party, another main opposition party in the
country.
</P>
<P>
But Angara's move was opposed by his colleagues who charged him
of "betraying" the interests of the Laban, sending the party to
crumble with the immediate resignation of Gonzales from emeritus
presidency and many local officials of the party.
</P>
<P>
Perez said that his resignation was an act of defiance to a
party leadership "who preferred to deliver a position to a
non-party member" as well as an expression of disenchantment to
Angara.

<HEADLINE> More and More Chinese Going Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of Chinese citizens
going overseas has increased rapidly over the past six years, Xu
Ganlu, director of the Exit and Entry Administration of the
Ministry of Public Security, said here today.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to the end of last June, Chinese public security
departments approved nearly 4.3 million citizens for overseas
travels, 4.6 million for visits to Hong Kong and Macao, and
140,000 others to go to Taiwan, Xu said at a national working
conference on the administration of exit and entry.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, China implemented a law on the administration of
exiting and entering the country. That year, the country allowed
80,000 citizens to leave the country to make personal visits.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the number climbed to 970,000; in the first half of
this year alone it reached 710,000.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that in accordance with regulations and laws, China has
implemented a series of measures to allow citizens to come into
and leave the country, in keeping with China's reform and
opening up policies and economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Administration departments have allowed citizens to go on
pleasure trips overseas organized by state-authorized tourism
agencies. They have also canceled the restrictions that affect
citizens who make a return visit to a foreign country; allowed
economic, trade, scientific and technological personnel to travel
abroad for further study and conducting academic exchanges;
permitted Chinese employees of privately-owned and foreign-backed
firms to go abroad; provided helpful conditions for students to go
abroad; encouraged overseas-returned students to work for the
country; and satisfied the demands of citizens in the inland area
to reunite with their families as often as possible.
</P>
<P>
The regulations to approve citizens from the inland area to go
to Taiwan have also been improved.
</P>
<P>
He said the measures have made it much easier for citizens to
travel overseas on private visits, and have vigorously promoted
Sino-overseas exchanges and social development, as well as
safeguarded both citizens' legal rights and interests as well as
the country's interests.
</P>
<P>
The official urged exit and entry administration officials
throughout the country to play an active role in promoting
economic construction and the reform and opening up drive.

<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Chen Muhua, vice chairperson of
China's National People Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said
here today she expects closer parliamentary ties between China and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with a Israeli parliament delegation of the

</P>
<P>
Regarding the Middle East issue, Chen said China is attentive

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Iraq Consider to Renew Trade Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Iraq were considering
a renewal of their 1996 trade protocol, English language daily
Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol, Jordanian exports of goods to Iraq were
worth 150 million U.S. dollars and services 70 million dollars in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Government officials rejected reports in the local press that
the Jordan-Iraq trade volume in 1997 would increase to 280 million
dollars in view of a forthcoming implementation of the U.N.-Iraq
oil deal, which was signed last May to allow Baghdad to export oil
worth 2 billion dollars over a six-month period.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, Jordan reduced its official
trade volume with Iraq to 220 million dollars for 1996 from about
400 million dollars for 1995 after reaching an agreement with
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The move came when Jordan found itself squeezed in its foreign
currency reserves, the officials said,
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Marwan Muasher reiterated Jordan's stands
Monday, saying that the Jordanian step to reduce the trade
volume between Amman and Baghdad was due to "purely economic
reasons."
</P>
<P>
Jordan announced that Iraq has owed the kingdom about 1.2
billion dollars, which have been accumulated since the Iraq-Iran
war broke out in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Iraq supplied the kingdom with oil under an exemption granted
from the U.N. to meet Jordan's daily oil needs.
</P>
<P>
Half of the Iraqi oil was free and half sold at a much lower
price than in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The oil revenues were used to settle the payments of Jordan's
exports to Iraq, but, the officials said the actual cost of the
oil was not sufficient to cover the value of Jordanian exports to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, Muasher said that while the official protocol was
cut down, the government had left it to the private sector to
continue trade with Iraq without official interference.
</P>
<P>
No definite figures were immediately available for exports to
Iraq by the kingdom's private sector, but conservative estimates
claim that they could be worth around 80 million to 100 million
dollars per year.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Break out in Mogadishu, Killing 9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 5 (Xinhua) -- At least nine people were
killed and more than 16 others wounded when heavy fighting
erupted today between the forces of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and
those of Osman Hassan Ali Atto in the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
The fighting which is the heaviest since the October 15 peace
deal in Nairobi by Somalia's main factions has affected the
inhabitants of Madina and Hodon districts of South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Muse Sudi Yalahow, militia leader of Madina district
supporting North Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed,
accused the militiamen of Hussein Aidid of igniting the war.
</P>
<P>
He said the siege on Medina was tightened yesterday by the
militiamen of Hussein Aidid as an early warning sign for today's
fighting. The secretary general of Osman Atto's faction has also
accused Hussein Aidid of beginning the attack.
</P>
<P>
Militiamen of the fighting factions today met on the
frontlines of the former University Compound, the American
Embassy, Digfer hospital and parts of Daynile where the shelling
also reached.
</P>
<P>
The worst affected point was a refugee camp near Ex-Control
where more than three rounds of mortars had landed, killing three
refugees and wounding four others. The shelling forced the
refugees to leave their small huts to hide in the nearby suburb
of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
It was only yesterday when the opposing factions of Mogadishu
nominated four delegates each to further continue the peace
dialogue initiated in Nairobi by Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi.
</P>
<P>
Intellectuals in Mogadishu said the fighting today is a clear
message to the mediators who are trying to bring Osman Atto's
faction to the negotiating table that Hussein Aidid's faction
seems to be avoiding to negotiate with it.
</P>
<P>
The senior Aidid was killed in early August when fighting with
Atto's which split from Aidid's faction.
</P>
<P>
A top lieutenant supporting Hussein Aidid characterized
today's fighting as a minor skirmish, saying this will not affect
what he called the peace process now goingon on in which his
government is leading.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,500 people gathered in
the Hong Kong City Hall today to celebrate the inauguration of the
Association for Celebrating the Handover of Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Nan, director of Xinhua News Agency HK Branch, made a
speech when officiating at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said that the association should actively promote the
concept of "One Country, Two System," the need for a smooth
transition, the bright and prosperous future of Hong Kong, the
dynamism of the place and the confidence that people here have in
the future; so that the atmosphere of the community is harmonious
and joyful in welcoming a new era in the history of Hong Kong as
an integral part of China after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Zhou also urged the association to encourage the participation
of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in organizing a variety
of celebration activities which highlight the love for the
motherland and the sense of belonging to Hong Kong for the
enjoyment of the people of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The association is established by the Preparatory Committee for
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the National
People's Congress to mobilize all sectors of the community to
actively participate in the celebration activities for the
handover of Hong Kong to China, to co-ordinate and carry out
non-governmental celebration activities, as well as to encourage
organizations from all sectors and districts to organize their own
celebration activities.
</P>
<P>
Raymond Wu, chairman of the Executive Committee of the
association, said that there are 130 well-known dignitaries
serving on the Board of Governors, and 83 persons from all sectors
of the community serving as members of the Executive Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said that the association has received more than 1,500
nominations for membership from various NGOs in Hong Kong
including religious bodies, district-based organizations and
professional groups.
</P>
<P>
He said that the funding for the association comes from private
donation. As of early November, more than 60 million HK dollars
(7.69 million US dollars) had been received. All the funds will be
used to support activities which he hopes will provide all
participants with a delightful and long-lasting memory.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Celebration Activities Sub-committee of the SAR
Preparatory Committee from the Chinese mainland, some senior
officials of the Hong Kong government, and some advisers of the
association also attended the ceremony.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Danny Gilman, chairman of
the Israeli Chamber of Commerce, has called on all businessmen to
attend the forthcoming regional economic conference, reported
Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Gilman said that the Casablanca and Amman summit conferences
had given a signal, a message, to the rest of the world,
especially the international business community, that the Middle
East is open to business.
</P>
<P>
"We Israelis and, as business leaders, have the
responsibility to make every effort to transmit a loud and clear
message that, despite everything and politics, business is going
on as usual and the Middle East is open to business," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gilman made the remarks after Agriculture Ministry officials
declared that they would also boycott the Cairo regional
conference scheduled to be held on November 12-14 unless they
receive assurances from Egypt that they are welcome guests.
</P>
<P>
Their decision followed an announcement by Egypt's chamber of
commerce Monday calling on its members to boycott Israel.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Minister of Infrastructure Ariel Sharon announced
that his ministry would boycott the conference.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian Trade Union has decided to boycott
the conference in protest against Israel's closure. The Saudi
government has also called on businessmen not to make business
deals with Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A close ally of Benazir
Bhutto said today that the deposed Pakistani prime minister "was
in high spirits and would soon be meeting the party leaders to
chalk out future strategy".
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen here after meeting with Benazir, Aftab
Sherpao, chief minister of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province
(NWFP), said, "She reacted in a manner as an elected leader should
in such circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Sherpao, who went to the Prime Minister House after meeting
with President Farooq Leghari, said he did not deliver any message
to Benazir.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the deposed prime minister was under
detention, Sherpao said, "She is not under arrest. But I was
given permission to meet her."
</P>
<P>
Nobody is allowed to go into or come out of the Prime Minister
House and the communication with the PM house has been cut off
since the president announced the dissolution of the National
Assembly and dismissal of Benazir's government early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Sherpao however hoped that "now she will be meeting (people)
shortly."
</P>
<P>
After meeting with the deposed prime minister at the Prime
Minister House, Sherpao said the former ruling coalition of
Pakistan Democratic Front would challenge the president's order in
the courts.
</P>
<P>
Sherpao termed the dissolution of the National Assembly as
"unjustified".
</P>
<P>
"There was no need of dissolution of assembly, as the
government was following his (the president) advice in all
matters," said Sherpao, who is a relative of the president and
played an important role in patching up differences between the
president and the prime minister in the past couple of months.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Simplify Procedures for Citizens to Go Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- China plans to simplify
examination and approval procedures for citizens leaving the
country on private visits, in a move to safeguard their rights to
go abroad which are protected by law, a senior official revealed
today.
</P>
<P>
Xu Ganlu, director of the Exit and Entry Administration of the
Ministry of Public Security, said that an interim regulation
concerning the examination and approval system, which was passed
this afternoon at an ongoing national conference on the
administration of exit and entry, is expected to go into effect by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the regulation aims to simplify and consequently
standardize approval procedures for citizens leaving the country
on such trips. This will strengthen the management of the
examination and approval process involved in going abroad, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the regulation stipulates that citizens can get the
application form when they submit an identity card, residence
booklet and a certificate which justifies why they are leaving.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also unifies travel time limits and fee
standards, as well as the requirements for approval.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that with the deepening of China's reform, China's
entrepreneurs, technicians and people from all walks of life will
be increasingly involved in global cooperation and competition,
and that the general public is becoming more and more interested
in sightseeing, studying abroad and visiting their relatives
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The director pointed out that it is imperative for China to
simplify approval procedures, improve efficiency, and move closer
to international practices in this area so that the country can
become more integrated with the rest of the world.

<HEADLINE> India's Fiscal Deficit to Be at 5 Percent of GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram today expressed confidence that the country's fiscal
deficit would be pegged at five percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Opening the three-day economic editors conference here, the
finance minister gave a comparative analysis of the anticipated
revenue and expenditure in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that revenue was 37.9 percent of the budget estimates
so far and total expenditure was 38.7 percent of the estimates,
lower than last year's level of 40.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Though revenue was slightly lower than last year, the
expenditure was also much lower. If there were overruns on one
account, then they were made up with extra collections in revenue,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister today also promised timely decisions by
the government to contain inflation and maintain price stability
while putting the country's economy on to a high trajectory.
</P>
<P>
"It is of paramount importance for the government and the
Reserve Bank of India to maintain price stability and keep the
money supply a shade below 16 percent," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rates of 6 to 7 percent must be expected as they are
consistent with the growth pattern, he said, adding that prices
were under pressure because of the petroleum price hike and a rise
in wheat prices due to a fall in production.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil import bill has risen to 9 billion US dollars
from original estimate of 7.8 billion for the year 1996-97.

<P>
BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- An official from the China
Charity Federation (CCF) said today a two-year rehabilitation
project for disabled orphans will be completed in 1997, providing
free correction surgery for the country's 1,600 orphans who have
harelips and cleft palates.
</P>
<P>
"This is only part of the rehabilitation project under CCF's
orphan support program, " CCF deputy secretary-general Yang Tuan
told Xinhua on the eve of the coming national working conference
on charity.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 1998, Yang said, the federation plans to provide
free correction surgery for more orphans who suffer the disability
in limps and other parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
To date, the project, which started in 1995, have covered 12
provinces and autonomous regions in western and central China, and
some 800 disabled orphans have received the surgery or have been
under treatment.
</P>
<P>
A report from the federation show that China has 100,000
disabled orphans, with 20,000 living in various kinds of social
welfare houses and some 1,600 suffering from harelips and cleft
palates.
</P>
<P>
"China's charity is still in its fledging stage," Yang
said. But, she stressed, the society has undergone a great change
since the country introduced the policy of reforms and opening
up. The original social welfare provided by the governments no
longer meets the demand of a socialist market economy.

CAIRO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian-Egyptian summit
Monday renewed Arab hopes for peace and reconciliation, said a
senior Lebanese legislator here today.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held talks with Syrian
President Hafez al- Assad on the latest developments in the
Middle East peace process during a lightening visit to Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Major General Samy Khatib, head of the Defense and Security
Committee at the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies made the remarks in
an interview with Sawt al Arab Radio.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese legislator said Syria and Lebanon are committed
to a just and comprehensive peace based on the land-for-peace
formula established during the Madrid conference in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Khatib also ruled out the possibility of separating the Syrian
track from the Lebanese one. "The concomitance of the two tracks
serves Arab interests," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. to play the role of a full partner in the
peace process, adding that Lebanon welcomes such a role.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has insisted on
maintaining Israeli sovereignty of the Golan Heights which was
captured from Syria in 1967 Mideast War and suggested to solve
the Lebanon issue first.
</P>
<P>
In Syria, Mubarak criticized Netanyahu's government for
abandoning the basis on which the peace process was founded,
mainly the exchange of the occupied Arab lands for peace with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak highlighted the necessity of resuming peace talks on
all tracks, saying the land-for-peace principle is indispensable
and "the more land is returned, the more chances there are for
progress in the peace talks."

Metropolitan Magistrate Prem Kumar, who directed him to surrender
before the court on or before November 14.
</P>

1986-87.

<P>
With the social and economic reforms, Yang said, as the social
wealth has been increased in a big margin and disparities of
residents' incomes have become larger.
</P>
<P>
According official reports, China has now some 65 million
people who have not adequate food and clothing, about 8.1 million
elderly who live alone, and 50 million disabled people.
</P>
<P>
In this case, charity organizations as an associated force for
the governments have a lot of work to do, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
China Charity Federation is a non-profit, non-governmental
organization, which was founded in 1994. Since the first charity
society for the elderly was founded in Pudong of Shanghai in 1993,
China has, so far, a total more than 100 charity organizations,
and 56 of them are members of the federation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it has over 200,000 local societies, including
1,800 welfare foundations and association, according to Yang, who
have been engaged in enterprise management and worked with the
State Commission for Restructuring the Economy for many years.
</P>
<P>
"With the social and economic development, these new 'cells'
will further propagate and play an important role in promoting the
country's reforms, opening up, economic construction, and ethical
and cultural progress," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, China's charity still faces a lot of difficulties in
terms of policy, law and funds, she added. Charity organizations
in the country have now collected a total donations of some 300
million yuan, while the federation has only about 60 million yuan,
some of which is collected as fund for charity founding. As a
result, there is a limited charity money that can be used to power
the charity projects.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Yang called for more support to China's
charity from domestic and overseas organizations, companies and
individuals.

<HEADLINE> Create New Situation in Promoting Ethical Progress: Ding Guangen (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ding said that since China initiated the policy of reform and
opening up 18 years ago, the CPC has formed the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the basic line of
taking economic construction as the central task, and
re-established the ideological line of emancipating the mind and
seeking truth from facts.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that immediately after the policy of the reform and
opening up was initiated, the then CPC Central Committee, headed
by Deng Xiaoping, stressed the strategic principle of placing
equal emphasis on material and ethical progress, and guided the
whole Party in doing work in various aspects of ethical and
cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Since the Fourth Plenum of the 13th CPC Central Committee, the
CPC Central Committee, headed by General Secretary Jiang Zemin,
has stepped up the promotion of ethical and cultural progress from
all aspects and made "positive and effective" efforts.
</P>
<P>
Ding said that the CPC Central Committee has taken a series of
effective measures to step up ethical progress, and has scored
great successes, thus helping to promote the reform, development
and stability.
</P>
<P>
He called attention to the problems in social cultural life,
which "merit our close attention."
</P>
<P>
According to Ding, the pursuance of the policy of the reform
and opening up, and the creation of a market economy have injected
"enormous vigor" into China's economic construction and social
development, and are helping promote ethical progress.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Import Skilled Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will use 1,500
skilled foreign workers from Southeast Asian countries in 1997 for
the construction of an airport in northern South Korea, officials
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Construction and Transportation Ministry
said the import of skilled foreign workers was designed to prevent
a possible deadlock in the construction of the Inchon
International Airport in Kyonggi Province caused by the shortage
of skilled manpower.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that skilled foreign workers are to be
brought into South Korea for construction work by either a private
firm or a public agency.
</P>
<P>
So far, South Korea has been importing unskilled foreign
workers under the name of "industrial trainee workers."
</P>
<P>
The skilled foreign workers, including carpenters, plasterers,
electricians and plumbers, will mainly come from Thailand,
Indonesia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
South Korea also plans to bring in 3,000 more skilled foreign
laborers in 1998 and some 2,000 in 1999, for the construction of
the airport, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> More Air Safety Investigators Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Transport Ministry is
negotiating for funds to increase its air safety investigation
team in order to add computerized flight systems specialists,
ministry officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The request has been made to the Finance Ministry for
additional appropriation in the fiscal 1997 state budget to hire
three more investigators for the Aircraft Accident Investigation
Committee, the officials said, adding that lessons from the
investigation of the 1994 crash of a Taiwan airliner at Nagoya
airport prompted the request.
</P>
<P>
It took a lengthy two years and three months to complete an
investigation into the crash of a China Airlines (CAL) Airbus
A300-600R because it took time for the ministry to investigate
automated flight-control systems, they said.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 18 people on the ministry's Aircraft
Accident Investigation Committee. However, there are no
investigators specializing in aircraft computer systems.
</P>
<P>
In order to investigate the CAL crash, the committee had to
seek the cooperation of domestic airline companies to examine
automated flight control systems, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is seeking two investigators for
computer-controlled flight systems and one person who will
specialize in investigating crashes involving international
carriers, they said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Threatens to Arrest Kaunda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Former President Kenneth Kaunda
will soon be arrested for instigating collection of voters cards,
Home Affairs Minister Chitalu Sampa said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The "Times of Zambia" newspaper today quoted the minister as
saying that the government is waiting for an opportune time
before descending on Kaunda, leader of the biggest opposition
United National Independence Party (UNIP).
</P>
<P>
The move is to be taken against what the minister called
illegal cards collection to disrupt the presidential and
parliamentary elections to be held late this month.
</P>
<P>
"Kaunda will be arrested at an opportune time. We can not
tolerate him anymore. We are still consulting and when time comes
we shall just pounce on him," Sampa said.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Kaunda's special aide for press and public relations
Muhabi Lungu challenged the government to do so by promising that
the party would continue collecting the voters cards.
</P>
<P>
"We are not buying these cards but people are surrendering the
cards voluntarily to us," the aide said.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP and several other opposition parties have decided to
boycott the elections in protest against the government
insistence that the elections be held under the new constitution,
which in fact bars Kaunda from contesting the presidency because
his parents are foreign immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Inflation Rate Rises Slightly in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' year-on-year
inflation rate for October inched up slightly to 4.7 percent from
4.4 percent in September, but well below the 5.1 percent target
set with the International Monetary Fund, official figures showed
today.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the country's inflation rate fell below
the IMF target under the Extended Fund Facility program. In
September, inflation rate was 0.3 percentage points lower than the
4.7 percent target.
</P>
<P>
The figures released by the National Statistics Office showed
the slight increase in the October inflation rate was a result of
price hikes for fuel, light and water from the level a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Price index for fuel, light and water rose to 7.4 percent in
October from the 6.4 percent a year earlier due to the price rise
in liquefied petroleum gas, kerosene, firewood and higher
electricity rates.
</P>
<P>
Among the commodity groups, only clothing registered a slowdown
from 3.6 percent in September to 3.5 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the same period last year, the October inflation
rate decreased by 6.3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The average inflation rate for the first 10 months of the year
stood at 9.2 percent, still above the 7.5 percent to 8.7 percent
target set by the government for the year.
</P>
<P>
But Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Gabriel Singson
said the October inflation rate is expected to help the government
attain its 8.5 percent target for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
If the government meets the 5 percent inflation target for
November and the 8.5 percent for December, the governor said, the
average inflation "for the whole year would hit 8.6 percent, well
within the 8.7 percent adjusted target for the year."
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year inflation rate measures the increase in the
prices of major commodity groups being monitored by the statistics
office in computing the consumer price index this year against the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Low inflation rate is one of the conditions the IMF set for the
Philippines to get free from the world's leading financial body's
supervision, which earlier reports said could end by June next
year.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin Spokesman Briefs on Yeltsin's Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's heart by-pass operation, which is being performed in
Moscow by Russian doctors, is to last from six to eight hours, his
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said today.
</P>
<P>
Before the operation, which began at 07:00 (0400 GMT) Tuesday
morning at the city's Cardiology Research Center, Yeltsin
temporarily transferred his presidential powers including control
over the so-called nuclear button to Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
According to Yastrzhembsky at a news briefing, as "the patient
had been fully prepared for surgery," the operation was set for
today.
</P>
<P>
The president, who had spent the night before surgery in the
Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow, was "vigorous and making
jokes," before the operation, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin continued to work until the very last
minute: he signed three decrees before he was taken into the
operation room, Yastrzhembsky added.
</P>
<P>
Members of the president's family are present in the Cardiology
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member surgery team is led by Professor Renat Akchurin,
the head of the Cardiology Research Center's surgery department,
who had performed a similar operation on Prime Minister
Chernomyrdin eight years ago, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign experts are to join the Russian team at 11:00 (0800
GMT). Famous U.S. heart surgeon Michael DeBakey with his assistant
as well as a group of U.S. and German specialists will be present
as consultants, Yastrzhembsky added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran will have good ties with
Pakistan whoever comes in power there, Deputy Foreign Minister
Abbas Maleki said at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
Maleki was making comments on the Tuesday dismissal by
Pakistan President Farooq Ahmed Leghari of Benazir Bhutto's
government on charges of corruption and bad performance.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations with Pakistan are very wide and comprehensive
and are not limited to this or that government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran regarded the collapse of Bhutto's government as a
"domestic issue," he said, adding "We are waiting for the
formation of the new (Pakistani) government and who would head
it."
</P>
<P>
Islamic Guidance Minister Mustafa Mirsalem will be soon going
to Pakistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Maleki also mentioned the differences Tehran has with Bhutto's
government on Afghanistan since two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations between Iran and Pakistan got cool
over the Afghan issue, especially in the wake of the recent
takeover of Kabul by the Tabilan backed by Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Investments Abroad Reach 8 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's overseas
investments totaled 21.2 billion ringgit (about 8.48 billion US
dollars) by the end of August this year, according to
Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry Hishamuddin Tun Hussein Onn today.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's investments are concentrated in Singapore, Hong
Kong, Britain, the United States and Australia in the areas of
mattress making, hotel and tourism, vegetable oil refining, rubber
goods manufacturing, property development, highway construction,
telecommunications and car component production, he said in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Most of the overseas investments, approved by the National
Bank, were financed by outside loans, he said, adding such
investments hence would not result in the immediate outflow of
funds and affect the country's balance of payment position.
</P>
<P>
Rather, he said, these overseas investments in the long run
would benefit Malaysia in the form of profit remittance, inflow of
dividends and foreign exchange, to help improve the balance of
payments in future years.
</P>
<P>
Apart from these benefits, he said, the country's overseas
investments would also help increase the export of Malaysian goods
and services, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the government had identified several problems
faced by Malaysian investors overseas, which included the absence
of laws to protect them.

</P>
<P>
A special function was held here today to see off the trial
trade caravan, which was attended by diplomats from China,

countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that such exchanges of trade caravans
would further cement the existing bilateral relations and
friendship among these countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that using KKH as main route for trade and business
could be beneficial to the respective countries in general and
particular for the welfare and economic prosperity of the people.
</P>
<P>
He said that the opening of KKH would not only benefit to
importers and exporters of the four countries but also to the
business communities in other areas who are engaged in services
like hotels and motels.
</P>
<P>
KKH, a 1000-kilometer-long road running through the mountainous
northern area of Pakistan, was built by Chinese workers from 1966

SEOUL, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean shipbuilding
industry is showing signs of a rapid recovery, with overseas
orders received in October reaching 763,800 gross tons for a total
of 10 ships, up 200,000 gross tons from August, industry sources
said today.
</P>
<P>
South Korea received 3.77 million gross tons of shipbuilding
orders in the first 10 months of this year, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
The country's shipbuilding industry sagged for the first five
months of the year with orders totaling less than half of what
were received during the same period last year, but it started to
inch up in June and continued to gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan, a major rival to South Korea in the sector,
garnered 8.77 million gross tons of overseas orders in the first
nine months of this year, far outperforming South Korea.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is the second largest shipbuilding country in the
world, following Japan, with the annual capacity of 8.5 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country received orders for 194 ships with 7.13

<HEADLINE> Create New Situation in Promoting Ethical Progress: Ding Guangen (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But they have also caused various problems to crop up, Ding
noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of stepping up education, perfecting
the legal system, and solving all kinds of problems.
</P>
<P>
He said, "While making a greater success of material progress,
we must take effective measures to give ethical and cultural
progress a more prominent position."
</P>
<P>
This is crucial to the realization of China's cross-century
blueprint and the prosperity of the country's socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China must withstand the pressure applied by
Western capitalist countries to "westernize" and "split" it,
resist the penetration of decadent cultures, oppose bourgeois
liberalization, and promote ethical progress that focuses on
economic construction, adheres to the four cardinal principles
(adherence to the socialist road, to the people's democratic
dictatorship, to leadership by the CPC, and to Marxism-Leninism
and Mao Zedong Thought), and uphold the reform and opening up
policies.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a socialist market economic system has
posed a higher requirement for ethical progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Promoting ethical progress in the condition of a socialist
market economy requires exploration and practice for a long time.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to use Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics as the fundamental
guideline, and apply his ideas on ethical progress to practice.
</P>
<P>
Deng's ideas on ethical progress reflects the requirement of
the times and the wish of the people, and constitutes a great
contribution to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the Sixth Plenum of the 14th CPC Central
Committee, General Secretary Jiang Zemin urged the whole society
to carry forward the central theme of patriotism, collectivism and
socialism, and to persist in arming the people with scientific
theory, guiding them with correct public opinions, training them
with lofty ideals and encouraging them with outstanding works,
Ding said.

<P>
Efforts should be made to motivate the Chinese nation, in a new
attitude, to achieve the objectives set for the 21st century, Ding
said.
</P>
<P>
The sixth plenum of the fourteenth Party central committee
featured a continuity of the fifth plenum, defining the programs
of the national economy and social development for the next five
to 15 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
It also exemplified the requirements of the fundamental tasks
of cultivating people with lofty ideals, a good education, moral
integrity and a strong sense of discipline, and working hard to
solve the urgent problems the broad masses of people are concerned
about, Ding said, adding that the latest plenum also defined the
general task of promoting ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
It is a combination of a long-term program and tasks in the
near future, for the country's promotion of ethical and cultural
progress, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
The objectives defined by the sixth plenum include both the
main aspects of promoting ethical and cultural progress, and the
prominent issues the nation is most concerned about, which need
dealing with earnestly, he said.
</P>
<P>
These objectives not only conform with the country's reality,
but also set up higher standards that require greater efforts to
achieve. They both show the people the prospect for promoting
ethical and cultural progress, and indicate that it takes time in
different stages to achieve the goal, he said.

<HEADLINE> Create New Situation in Promoting Ethical Progress: Ding Guangen(6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some 50 years ago, late chairman Mao Zedong published the
article "Serving the People." Thanks to the Party's efforts, the
idea of serving the people has found its roots deeply in the
hearts of the broad masses of people, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
Today, he said, the country's reforms, opening up and
development of a socialist market economy add new contents to the
concept of serving the people, and there is an urgent need for
spreading the idea of serving the people across the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that "serving the people" exemplifies the
correct world outlook, outlook of life and value which have been
carried on by the Party for a long time, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In our society, Ding said, whether an individual's social
status, ability and rank are high or low, he or she should be able
to practice the ethics of serving the people.
</P>
<P>
In the situation of developing a socialist market economy,
where people enjoy their legal rights and interests, a better
service should be provided among people, and attention should be
called for promoting the ethics of serving the people, he added.
</P>
<P>
While attention is given to education, legislation should also
be enhanced, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
To form a better social order and a better order of a market
economy, and to overcome the negative influences of corruption, it
is imperative to carry forward the party's fine working style and
to adhere to its political advantage, and close attention must be
paid to education, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that political work can only be strengthened but
not weakened.
</P>
<P>
Only when self-discipline, discipline, initiation, prohibition,
and restriction are integrated into one, can it help cultivate
good habits, curb uncivilized behavior, and form a good social
mood that encourages the good and discourages the bad, Ding said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Labor Force, Salaries on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The labor force in Hong Kong
increased from 2.8 million in 1986 to 3.2 million this year,
despite a drop in the overall labor force participation rate from
66 to 63 percent over the same period, according to the results of
the 1996 Population By-Census.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on the by-census results, Commissioner
for Census and Statistics Frederick Ho Wing-Huen said that about
30 percent of the working population were managers,
administrators, professionals and associate professionals.
</P>
<P>
Ho said workers in elementary occupations such as cleaners,
messengers, watchmen and freight handlers made up one-fifth of the
working population.
</P>
<P>
He said the distribution of the working population by
industrial sector has also changed significantly.
</P>
<P>
Wholesale, retail and external trades, restaurants and hotels
became the largest sector employing one quarter of the working
population, followed by "community, social and personal services,"
which employed about one-fifth of the working population.
</P>
<P>
The median income from main employment of the working
population was 9,500 HK dollars this year, an increase of 269
percent during the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Housing conditions have improved significantly during the last
decade and some 3.1 million persons, or almost half of the
population, lived in public housing, including public rental
housing and subsidized sale flats.
</P>
<P>
Another 2.9 million lived in private permanent housing and
about 0.12 million persons lived in temporary housing.
</P>
<P>
The median income of domestic households this year was 17,500
HK dollars, an increase of 239 percent over that a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
The resident population of Hong Kong in March 1996 was 6.218
million, an increase of 722,000 or some 13 percent over that 10
years ago,
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate of the population averaged 1.8 percent
in the period between 1991 and 1996, but only 0.6 percent in the
period between 1986 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
The population became older during the last 10 years with the
median age rising from 29 to 34, which is attributable to
mortality improvement and the continuously low fertility rate.
</P>
<P>
The sex ratio, namely the number of males per 1,000 females,
dropped from 1,057 in 1986 to 1000 in 1996.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Soldiers Kill Two DPRK Armed People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean army killed two
armed persons of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK),
presumed to be among the three DPRK "submarine infiltrators" still
at large, in the country's northern province of Kangwon today, the
Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) announced here.
</P>
<P>
During the shootout, three South Korean soldiers were killed by
hand grenades thrown by the DPRK persons, the JCS added.
</P>
<P>
According to the South Korean authorities, a group of 26 armed
DPRK people "infiltrated" into the country's Kangwon Province from
a grounded submarine in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) on September
18.
</P>
<P>
In an ensuing manhunt earlier, 22 DPRK "infiltrators" were
killed or found dead, one was captured alive and three were
believed to be still at large.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK said that the submarine, while on a training mission,
drifted after having an engine trouble and hitting a rock in the
sea.
</P>
<P>
However, Seoul claimed that the case of the intrusion was not
an "inadvertent incident that occurred during routine training" as
Pyongyang said, but was a "carefully premediated act of
provocation."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has threatened to take retaliatory steps against South
Korea for the killing of DPRK people who "landed ashore in South
Korea due to the engine trouble of the submarine."
</P>
<P>
The South Korean military authorities today asked Ri Kwang-su,
the only captive of the DPRK's "submarine infiltrators", to go to
the scene of the shootout to identify whether the two dead persons
are among the three still at large, the JCS said.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows HK Salary Gradually Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A survey published here on
Tuesday showed that salary increases have been gradually falling
in Hong Kong since 1989 following a downward trend of the
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management (IHRM)
today announced the results of the 1996 Pay Trend Survey, which
covers 113 prominent Hong Kong companies and more than 130,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
The survey measures the pay increases awarded between January
and October 1996 and predictions for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Also published was a Pay Level Survey showing actual the
average salaries and starting rates for a large number of typical
jobs ranging from professional engineering to junior
administration jobs.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, total pay rises were 1.6 percent less than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The results of the 1996 Pay Trend Survey showed a weighted
average increase of 8.5 percent amongst the 113 participating
companies," said Survey Committee Chairman Patrick Maule.
</P>
<P>
"This means that 1996 provided real increases of about 2.5
percent given an average inflation of six percent for the year," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Predictions for 1997 increases show a continuing decline," he
added.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the companies that have their next salary
reviews in January 1997 predicted a lower increase in 1997, among
which one-third will have a decrease of more than two percent.
The most common predictions are within the range of six to eight
percent.

<HEADLINE> Creating New Situation in Promoting Ethical Progress: Ding Guangen ( 7 ) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is the important task of ethical progress to strengthen
cultural advancement, strive to create more and better cultural
works and meet the increasing demand of the people for ethical
enhancement, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he continued, the plenary session put forward
clear requirements in the fields of literature and arts, press and
publications, philosophy and social sciences.
</P>
<P>
First of all, the Party's principle and policy on cultural work
must be maintained to ensure the right direction of the socialist
culture, Ding stated.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the central theme must be upheld, as it
represents the spirit of our time and reflects the fine thinking
and feelings of mankind.
</P>
<P>
A developing society should have an advancing spirit and
positive mainstream, Ding said, adding that culture should provide
the spiritual impetus for social progress, and writers and artists
should create refined works to reflect this spirit.
</P>
<P>
To reflect the central theme of the times, importance should be
attached to diversity, as the social life is rich and colorful,
and the people's ethical demands are also diverse and multi-level,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Ding stressed that the central-theme work should be of high
standard, both in content and in form, and the diversified ones
should be healthy and harmless. A firm fight should be waged
against harmful works, he explained.
</P>
<P>
To implement the Party's cultural work policy, he went on, the
guidance for socialist ideology and thoughts should be
strengthened. He said cultural workers are encouraged to go deep
into the masses, and their lives, have the right thoughts,
seriously consider the social effects of their works, and present
the best spiritual food for the people, Ding said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ding noted that the difference between academic and political
questions should be clear, and people should maintain a clear-cut
attitude on political orientation and major principles.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, a "refined works" strategy should be implemented to
help bring about the overall prosperity for the cultural course,
Ding said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that refined works reflect the country's cultural
development level and represent the orientation of the cultural
prosperity, as the impact of one refined piece surpasses that of a
dozen or hundred more ordinary works.
</P>
<P>
Ding said the requirement is to create a lot more refined
works, which well combine ideology and artistic forms, have strong
appeal, and are well received by the masses.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, attention should be paid to both cultural prosperity
and better management to further promote the healthy development
of the cultural course, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening management on spiritual production and the
cultural market is the guarantee for a prosperous and smooth
development of the cultural course, Ding said, adding it is also
an important experience for positive progress in recent years in
propaganda, ideological and cultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
He urged the further deepening of cultural system
restructuring, and help to perfect the cultural market in a bid to
make healthy works serve as the mainstream of the market.
</P>
<P>
Ding insisted that ethical promotion should pay more attention
to its continuity and fight against formalism.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Premier Leaves to Attend Summit on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi left here this morning for Nairobi, Kenya to attend
a regional summit convened to consult on the grave situation in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said the summit
called by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi would seek lasting
solutions to end fighting in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He said the condition of the Rwandan refugees in refugees
camps in eastern Zaire and the future of the former Rwandan Hutu
army would be among the major issues to be discussed at the
summit.
</P>
<P>
More than half a million minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus
were killed in 1994 in Rwanda by the then Rwandan troops who fled
to eastern Zaire after being defeated along with over one million
Rwandan refugees some of whom were accused of taking part in the
genocide.
</P>
<P>
Tutsi rebels have been fighting in eastern Zaire since last
week against Zairean troops with the refugees caught in between.
Zaire accuses neighboring Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda of backing
the rebels, and the summit is intended to mediate for a settled
solution to the issues.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that Secretary General of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim also left for Nairobi on
the same plane to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Tanzania, Cameroun, Uganda, Rwanda and
Eritrea will take part in the summit to tackle the crisis in
eastern Zaire. Zaire said it would send its Premier to attend.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Police Seize 130 Kilograms of Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese police seized 130
kilograms of cocaine and arrested 14 persons, most of whom were
of Colombian, Venezuelan and Sierra Leonean nationalities, local
As-Safir daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the cocaine, the biggest haul of drug seized by
the police since 1990, was worth an estimated 8 million
U.S. dollars at black market price.
</P>
<P>
The story started when the police detained a person carrying
200 grams of cocaine in the Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Interrogations led to the arrest of a Colombian, who
acknowledged that he bought 130 kilograms of pure cocaine in
Colombia and shipped it to Beirut via Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
He confessed that the cocaine hidden in a container fully
loaded with building materials was transported from the Beirut
Port to the northern coastal town of Batroun where 50 kilograms
of the cocaine was distributed to drug merchants all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
With the clues in hand, the police seized the 50 kilograms of
cocaine in Beirut, northern Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley, and the
rest 80 kilograms in Batroun, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Investigations were still going on with the 14 traders of the
cocaine, the report noted.

<HEADLINE> Creating New Situation in Promoting Ethical Progress: Ding Guangen ( 9 ) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ding said the Party's plenum proposed three major activities
among the masses for ethical progress: to create more civilized
cities, townships and industries.
</P>
<P>
These activities should be associated with the solution of
practical problems that the general public care about, and the
promotion of economic development and social progress, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ding called for continuity of these activities, and for
practical effects, saying he is against any form of formalism.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the crucial issue of ethical progress is
leadership of all Party committees, and the model effect of all
Party members.
</P>
<P>
Ding urged all Party committees to have unified leadership for
ethical progress, and well integrate it with material progress.
</P>
<P>
He asked to further strengthen the Party's leadership in the
propaganda and cultural departments, and firmly control the press
within the Party's hands.
</P>
<P>
It is of decisive importance for the Party to take the lead in
promoting ethical progress, improve its working style, and give
full play to all the Party members in the drive, Ding stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ding said more input should be given for the ethical progress
through various channels and in various forms, and the existing
cultural facilities should be given full play.
</P>
<P>
The high-ranking Party official noted that it is a good chance
for the whole Party and all of society to give a bigger impetus to
the ethical progress and open a new page, he said.
</P>
<P>
All the people should, under the leadership of the Party
Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, uphold the banner
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and do the
best job for ethical and material progress, in a bid to greet the
Party's 15th national congress in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Step Up Anti-Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is to step up its fight
against corruption through amendments to the criminal law and the
creation of a special anti-corruption committee with wide ranging
powers, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the National Assembly is to define specific forms of
corruption, some of which will carry death penalty.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendments include definitions of what is a gift,
an offer or acceptance of a bribe and what is illegally obtained
property.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Minister of Justice Nguyen Dinh Loc as saying
that amendments to the criminal law covering corruption will
include punishment, and the most serious case will be dealt with
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the existing system of procurators,
police and courts will be beefed up, while a new body will be
created in the fight against the corruption.
</P>
<P>
The new body, to be named the National Anti-Corruption
Committee, will be given much freedom to operate independently.
</P>
<P>
The current Criminal Law contained only a few references to
corruption while there are actually many forms of corruption.
</P>
<P>
The amendments to be considered by the National Assembly
include a separate chapter on corruption as well as the
punishments, fines, losses compensation, and property inventory
for confiscation, according to the minister.

<HEADLINE> Asian Economic Growth Projected at 7.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite a marginal decline, the
Asian economy is expected to grow by 7.3 percent in 1996 and 1997,
thus remaining the world's fastest growth region, economists of
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) predicted here today.
</P>
<P>
In a report presented to the Ninth Workshop on Asian Economic
Outlook for discussion, ADB economists Dilip K. Das and Charissa
N. Castillo said that the average growth rate for the developing
Asian region is expected to decline marginally in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"From 8.3 percent in 1994, the growth rate declined to 7.9
percent in 1995, and is likely to fall further to 7.3 percent in
1996," they said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the average growth rate is projected at 7.3 percent,
the same level as in 1996, which suggests that the region has
reached, at least temporarily, a plateau in its growth process,
the economists said.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the deceleration, Asia's economic growth is still
the world's fastest. With growth rates of more than 7 percent per
annum predicted for 1996 and 1997, Asia is far ahead of the other
regions in the international economy," they said.
</P>
<P>
"Periods of cooling off, even cyclical slowdowns, are normal,
and to be taken in stride," the economists added.
</P>
<P>
The economists said that the marginal decline in the growth
rate in 1996 can be attributed largely to the current deceleration
in export growth, which appears to have afflicted several Asian
economies, including Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia
and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The demand-side in the world trade cycle of electronics has
influenced the export performance of ADB members, and the global
slump in 1996 in electronics, semiconductors, and computer-related
products has largely been attributed to the inventory overhang in
the beginning of 1996, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, judging by the recent stabilization of
orders and the rise in the book-to-bill ratio, the dramatic
inventory correction in these industries that began in early 1996
seems to be coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
Based on recent economic performance in both the external and
domestic sectors, the economists predicted that the economic
growth in Southeast Asia is forecast to decline from 8.1 percent
in 1995 to 7.3 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand are expected to experience
slower growth as a result of sluggish export growth, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is expected to register a growth rate of 5.5
percent in 1996 and 6 percent in 1997, while Vietnam will continue
on its robust economic growth path, the economists said.
</P>
<P>
In South Asia, they said, growth this year will generally be
higher, though Sri Lanka is expected to record a somewhat slower
growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) than that achieved
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
China's economic growth will continue to be robust, at 9-10
percent, in the next two years largely on account of a robust
growth in domestic consumption, the economists said.
</P>
<P>
They also said that inflationary pressures in developing Asia
have declined in the recent past and the downward trend is
expected to prevail in the next two years, as global prices are
rising less rapidly.
</P>
<P>
But due to the deceleration in export growth and the associated
weakening in the terms of trade, the current account deficit for
developing Asia will deteriorate substantially in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was sponsored by the Asian Development Bank.

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Chief Metropolitan Magistrate
(CMM) Prem Kumar today rejected former Prime Minister P. V.
Narasimha Rao's bail plea in the St. Kitts forgery case.
</P>
<P>
In his 36-page order, Kumar directed Rao and the other accused
to surrender to the court on November 14 or prior to that, subject
to the order of the Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
He further said that as per the October 13 direction of the
Supreme Court, the accused persons would continue to remain on
anticipatory bail for a week hereafter.
</P>
<P>
"After most careful circumspection, I am of the view that in
the larger interest of the state and a fair trial of the case, the
accused persons are not entitled to bail at this stage," Kumar
added.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) accused Rao, in
conspiracy with others, attested forged documents in an attempt to
make them genuine to show that Ajeya Singh, son of former Prime
Minister V. P. Singh, maintained a secret account in the First
Trust Corporation in the St. Kitts Island, West Indies, and
deposited 21 million U.S. dollars in it during 1986-87.
</P>

appeal against the CMM's order in the sessions court at Tis Hazari

<HEADLINE> EU Troika Cancels Jerusalem Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The three-member rotating
leadership of the European Union (EU) has canceled its visit to
Jerusalem scheduled for Sunday for Israel's denial of its visit
to a Palestinians' key office, a newspaper report said today.
</P>
<P>
The troika, headed by Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring and
including the foreign ministers of Italy and the Netherlands,
will only visit Jordan, Syria and Gaza, the English Jerusalem
Post reported.
</P>
<P>
Downplaying the failure of the visit here, a senior Foreign
Ministry official was quote as saying "it is not such a
catastrophe that they are not coming."
</P>
<P>
"They might be meeting (Israeli) Foreign Minister (David) Levy
at the Cairo economic summit a day or two later. Neither they nor
we are seeking confrontation," the official who was not
identified in the report added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government hoped the troika would follow in the
footsteps of British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, neither of whom
visited Orient House, the de facto representative office of the
Palestinian Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
However, Spring rebuffed Israel's appeal, saying that a
decision was taken by the EU in July which would make a trip to
Orient House mandatory for the troika but leaves it optional for
visitors from European countries.
</P>
<P>
But for logistical reasons, the Troika group is currently
expected to make a transit stop at Ben-Gurion Airport here on
route to Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The official was quoted as saying there would be Israeli
officials to greet the three foreign ministers when they arrive
at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the PA are locked in a bitter dispute over the
status of Jerusalem. Israel has self-declared the holy city as
its only eternal capital, while the PA demands east Jerusalem,
seized by Israel in the 1967 war, to be the capital of a future
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo peace accords, the status of Jerusalem should
be settled through the final-status negotiations which began in
May but have been frozen since then.

<HEADLINE> Help-each-other Services in Tianjin (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of model volunteers selected each time, more than 70 percent
are Chinese Communist Party (CPC) members. There are also many
officials who serve as volunteers.
</P>
<P>
Li Jianguo, former secretary of Heping District CPC committee,
and the current deputy secretary of Tianjin Municipal CPC
committee, has visited the apartments of aged people, and for
years helped them solve problems during festivals and holidays.
</P>
<P>
No one can tell how many people have benefited from voluntary
services, or how many times the volunteers have performed good
deeds for their neighbors during the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
However, local residents know that the volunteers are
everywhere, ready to help those who need help.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shouzhen, 72, lives in Gansu Road with her 75-year-old
sister, and are both mentally-retarted. Each year, before winter
comes, volunteers will deliver coal to their home and buy them
cabbages to help them survive the winter.
</P>
<P>
Voluntary services not only bring benefits to residents, but
also work units.
</P>
<P>
Binjiang Shopping Center is a new department store. From its
construction until now, the center gets a great deal of help from
volunteers. Every day, a group of old men and women keep order and
clean the square in front of the shopping center.
</P>
<P>
The center's manager said that "It is these volunteers who have
created a good environment for our business."
</P>
<P>
Voluntary services have helped local residents establish more
closer relations between each other.
</P>
<P>
In many residential zones, people usually write down their
special skills on a board, so that they can help others directly.
People can receive services like hairdressing, maintenance of
bikes and household electric appliance repair, and medical
treatment without leaving their living area.
</P>
<P>
Xinxing Street has opened a volunteer's hotline, which serves
nearby residents 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
Guiyang Road Non-staple Food Store has opened a special
telephone to help those who have difficulties buying
foodstuffs. The store also has a team responsible for delivering
food to the doorsteps of consumers.
</P>
<P>
The group of volunteers in Heping District is expanding
everyday. Every one who gets help from others also wants to do
something for others.
</P>
<P>
Jin Yangshan joined the volunteers' association after his
retirement. He started his service by cleaning the corridors of
the building where he lives.
</P>
<P>
Moved by his action, many of his neighbors also took part in
the cleaning campaign. Their building and other four buildings are
selected as model buildings for their good and clean environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
yesterday announced its willingness to cancel its 8.5 million
U.S. Dollar arms deal with Rwanda, the "Kenya Times" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted S.A. cabinet minister Kader Asmal, chairman

Pretoria would be guided by the outcome of the Nairobi summit.
</P>
<P>
The minister said in Cape Town yesterday that his committee
and Defense Minister Joe Modise could cancel or suspend the
Rwanda contract if this was deemed to be in South Africa's
national interest.

conflit and ruled out possibility of peace talks until the latter

<HEADLINE> NATO Secretary General Visits Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 4 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana arrived here today for his first official visit to Italy
since he assumed the post in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, Solana
told reporters that he and Dini shared identical views on NATO's
restructuring and the situation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that as a military alliance, NATO's most important
role should be its military functions.
</P>
<P>
It was important to establish a stable Europe security system,
he said, adding that it was a common concern of all NATO member
states.
</P>
<P>
On NATO's reform, Solana said the alliance was working for a
new order, its gradual expansion while making its institutions
smaller but more efficient.
</P>
<P>
He said it was understandable that Russia opposed its eastward
expansion, because the expansion was connected with Russia's vital
interests. NATO should strengthen its existing good relations
with Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that NATO will start its expansion in 1997 and
complete it by 1999.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated Italy's willingness to contribute to a new
peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Rome, Solana is expected to address the
general assembly of the Atlantic Treaty Association.

HANGZHOU, November 5 (Xinhua) -- They are going, going, gone
back to training classrooms in China to learn about the art of
auctioneering.
</P>
<P>
Just a decade ago the thought of an auctioneer's hammer
striking deals seemed a far-off dream in China. But in just a
decade the auction industry has boomed and now the country has 900
registered auction houses.
</P>
<P>
The range of auction items extends from daily-use articles to
cars, real estate, antiques and artworks and invisible property.
</P>
<P>
A national law on auction will come into operation at the
beginning of next year, while regulations on registered
auctioneers will be publicized soon.
</P>
<P>
As part of efforts to help implement the new law and
regulations, the country is now holding a training class for
auction personnel.
</P>
<P>
Sun Qinyong, president of the newly-established auctioneering
association in east China's Zhejiang Province, says that
auctioneering is now regarded as a promising industry in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang, an economically-developed area in the country, opened
more than 60 auction houses since its first auction house was
introduced at the end of 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Help-each-other Services in Tianjin (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A helping-hand movement that
started with just a handful of people has grown into an army of
volunteers in a busy district of north China port city, Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
As help-each-other services have taken root and become more
popular, 500,000 residents in the city's Heping District have a
more easy ways to solve everyday problems they encounter.
</P>
<P>
People who have taken part in the help-each-other services are
all volunteers. They include officials, retired workers, students,
and intellectuals, making up one-tenth of the district's total
population.
</P>
<P>
Voluntary services first started in the district in 1988, when
13 residents established contact with 13 families which were
experiencing difficulties, and provided free services for them.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the Xinxing Street wrote down their strong points,
explaining what they can do for others, and what they themselves
need.
</P>
<P>
Though there are dozens of barber shops, more than 6,000 old
people living in the Xinxing Street area want their hair cut at
home. So many barbers visit the homes of the old people to cut
hair.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-four-year old Zhao Yuanfa, who has worked as a
hairdresser for 50 years, also joined the group of volunteers. He
said, "I feel very happy that I can do something for others."
</P>
<P>
Xinxing Street's volunteers usually go to the street on the
first Sunday each month, sometimes, during major festivals such as
"National Day" and New Year's Day. Every time, they are surrounded
by thousands of people who need help.
</P>
<P>
Heping District has enjoyed a good social order for years,
thanks to the joint efforts of local people. More than 7,000
officials and 6,000 people who are in charge of the safety of
high-rise residential buildings, as well as ordinary residents,
all voluntarily serve as security guards.

</P>
<P>
"We are not ready for any negotiations on the crisis until our
sovereignty is respected. What I mean is that the intruders
should first pull out before we sit down to talk." said President
Mobutu's special envoy, Ngbanda Nzambo Atumba.
</P>
<P>
He said his country had enough evidence showing the fighters
involved were not Banyamulenge Tutsi rebels, but Rwandan soldiers
being backed by the UN Security Council and the European Economic
Community (EEC).
</P>
<P>
Atumba, who was here to deliver a special message to President
Benjamin Mkapa from President Mobutu, said that there was no
tribe in Zaire known as Banyamulenge.
</P>
<P>
"These people referred to as Banyamulenge are actually people who
live in the Mlenge Mountains, near Uvira. They are pygmies by nature
and their populations in hardly 40,000.
</P>
<P>
"How can such a small population form a strong army with
sophisticated weaponry if they are not intruders backed by the
international community?" asked the envoy.
</P>
<P>
Many of the fighters nabbed had acknowledged being Rwandan
soldiers, the envoy added.
</P>
<P>
He said he was in the country to explain the worsening crisis
and solicit support against the "invaders". He would proceed to
Zambia and South Africa on the same mission.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Great Lakes summit in Nairobi on the crisis in
eastern Zaire was intended to attract leaders from Zambia,
Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Cameroon, Rwanda and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the number of Zairean refugees fleeing
to Kigoma town, in western Tanzania, has risen from 1,700 to
4,088.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Assured of Business Environment in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian business
sector has been assured of an attractive business environment in
Hong Kong after 1997 when China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over the territory.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was given by Denise Yue, secretary for trade and
industry of Hong Kong, while presenting a keynote address at a
one-day seminar on "Hong Kong After June 30, 1997: Implications
for Business" here today.
</P>
<P>
The senior Hong Kong official shared with some 200 Malaysian
businessmen some practical reasons for Hong Kong to continue to
stand as a great place for investment and business after its
return to Chinese sovereignty after June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
First, she said, with strong economic fundamentals, the Hong
Kong economy is projected to continue to grow at an annual rate of
5 percent in the remaining years of the century.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is and will continue to be the world's gateway to
China's mainland and China's window to the world, as it is the
world's busiest container port, second busiest airport for freight
and third busiest for international passengers, fifth largest
banking center and fifth largest foreign exchange market as well
as Asia's second largest stock market, she said.
</P>
<P>
She declared that the factors that have helped create Hong
Kong's success will not disappear after the change of sovereignty
in the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
She said the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 which set
out the future for Hong Kong beyond 1997 and the Basic Law, the
mini-constitution drawn up by China to give legal effect to the
provisions of the Joint Declaration, both recognize that Hong
Kong's success as a community and as a business center depends
upon the continuation of its system of government and its way of
life after 1997.
</P>
<P>
She told the participants that many who left for places like
Canada and Australia earlier are coming back, very conscious that
Hong Kong is their home, where, they believe, economic
opportunities lie.
</P>
<P>
She believed that Hong Kong will continue to thrive as a
free-market gateway to China's mainland and as an important
provider of capital and high-value services throughout Asia.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Immigration
Department in Zanzibar has cancelled the residence permit issued
to a Canadian pilot and given him seven days to leave the isles.
</P>
<P>
The local press report said today that the Zanzibar Urban West
Regional Immigration Officer, Ali Khamis, alleged in the town of
Zanzibar on Monday that Captain Vincent Andre had cheated the

permit after arriving in Zanzibar, contrary to the procedures
which required him to request for it while he was out of
Zanzibar.

<P>
According to the immigration records, Captain Andre arrived in
Zanzibar last May 25, and used visitor's pass to work as pilot
until August 16, when he applied for the residence permit.
</P>
<P>
The pilot was been notified to pay a fine of 300 U.S. Dollars
and apply for residence permit afresh but the captain refused,

BEIJING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's export drive
continued its upsurge this year, with 500 million US dollars worth
of machinery products shipped overseas during the first three
quarters this year, rising 13 percent over the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Stocks Turn Costliest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi stock markets, namely
the Dhaka and Chittagong stock exchanges, have now become the
world's costliest ones, and the costliest exchanges provide a
grosteque mismatch for the investment scenario in the real sectors
of the economy, a local daily, The Financial Express, said here
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, money continues to flood in, but the
retail investors, as the allegations go, have been thrown out of
the stock exchanges and are forced to buy and sell in the kerb
market.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka Stock Exchange All Share Price index that represents
the price movements of all the listed stocks has recorded a 4-fold
rise in the last 5 months while the market capitalization of all
the listed stocks now stands at about 6 billion US dollars, about
one-fifth of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), which
represents the aggregate value of the goods and services produced
in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Market insiders, retail investors and operators in the kerb
market complained that trading activities on the floor of the
exchange in Dhaka were mostly restricted to the members of the
exchange and even relates to "syndicated," "insider" or "phoney"
deals.
</P>
<P>
Normal buy-sale orders by ordinary investors are hardly carried
out on the floor and most Dhaka stock exchange members have no
time to attend to them, the allegations run.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, trading on the floor of the Dhaka Stock Exchange
witnessed extraordinary buoyancy resulting in a big rise in the
All Share Price index by 235.59 points from the previous day's
3352.1 points.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rise of Tk 16.67 billion (about 387.6 million US
dollars) for market capitalization stimulated the big rise of the
price index, which crossed two 100-marks surpassing the levels of
3,400 and 3,500 marks.

<HEADLINE> Argentina's First Research Satellite Put Into Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The first scientific
research satellite ever built in Argentina was brought into orbit
today by a U.S. rocket launched from Wallops, Virginia, on the
east coast of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The SAC-B satellite, weighing 181 kilograms, took off aboard
the Pegasur rocket at 14:09 local time and was deployed into the
scheduled orbit 10 minutes later, said Argentina's National
Commission on Space Activities (CONAE).
</P>
<P>
It will remain there for three years to monitor agricultural
and forestry production, fishing activities, floods and other
natural disasters, ground and underground resources, said Raul
Hisas, CONAE's manager of institutional relations.
</P>
<P>
The SAC-B was designed and built by 40 Argentine scientists
under the direction of the CONAE.
</P>
<P>
The space agencies of the United States, Italy and Brazil
contributed scientific instruments for the spacecraft's hardware
and its launching partly in exchange for sharing the results of
the research project.
</P>
<P>
Their shares in the satellite's total cost of 34 million
U.S. dollars were 10 million dollars, 4 million dollars and 1.7
million dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Another CONAE project underway is the SAC-C satellite, which
will be put into orbit within three years in cooperation with the
space agencies of the three nations plus that of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The SAC-C will transmit information about the characteristics
and distribution of vegetation, especially in the Patagonia region
of Argentina.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has formally
joined the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries
(ANRPC), according to an official statement here today.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, which contributed nearly 2 percent of world rubber
production in 1995, deposited its Instrument of Accession to the
ANRPC Constitution with the Malaysian government on October 10,
ANRPC Secretary General J. Lalithambika said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
The ANRPC now comprises India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New
Guinea, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. The eight
ANRPC members now account for 85 percent of world output of
natural rubber.
</P>
<P>
J. Lalithambika said Vietnam could now take advantage of the
technical cooperation programs and other development activities of
the association, which are aimed at promoting the advancement of
the natural rubber industry.
</P>
<P>
The participation of more natural rubber producing countries in
the association would not only strengthen the producers' position
in the world rubber industry but also facilitate mutual assistance
and cooperation which will expedite the development of the natural
rubber industry, the ANRPC official said.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price Falls Back After 1996 Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The average price of OPEC's
basket of seven crude oils dropped by over 4 percent to 22.84
dollars per barrel last week over the previous week's 1996 high of
23.84 dollars, the organization's secretariat announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the price is still well above the 11-member oil cartel's
internal reference price of 21 dollars per barrel reached at the
beginning of September and has been achieved in spite of member
countries breaking the cartel's overall production quota of 25
million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices had been fluctuating recently, mirroring tensions in
the Middle East and the see-saw situation of the U.N.-Iraq
"oil-for-food" deal.
</P>
<P>
In June, the U.N. agreed to lift its six-year embargo on Iraqi
oil allowing the country to sell oil to raise money for
humanitarian purposes. The prospect of 700,000 barrels a day of
Iraqi oil on the market didn't cause too much of a dent in prices
at the time.
</P>
<P>
But delays in implementing the deal, together with other
factors such as falling stocks in industrialized countries,
shortfalls in supply by non-OPEC states and rising demand with the
onset of winter, have all contributed to buoyant prices in spite
of overproduction by OPEC.
</P>
<P>
The price of OPEC's seven crudes has been rising steadily all
year. The monthly average in September was 21.68 dollars per
barrel, compared with 19.94 in August and 18.76 dollars in January.
</P>
<P>
Average prices are now at their highest point since 1991. In
August, the annual average price of OPEC's basket was around 19.2
dollars a barrel, compared with 16.9 dollars for the same period
in 1995 and 15.3 dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The rising prices have brought windfall revenues for OPEC
countries. Oil analysts estimate the higher prices have brought in
an extra 20 billion to 25 billion dollars in export revenues for
the cartel's members.

MANILA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
set up a special task force to fight kidnappers and other criminal
elements in Mindanao island, Interior and Local Government
Secretary Robert Barbers announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the team, called Tabang (Help), came after
Barbers visited Cotabato City in Maguindanao province, which has
seen at least 10 kidnappings last month, over the weekend to
assess the security situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Barbers said the task force will be jointly created by the
military, police, the Moro National Liberation Front, local
government units and civilians concerned with the rising crime
cases, particularly in Central Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Regional army commander Maj. Gen. Raul Urgelio said he has
deployed 100 marines in Cotabato City Monday to beef up a 2,500
police and military force mobilized to stem a wave of kidnappings
targeting mostly Chinese-Filipino businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Kidnapping syndicates and other criminal groups have been
rampant in the country for years. Businessmen last week shut down
shops, offices, banks and gasoline stations for two days to
protest the kidnappings.

saying that the programs will be implemented soon for a quick
raise in the nation's literacy rate.
</P>
<P>
"We'll immediately implement free women education program upto

advancement, political stability and economic development of the
country," the prime minister said.
</P>

<P>
Speaking at the function, Hasina said that her government
believes that it would be able to ensure a life-oriented education
system by introducing an up-to-date national educational policy.

<HEADLINE> Lukin Opposes Russia Joining NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia's participation in NATO's
political structure, though appealing, cannot become a reality,
Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Russian parliament's Committee on
Foreign Affairs, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
His statement, made on Russian TV, came in response to comments
last week by Ivan Rybkin, the new chief of the Russian Security
Council, that he was in favor of Russia joining the western
military alliance's political structure.
</P>
<P>
Interfax news agency said Lukin told the TV station that
implementation of such a proposal would mean that Russia, like
France, would still be in control of its own armed forces, but
would simultaneously be under NATO's integrated umbrella for
protection against attack.
</P>
<P>
Lukin said that "though the idea is beautiful, it cannot be
turned into reality," and that Russian statesmen should not become
intoxicated by such illusions.
</P>
<P>
Those countries involved in NATO's planned eastward expansion,
especially the U.S., would never consider allowing Russia to join
the military alliance in any form, said Lukin.
</P>
<P>
And he accused the U.S. of being obsessed with creating a
single world order led by Washington, he added.

<HEADLINE> Border Dispute Goes to Supreme Court in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A dispute over the
Nepal-India border demarcation made four months ago has finally
arrived at Nepal's Supreme Court, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
A writ petition was filed Monday to the Supreme Court by six
individual Nepalese alleging that the latest demarcation in early
July in eastern Nepal's border area is illegal as it is not
consistent with the Nepali Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The petitioners claimed that as a result of the new
demarcation, Nepal has lost its sovereign rights over about 800
hectares of land in the border town of Bhadrapur and nearby areas
in East Nepal's Jhapa District, according to press reports.
</P>
<P>
The writ petition made the Council of Ministers, the Foreign
Ministry, the Home Ministry and the local administration of Jhapa
District defendants.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the demarcation of Nepal's eastern border with India
had triggered widespread concerns here while local residents in
the border area staged mass rallies in protest of the alleged
encroachment by India and the government's silence over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani said in a statement in
mid-August that the new border markers were built in line with a
1816 treaty between Nepal and the then British-ruled India.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign minister's statement failed to calm down
the voices against the demarcation work throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court is to hold hearings on the writ petition on
December 4, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Up by 1.9 Percent in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Construction spending in the
U.S. increased by 1.9 percent in September, the steepest advance
in six months, U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
But the sharp increase was resulted mainly from a rebound in
government expenditures and outlays for the vital single-family
housing sector shrank, signaling the slowdown of the U.S. housing
market.
</P>
<P>
The department said spending on residential, non-residential
and government projects totaled 573.4 billion dollars at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate in the month, compared to 562.7
billion dollars in August.
</P>
<P>
The gain of construction spending in September, following an
increase of 0.7 percent in August, was the largest since it shot
up by 2.3 percent last March.
</P>
<P>
The increase helped push spending up by 1.8 percent in the
third quarter of this year, compared to the 1.1 percent increase
from the April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
The increase of construction spending in September was led by
government outlays which jumped by 6.4 percent, the first advance
in five months. Government spending was weak in that sector this
year because of the cutting of the government budget.
</P>
<P>
But spending on residential buildings, including remodeling
projects, fell by 0.1 percent, the fifth straight decline.
</P>
<P>
Outlays for single-family homes -- more than 25 percent of
total construction spending -- declined 0.9 percent in the month.
It was the first decrease in three months, although spending was
flat in August.
</P>
<P>
The decline has been predicted for months by analysts as the
rising mortgage rates would eventually lead to the slowdown in the
U.S. housing market.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged more than 8 percent
during the July-September quarter, compared to 7.03 percent last
January.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Why President Fires Benazir Bhutto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 5 (Xinhua) -- When Pakistani President
Farooq Leghari dismissed Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her
cabinet early this morning, it was not so surprising to those who
have been closely following the country's political scenario.
</P>
<P>
When Leghari, a former member of Bhutto's Pakistan People's
Party (PPP) and close ally of Bhutto, was elected president in
1993, it was widely believed that the Bhutto government was safe
from the danger of being dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Two consecutive governments, one of Bhutto and another of Nawaz
Sharif, had been dismissed by the then President Ishaq Khan before
they could finish their tenure.
</P>
<P>
President Leghari, who has the power to dissolve the National
Assembly and the government under the constitution, openly
declared that he would not dismiss the government when he was
elected.
</P>
<P>
However, after almost three years, Leghari told opposition
leader Nawaz Sharif when they held the first meeting in three
years in September that he would not dissolve the National
Assembly unless national interest so require.
</P>
<P>
Confrontation with the judiciary, corruption and mismanagement
are the reasons behind the president's move today.
</P>
<P>
On March 20 this year, the Pakistani Supreme Court issued a
short order on the appointment of judges.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto not only challenged and attacked the order in her speech
at the National Assembly soon after it was issued, she also
refused to carry out the decision, thus seriously affecting the
functioning of various courts.
</P>
<P>
Rifts appeared between the two close allies during this period.
The president had to interfere in September, telling the prime
minister to implement the decision or face action from the
president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president sent a reference to the Supreme Court
through his own lawyer rather than the attorney general of the
government, asking if the president is bound to follow the prime
minister's advice on the appointment of judges.
</P>
<P>
Realizing that she was in a dangerous situation, Bhutto quickly
took action and implemented the Supreme Court appointment the very
next day after a meeting with the president on September 29.
</P>
<P>
But after her estranged brother Murtaza Bhutto was killed in
police firing on September 20 this year, Bhutto pointed the finger
at the president, hinting at his involvement in the case.
</P>
<P>
The president, who was once referred to as "our man" inside the
government circle, had to break the silence and defend himself.
</P>
<P>
He asked government officials to refrain from issuing
irresponsible statements in face of personal tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition have long accused the government of
corruption and demanded that a neutral committee be set up to deal
with the problem.
</P>
<P>
The government rejected the demand and only after the
president's intervention did the government table an
accountability bill before the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Though the bill was fairly comprehensive, it required a
two-thirds majority to pass as it was meant to be an amendment to
the constitution.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition made it clear at the beginning that
they would not support the bill and the government knew this.
Therefore, the sincerity of the government in tabling such a bill
and in eliminating corruption was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the government announced the budget for the fiscal
year of July 1996 and June 1997, which introduced heavy taxes,
opposition parties have been trying to push out the government.
</P>
<P>
In July and August, almost all trade associations held strikes
or protests against the budget.
</P>
<P>
However, with the economy showing no sign of improvement and an
acute shortage of foreign exchange, the government negotiated with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to seek more loans.
</P>
<P>
The government succeeded in getting loans, but the conditions
were a bitter pill to swallow.
</P>
<P>
Just before the IMF agreed to release 160 million U.S. dollars
of delayed loans, the government announced an economic reform
package including more taxes, an 8.5-percent devaluation of the
Pakistani rupee and an increase in prices for petroleum and gas,
to meet requirements for the loans.
</P>
<P>
The package drew expected protests from the business community
and the opposition. People's resentment toward the Bhutto
government was mounting.
</P>
<P>
On October 27 and 28, activists of the religious party
Jamaat-i-Islami clashed with police and rangers in and around the
capital as the government tried to prevent the party from holding
a sit-in demonstration against corruption and mismanagement of the
government and demanding the dissolution of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Many people were injured during the confrontation and the
capital was in chaos for two days.
</P>
<P>
Sensing the danger she was facing, Bhutto said on various
occasions recently that there were people trying to overthrow her,
but she vowed that she would not resign.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto, who the local media often say is good at turning
friends into foes, in the end lost the confidence and exhausted
the patience of the president, costing her premiership for the
second time.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Rejects Seoul's Request to Join WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has rejected a South
Korea request to take part in the consultation talks in the World
Trade Organization (WTO) between Indonesia and the countries who
objected to it's national car policy.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia did not wish any third party to join the bilateral
talks, local press quoted Industry and Trade Minister Tunky
Ariwibowo as saying here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had already launched a bilateral consultation on its
national car policy with the European union (EU) and the United
States at the WTO headquarters in Geneva last weekend. Indonesia
and Japan consultation had not been scheduled yet.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's national car policy issued under presidential
instruction in February this year was being opposed by Japan, the
United States and EU, and their objection has been filed to the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
The objection was against the granting of import duty and
luxury sales tax exemption by the Indonesian government to the
producer of the national car, seen as a discrimination of other
car producers already operating in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The government believed that South Korean participation in the
consultative talks have no benefit because the Indonesian
government from the very beginning wished the bilateral talks be
held with Japan, the United States and the European Union," Tunky
noted.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Still ADB's Largest Borrower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia remains the largest
borrower of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), with cumulative
loans amounting to 13 billion US dollars, ADB's representative in
Indonesia T.C. Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
ADB's lending to Indonesia has increased steadily from an
annual US dollars in the 1980s, Patterson told a seminar here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The bank's lending to Indonesia increased further to more than
one billion US dollars annually in the current decade. To date,
cumulative ADB lending to Indonesia has reached about 13 billion
US dollars," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the agriculture sector, which includes forestry-related
projects, is the largest sector to receive loans from the ADB,
with a 27 percent share. Second largest is the social
infrastructure sector, including urban development, education and
health, with a 23 percent share.
</P>
<P>
The bank also provided two-step loans to the Indonesian private
sector through local commercial banks, he added.
</P>
<P>
The strategic objectives of ADB's future operations, he said,
are to support economic growth, human resource development and
sustainable utilization of natural resources in line with
Indonesia's sixth Five-Year development plan (1994-1999),
Patterson said.

<HEADLINE> Flight Cancellation Takes Toll on Ecuador's Flower Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 4 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran flower exporters are
losing over 1 million U.S. dollars a week in earnings because of
the cancellation of flights by an American airline company.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Ecuadoran Flower Exporters (Expoflores) said
today the cancellation has grounded nearly 10,000 boxes of flowers
each week that otherwise would leave for international markets.
</P>
<P>
The weekly shipment, weighing 180 metric tons, previously was
undertaken by Million Air, a U.S.-based cargo carrier.
</P>
<P>
However, since the deadly crash of a Million Air Boeing 707
cargo plane on October 22, Ecuadoran aviation authorities have
suspended the company's operation in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy killed a crew of four aboard the plane and 20
others on the ground in the city of Manta, about 250 kilometers
southwest of Quito on Ecuador's Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
Expoflores complained that since flowers are extremely
perishable and cannot be stored indefinitely, the cancellation of
flight is costing exporters more than 1 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The association's executives therefore urged Ecuador's civil
aviation directors to lift the suspension on the operations of the
U.S. airline company in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Andean country's annual flower sales to international
markets increased from 13.5 million dollars at the beginning of
the decade to 79.4 million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador exported more than 50 million dollars worth of flowers
in the first half of this year, making flowers the country's
fourth primary export product after petroleum, bananas and
shrimp.

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Congress party's new chief
Sitaram Kesri has declared his assets and asked his partymen to
follow suit, Congress sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The move was of great significance in the party's effort to
fight corruption, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Kesri announced at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting
here Monday that corruption had to be tackled in earnest and there
could be no compromise on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Though there were many red faces at Mr. Kesri's remarks, none
of the CWC members had any option but to agree to his proposals,"
said a CWC member after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Not a few former Rao government ministers and senior officials
have been involved in varies cases of corruption. Former prime
minister P.V. Narasimha Rao himself has been involved in several
corruption cases, which are under investigation or trial in the
court. This has seriously damaged the party's image. Opposition
parties have regarded the Congress party government as "the most
corrupted government in Indian history".
</P>
<P>
It had been the custom for the Congress partymen to declare
their assets till the time Devkanta Baruah was the party
president. The practice stopped during the latter part of former
prime minister Indira Gandhi's tenure as the party chief and was
not resumed by either former prime ministers Rajiv Gandhi or
Narasimha Rao.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Schools Win 50m Yuan Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Funds and equipment worth 50
million yuan (over six million U.S. dollars) have been sent to
schools in the Three Gorges Area which need to move because of the
construction of the big dam.
</P>
<P>
Over 600 schools in the Three Gorges Area, which includes parts
of southwest China's Sichuan and central China's Hubei provinces,
will eventually be submerged. Over 200,000 students will have to
transfer elsewhere for their school education.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission (SEC) asked in an announcement
issued early this year to support educational development in the
Three Gorges Area with funds, materials, equipment and projects.
</P>
<P>
Specialized departments were set up in provinces and cities,
such as south China's Guangdong province, Beijing, northeast
China's Liaoning province and central China's Henan province, to
take charge of the aid work.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen cities in Guangdong decided to help 15 schools in
Wushan County to relocate. The contracted investment surpassed 20
million yuan (over 2.4 million U.S. dollars), followed by a latest
donation of 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Beijing donated nearly three million yuan to schools in Badong
county for re-settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance promised to donate 700,000 (over 84,000
U.S. dollars) for school reconstruction at a recent working
meeting on aiding the Three Gorges Area.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Committee of Liaoning province is
encouraging a one-yuan donation from each of its seven million
students to help educational development in Fengjie county.
</P>
<P>
The SEC decided to allocate 42 million yuan (about five million
U.S. dollars) for Wanxian City's compulsory education project for
poverty-stricken areas. And the World Bank will grant a loan
totaling 1.06 million U.S. dollars to Kaixian County in Sichuan
province to develop compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong also signed a contract with Wuxian to employ 100
vocational school graduates each year for five years. Its
neighboring province Fujian has employed 1,400 graduates from the
area.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project is building a 175-m-high dam across
the Yangtze, the longest river in China. The purpose of the dam is
to use the river's abundant water resources to generate
electricity and reduce the possible danger of floods.
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled to be completed in the year 2009 and
cost at least 90 billion yuan (about 10.7 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
About one million people living around the project area will be
evacuated and settled elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges Rich Countries to Open Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand wants the APEC's
developed members to open their markets to all products, including
sensitive farm products, by 2010, according to Thai Deputy Prime
Minister Amnuay Virawan.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay will lead a Thai delegation to the eighth ministerial
meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation to be held in the
Philippines on November 22 and 23.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay was quoted today by the local daily the Bangkok Post as
saying that APEC members have still not clearly defined the level
of free trade and investment they wish to achieve by 2010 for
developed members and 2020 for developing members.
</P>
<P>
Thailand says the APEC's developed nations must stand by the
commitment made in Bogor, Indonesia, in 1994 to fully open their
markets to both industrial and agricultural products by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Developing members should achieve the same complete
liberalization by 2020.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay said developed members should also eliminate all unfair
trade restrictions and all non-tariff barriers such as industrial
and environmental standards by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Some developed countries have begun to backtrack on the
liberalization of trade in farm products, putting the goal of
comprehensive liberalization in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay added that the APEC should set up free trade and
investment milestones to keep track of whether members were
liberalizing their economies quickly enough to meet the two
deadlines.

<HEADLINE> MDC Chairman Says Potential of China Market High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese market is vital to
aircraft maker McDonnell Douglas Corporation, and is the primary
focus of the company's world-wide commercial marketing efforts,
company chairman John F. McDonnell said here today.
</P>
<P>
Propelled by economic reform and the opening-up, China's
aviation industry is experiencing unprecedented growth and has
become a market of great potential, Mr. McDonnell commented.
</P>
<P>
He is in Zhuhai City, south China's Guangdong Province, to
attend '96 China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition
which opened today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, the chairman of the US based
company said that his company, which has conducted friendly
cooperation with China for more than two decades, is full of
confidence for further strengthening cooperation with China, and
expanding market penetration of MDC's products in China.
</P>
<P>
He said that of the estimated 1,300 new aircrafts China needs
in the coming 20 years, MDC would like to obtain 30 percent of the
market share.
</P>
<P>
Mr. McDonnell said that MDC is facing increasingly fierce
competition from other major world aircraft makers in winning
Chinese markets, adding MDC is taking effective measures to meet
the challenge.
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort, MDC opened a spare parts distribution
center in Beijing in June with China Aviation Supplies Company.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include assistance to China Northern Airlines in
developing a modern flight training center; additional field
service representatives working directly with customers; and MDC
conferences in China to help airlines improve their business
performances, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mr. McDonnell spoke highly of a co-production program for MD-90
twin-jets, now undertaken by four Chinese aircraft makers.
</P>
<P>
"All of the factories are doing excellent work on this
program," he said. "We are working with the factories, the Chinese
aircraft airworthiness authorities, and the US Federal Aviation
Authority to implement a quality system to assure that the MD-90
meets all relevant Chinese and US airworthiness standards," he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the chairman, there are currently 39 MD-82
aircrafts, three MD-90s, six MD-11s in operation with Chinese
airlines.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that MDC aircrafts are very suitable products for
the Chinese market," he said.

<HEADLINE> Harbin Upgrades Old State Firms by Using Overseas Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A massive five billion US dollar
drive to transform state-owned enterprises in Harbin, capital city
of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, has been announced.
</P>
<P>
The old industrial center plans to attract the money in the
coming 15 years to revitalize the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Authoritative government sources said the funds will be used to
carry out technological upgrading in 150 large and medium-sized
state enterprises, covering machinery, metallurgy, electronics,
automobiles, light industry, petroleum chemical industry,
textiles, medicine, building materials and food.
</P>
<P>
The move will promote technical improvements in the city, and
will provide new opportunities for overseas investors to expand
economic and technological cooperation with major local industrial
businesses.
</P>
<P>
With more than 4,000 large industrial ventures, the city has a
unique advantage to make use of overseas funds, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Thermal and hydraulic equipment produced in Harbin makes up one
third of the total installed capacity in China's power plants.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the largest city in northeastern China plays a
vital role in the manufacturing of airplanes, medicines, measuring
tools, bearings and flax.
</P>
<P>
The city boasts abundant resources, such as timber, crude oil,
coal and grain. It also serves as a major transportation and
telecommunications hub.
</P>
<P>
Investors from Japan, Malaysia and Israel have already signed
agreements with two enterprises of the city to carry out
technological upgrading.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the city government has worked out favorable
taxation and financial policies to attract overseas funds, and
governmental departments have taken an active attitude to
efficiently solve any problems for overseas-funded enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Law, Order Situation, Judiciary Rift Cost B. Bhutto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his speech to the parliament on October 29, 1995, President
Farooq Leghari warned that law-enforcing agencies must ensure that
there is no harassment of innocent citizens in the fight against
terrorism and that human and legal rights of all persons are duly
protected.
</P>
<P>
However, "This advice was not heeded. the killings continued
unabated." said the president.
</P>
<P>
The president accused the now dissolved government of having
taken no meaningful steps, on the part of neither the government
of the federation nor the provincial governments to put an end to
the crime of extra-judicial killings.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said that instead of ensuring proper investigation of
these extra-judicial killings and punishment for those guilty of
such crimes, the government took pride in that the law and order
situation had been controlled.
</P>
<P>
These killings coupled with widespread interference by the
government in the appointment, transfer and posting of officers
and staff of the law-enforcing agencies have destroyed the faith
of the public in the integrity and impartiality of the
law-enforcing agencies and in their ability to protect the lives,
liberties and properties of the average citizen, Leghari said.
</P>
<P>
The president said the government has sought to undermine the
independence of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
He said the prime minister ridiculed the judgment issued by the
Supreme Court on March 20 this year on appointment of judges in a
speech before the National Assembly which was shown more than once
on nation-wide television.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the judgment was resisted and
deliberately delayed in violation of the constitution, the
president added.
</P>
<P>
The president said the government's accountability bill is
designed not only to embarrass and humiliate the superior
judiciary but also to frustrate and set at naught all efforts
made, including the initiative taken by the president, to combat
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the details of the bill, the president said it was
"evidently an attempt to destroy the independence of the
judiciary".
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister and her government have deliberately
violated, on a massive scale the fundamental right of privacy,"
the president further stated.
</P>
<P>
"This has been done through illegal phone-tapping and
eaves-dropping techniques," the president pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The president accused Benazir of including a minister into her
cabinet "against whom criminal cases are pending".
</P>
<P>
However, corruption and bad economic policies of the government
were not listed in the president's statement as reasons for
dissolving the National Assembly and sacking Benazir's government.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Has Largest Number of Mobile Phone Users in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Just 20 people in Shanghai
possessed what was the ultimate in one-upmanship in 1982 - a
mobile phone. Known in the western world as 'yuppie' phones,
carriers were viewed as the posers of a modern society.
</P>
<P>
But that handful of cordless communications pioneers in China's
biggest city have seen the ranks swell to over 300,000.
</P>
<P>
The figure has made Shanghai the leading mobile phone user in
the country, after the regions of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan,
local officials in charge of telecommunications administration
announced.
</P>
<P>
The number is expected to exceed 320,000 by the end of the
year, and will continue to rise when the installed capacity of
mobile phone reaches 800,000 lines next year, they predicted.
</P>
<P>
They contributed the fast growth of mobile phone sector to
Shanghai's economic boom in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has invested one billion yuan (120 million US dollars)
to enlarge the installed capacity of mobile phone to 400,000 lines
in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
It has provided a roaming service for mobile phone linking with
almost all provinces of China's inland, and Hong Kong, Macao and
Singapore. The roaming service will link Shanghai with Germany,
Spain and Italy by the end of this year, local authorities have
announced.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 4 (Xinhua) -- An Argentine ministry said
today that 98 percent of the dry tropical forests on the Pacific
coast of Central America have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
In a document issued during the World Conference on
Biodiversity, which started here today, the Natural Resources and
Human Environment Ministry said that 9 percent of the tropical
forests which occupy just 7 percent of the earth's surface were
lost between 1981-1989.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that 50-90 percent of the species in the world
live in tropical forests and that at the current rate of
deforestation, between 4 and 8 percent of the species found in
rain forests are in danger of becoming extinct by the year 2015
and 17-35 percent by the year 2040.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the deforestation and degradation of
native forests in Argentina have reduced them to one-third of what
they were in 1914.
</P>
<P>
The document said that the Argentine government is drafting a
project for the conservation and handling of protected areas,
native forests and biodiversity.

<P>
ZHUHAI, November 5 (Xinhua) -- A MD-90 twin jet operated by
China Northern Airlines is the centerpiece of the McDonnell
Douglas Corporation's (MDC) exhibit at China's international air
show which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the the new-type 150-seater, verified as the
world's quietest aircraft, will arouse special attention from
visitors flocking to the show, since 20 such aircrafts are
currently being co-produced in China.
</P>
<P>
Embracing 21th century technology, the MD-90 is not only said
to be the quietest, but also the cleanest and most fuel-saving
plane of its type in the world today.
</P>
<P>
Since its maiden flight in 1993, 20 MD-90s are in service
around the world, and many more on order. .
</P>
<P>
China Northern Airlines is the first to operate the MD-90 in
China, and so far has received three of the 11 MD-90s it has
ordered. China Eastern Airlines has also placed orders.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreements signed between China National Aviation
Technology Import and Export Corporation and MDC, 20 MD-90s will
be turned out in China, with factories in Shenyang, Chengdu, and
Xi'an responsible for parts and components, and one in Shanghai
for general assembling.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that all the four Chinese aircraft makers were
already successfully involved in the co-production of MD-82 type
planes, and the first China-made MD-90 will roll out in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Currently, MDC has two assembly lines for MD-90s, one in Long
Beach, California, and the other in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Also featured in MDC's exhibit at the Zhuhai Air Show, is a
display of photographs and models to illustrate the company's
20-years-plus of successful cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said the presence of John F. McDonnell, the
chairman of the Board of Directors of MDC, at the show, which is
the first ever held by China, also illustrates MDC's strong wish
to expand in the China market.

<HEADLINE> Ants, Moths and Maggots on Menu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 5 (Xinhua) -- China is famed for its
mouth-watering banquets. But the latest offering in home made
cuisine is enough to send a cold chill up a diner's spine.
</P>
<P>
The delicacies to reach these dinner bowls were a dozen
horrifying insects, including locusts, ants and fly maggots.
</P>
<P>
They crawled their way onto the menu, thanks to a team of
hungry entomologists in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts claim this is the first insect banquet in China,
composed entirely of food made from locusts, ants, pink boll worm
insects, Eisenis foe-tida and silk moths.
</P>
<P>
Designated by scholars from the Central China Agriculture
University, and cooked by first-class chefs, these "terrifying
insects" were transformed into 15 delicious dishes to entertain
some 80 entomologists who were attending a national conference on
insect resources in the city.
</P>
<P>
Some entomologists said the insects contain rich protein, fat,
vitamin and trace elements, with the protein content even reaching
70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Documents show there are hundreds of species of insects in the
world, and many of them are valuable to humankind.
</P>
<P>
To most Chinese, insects are always looked upon as disgusting,
but to think of them as food. But some insects have been used in
traditional Chinese medicine formulations.
</P>
<P>
Whether creepy-crawly banquets can ever replace Peking Duck as
a Chinese favorite is doubtful. But as a food source maybe
stir-fried ants and maggots are a recipe for the next century.

<HEADLINE> France, U.S. Differ over Ways to Deal with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 4 (Xinhua) -- France and the United States are
apparently differing with each other over ways to deal with the
present crisis in eastern Zaire, where more than one million
refugees are facing an unprecedented human disaster.
</P>
<P>
In a joint declaration issued today with Spanish Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar in Marseille, French President Jacques Chirac
called on the United Nations Security Council to meet in emergency
on the organization of a multi-national humanitarian operation in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France is ready to contribute to such an
operation, including sending French troops to eastern Zaire for a
military intervention under the coordination of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that the intervention must be joined by the United
States and the Organization of African Unity, as well as the
European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the polling of the presidential election, the
United States reacted to the French proposal with apparent reserve
and coldness.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said this
afternoon in Washington that U.S. needs to have more information
about what is in the head of the French government before making
any formal reaction to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. government sent a team to Geneva Sunday
evening to discuss with U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako
Ogata "precise logistic problems" faced by the U.N. commission
in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He also refused to give a precise stand of the U.S. government
on the proposal by Sadako on the creation of a human corridor in
eastern Zaire to repatriate one million refugees now desperately
struggling to survive hunger, disease and violence.
</P>
<P>
The United States has made it clear that no U.S. soldier will
be sent to Zaire, although it is willing to provide logistic
support to humanitarian operations there.

<HEADLINE> Bankrupted Enterprise in Qinghai Bought Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Bankrupted Guangming Chemical
Factory in northwest China's Qinghai Province has been bought
outright by a local company.
</P>
<P>
Guangming Chemical Factory, which moved to Qinghai from
interior areas in mid-1970s, used to be China's first large
national defense chemical enterprise for producing heavy water
products.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise had been hopelessly debt-ridden over the past
several years, and was declared bankrupt according to law on April
15 this year.
</P>
<P>
Liming Chemical Factory (Group) Company, with the help of
Qinghai Provincial Higher People's Court, has decided to buy all
the properties of the bankrupted Guangming Chemical Factory,
accept and make arrangements for all the factory's workers, which
was Qinghai's third enterprise to ever be declared bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Guangming Chemical Factory is placed at the top among the three
bankrupted enterprises for its debts, assets and the number of
workers.
</P>
<P>
As agreed, Liming Chemical Factory (Group) Company will buy all
of the original Guangming Chemical Factory's properties, including
products in stock, fixed assets, land use right of 392,000 square
meters of state-owned land, and will inject funds for arranging
for the 1,800 on-job workers and retirees from the bankrupted
enterprise, as well as make arrangements for relatives left by 18
former workers of the bankrupted factory.
</P>
<P>
Jia Xitai, deputy governor of the province, said that letting
Guangming Chemical Factory declare itself bankrupt and sell it
completely to another company is an important measure by Qinghai
toward deepening and intensifying reform in state-owned
enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 4 (Xinhua) -- The Socialist Party of Serbia
(SPS) claimed that its leftist coalition had won an overwhelming
victory in Sunday's parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Ivica Dacic said late on Monday that the leftist
coalition, comprised of the ruling SPS, Yugoslav Left (JUL) and
New Democracy (ND), would certainly garner in more than 60 seats
in federal parliament's Chamber of Citizens (Lower House).
</P>
<P>
Dacic told a press conference he was basing his estimate on the
results of three-fourths of the returns counted so far.
</P>
<P>
The results proved that the leftist coalition had scored a
convincing and triumphant victory and would have an absolute
majority in the federal parliament, he said. Out of the 138 seats
in the Chamber of Citizens, 108 would be allotted to Serbia and
the rest 30 to the other republic Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Dacic stressed that the coalition had scored heavily also in
the municipal elections, held the same day with the federal
parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
"They are far ahead of the other candidates in all
municipalities, having been either elected outright in the first
round or qualified for the second round, also ahead of their
rivals," he added.
</P>
<P>
But these were preliminary results, he said, adding he hoped
that the rest of the returns would be counted during the night and
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Montenegrins voted also for their 71-seat republican
parliament. The ruling Democratic Party of Socialists had won a
landslide victory in the elections, according to preliminary
results.

coalition, comprised of the ruling SPS, Yugoslav Left (JUL) and
New Democracy (ND), would certainly garner in more than 60 seats
in federal parliament's Chamber of Citizens (Lower House).
</P>
<P>
Dacic told a press conference he was basing his estimate on the
results of three-fourths of the returns counted so far.
</P>
<P>
The results proved that the leftist coalition had scored a
convincing and triumphant victory and would have an absolute
majority in the federal parliament, he said. Out of the 138 seats
in the Chamber of Citizens, 108 would be allotted to Serbia and
the rest 30 to the other republic Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Dacic stressed that the coalition had scored heavily also in
the municipal elections, held the same day with the federal
parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
"They are far ahead of the other candidates in all
municipalities, having been either elected outright in the first
round or qualified for the second round, also ahead of their
rivals," he added.
</P>
<P>
But these were preliminary results, he said, adding he hoped
that the rest of the returns would be counted during the night and
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Montenegrins voted also for their 71-seat republican
parliament. The ruling Democratic Party of Socialists had won a
landslide victory in the elections, according to preliminary
results.
