<HEADLINE> French Writer Condemned to Jail Term for Attacking Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Roger Garaudy, a 85-year-old
author of "the Founding Myth of Israel" and some other works in
which he attacked Israel, was sentenced to nine months in jail
plus 160,000 francs (27,000 U.S. dollars) in fines by an appeals
court of Paris on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He was convicted of contesting crimes against humanity, racial
defamation, and provocation of hatred by the 11th Chamber of the
Appeals Court of Paris, which rejected an appeal by Garaudy
against an earlier sentence by a lower court against him.
</P>
<P>
Garaudy, a former member of the politburo of the French
Communist Party but now converted to Islam, was sentenced on
February 27, 1998, by the first instance of the court of Paris to
pay 120,000 francs in fines for contesting crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
In "the Founding Myth of Israel" and others, Garaudy said the
number of dead in the Holocaust as was claimed by Israel was
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
Garaudy also fiercely attacked the policy of Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanhyahu and reaffirmed his theory on
Holocaust in his 1998 book "The Trial of Israeli Zionism."
</P>
<P>
The court also sentenced the publisher of "Founding Myth of
Israel" Piere Guillaume, who is the boss of the publishing house
La Vieille Taupe, to six months in jail and 30,000 francs (5,000
dollars) in fines for contesting crimes against humanity.

<HEADLINE> Former East German Doctor Dropped from Training Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Bernd Pnsold, a former East
German doctor, is being dropped from the training center used by
Austrian ski star Hermann Maier because of his convicting of
giving performance-enhancing drugs, according to the Austrian
news agency APA on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A Berlin court found Pnsold guilty of administering
performance-enhancing drugs to nine underage athletes from
1975-84 even though he knew the drugs were dangerous. Pensold was
fined 14,000 marks (8,200 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, the Austrian Skiing Federation stepped up
pressure on Maier to cut his ties to Pensold. The Obertauern
training center is not under the federation's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Maier, double Olympic gold medalist and last season's overall
World Cup champion, has always rejected any doping allegations
and said he used Pensold as a performance analyst, paying for his
services out of his own pocket.
</P>
<P>
Pensold also rejected any doping accusations. "I would be an
idiot if I _ with the reputation I have _ gave drugs to Hermann
Maier," Pensold was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Sell Kuwait Howitzers in Big Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
offering to sell Kuwait its Paladin howitzers in a package worth
up to 750 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has received an official U.S. response on Kuwait's
purchase of the U.S.-made guns, Deputy Prime Minister and Defense
Minister Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a graduation ceremony of army officers at the
Mubarak Al-Abdullah Military College, Salem said he had received a
letter from his U.S. counterpart William Cohen. But he didn't
reveal its content.
</P>
<P>
On December 7, the Kuwaiti defense chief said the Kuwaiti Army
was "in dire need of the U.S.-made howitzer guns to fill the
shortage suffered by the land forces."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Kuwait was planning to equip three
battalions with howitzers and was studying offers worth a total of
750 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Several big powers including the United States were bidding for
a share of the purchase. Washington was offering its M109 A6
Paladin howitzers.
</P>
<P>
Defending the government decision to buy U.S. guns, the defense
minister said the selection was made according to reports by
several specialized committees which studied all its technical
aspects.
</P>
<P>
Competing guns lacked several technical details offered by the
U.S., including "the possibility to amend it according to our
needs," Salem noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the purchase sparked fierce controversy in the
country. Some of the lawmakers strongly criticized the government
plan, saying the U.S.-made guns are outmoded and not compatible
with the Kuwaiti armament system.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ASEAN Leaders Focus on Economic Recovery at Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Hanoi Declaration they approved at Wednesday's meeting,
the leaders admitted that the economic and financial upheaval
afflicting the region's economies "has severely set back many of
the gains that our nations and our association have achieved."
</P>
<P>
They pledged to "overcome those economic and social
difficulties by working together in ever closer cooperation and
ever stronger solidarity."
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN region, which was one of the fastest growing areas in
the world in the 1980s and 1990s, was plunged into a financial
crisis last year, reducing the growth rate of some member
countries to the negative and forcing them to seek assistance from
the International Monetary Fund and other organizations and
countries.
</P>
<P>
The leaders pledged to keep ASEAN markets open to attract
long-term investments which they described as "the key to
strengthening and stabilizing the region's currencies and
economies."
</P>
<P>
They also reaffirmed their commitment to the greater
integration of their economies "as a primary expression of our
cooperation and solidarity."
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed on the immediate implementation of a number
of "bold measures" to improve the investment climate in the member
countries "to regain business confidence, enhance economic
recovery and promote growth."
</P>
<P>
According to the measures, the ASEAN countries, in an effort to
attract foreign direct investment, will extend incentives and
privileges to qualified ASEAN and non-ASEAN investors in the
manufacturing sector, including a minimum three-year corporate
income tax exemption, or a minimum 30-percent corporate investment
tax allowance, 100-percent foreign equity ownership, duty-free
imports of capital goods and domestic market access.
</P>
<P>
In the Hanoi Plan of Action, the leaders pledged to restore
confidence, regenerate economic growth and promote regional
financial stability through maintaining sound macroeconomic and
financial policies and strengthening financial system and capital
markets so as to avoid future disturbances.
</P>
<P>
The plan contains a number of concrete measures for improving
the member countries' trade and financial systems and facilitating
trade among ASEAN members and that between the ASEAN members and
other countries through accelerated implementation of the ASEAN
Free Trade Area (AFTA) and other liberalization measures to remove
trade barriers by cutting tariffs to 0-5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the ASEAN countries will promote liberalization
of the financial services sector and intensify cooperation in
money, tax and insurance matters including feasibility studies on
the establishment of an ASEAN currency and exchange rate system.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also agreed to go ahead with the establishment of
the ASEAN Investment Area, where each ASEAN member country will
give foreign investors the same privileges of their own nationals
in an effort to attract more direct investment into and within the
ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
The summit also agreed to admit Cambodia at an admission
ceremony to be held in Hanoi as soon as possible, thus fulfilling
the vision of ASEAN-10.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Calls U.S. Natural Security Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov has described the U.S.-Russian relations in recent years as
"natural security partnership" despite differences in approaches
to their common goals.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the newspaper "Nezavisimaya Gazeta"
published Wednesday, Ivanov said Russia and the United States have
converging strategic goals as far as the resolution of most
international problems is concerned.
</P>
<P>
However, different measures and methods to reach the strategic
goals are often suggested and sometimes they cause serious
differences, said the Russian foreign minister, who is paying an
official visit to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov noted, "Russia believes that international relations
should be based on the supremacy of international law rather than
on the use of force."
</P>
<P>
"Practice shows that an intention of using force, especially
when circumventing the U.N. Security Council, may spawn very
dangerous consequences for international security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is opposed to attempts to use Russian-Iranian relations
in certain fields as a lever of pressure on Russia, Ivanov stated.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the pan-European processes, he said, "Russia
realizes the need to preserve the Trans-Atlantic dimension and
does not think that the United States should be squeezed out of
Europe."
</P>
<P>
"But we will not accept attempts to push Russia aside in
Europe," Ivanov stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the importance of economic and technological
cooperation between the two countries. He said that Russian-U.S.
trade last year doubled and reached 8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov pointed out that bilateral economic relations are still
facing quite a few problems.

<HEADLINE> France Calls on U.N. Council to Decide on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- France Wednesday called on the
United Nations Security Council to decide on the follow-up actions
on Iraq, and stressed that the report submitted by the UNSCOM
conflicted with that of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA).
</P>
<P>
"We noted that the first document (by the UNSCOM) is negative
and the second (by the IAEA) is positive," said French Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
The report submitted by chief of the UNSCOM Richard Butler said
that Iraq had failed to cooperate fully with his weapons
inspectors, while the letter from IAEA chief Mohamed El Baradei to
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said that Iraq had provided "the
necessary level of cooperation" to IAEA inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Concerning Mr. Butler's report, its substance and the question
it raises must be examined in depth by the Security Council. The
Security Council will then decide on the follow-up actions," said
the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
She also criticized the U.N. for failing to consult the members
of the Security Council, as it was in previous cases, before
withdrawing weapons inspectors from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"This decision was not preceded by consultations within the
Security Council, as should normally be the case, and as we have
asked for in the past in similar circumstances," she said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council will hold an emergency
session Wednesday to discuss the situation of Iraq, during which
France and Russia are expected to oppose the stand of the United
States and Britain on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have threatened to strike Iraq
without pre-warning and without U.N. mandate.

<HEADLINE> Hodler under Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Marc Hodler, the
vice-president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) from
switzerland, said on Wednesday he was undeterred by the storm
which had arisen over his accusations of corruption in the
Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that certain people were afraid of this affair
and were intent on sweeping it all under the carpet. I wanted to
put the pressure on," Hodler was quoted by the Neue Zuercher
Zeitung as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plot had earlier thickened after Hodler said he was under
political pressure to tone down his attack for fear it could harm
a Swiss bid for the 2006 Winter Olympic Games, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Hodler, whose allegations of financial wrongdoing in the
bidding process caused a row at the weekend, said Swiss Foreign
Minister Flavio Cotti had advised him against pressing for the
creation of a commission of enquiry in case it scuppered the
Swiss city of Sion's attempt to stage the 2006 Winter Games.

<HEADLINE> Education Holds Key to Development: Ethiopian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of
Education Genet Zewdie said Wednesday that education, particularly
that of young girls and boys, holds the key to the development.
</P>
<P>
Launching of 1999 State of the World's Children Report at the
United Nations Conference Center here, Genet noted that education is
the most important factor in combating many social and economic
problems prevailing in developing countries, without making education
accessable to their people, developing countries can not achieve
economic growth and increase social development on a sustainable
basis.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the focus of this year's State of the
World's Children Report is education, which "is one of the major
challenges that we all face as we move towards the new
millennium."
</P>
<P>
According to the report, about 21 percent of primary
school-age children worldwide are out of school and an estimated 855
million people (nearly one-sixth of humanity) are likely to be
functionally illiterate at the end of this century. While in
developing countries, over 150 million children started school but did
not reach grade five.
</P>
<P>
Referring to educational state in Ethiopia, Genet said the
budget to education grew from seven percent to about 14 percent in the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
A five-year Educational Sector Development Program aims at
increasing the primary school enrollment to 50 percent and girls
enrollment to 45 percent by the end of the year 2001, she added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony, Per Engebak, Representative
of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), pointed out that
"Mass illiteracy exists because of the world has failed to make good
on its commitment to ensure the right of basic primary education for
every child."
</P>
<P>
He said that the global cost of meeting those commitments has
been estimated to be an additional 7 billion U.S. Dollars a year over
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
"Seven billion Dollars is less than its spent each year on
cosmetics in the United States -- or ice cream in Europe. And
the total education spending package of 70 billion Dollars is
less than one-tenth of what the world spends militarily in just
one year," he stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Wednesday disclosed that the proposed Lusaka summit on
ncy ZANA.
</P>
<P>
The summit was put off due to commitments by various heads of
states on the dates that were earlier proposed, Chiluba explained
when briefing the press before departure for Burkina Faso to
attend a meeting of the Organisation of African Union (OAU) which
takes place Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Answering whether the rebels fighting President Laurent Kabila
in Congo (K) will be invited to the discussions after they were
denied access to previous meetings, Chiluba said he is positive
they will be invited.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian leader has been mandated by the Southern African
Development Community states to mediate the Congo (K) conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Many steps have been made and all parties to the conflict
will attend and possibly agree to a ceasefire before other
internal procedures take place," Chiluba noted.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which was originally scheduled for December 8 and
later re-scheduled for December 14, were postponed because of the
objection of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa argued that it was wasting time to hold the
meeting without the participation of the rebels who claimed to
have controlled half of the territory of the vast central African
country.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who has invited Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad to
help quell the rebellion, insisted that his government only
wanted to hold talks with Uganda and Rwanda that are backing the
Tutsi-led rebels.
</P>
<P>
While the rebels earlier expressed clearly their stand that
any cease-fire would be meaningless if the government didn't hold
direct peace talks with them.

commitments in the 1995 Dayton peace accords, and called for
respect for the country's independence and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The document said the international community would gradually
reduce its aid to Bosnia in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it said, the Bosnian people should make good use of
the time to develop their economy, create more job opportunities
and improve their living standards so that they could manage to do
without foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called on all parties in Bosnia to work harder
to create political, economic and security conditions for the
return of the large number of refugees in 1999.
</P>
<P>
It promised that the international community would provide
necessary aid to facilitate the return of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also called on the Bosnian authorities to
closely cooperate with the international community and shoulder
greater responsibility in the implementation of the Dayton peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, which opened on Tuesday, had
participants from 43 countries and 17 international
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Has Broken Its Promises, Says Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- United Kingdom Prime Minister
Tony Blair said Wednesday that the Iraqis had broken pledges to
let the United Nations arms inspectors return to Baghdad and
resume their work unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Blair told the House of Commons, the lower house of parliament,
that U.N. chief inspector Richard Butler's report to
Secretary-General Koff Annan clearly listed obstacles such as
delays and refusal to provide documents.
</P>
<P>
The allies had the necessary authority needed to launch air
strikes, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said the Iraqis operated a "plan of
deceit" to prevent inspections.
</P>
<P>
In the last round of the Iraqi crisis, the prime minister had
warned that the United States and UK forces in the Gulf would
strike Iraq without previous warning next time when necessary.
</P>
<P>
Butler said Tuesday Iraq had failed to restore full cooperation
with his weapon experts.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman said earlier that the Moslem holy month of
Ramadan, due to start later this week, was a serious consideration
in deciding the time of any attack.
</P>
<P>
"This is not something that can be done in the click of a
finger," the spokesman said when asked about the possible timing
of a strike.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Wednesday suspended its scheduled consultations to meet on
Iraq at 11:30 (EST), the U.N. Spokesman's Office announced.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told reporters Wednesday
morning that he would attend the council meeting on Iraq after he
received a call from Peter Burlegh, charge d'affaires of the U.S.
Mission to the United Nations, who said that Washington has asked
U.S. citizens in the Gulf to leave the area.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would discuss the issue of Iraq with Security
Council members to know what was going on inside the world body.
</P>
<P>
Some of the U.N. humanitarian personnel had left Iraq and the
United Nations had grouped the remaining personnel in one location
in Iraq for their own safety, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The council decision to shift its focus of attention to the
issue of Iraq came after chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler
has presented his long-awaited report to Annan, who later handed
it over to the 15-member Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued late Tuesday, said that Iraq had imposed new
restrictions on arms inspections, that was seen as Baghdad's
failure to offer full cooperation with the U.N. arms inspection
group, known as the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Butler said Iraq's lack of full cooperation made it impossible
for inspectors to determine that Baghdad had eliminated its
prohibited weapons, a key requirement for lifting stringent U.N.
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council held a scheduled meeting Wednesday morning
on the maintenance of peace and security and post-conflict
peace-building.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided to suspend the consultations and
immediately go into the discussion on Iraq, a U.N. official told
Xinhua. The council is expected to resume consultations on
peace-building at the end of the consultations on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government called for an emergent meeting of the
Security Council while a French government spokesman voiced the
hope that a military strike could be avoided.

<HEADLINE> Gore Urges Congress Not to Impeach Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
called on Congress Wednesday to "turn away from the bitter
partisanship" and spare President Bill Clinton from impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"I believe on Capitol Hill there is still time for Democrats
and Republicans to come together and embrace a bipartisan
compromise to seek a resolution that is both quick and fair and
try to turn away from the bitter partisanship that we have seen so
far," Gore said at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president's call came one day before the House of
Representatives is expected to start debate Thursday on the four
articles of impeachment approved last week by the Republican-led
House Judiciary Committee. They include two counts of perjury, one
of obstruction of justice and one of abuse of power in connection
with the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
A House vote for impeachment would send the case to the Senate
for a trial, where 67 votes, or two-thirds majority, would be
needed to remove Clinton from office -- a result no one expects.
</P>
<P>
Gore canceled a trip to New Hampshire to stay in Washington and
he tried to rally fresh support to stop Clinton from becoming only
the second chief executive to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
The prospects for Clinton avoiding impeachment in a House vote
continued to worsen as more undecided Republicans declared their
intention to vote to remove Clinton.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, whom
Clinton defeated in the 1996 presidential race, suggested that the
Senate could head off a protracted impeachment trial by passing a
joint resolution to censure Clinton and sending it to the House.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the House justifying the four articles of
impeachment along party lines, Judiciary Committee Republicans
said Clinton "disgraced himself and the high office he holds."
</P>
<P>
"His high crimes and misdemeanors undermine our Constitution.
They warrant his impeachment, his removal from office and his
disqualification from holding further office," the Republican
report said.
</P>
<P>
A draft version of the minority report, by the committee's
Democrats, concluded, "We do not believe that the nature of the
misconduct is the mettle with which the founding fathers intended
impeachments to be made."
</P>
<P>
Repeating a theme sounded by Democrats in impeachment hearings,
the minority report said that even if the allegations were true,
they don't merit "impeaching a president, thereby decapitating the
executive branch and disenfranchising the electorate."

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Highway Construction in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Wednesday
announced the approval of a 200 million U.S. dollar loan to China
for construction of the 152-kilometer-long Hefei-Anqing
expressway.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the Hefei-Anqing expressway is the main
component of the Anhui provincial highway project. This year
expressway would link the two major cities in the province and
eventually be part of two longer expressways in China's national
trunk highway system, linking the low-income province to the
markets of the coastal region and its deepwater ports.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, 240 km of existing provincial highways would
also be widened and rehabilitated to keep up with the area's
rapidly increasing congestion.
</P>
<P>
The overall project cost is some 453.9 million dollars. The
Chinese government will contribute 253.9 million dollars for the
project.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder to Review Tax Reform Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN. December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
plans to review his government's much-criticized tax reform
proposals prior to starting work on tax legislation, a government
spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see whether certain objections of small and
medium-sized companies are justified," said Schroeder's spokesman
Uwe-Karsten Heye.
</P>
<P>
The review of tax reform plans by Schroeder's full cabinet was
expected to take place on February 17, he said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's tax plans have come under furious criticism from
Germany's business and banking communities.
</P>
<P>
Under the center-left government's current plan, corporate
income tax would only drop in 2002, although Schroeder has said a
cut might come in 2000 if enough revenue was available.
</P>
<P>
Personal income tax rates, which now range from 25.9 percent
for low earners and 53 percent for higher incomes, would be
trimmed on a step-by-step basis to between 19.9 and 48.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Germany's central Bundesbank joined the attack on
Schroeder's tax reform in its December report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas reductions mainly benefit private households, the
counterfinancing is mainly concentrated on companies so that there
is an additional tax burden for this sector despite tax cuts,"
said the Bundesbank report.
</P>
<P>
"This could make investment conditions more difficult, even if
domestic private consumption is positively influenced," said the
report.

</P>
<P>
An interest-free credit equivalent to 194.1 million dollars is

</P>
<P>
The credit will be channeled through the International
Development Association, the World Bank's concessionary lending
wing for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
A loan of 23.3 million dollars will be used to help the

<HEADLINE> German Government Still Divided on Nuclear Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
Red-Green government Wednesday ended its last cabinet session
before the Christmas holiday divided over how to push ahead with
plans to shut nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
"In its objective the coalition is in full agreement, but the
way to get there has not been fully agreed," admitted Schroeder's
spokesman, Uwe-Karsten Heye.
</P>
<P>
Heye said parameters for a law aimed at long-term closure of
nuclear plants would be agreed by a January 13 meeting of the
chancellor and his economic and environment ministers.
</P>
<P>
Bonn's center-left government agreed in its coalition pact to
shut Germany's 19 nuclear power stations, which produce about 30
percent of the country's electricity.
</P>
<P>
Green Environment Minister Juergen Trittin wanted a fast
closure and had sought to force through strict nuclear power
legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
But Schroeder and his Social Democratic (SPD) Economics
Minister Werner Mueller want to reach a consensus over closure
with nuclear power station operators, meaning the process will
take much longer to complete.
</P>
<P>
At dispute are possible legal demands for compensation both
from nuclear operators and from British and French reprocessing
plants which have contracts to take spent German nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
Trittin and the Greens believe there is little danger of the
government being forced to pay compensation either for shutting
plants -- which currently have indefinite operating licenses -- or
for breaking contracts with British and French reprocessing
concerns.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder and Mueller, however, fear that without talks on a
consensus basis the plant closures could end up with a massive
bill for the government.
</P>
<P>
Heye told reporters that talks with Germany's nuclear plant
operators would start in late January.

<HEADLINE> Angola Gets Better Harvest This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Angola sees a better harvest
this year over last year, with a plenty of rain in most parts of
the country and increased supply of fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
A bulletin issued Wednesday by the Agricultural Ministry said
that in northern part of the country, the output of maize
increased by 51 percent, and that of cassava by 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
But because of the continued military conflicts in northern
Angola's Malange Province, many farmers have been forced to fleed
their homes and the province has to depend on relief food.
</P>
<P>
In central part of the country, many farmers harvested next to
nothing, after the farmers had used seeds imported from Brazil,
which have proved as unsuitable for the climate in central
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The Cunene Province in southern Mozambique experienced severe
drought and locusts plague this year which marginally reduced the
agricultural production in the province.
</P>
<P>
The war-ridden country, which has to rely on international
food aid for 10 years, was estimated in May by the World Food
Program to need about 470,000 tons of food aid this year.

<HEADLINE> China Calls on Security Council to Do More on World Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday called
on the U.N. Security Council to respond positively to the repeated
appeals of African countries and translate its attention to
African issues into concrete deeds.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the Security Council to refrain itself from being
involved in internal conflicts in some countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Qin Huasun, China's permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at the
Security Council on the maintenance of peace and security and
post-conflict peace-building.
</P>
<P>
"The prime responsibility of the council in maintaining
international peace and security is both unshirkable and
irreplaceable," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
In regions like Africa and Central Asia, where war and conflict
persist, to put an end to the conflicts at an early date so as to
create a secure environment for their socio-economic development
has become the top priority of the international community, and
thus calls for the meaningful support and assistance of the United
Nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary for the council to respond positively to the
repeated appeals of African countries and translate its attention
to African issues into concrete deeds," he said. "The council
should play an especially constructive role" on such questions as
that of Somalia, Sierra Leone, the Great Lake region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The council "should take into serious consideration the
reasonable requests of Africa, effectively assist in and
coordinate with the African efforts and give active support to
regional organizations like OAU (the Organization of African
Unity) that are in want of necessary funds and technical
expertise."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese ambassador called upon the Security
Council not to get involved in internal conflicts in some
countries.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, the council has become more, rather than
less, involved in the internal conflicts in some countries," he
said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> IAEA Relocates Its Personnel From Iraq to Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The director-general of
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mohamed Elbaradei,
had decided to temporarily relocate to Bahrain all its personnel
currently in Iraq, a U.N. release said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The release said this action was taken after the decision by
the Untied Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), on whose logistic
support the IAEA's activities in Iraq are dependent under the
existing arrangement, to withdraw all of its personnel from Iraq
and out of concern for the safety and security of IAEA personnel.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, executive chairman of the UNSCOM in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, reported late
Tuesday that Iraq had failed to cooperate fully with the U.N. arms
inspectors in the past month.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA Tuesday said it got satisfactory cooperation from Iraq
since it promised to resume full cooperation with the U.N. on
November 14.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to launch military strikes
against Iraq for its failure to cooperate fully with U.N. arms
inspectors at any time and without consultations with the Untied
Nations Security Council.

<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein called on his people and armed
forces to fully mobilize and make all necessary arrangements to
face the imminent U.S. air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The call came during a joint meeting of the Revolutionary
Command Council and the ruling Baath party leadership at which
they discussed the status quo and reviewed all the relevant
measures to confront the possible U.S. and British military
actions.
</P>
<P>
A statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency after the joint
session Wednesday evening said the leadership reviewed all
necessary precautions and measures to confront the American-British
aggression.
</P>
<P>
It has become undoubtedly clear that they have been planning
for a long time to try their doomed luck to launch once again
another aggression as they are being pushed by their malice and
hatred and by Zionism, it said.
</P>

The statement said the Iraqi people withstood a great deal of
sufferings and survived lots of mischaps over the previous years.

<P>
The Iraqi leadership tolerated similar aching experiences, it
said, adding that the enemies of the country made the Iraqi people
a target for their hostilities through force or through sanctions

<P>
The statement urged the Iraqi people to be ready for
confronting the American aggression, saying they will be the losers
as they had lost and failed during the great encounter of the
mother of all battles.

<P>
It said the Iraqi leadership would lead the confrontation
against the U.S. aggression and would strongly back the Iraqi
people.

U.N. Security Council or the international community for support

Meles Zenawi left here Wednesday for Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso to
attend the summit of the Central Organ of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management
and Resolution.
</P>
<P>
The seven-month Ethio-Eritrean border dispute is one of the

KUWAIT CITY, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Minister of
Commerce and Industry Abdel Aziz Dekheel Al-Dekheel was appointed
deputy prime minister and minister of state for cabinet affairs
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
His duties were taken by Heshan Suleiman Al-Oteibi, a veteran
economist, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The changes were announced in a decree signed by Prime Minister
Crown Prince Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The portfolio of deputy prime minister and minister of state
for cabinet affairs remained vacant since the Kuwaiti government
approved on November 1 the resignation of Nasser Abdullah
Al-Roudhan.
</P>
<P>
Al-Roudhan submitted his resignation for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
Al-Oteibi has been director general of the Kuwait Stock
Exchange since 1987 and also head of the Arab Bourse Union in
1987-1988 and 1995-1996.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Minister: Bank Sale Report "Misleading" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A Ugandan cabinet minister
Wednesday categorically refuted a report of the country's leading
daily New Vision on the sale of Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB) as
misleading.
</P>
<P>
Kehoash Mayanja Nkangi, the Ugandan Minister of Justice and
Constitutional Affairs, told a press conference that the report
entitled "Nkangi Names State House in UCB Sale" implies that
President Yoweri Museveni was involved in the UCB saga while he
did not mean it in his defense report in the parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister clarified that Engineer Kabanda, the former
principal private secretary of the president had inquired whether
the 49 percent shares of UCB bought by a Malaysian company could
be sold to anybody else.
</P>
<P>
He advised journalists to find and check and to be
responsible for their reporting.
</P>
<P>
The Westmont Holdings of Malaysia bought 49 percent shares in
UCB last year and it reportedly sold the shares to Salim Saleh,
President Museveni's younger brother, which is a clear breach of
the sale agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates that the buyer of the shares cannot
sell them within three years unless authorized by the Ugandan
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Saleh admitted 10 days ago that he used Westmont as a front to
buy UCB because his Greenland Investments was disqualified as a
bidder by the Bank of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The illegal transfer of shares reportedly led to heavy losses
to the government and some ministers involved in the matter
either resigned or are facing censure from the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Iran Optimistic to Pipe Central Asian Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami here Wednesday expressed optimism that Iran would win in
the competition to become the main route for transporting Central
Asian oil and gas to Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Despite all the efforts by the U.S. and the Zionists
(Israelis) to prevent transfer of the Central Asian energy to
Europe through Iran, I am of the belief that Iran would be the
route for transfer of the energy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to staff members of the Oil Ministry, he said that the
European countries would give priority to their national
interests, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The United States has strongly opposed the option to pipe oil
and gas across Iran, which it regards as an avowed enemy.
</P>
<P>
Tehran hoped economic considerations will finally prevail,
saying that Iranian route is the shortest and the most economic
one for Central Asian energy to reach world markets.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the U.S. sanctions against Iran's vast oil
resources accentuate the importance of the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Over the past half century, he said, 90 percent of the
country's foreign exchange revenues and 60 percent of its
domestic income have been from the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
He called for fundamental changes in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been vying for the vastly rewarding project of
transporting oil and gas from the Caspian nations to Europe, with
other competitors, among which are Russia and Turkey, which has
the backing of Washington.

<HEADLINE> Bundesbank Sees Dark Clouds Ahead for German Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The German central bank, the
Bundesbank, has painted a bleak economic picture of Germany in its
latest monthly report, with uncertainty created by the
government's new tax plans adding to the loss in growth caused by
the emerging markets crisis.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the Bundesbank said in its December report
released Wednesday that slumping foreign orders had left
"significant economic skidmarks," with the export of goods falling
in the third quarter of 1998 for the first time in about three
years.
</P>
<P>
And with German unemployment remaining at stubbornly high
levels, Germany's influential central bank said that Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's new center-left coalition could help to boost
jobs and investment by offering companies cuts in taxes and other
levies.
</P>
<P>
In the light of the current uncertain economic outlook, the
Bundesbank appealed to the government along with both employers
and unions to help to ensure a stable political climate.
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, the Bundesbank called on the unions and
employers to promote a moderate wage outcome in the country
combined with steps aimed at dealing with the jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Bundesbank argued that creating jobs and
consequently ensuring a lasting reduction in unemployment should
also be accompanied by increasing productivity together with
employment incentives for companies.
</P>
<P>
But the Bundesbank was also clear about the role the German
government had to play in underpinning the labor market.
</P>
<P>
"The government could contribute more to investment and new job
creation if it held out the prospects for companies of a
significant reduction in taxes and the total burden of levies,"
the Bundesbank said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the fall in foreign orders from oil-producing
nations and regions hit by financial turmoil, the Bundesbank saw
German export industries facing tough price competition from Asia
and as a result having to offer goods at more competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
This is also likely to occur against the backdrop of a weaker
U.S. dollar, which would be expected to hit German exports.
</P>
<P>
In its report, the Bundesbank singled out two key German export
industries, the chemical and machine engineering sectors which it
said had suffered in recent months as a result of the state of the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
During the third quarter, the delivery of German goods to Asian
nations had dropped by 31 percent compared with a year earlier,
falling by 10 percent to Japan and 10 percent to OPEC
oil-producing countries, which have faced a slump in oil prices
following the emerging markets crisis.
</P>
<P>
But the Bundesbank noted that because of the comparatively
small role of exports to regions hit by financial woes, the
economic fallout on Germany could be limited, with exports to key
markets in the European Union and the United States likely to grow
by 4.5 percent and 11.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
A key pillar of domestic orders has been the recent strong
performance of Germany's car industry.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank, however, saw limits on the growth in domestic
consumer spending with the marked expansion of consumption partly
a result of consumers resorting to savings.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bundesbank, at 11.75 percent, private savings
are now at an historic low.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Issue Depends on Two Communities: Peres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres said here Wednesday that a solution to the political
issue in Cyprus depends on the two communities in the island.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Peres said his advice to the Greek
Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities on the island was "to get
on with the process" themselves.
</P>
<P>
"My best advice is for them to decide. We can help, we can
support but basically it is in your hands, as it was in our case,"
the Nobel Peace Prize winner said.
</P>
<P>
However, in the case of Cyprus "it is a little bit more
difficult because negotiations are not only between the Turks and
the Greeks who live on the island but also between Turkey and
Greece."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed
 its troops and took over the northern third of the island in
1974 following a failed pro-Athens coup. The U.N.-led efforts to
reunite Cyprus have so far yielded no results.
</P>
<P>
Peres also expressed the view that a solution will be found
once all three countries, Cyprus, Greece and Turkey become
European Union (EU) members.
</P>
<P>
Peres was here to present trade awards to 12 Cypriot companies
which have close business ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is very clear. the island should be united, the
parties should discuss," Peres said.
</P>
<P>
Peres left here later Wednesday. During his stay in Cyprus, he
met with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Speaker of the
House of Representatives Spyros Kyprianou.

LUSAKA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Wednesday disclosed that the proposed Lusaka summit on
Congo (K) crisis which has been put off twice in the past week
will be held on December 27 and 28.
</P>
<P>
The summit was put off due to commitments by various heads of
states on the dates that were earlier proposed, Chiluba explained
when briefing the press before departure for Burkina Faso to
attend a meeting of the Organization of African Union (OAU) which
takes place Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Answering whether the rebels fighting President Laurent Kabila
in Congo (K) will be invited to the discussions after they were
denied access to previous meetings, Chiluba said he is positive
they will be invited, according to the Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian leader has been mandated by the Southern African
Development Community states to mediate the Congo (K) conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Many steps have been made and all parties to the conflict
will attend and possibly agree to a ceasefire before other
internal procedures take place," Chiluba noted.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which was originally scheduled for December 8 and
later re-scheduled for December 14, were postponed because of the
objection of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa argued that it was wasting time to hold the
meeting without the participation of the rebels who claimed to
have controlled half of the territory of the vast central African
country.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who has invited Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad to
help quell the rebellion, insisted that his government only
wanted to hold talks with Uganda and Rwanda that are backing the
Tutsi-led rebels.
</P>
<P>
While the rebels earlier expressed clearly their stand that
any cease-fire would be meaningless if the government didn't hold
direct peace talks with them.

GENEVA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Wednesday
launched consolidated appeals covering humanitarian assistance
needs during 1999 in more than 10 countries.
</P>
<P>
"We, the organizations of the United Nations system and our

1.3 billion U.S. dollars for urgent humanitarian assistance," said

affairs and emergency relief coordinator.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 figure is lower than the 1998 amount of 2.2 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This figure is roughly equivalent to a half day's total
military expenditure but will serve to protect some 25 million
people from starvation or disease, and help to rebuild lives
destroyed by the scourge of war," Vieira de Mello said on behalf
of the U.N. agencies and programs.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Urged to Release Israelis on Spy Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres on Wednesday called on the Cypriot authorities to
show mercy to the two Israelis charged with spying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two Israelis committed a "mistake but not a
crime," saying that they were fighting terrorism and not acting
against Cyprus and that he would like to see them released.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of his two-day
visit, Peres expressed regret for what he described "a local
accident" and said "they did not want to cause any harm or hard
feeling between our people."
</P>
<P>
Expressing respect for the independence of the judiciary in
Cyprus, as far as the case is concerned, he said "we can ask for
understanding but we cannot force anybody to do anything."
</P>
<P>
Peres said if Cyprus does not consider this a mistake it would
harm bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"It was not any attempt to spy on Cyprus or against Cyprus,
this is nonsense. It is a local accident which we regret very
much because we learned that it caused some bad feelings among the
Cypriot people and this surely we did not want," Peres said.
</P>
<P>
The two Israelis, Udi Hargov, 37, and Igal Damary, 49, were
arrested in November on charges of spying, conspiracy to spy and
possession of banned audio equipment. They are due to appear
before court on Monday.

<HEADLINE> MPs Sign to Censure Minister in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Over 120 members of
parliament in Uganda have so far signed a motion seeking to
censure a minister who they said should be responsible for the
improprieties in the privatization of parastatals in the country.
</P>
<P>
The MPs accused Sam Kuteesa, state minister in charge of
planning and investment, of playing a part in messing up the
privatization process of the country's key parastatals, Radio
Uganda reported Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians told Radio Uganda Wednesday afternoon
that they would censure him if he does not resign, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the minister said he is not corrupt and has not
used his close relationship with President Yoweri Museveni to
manipulate his way in business.
</P>
<P>
He also attacked the report of a parliamentary probe team,
saying it was unfair to him and vowing that he will not resign.
</P>
<P>
Kuteesa, who married the sister of the First Lady Janet
Museveni, bought 20 percent shares in the ground cargo handling
services under a consortium through his private company Global
Airlinks.
</P>
<P>
Some MPs accused the minister of political influence peddling,
financial impropriety and stripping the government of its assets
through dubious deals.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Envoy on Upholding World Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday voiced
its support for the active involvement of the U.N. system in the
efforts for peace-consolidating and peace-building in
post-conflict regions.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, China's permanent representative to the United
Nations, made the statement as the U.N. Security Council met on
the maintenance of peace and security and post-conflict
peace-building.
</P>
<P>
"To maintain and consolidate peace after conflict requires
enormous efforts. In regions where war just ended, effective
support and assistance from the international community are needed
since the political and security structures in these regions are
still delicate and their economy has been severely damaged," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Qin put forward three proposals on making and
consolidating peace in post-conflict regions.
</P>
<P>
First, equal attention should be given to all post-conflict
regions.
</P>
<P>
"We have noted with concern that certain hot issues have become
the focus of attention while some others have been unfairly put on
the back burners," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We see that in some places where there is no longer the threat
to international peace and security, U.N. peace-keeping operations
are still on the ground; while at the same time, other places,
like Africa, in much harder humanitarian and economic situations
are stuck in various kinds of difficulties in getting capital
assistance and the involvement of the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, in the peace-consolidating process in post-conflict
regions, international efforts should be turned to the will of the
country concerned.
</P>
<P>
"The international community should get involved only on the
basis of the commitments to maintaining the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and political independence of the country
concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Consideration should be given to the most pressing needs of
the country concerned, namely, the funds and technical assistance
that it needs most in its rehabilitation and development," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"China has all along been opposed to attaching political
conditions to assistance, even more strongly to the practice of
using the involvement in post-conflict peace-building to sell
one's own value or achieve any political ends," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, what is most needed in post-conflict reconstruction is
capital and technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
Being gravely concerned over the marginalization of relevant
U.N. functions, Qin said, "The role and capacity of U.N. organs in
the socio-economic field should be strengthened."
</P>
<P>
"We are even more strongly opposed to the weakening of the role
of U.N. organs in the socio-economic fields on the one hand, while
putting the large load of social issues on the agenda of the
Security Council on the other," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in favor of putting all the problems in all
conflict areas in the hands of the Security Council, not least on
the ground of the division of work among the various organs of the
organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not good for the normal functioning of other U.N.
organs, including the General Assembly that is composed of all
U.N. member states," he said. "At the same time, such practices
might dilute the priority and impair the efficiency of the work of
the Security Council."

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Rap Netanyahu for Procrastinating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) blasted Israel Wednesday for its decision to
postpone the pending troop withdrawal under the latest peace deal
but vowed it would be committed to its obligations.
</P>
<P>
Upon returning from a short trip to Cairo, PNA Chairman Yasser
Arafat said in Gaza that the decision made by the Israeli cabinet
earlier Wednesday was "clear and dangerous violations" of the Wye
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he doubted that Washington, who helped broker the
deal in October, would agree to the postponement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet reaffirmed at a special meeting Wednesday
morning that Israel will not begin implementing the second stage
of troop withdrawal on Friday as scheduled because the PNA has not
fulfilled its obligations.
</P>
<P>
PNA Planning and International Cooperation Minister Nabil
Sha'ath said the Palestinians have fulfilled and will be committed
to all of its obligations.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour, however, warned that the
PNA would consider suspending implementing its part of the
agreement in reaction to Israel's decision, stressing that the
commitments must be mutual.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who convened the
cabinet meeting to report on the three-day visit by U.S. President
Bill Clinton to Israel and Palestinian areas, repeated his
position that Israel will not carry out its part of the agreement
until the Palestinians fulfill all their obligations.
</P>
<P>
He put the troop withdrawal on hold last week amid widespread
violence in the West Bank, sparked by Israel's refusal to release
Palestinian political prisoners, and other alleged Palestinian
violations.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, Clinton failed to persuade Netanyahu, who
faces strong pressure from the hardliners in his coalition, to
stick to the timetable set in the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by Netanyahu and Arafat at the White
House in October, calls on Israel to relinquish 13 percent more of
the West Bank in exchange for tougher Palestinian measures on
anti-Israeli violence.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu repeated at the cabinet meeting that the Palestinians
have to meet a list of demands before Israel agrees to carry out
the troop withdrawal, including curbing violence, confiscating
illegal weapons and abandoning the intention to declare a
Palestinian state unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
But the PNA said it has fulfilled all of its obligations,
including revoking the anti-Israel clauses in its national
charter as demanded, and accused Netanyahu of shifting his
internal pressure on the Palestinian side.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Poised for Air Strike at Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. military forces are
"in execute mode" as President Bill Clinton was pondering how to
make a response to what Washington believed was Iraq's lack of
full cooperation with weapons inspectors, U.S. officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, just back from the Middle East, sat down with his
foreign policy advisers Wednesday morning in the White House
Situation Room. They met there for about 45 minutes and were
expected to confer throughout the day, one official said.
</P>
<P>
"We're in an execute mode," a senior defense official said. "If
somebody dials 911, we're ready to go."
</P>
<P>
"This is obviously a very serious situation. All options are on
the table," including air strikes, one White House national
security aide said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. force strength in the Gulf was unusually high with over
200 warplanes and 20 warships and 15 B-52 bombers on the Indian
Ocean island of Diego Garcia, each capable of firing 20
air-launched cruise missiles with 2,000 pound high explosive
warheads.
</P>
<P>
The missiles can fly up to 1,000 miles (1,600 km) and guided by
satellites in space, strike small targets with pinpoint accuracy.
</P>
<P>
Britain has 18 Tornado attack jets in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Radar-avoiding U.S. F-117A stealth attack jets have not been
sent to the Gulf this time, and defense officials said privately
initial attacks are likely to chiefly involve cruise missiles to
keep U.S. and British pilots out of harms' way.
</P>
<P>
In addition to more than 70 naval aircraft on the aircraft
carrier Enterprise, the U.S. Air Force has four big swing-wing B-1
bombers based in Oman and some 90 F-15, F-16 and A-10 attack jets
based in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Lawmakers Debate New Government Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese parliament started a
two-day debate Wednesday on the policy statement submitted by the
newly formed government two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Eleven deputies representing their factions in the 128-seat
parliament addressed the meeting, during which the new cabinet is
pending a vote of endorsement.
</P>
<P>
Although parliament member Walid Jumblatt, former Druze militia
leader during the country's 1975-1990 civil war, attacked some
proposals in the statement and decided not to vote for the
cabinet, most deputies gave backings to the new government.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member cabinet was formed by Prime Minister designate
Salim Hoss early this month following the resignation of former
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Hariri served over the past six years
under former President Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts attributed Hariri's quit mainly to his
struggle with current President Emile Lahoud over the formation of
the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
He was also disappointed that some of his one-time allies in
his cabinet refused to nominate him as head of the first
government under Lahoud, who took office in October, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to parliament procedures, the legislators will go on
with their debate Thursday morning and cast their votes in the
evening. Analysts forecast that the government will be approved.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Continue Meeting on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council will continue emergency consultations on Iraq Wednesday
afternoon, council president Jassim Buallay said.
</P>
<P>
The council started the closed-door meeting at 10:45 a.m. (EST)
Wednesday on the follow-up actions after chief U.N. arms
inspector's report raised the specter of a military confrontation
between the U.S. and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, with the attendance of U.N. Secretary-general Kofi
Annan, adjourned at 1:20 p.m. and Buallay said the discussions
will resume at 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to tell the press about the outcome at the end
of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, executive chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, reported late Tuesday that Iraq failed to live up to
its promise to cooperate fully with the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the United States have threatened to launch
military strikes against Iraq "at any time."
</P>
<P>
The council had a scheduled day-long meeting Wednesday on the
maintenance of peace and security and post-conflict peace
building.
</P>
<P>
As the Iraq issue has emerged, the 15-member council decided to
suspend the scheduled meeting and began consultations on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It intended to resume the scheduled meeting at 3:00 p.m., but it
changed the agenda again, leaving the afternoon session to
consultations on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Butler's Report Against Fact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said Wednesday
that it has offered "full cooperation" with U.N. arms inspectors,
especially during the past three weeks, and the U.N. Special
Commission, or UNSCOM in charge of disarming the Mideast country,
presented a report which "is against the fact on the ground."
</P>
<P>
Nizar Hamdoon, Iraqi permanent representative to the United
Nations, made the statement after the Security Council adjourned
its morning session on Iraq. The 15-member council is scheduled to
hold consultations on a report presented by Richard Butler, the
chairman of the UNSCOM, at 3:30 p.m. (EST).
</P>
<P>
"The report is against the fact that has emerged on the ground
over the last three weeks" and "the UNSCOM is very much
politically motivated, very much politically motivated and very
influenced by the policy of the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
Butler said in the report, presented to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan late Tuesday before Annan handed it over to the
Security Council, that Iraq failed to fully cooperate with U.N.
arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has done its best to meet its obligation" by fully
cooperating with the UNSCOM, Hamdoon said. The Iraqi statement was
supported by a Tuesday report from the International Atomic Energy
Agency, which said that it had got satisfactory cooperation from
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Butler has had a heavy attack" from some of the 15 Security
Council members Wednesday morning as he was briefing the Security
Council on his report, Hamdoon said, adding that Butler was
criticized for "his way of preparing his report and his decision
to withdraw personnel out of Iraq without informing the Security
Council at appropriate time."
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. Spokesman's Office quoted Butler as saying
that he made the withdrawal decision after his conversation with
Annan.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM, a body under the Security Council, should seek the
council's approval before taking any decision.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president of the Security Council for the month of
December, Jassim Buallay of Bahrain, told reporters that he could
not speak any more beyond the simple announcement of the council's
resumption of the discussion Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But he promised to inform the press of the outcome after the
council's upcoming afternoon session on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, which suspended its previously scheduled
consultations on other issues, decided to begin discussion on
Butler's report at the request of Russia, who called for an
emergent council meeting on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the council's peace efforts, championed by China,
France and Russia, Iraq has narrowly averted the U.S. military
strikes in mid-November.

<HEADLINE> Chechen President Not to Impose Curfew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 16 (Xinhua) -- There is no plan in the Chechen
administration to impose a curfew on the breakaway republic
following the declaration of a state of emergency, the Chechen
president's spokesman Mairbek Vachagayev said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decision to exercise a one-month state of emergency on the
territory of Chechnya was declared by the Chechen parliament
Tuesday. The state of emergency began at 0:00 local time
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya declared the state of emergency in order to step up
the crackdown on criminals and to end the nearly daily kidnappings
in the republic.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of a state emergency would not affect
citizens' basic rights and freedoms, and it "allows Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov to tackle crime problems more promptly,
involve reserve forces and use weapons," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, by Wednesday morning, five regiments and nine
battalions had been formed out of reservists.
</P>
<P>
It was said that on Monday, the parliament turned down a
request by Maskhadov to mobilize army reservists as part of the
anti-crime effort. Lawmakers said reservists could only be
mobilized in the face of an external threat.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Interfax reported, ideological
preparations for special operations to combat criminals have
reached their peak.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov has urged the population to gather in Freedom Square
Thursday and state their attitudes on criminals and on actions to
combat them.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the situation in Chechnya remains tranquil
despite the declaration of a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
Kidnappings have become more and more frequent. Last week four
foreign hostages were beheaded in Chechnya, which shook the whole
world.

He expressed his belief that the project will become another
good example of the long-term friendly cooperation between China
and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Transport and Energy Minister Enos Chikowore also

BUCHAREST, December 16 (Xinhua) -- NATO will not make proposals
of enlargement at the summit due in Washington, next April,
marking 50 years of the alliance's existence, Bruce P. Jackson,

Romania continues to be an important candidate for NATO

The integration proper will occur around 2003-2004, said
Jackson who is currently paying an official visit to Romania. He
added he wants Romania to become, at least militarily, "a de facto
NATO member" before becoming a "de jure" one, with the completion
of the technicalities required for adhesion.
</P>

Jackson stressed that a political decision on the alliance's

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Hints at Possible Early Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday he would initiate early
elections next Monday if he could not muster a necessary majority
for his policy on the peace process with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Likud gathering celebrating the Jewish festival
of Hanukka in Tev Aviv, Netanyahu urged his coalition members and
opposition to support his decision to suspend the pending troop
withdrawal from the West Bank stipulated under a recent
land-for-peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Palestinians of a series of failures to comply
with the agreement and reiterated that Israel would not carry out
its part of the accord until the Palestinians fulfill all their
obligations. The cabinet reaffirmed his decision Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
He was obviously calling on the opposition Labor Party to form
a unity government with the Likud coalition by saying that "we
must unite the forces."
</P>
<P>
But in an effort to avoid the impression that he was wooing
the opposition, he stressed that "I'm not going to run after
somebody, to race after somebody."
</P>
<P>
"If there is no necessary majority to support this
decision...I will initiate new elections in order to get from the
people the mandate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu faces a no-confidence vote in the parliament next
Monday. Since some hardliners in his coalition who opposed the
peace agreement have vowed to topple his government, it seems
that he would certainly lose the vote.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were seen as a last bid to win back those rebels
in his coalition and to form a unity government with the Labor
Party before being forced to initiate early elections.
</P>
<P>
Since the Labor Party has no interest in rescuing him from the
brink of being brought down, his words could virtually be
interpreted as an announcement that there would be early
elections in Israel.

sectors, including information technology, telecommunications,
education, agri-food, engineering and construction.
</P>
<P>
"These four markets together accounted for more than 1 billion
Canadian dollars (650 million U.S. dollars) of Canadian exports in
1997," said Marchi in a release issued Wednesday. "I welcome this
opportunity to support Canadian companies active in the region and
help them gain a competitive edge."
</P>
<P>
In Riyadh, Marchi will participate in the ninth session of the
Canada-Saudi Joint Economic Commission and meet with a number of
Saudi government officials. In the United Arab Emirates, he will
open the new Canadian Embassy building in Abu Dhabi. On his first
visit to the West Bank, the minister will officially open the
Canadian Representative Office in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Marchi will also review the two-year-old Canada-Israel Free
Trade Agreement (CIFTA) and explore ways to further improve trade
with Israel. Under the CIFTA, two-way trade has increased more
than 34 percent, with exports to Israel surpassing 243 million
Canadian dollars (158 million U.S. dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Canadian exports to Saudi Arabia reached over 545
million Canadian dollars (354 million U.S. dollars), and over 257
million Canadian dollars (167 million U.S. dollars) to the United
Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Rises for Second Month in Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- British unemployment is
continuing to rise with the two measures of counting the number of
people out of work going up for the second month in a row.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced Wednesday
the number of British claiming jobless benefits rose by 5,900 last
month, after jumping by 10,700 in October.
</P>
<P>
Employment Minister Andrew Smith conceded that the rise in the
number of people claiming unemployment benefits was consistent
with an economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
However, the jobless rates remained unchanged at 4.6 percent of
the workforce on the claimant count and 6.2 percent on the
International Labor Organization measure.
</P>
<P>
The measure of unemployment which introduced by the government
earlier this year as a better reflection of the numbers looking
for work showed a fall of 129,000 on a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said the labor market generally continued to improve,
with employment rising and record numbers of job vacancies.
</P>
<P>
Gerard Lyons, an economist in the City, said, "Any rise in
unemployment is not a good thing for the economy but the market
was expecting a 10,000 rise."
</P>
<P>
Now the figure "is consistent with a modest pace of slowdown in
the economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe unemployment will rise next year. Accountants
Chantrey Vellacott said it could increase by 400,000 over the next
two years.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Iran to Boost Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Saudi-Iranian Trade
Committee concluded its two-day session Wednesday after reaching
an agreement on boosting economic and commercial cooperation
between the two countries, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed on encouraging investment in joint
projects and holding commercial exhibitions in both countries,
according to the final minutes of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A Saudi trade exhibition will be held soon in Iran, the
minutes said.
</P>
<P>
The committee also discussed means of promoting cooperation
between the Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation and the
private Iranian Petrochemicals Company, it said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a navigation line linking Saudi and
Iranian ports was also discussed during the meeting, the minutes
said, adding that Iran has expressed readiness to transit Saudi
products to central Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Saudi Arabia, once in mistrust to each other for
almost two decades, began to improve their relation since Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami took office last year.
</P>
<P>
The two countries saw a big boost in their ties since last
February when Iran's former president Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani paid a 14-day official visit to Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
Hence, the two sides have exchanged a number of other
high-level visits, during which talks on ways of boosting
bilateral ties and shoring up the sagging oil prices were held.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Decide Missile Issue After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will maake a decision
on the issue of missiles after the U.N. Security Council adopts
its resolution on Cyprus, said Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said after a cabinet meeting that "if, in the next
few days, the Security Council and particularly the international
community show sufficient and convincing interest and sensitivity
towards our security concerns and if this meets one or both of the
preconditions we have set out, then the National Council (top
advisory body to the president) will be in a position to examine
these prospects and decide accordingly."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus insists that the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles will be deployed in Cyprus unless productive talks begin
or unless the prospect of a reduction of military presence is in
sight with a view to the demilitarization of the island.
</P>
<P>
However, Kasoulides said that he was not speaking about
cancelling government plans for the missiles but about relevant
decisions the National Council may take on the matter.
</P>
<P>
He said the European Union (EU) cannot be indifferent to
developments in Cyprus as the island is negotiating its accession
to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides confirmed that "some relative progress has been
made" in the separate meetings U.N. resident representative Dame
Ann Hercus held with Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
And the shuttle talks will continue after Hercus returns from
New Zealand where she is spending Christmas holidays. The talks
will focus on such issues as commitments to rejecting the use of
violence or the threat to use violence and to avoiding any further
military buildups, Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy S-300
anti-aircraft missiles but postponed the arrival of the missiles
until the end of December amid Turkey's threat to launch
preemptive strikes on the missiles if they are deployed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Ocalan to be Put on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan should be
brought to justice and must not be set free.
</P>
<P>
"The United States believes that Ocalan should be brought to
justice for the terrorist crimes of which he is accused in a
manner consistent with international standards," said U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"If he (Ocalan) is allowed to go free without facing charges it
would be a blow to the international fight against terrorism," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The United States had been in contact with senior levels of the
Italian, German and Turkish governments to express the view that
Ocalan should not be set free, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Rome's Court of Appeals said Ocalan could
go free because Germany had withdrawn its international arrest
warrant and possible extradition request -- the only reason Ocalan
was detained in Italy. Germany had wanted him arrested for alleged
crimes on its soil.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK),
is also wanted in Turkey on treason charges.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government holds Ocalan and the PKK responsible for
the deaths of more than 29,000 people killed by Kurdish fighters
and Turkish armed forces in the Kurds' 14-year fight for
self-rule.

BUCHAREST, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Police cracked
down on a ring of money counterfeiters, seizing 54,600,000 lei
(about 5200 U.S. dollars) in 50,000 lei bills, the largest such

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Suez Canal Revenues Drop in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt saw a continued decline in
revenues of the Suez Canal in 1998, Chairman of the Suez Canal
Authority Ahmed Fadel said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The canal authority collected 1.76 billion U.S. dollars this
year, down 3.4 percent from last year, Fadel told a news
conference held in Ismailia at the midway of the canal, 110
kilometers east of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Fadel attributed the fall in revenues to the economic turmoil
in Southeast Asia and the sharp slump of oil prices on the world
markets, which he said withered the maritime transport.
</P>
<P>
He said that 13,478 ships sailed through the world's longest
lock-free canal in 1998, a drop of 6.6 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The canal revenues, one of Egypt's four largest foreign
currency earners, were 1.822 billion dollars in 1997. This was
already 3 percent lower than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A circular released by the authority Wednesday said the transit
fees of the ships going through the international waterway will
not be changed in 1999, meaning that the tolls which have been in
place since 1994 will be kept intact.
</P>
<P>
The authority is to offer new services in a bid to lure more
ships to pass through the canal, Fadel said. It is seeking a
partnership deal with foreign companies for maintenance within 36
hours for vessels carrying up to 350,000 tonnes of cargoes, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The official said the depth of the canal will be increased to
72 feet (about 21.95 meters) for the world's largest oil tankers
to go through.
</P>
<P>
The 193-kilometer canal stretches from Port Said, 160
kilometers northeast of Cairo, to Suez city, 120 kilometers east
of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The canal, linking the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, was
opened in 1879 and nationalized in 1956.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania-Zambia Railway Reshuffles Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania-Zambia
Railway Authority (TAZARA) board of directors have decided to
retire the managing director Kingsley Mkandawire and his deputy
Ayub Ritti because of their poor management.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued in Dar es Salaam Wednesday said that the
board of directors made the decision after a meeting in the city
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed by TAZARA board chairman S. H. Msoma and
co-chairman X. E. Vlahakis, said that the board has appointed
Charles Phiri and M.P. Banyikwa as acting managing director and
deputy managing director respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the 1997/98 fiscal year (from July 1997 to June 1998)
the authority's losses fell to 16.6 million Shillings (25,150
U.S. Dollars) from 18.8 million Shillings (28,480 Dollars) in the
previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
But the improvement in operations and financial controls was
increasingly threatened by various problems in the management
style, such as lack of management-worker contact and default in
paying workers' salaries.
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, TAZARA workers complained about mismanagement
by TAZARA and demanded the resignation of Mkandawire, who is a
Zambian.

<HEADLINE> Romania: Opposition Reads Out No-confidence Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Opposition read
out on Wednesday in Parliament a no-confidence motion against the
current government. The motion is to be debated by the two Chambers
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The motion was tabled last Friday in the Permanent Offices of
the two Chambers of the Parliament and was signed by 97 deputies
and 46 senators from the parliamentary groups of Party of Social
Democracy of Romania (main force in the opposition), Greater
Romanian Party, and Romanian National Unity Party.
</P>
<P>
The motion refers to "the incapacity of the current majority to
lead the country as well to its incapacity to understand and
defend the national interest."
</P>
<P>
The authors of no-confidence motion consider that the
government led by Radu Vasile demonstrated in the eight months
since it took office lack of responsibility for the economic and
social situation in the country, that it "caused chaos in Romania,
its failure is evident on all planes."
</P>
<P>
The motion says that Romania is today in the grip of the most
serious social crisis after 1989. The Opposition hopes that the
motion will be voted for, the Radu Vasile Government will be
withdrawn trust, and "a responsible and competent Executive will
be formed, that will prepare premature elections."
</P>
<P>
The leader of Party of Social Democracy Ion Iliescu explained
that the motion was determined by the country's arrested economic
and social development, not political calculations. He said the
motion had been meant to "trigger out" serious public debates on
the effects of the current leading coaltion's mistakes and the
ways to put an end to the current "dangerous fall" of economy and
living standards, and also to reinvigorate the country's economy
and society.
</P>
<P>
President Emil Constantinescu said that the Opposition's action
is "ill-timed," since right now all forces and energies have to be
focused on the economy restructuring process. He believed that
the motion shall be "used for a serious analysis of the Power's
management short-comings, for suggestions on a better
communication between Power, Opposition and the civil society."

<HEADLINE> Departing House Members Voice Displeasure over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, Xinhua 16 (Xinhua) -- Some of the 40 departing
House members are voicing displeasure about capping their
congressional careers by voting on whether President Bill Clinton
should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible way to go out," Representative Lee Hamilton, a
Democrat, told ABC's "Good Morning America" on Wednesday.
Hamilton, a foreign affairs expert who is retiring after 34 years
service in congress, said "there are 1,001 other issues I would
prefer to vote on."
</P>
<P>
Hamilton opposes impeachment. Others in the group of lame-duck
lawmakers, including impeachment supporters, share his distaste
for the upcoming votes.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody is really excited about making it but
it's one of those tough votes as an elected official you have to
make from time to time," said Representative Vincent Snowbarger, a
Republican, who supports impeachment.
</P>
<P>
The House is scheduled to take up the four articles of
impeachment against Clinton on Thursday that the House Judiciary
Committee approved last week.
</P>
<P>
Three of the 40 departing House members -- Republicans Jim
Bunning, Michael Crapo and Democrat Charles Schumer -- were
elected to the Senate and would serve as jurors during possible
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
Schumer, who opposes impeachment, also serves on the House
Judiciary Committee. Bunning and Crapo were undecided on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
But some of those who won't be in the new Congress that opens
January 6 said they weren't concerned about political
repercussions, instead saying that returning members are the ones
who need to be worrying about it.
</P>
<P>
"My career I think will speak for itself," said Representative
Louis Stokes, a Democrat, an impeachment opponent who is retiring
after 30 years. "I think the ones who have to worry about their
place in history are the ones who have instigated this type of
embarrassment on the part of the nation."
</P>
<P>
Retiring five-term Representative Mike Parker, a
Representative, doesn't care about fallout.
</P>
<P>
Parker said he votes "my conviction" after examining facts,
adding "That's all I can do. I don't worry about how it fits into
the scale of the other votes that I cast."
</P>
<P>
Representative Paul McHale, a Democrat, said, "The last thing I
want to do is leave public life by voting for the impeachment of
the president of my own party." The three-term representative
said, "I will recognize that this is a duty that I have to meet,
but it certainly is not a pleasant one."

<HEADLINE> Syria Denounces U.S. Air Strikes on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Syria on Thursday denounced
the air strikes launched by the U.S. and Britain on Iraq Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the Syrian People's Council Abdel Kader Kaddura said
that the attack against Iraq was completely uncalled for. It was
conducted beyond the U.N. resolutions. And it would hurt the Iraqi
people, particularly children and civilians, increasing their
sufferings and pains.
</P>
<P>
He added that "we in the People's Council, while denouncing,
censuring and condemning this attack, call upon the international
community to denounce it and have it halted immediately."
</P>
<P>
After months of disputes over weapons inspections, U.S. and
British forces launched the biggest air strikes against Iraq since
the 1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The attack came hours after the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) chief Richard Butler presented a report accusing Baghdad
of failing to fully cooperate fully in weapons inspections as its
promised one month earlier.

BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese party
official said here today that China has reexamined and reversed
4.18 million frame-up, false or wrong cases over the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Quanjing, head of the organization department of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), made the
remarks at a seminar held here today to mark the 20th anniversary
of the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, which falls
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Outlining six major achievements China has made in
organizational work, Zhang said more than 21 million party
officials have attended theoretical study sessions since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The average age of officials at Party and government leading
bodies at provincial, prefectural and county levels have been
lowered by seven, six and five years respectively. At present over
93 percent of leading officials are college or university trained.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the central committee has launched a campaign to
overhaul and consolidate grassroot party organizations in rural
areas and state-owned enterprises and achieved good results, Zhang
said.

-- The Albanian government said Thursday that Tirana is fully
supportive of the U.S.-led air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Soko Gjoka said in a statement that
the U.S. took the military action following it received a report

resolutions and their cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission
had been suspended, said a government statement.

In order to make Iraqi President Saddam Hussein adhere to
U.N. resolutions, it is necessary to take military actions, the
Polish Press Agency quoted the statement as saying.

However, Poland also held out hope that the actions will not
bring damage to the civilians.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek

<P>
MOSCOW, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov Thursday condemned the military strikes against Iraq as
"outrageous" and said that the action has further worsened the
Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Primakov blamed Richard Butler, head of the UN Special
commission, for his negative role in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Russian President Boris Yeltsin met with
Primakov and high-ranking military officials to discuss the
situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the president stayed up all night and issued a
strongly worded statement against the attack.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev were summoned back from overseas trips for consultations.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federal Council, or upper chamber of Russia's
parliament, released a statement urging the U.S. and Britain "to
respect the U.N. Charter and international law."
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, is expected to
adopt a resolution denouncing the strikes, which is likely to
include a provision on Russia's withdrawing from the
U.N. sanctions against Iraq, said the State Duma Chairman Gennady
Seleznyov.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency said that Russia's mass
organizations, such as the Labor Union and the Congress of Russian
Communities, have categorically denounced the air strikes and
urged boycotting contacts with U.S. officials.

Thursday about the escalation of the military operations against
Iraq, calling upon all parties concerned to exercise restraint and
halt military actions immediately.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Tunisian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
reiterated Tunisia's firm position it had expressed in November,
which had appealed for the concerned parties to exercise

The ministry expressed its deep regret for the serious
consequences of the air strikes. It called upon the international

to resolve conflicts in conformity with the U.N. Charter and
international norms.

Iraqi people to end their sufferings. It further voiced utmost
concern about the negative consequences of the air strikes on the
security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British forces launched air strikes against Iraq
midnight Wednesday under the pretext of Iraq's failure to

<HEADLINE> Regulation on Urban Housing Reform Passed in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Municipal
People's Congress today adopted a regulation on urban housing
reform submitted by the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
The regulation sets the deadline for commercializing housing on
December 31, 1999, by which all new apartments that will be
delivered and existing government-built apartments for sale will
be sold to workers and staff members.
</P>
<P>
Since the housing reform was tried out in the city in 1994,
700,000 households have bought government-built
apartments. Per-capita floor space in the urban area has reached
9.3 sq.m.
</P>
<P>
The government-allocated funds for housing construction will be
converted into housing subsidizes.
</P>
<P>
A housing guarantee system for lowest-income families will be
introduced to enable such families to rent inexpensive
apartments. By the year 2000, there will be no family in Shanghai
with a per-capita floor space of less than four sq.m.

<HEADLINE> France Doubts Effectiveness of U.S.-British Strike on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- France is sceptical about the
effectiveness of the ongoing U.S.-British missile strikes against
Iraq, said French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are always not convinced, we cannot but be sceptical about
the effectiveness of the military strikes in respect of the
objective which is that of the international community, that is
how to maintain a real control to ensure that this country... not
become dangerous for the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The sooner the strikes stop, the better it would be," said
Vedrine, who made the statement at the French Senate.
</P>
<P>
He said that the problem of making Iraq fully cooperate with
U.N. arms inspectors could be solved through political and
diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
"We think that this question, these conflicts, these
impossibilities should be overcome through political and
diplomatic work," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier statement, the French minister said that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein bore primary responsibility for the
U.S. strikes.
</P>
<P>
"I regret that he (Saddam) and the Iraqi leadership failed to
properly cooperate," he said.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Hails Anniversary of Landmark CPC Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Tomorrow's edition of People's
Daily, the voice of the Communist Party of China CPC), will carry
an editorial hailing the importance of the Third Plenum of 11th
CPC Central Committee held in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The editorial reviews the fundamental changes in various social
sectors over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
It also cites the historical merits of the Third Plenum of the
11th CPC Central Committee's decisions on establishing the Maxist
ideological line of "emancipating minds" and "seeking truth from
facts", as well as its decision to discard the erroneous principle
of "taking class struggle as the key link".
</P>
<P>
The editorial clarifies a number of political, ideological and
theoretical issues regarding problems lingering from the "Cultural
Revolution" and formulation of the reform and opening policies.
</P>
<P>
Monumental changes have taken place in China over the past two
decades under the guidance of the line, principles and policies
adopted during the Third Plenum.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy, which was once on the verge of collapse,
currently ranks seventh in the world in terms of gross domestic
product. The country leads the world in output for major
manufactured goods and farm produce, and ranks second in both
foreign exchanges and the use of foreign direct investment. In
addition, annual income levels for both urban and rural residents
have increased significantly.
</P>
<P>
The editorial attributed achievements over the past 20 years to
Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's economic reforms. "The
achievement of today's good situation and new life for Chinese
people would have been impossible without Deng Xiaoping at the
core of the collective leadership of the second generation,"
according to the editorial."
</P>
<P>
It notes that the third generation leadership with Jiang Zemin
at the core serves as a link between the past and future, and
continues to lead the Party and people of all ethnic groups in
efforts to follow a correct line.
</P>
<P>
A number of new problems cropping up in the course of
modernization have required the staunch leadership of the
Party. Events in the late 1980s and early 1990s, especially the
Asian financial crisis and the devastating summer flooding, have
proved the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core is
fully capable of overcoming all difficulties. The efforts have won
the full support of the Party, army and people of all
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls on all Chinese citizens to rally around
Jiang Zemin and the Central Committee, unswervingly adhere to the
Party's basic line, join in efforts to combine reform and
development with stability, and work diligently in all fields to
greet the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China.

<HEADLINE> Canada Needs Huge Investment for Highway Repairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Canada's highways are scarred
with potholes, cracks and rough patches that would take the
various governments more than 17 billion Canadian dollars (11
billion U.S. dollars) to fix, a new national study says.
</P>
<P>
The country's 25,000 kilometers of provincial and
interprovincial highways -- the lifeblood of Canada's trucking
industry and a huge component of the national economy -- are at
least as bad as the they were 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The study says that fixing the roads immediately would cost the
federal and provincial treasuries 17.4 billion Canadian dollars
(11.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The news comes despite the fact than 11 billion Canadian
dollars (7.2 billion U.S. dollars) has been spent on the system
since 1988 and that annual expenditures on highways are twice what
they were 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Canada has about 800,000 kilometers of roads, but only 25,000
are classified as highways. About 30 percent of travel takes
place on this system.
</P>
<P>
The study found that levels of rideability -- or road roughness
-- are unacceptable on 7,000 kilometers of road, up from 5,200
kilmetres in 1988. More than 5,300 kilometers of the roads could
not carry vehicles operating at 90 kilometers an hour or higher.
That figure is up from 4,200 kilometers in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Fan Saves China for Third Straight Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Veteran defender Fan Yunjie
headed in a golden goal five minutes into the second half of extra
time to pace China for a 1-0 win over DPR Korea in the women's
soccer final.
</P>
<P>
It was China's third straight title for women's soccer at Asian
Games.
</P>
<P>
Just as the time was running out and penalty shoot-out in
sight, China got a corner kick at the left. Zhao Lihong sent a
cross to the 26-year-old Fan, who raced to head the ball past
South Korea's out-charging goalkeeper Kye Yong-Sun into the net.
</P>
<P>
China, inferior to their DPR Korean opponents in both speed and
stamina, got a lot of chances in the goalmouth, only to see their
shots repeatedly blocked by DPR Korea's tight defence.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Korean team, which lost to China 0-2 last December for
runners-up in the 11th Asian Women's Championships, whipped up
waves upon waves of attack on China's goal at the beginning of the
match, with forwards Jo Jong-Ran and Kim Song-Ryo running China's
defence ragged. But their shots went to no avail before Chinese
inspired goalkeeper Gao Hong.
</P>
<P>
China, who never lost in the Games' women soccer after it being
inaugurated in the 1990 Beijing Asiad, got a good chance in the
40th minute when defender Wen Lirong chipped a pass to unmarked
Sun Wen, but Sun's blank-point shot was fingertipped by Kye
Yong-Song over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Korea also surprised China in the 84th minute when Yang
Kyong-Hui saw her direct freekick hit the cross-bar.
</P>
<P>
After a 90-minute scoreless regular, both sides had to fight
for the extra which was ended by Fan's sudden-death goal.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first extra since I took the helm of China's women
soccer," said coach Ma Yuanan.
</P>
<P>
"This is an unexpected hard fight for us," he said. "I
originally expected us to win by at least two goals, but our
players failed to psych themselves up for the match."
</P>
<P>
"They bore some mental burden as they were much eager to win
the title, and this affected their performance," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jilong, vice president of Asian Football Confederation,
held that the hard win reflected DPR Korea's gnawing at China's
lead in Asian women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
"The DPR Korean players took us aback with their speed, stamina
and footwork," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The era of China's domination in Asian women's soccer is near
the end," added Zhang, who also serves as vice president of
Chinese Football Association.
</P>
<P>
China, who conceded no goal in the Games, has swept the last
six Asian Women's Football Championships since they first entered
in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Asiad Ticket Revenue Possible to Reach Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Revenue from ticket selling in
the 13th Asian Games has reached 153 million baht (4.25 million
U.S. dollars), making it possible to reach the 230-million-baht
(6.4 million dollar) target, an official from the Bangkok Asian
Games Organizing Committee (BAGOC) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 153 million baht has not included the income from the men's
soccer semi-finals between host Thailand and Kuwait on Wednesday,
which is estimated at 15 million baht (416,667 dollars), Keattisak
Wongpanich, Assistant Secretary of BAGOC's Ticket Sub-Committee,
told Xinhua Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The BAGOC had expected to earn some 230 million baht (6.4
million dollars) before the Games was opened on December 6.
</P>
<P>
The most popular sports are soccer, gymnastics, boxing and all
events in the acquatic center, Keattisak said.
</P>
<P>
"The most unexpected sport is Taekwondo," he said. "Before the
Games, we estimated that there will be 400 spectators daily at
most, but the real spectators doubled our estimation, with some
day seeing more than 800."
</P>
<P>
Monsak Nuntasaen, senior manager of Power Telecom Company,
which is appointed by BAGOC for producing and selling Asian Games
tickets, said Thursday that tickets for soccer and boxing matches
are the most popular ones.
</P>
<P>
"Although the match between Thai and Chinese soccer teams for
the bronze scheduled on Saturday is arranged in the southern
province of Songkhla (some 600 kilometers south of Bangkok), the
tickets have been quickly sold out," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has launched a campaign to lure more
students from drugs to sports by lowering the price of student
tickets to only 10 baht (28 cents) each.
</P>
<P>
But despite the campaign, it is still possible for BAGOC to
meet its target of earning 230 million baht from ticket selling,
Keattisak said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Condemns Strike on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian
Agriculture Minister Hikmat Zeid said here Thursday that the
overnight U.S. and British missile strikes against Iraq is "a bad
and unjustified aggressive action."
</P>
<P>
"This is an aggressive and unjustified action against the Iraqi
people and it should stop the soonest." Zeid said after meeting
with Cyprus' Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment
Minister Costas Themistocleous.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched the strikes midnight Wednesday
proclaimedly in retaliation for Iraq's breaking its promise to
fully cooperate with the United Nations arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Zeid, here on three-day private visit, stressed that the United
States President Bill Clinton should not use double standards in
dealing with issues in the area.
</P>
<P>
On his recent visit to the Palestinian areas, Clinton promised
to help the Palestinians achieve their self-determination. But the
remark went pale as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who
was under strong pressure from hardliners at home, did not respond
to it.

range of areas such as the study of traditional Chinese medicine
and the development of computer's software for Chinese language as
well as biological products, he said.
</P>
<P>

enterprises provides foreign entrepreneurs with more chances for
investments.
</P>
<P>

enterprises reform involves various aspects such as
re-organization of assets, structural readjustment and upgrading
enterprises' technological and management level.
</P>

Administrative Region will neither guide nor interfere in our
businessmen's investment," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Herbert Liang, president of the Chinese Manufacturers'
Association of Hong Kong, said Hong Kong and Taiwan are
respectively the first and the third largest places of the sources
of the overseas investment. Their accumulated investment accounts
for over 60 percent of the total direct foreign investment that

Industry, expressed the hope for sustainable economic growth of the

<HEADLINE> NATO Not to Cancel PJC Meeting With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) on Thursday said it was not the side that will
propose to cancel the Permanent Joint Council (PJC) meeting with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
A NATO official told the press that the western military
alliance was not considering cancellation of the meeting,
scheduled for Friday, after reports reaching here said Russian
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev would not come to Brussels as a
protest against the U.S.-led air raid on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The official said NATO is not the side that cancels the PJC
meeting and that the meeting may still go ahead with other
officials from the country to discuss issues ranging from nuclear
transparency to computer "millennium bug" problem.
</P>
<P>
"I can't confirm that the meeting will not be held as
scheduled," said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was in the interests of both sides to sit
together and discuss issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
But the official made it clear that Iraq is not a NATO
responsibility. "It is not something that NATO as an organization
handles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana issued
a brief statement concerning the American-British joint air raid,
but his statement was described by the official as personal.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China are strongly opposed to the use of force
against Iraq, while France deplored the military attack as one
without the mandate of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Russia withdrew its representatives from Brussels in protest
after NATO ordered air strikes against Yugoslavia in mid-
October. But the Russian representatives returned shortly
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The Permanent Joint Council was established after the signing
of the NATO-Russia Founding Act in May last year to serve as a
consultation platform for the former Cold War foes.

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Malaysia Agree to Solve Bilateral Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said Singapore and Malaysia have agreed to work out a
package to settle the disputes over the CIQ (Customs, Immigration
&AMP; Quarantine) and Railway Land problems along with other
outstanding issues between the two neighbors, media reports said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Goh made the revelation to reporters after a 30-Minute meeting
with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad following the ASEAN
Summit in Hanoi, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
After the divorce 33 years ago, quite a number of issues have
been left to be resolved in the bilateral relations between the
two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the problems over relocation of Malaysian CIQ
facility at Tanjong Pagar and Malaysian-owned Railway Land both
within Singapore, the two countries also face the issues such as
the CLOB, that was an out-of-counter exchange for trading
Malaysian shares and was forced to suspend after Malaysia imposed
capital control in early September, the withdrawal of Singapore's
Central Provident Fund (CPF) for Malaysian workers who contributed
to CPF while working in Singapore, and the entry and use of
Malaysian airspace by Singapore's air force and Singapore's water
requirement from Malaysia
</P>
<P>
Singapore was happy to discuss all the issues as a package and
the new package will be a win-win situation for both countries,
Goh was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Goh also said that the new package was a change from the
earlier water-for-funds deal being worked out by both sides as
Malaysia is now able to get funds on his own.

<HEADLINE> France Holds Iraqi President Responsible for U.S. Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- France has held Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein responsible for the missile strikes by U.S. and
British forces and refrained from publicly criticizing
Washington and London.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said on Thursday that
Saddam Hussein was primarily responsible for the present
situation, because he and other Iraqi leaders had not shown enough
proof of cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
However, the Socialist Party, Communist Party, Greens and other
leftwing forces which make up the ruling coalition have all
expressed opposition, to different degrees, to the U.S. and
British action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party Thursday called for "an immediate stop" of
the bombings, which it said were "a unilateral resort of force in
violation of international laws."
</P>
<P>
Communist Party National Secretary Robert Hue said that he
regretted that France failed to show more firmness in its
opposition to the U.S.-British military operation against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Deplore is not enough; we should condemn," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hue said that the Communist Party, some trade unions and
leftwing parties will hold a protest rally in front of the
U.S. embassy in Paris Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The rightwing opposition parties said that they support the
policy of the government, which they said is realistic and
balanced, while the far-right National Front has condemned the
U.S. bombings.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, who has not made any public
comment on the bombing, Thursday expressed his concern over the
safety of French nationals in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is keeping contact with his U.S. counterpart Bill
Clinton, presidential spokesman Catherine Colonna said.
</P>
<P>
The French military said that the French combat aircraft
participating in the "Southern Watch" operation in Iraq have
received order to stay grounded since the beginning of the
U.S.-British strikes Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
France has deployed one C-135 oil supply plane, five Mirage
2000 fighters and three Mirage F10CR reconnaissance planes in the
Saudi airbase of al Kharg since the end of the Gulf War under the
"Southern Watch" operation imposing a no-fly zone south of the
33rd parallel.
</P>
<P>
French planes have never flown beyond 32nd parallel, because
France does not agree with a U.S. decision to extend the no-fly
zone to 33rd parallel.

<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-premier Qian
Qichen today highly praised the role of the All-China Federation
of Returned Overseas Chinese (ACFROC) at the federation's fifth
plenary session held here today.
</P>
<P>
The development of Chinese residing abroad is linked
with the domestic and international development. The prosperity
China has scored in the past two decades has created a favorable
condition for the overseas Chinese development abroad, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Yang Taifang, president of the ACFROC, said
China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on
December 20, 1999, which is another historical event in the
great cause of reunification.
</P>
<P>
He urged ACFROC members at all levels to forge close ties with
compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao and contribute more for the
return of Macao and its prosperity and stability.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- "This prison ranks first among
13 prisons I've visited in foreign countries in terms of
environment and management," according to Jeremy Corbyn, a member
of the British parliament.
</P>
<P>
Corbyn made the remark during a visit to the Beijing No.1
Prison in Daxing County located in the southern suburbs of the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The prison has hosted visits by 187 delegation and 4,291
individuals since 1996. The visits have provided people from both
at home and abroad with a good opportunity to learn more about
prison management in China.
</P>
<P>
Warden Yang Di noted the transportation of convicts has been
carried out over the past 16 years without a single incident. No
escapes have been recorded over the past two years, and the
recidivism rate is less than two percent.
</P>
<P>
The prison has adopted modern scientific measures to integrate
supervision, education and labor. The facility also provides
training which enables prisoners to adapt to the life on the
outside.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that staffers assess the performance of inmates
daily on a 10-point system. The system is based on four points for
work performance, three for study habits and three for
behavior. The results are posted on a monthly basis and determine
the level of privileges granted.
</P>
<P>
The prison has also opened a school enabling prisoners to
pursue advanced studies. Some 119 inmates have passed national
college entrance examinations.
</P>
<P>
The facility, established in 1982, covers an area of 440,000
square meters and is staffed by 384 guards. The prison houses
close to 2,000 inmates.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- With three days to go, China
celebrated its century gold through women long jumper Guan Yingnan
and stepped further to 102 with a golden goal in the women's
soccer and a martial art expert at the Bangkok Asian Games here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
National champion Guan, winner in the Asian Championships last
year, awarded China its 100th gold medal by jumping to her winning
distance of 6.89 meters in the last attempt.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad that I've beaten my anxiety by landing in the victory
distance in my last jump as my teammate Yu Yiqun surprised me with
her 6.77-meter last effort," said Guan.
</P>
<P>
To highlight China's feat in the Asian Games, Fan Yunjie scored
the golden goal from a left-wing pass off Zhang Ouying to award
China its 101st gold medal in the women's soccer final against the
Democratic People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese held a little advantage over their rivals in the
pitch but failed to convert chances into goals in regulation time.
</P>
<P>
Of the six athletics golds, China took one more through Li
Shaojie in the men's discus, who set an Asian Games mark of 64.58
meters, with the other four split by Kazakhstan, Japan, South
Korea and India.
</P>
<P>
South Korea reapt the most of eight golds out of a total of 40
golds at stake in the competitions of the day, taking both the
men's and women's team titles in archery, two from the wrestling,
and one apiece from the athletics, badminton, cycling, fencing.
</P>
<P>

46.56 seconds after a break of three years, banned for doping
test.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had its best day of five golds, taking half of the six
boxing gold medals on its clear home advantages, winning its
strong sport of sepak takraw and a surprising victory in the men's
tennis doubles.
</P>
<P>
Three Thai boxers were involved in the day's finals with all
beating their respective rivals by points, raising concerns for
the refereeing system of amateur boxing as neither of the losers
willingly acknowledged their defeats.
</P>
<P>
In the track cycling, Japan, South Korea and China, the East
Asian countries, continued their dominance by taking five out of
the seven golds at stake in the Bangkok Asian Games, with the
other two went to Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The men's sprint remains as the domain for Japan as Yoichiro
Kamiyama becomes the first professional cyclist with an Asian
Games gold, South Korea becomes the winner in the men's team
pursuit and China proves its strength by taking all the golds and
silvers in the women's events.
</P>
<P>
The day's medal tally also ushered in a new champion of origin
as Myanmar outbeat Vietnam in the women's sepak takraw final, and
both Macao and Brunei won their first medal of a silver and a
bronze respectively.
</P>
<P>
Thailand overtook Kazakhstan and Chinese Taipei to rank in a
distant fourth with 18 golds, only behind of China, South Korea
and Japan.

BUCHAREST, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Romania held that the U.S.-

Baghdad abide by its commitment," the Foreign Ministry said

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Leader Returns from ASEAN Summit Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Than Shwe
returned here Thursday afternoon from Vietnam after attending the
two-day Sixth Summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reportedly approved a number of documents aimed at
bringing about an early economic recovery in the region.
</P>
<P>
Joining with other ASEAN leaders in calling for measures to
restore the region's economy to its previous glory, Than Shwe,
chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council and
Prime Minister, expressed at the summit meeting the confidence
that ASEAN countries will be able to overcome the present
difficulties and that the region will again rise up to resume its
rightful position as the most economically dynamic one of the
world.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed basic fundamentals and the code of conduct as
laid down in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, emphasizing that
principles of respect for sovereignty and non-interference remain
valid today.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of agreement reached at the Manila
First ASEAN Home Ministers' Meeting in December 1997 when the
ASEAN Declaration of Transnational Crime was signed, saying that
Myanmar is willing to host the second similar meeting in Yangon
in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
On ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), he said, Myanmar does not see
any difficulty in meeting the AFTA goals within the designated
time frame of 2008, looking forward to fulfilling some of the
obligations in such fields as unprocessed agricultural products
well in advance of the specified period with regard to the Common
Effective Preferential Tariff Scheme.
</P>
<P>
With a growing agricultural production and increasing
availability of energy resources, Myanmar in not too distant
future can become a reliable source for the region's food and
energy security without failing in its responsibility to
contribute towards regional peace, security and prosperity, he
added.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic situation, he said, "Myanmar today enjoys
unprecedented peace and stability and a firm and solid economic
foundation is being built."
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe also attended the meetings between leaders of the
ASEAN and leaders of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, major
dialogue partners from East Asia.
</P>
<P>
He had separate deliberations with leaders of other ASEAN
member nations as well as the three East Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for Than Shwe to attend a formal ASEAN
summit after Myanmar became a full member of ASEAN in July 1997.

<HEADLINE> 1,500 DRC Fishermen Flee Into Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,500 refugees
from the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), mostly
fishermen, have fled into Tanzania with the fall of Moba Town
into the hand of rebels in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, from Fizi zone and South Kivu Province, have
been entering Tanzania through Rukwa Region in southwest Tanzania
and are settling in villages along the southern shores of the
Lake Tanganyika, Vincent Parker, a senior external relations
officer of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the influx in Rukwa Region, UNHCR immediately
hired boats in late November to collect the new arrivals
initially estimated at 1,500 by local government authorities,
Parker told a press conference at UNHCR's branch office in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
From November 23 to December 13, he said, a total of 621 new
arrivals were picked up with Mv Mwongozo and Mv Liemba from
southern lakeshore villages in the region and brought to the
Kibirizi Port in Kigoma Region which lies to the north of Rukwa.
</P>
<P>
"The new arrivals picked up from Rukwa Region are
predominantly of fishing background, some of whom had fled with
their fishing boats," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is alleged that many of the refugees in the villages are
reluctant to go to refugee camps because of the perceived that
camp life is hard," he added.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR does not currently have permanent presence in Rukwa
Region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since rebels in the DRC took up arms against the government of
President Laurent Kabila, more than 17,300 DRC refugees had fled
into Tanzania, he said, adding that the number still keeps rising
day by day.
</P>
<P>
He said most of the refugees had entered Tanzania from the
Kigoma Region and are accomodated at the Nyarugusu Camp, some 160
kilometers northwest of the Kigoma Town on Lake Tanganyika.
</P>
<P>
The refugees have been in good conditions, he later told
Xinhua. "They are better than Burundian refugees."
</P>
<P>
He said the civil war in Burundi since 1993 has forced more
than 270,000 refugees from the country to flow into Tanzania,
although 11,259 had returned by the end of November.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania plays host to refugees primarily from Burundi, DRC,
Somalia and Rwanda. By November 30, he said, the assisted refugee
population in Tanzania stood at 336,826, compared with 346,000 at
the beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Condemns U.S. Attack on Iraq (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States and Britain launched air strikes code named
"Operation Desert Fox" at 05:49 (Beijing time) today. Early
reports indicated that the raids either killed or injured a number
of Iraqi civilians, including children.
</P>
<P>
China issued an immediate response condemning the strikes, and
the Chinese media promptly commenced coverage of the latest
developments. Media reports included diversified responses from
international organizations and countries throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Various local international affairs observers considered the
air strikes an "inevitable" U.S. strategy to use military force to
settle international disputes and advance both hegemonism and
power politics. "Military action was also designed to offset the
seriousness of the impeachment crisis," according to one expert.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Qipeng, director of the International Relations Research
Institute at the Foreign Affairs College, said the international
community, including China, has made unremiting efforts to
peacefully settle the issue. However, according to Zhou, the
U.S. choice of military action against other nations is determined
by nothing more that its foreign policy strategies and so-called
"national interests."
</P>
<P>
Tang Wenzhao, deputy director of Institute of U.S. Studies
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), pointed out
that the constraint factor offered by the the international
community, particularly the opposition Security Council members
China and Russia, successfully quelled the U.S. and Britain's two
previous attempts. However, they are "determined to strike Iraq
and eventually oust the Saddam administration," according to Tang.
</P>
<P>
Beijingers intently watched TV reports throughout the day, with
soaring newspaper sales for covers related to Iraq and the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
The local media urged the U.S. and Britain to immediately cease
their military action and expressed full anticipation that China
and the international community work together in an attempt to
settle the Iraq weapons inspection crisis politically.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Party Condemns Air Strikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's Munkaspart party
Thursday strongly condemned the United States and Britain for
their air strikes against Iraq, which have so far killed at least
five people and injured 30 others in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the party urged an immediate end to the
"aggressive" military actions.
</P>
<P>
The statement said it is totally groundless for the two
countries to launch such military attacks when possibilities have
not yet exhausted for a peaceful settlement of the Iraqi weapons
inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
The acts of the U.S. and Britain, aimed to change Iraq's regime
through military means, are flagrant trampling of Iraq's
sovereignty and international norms.
</P>
<P>
The party expressed deep sympathy for the Iraqi people,
especially women and children trapped in the current plight. The
party also promised moral and political support for them.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British launched airstrikes, code-named Operation
Desert Fox, against Iraq early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The strikes came shortly after chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler issued a report on Tuesday, claiming that Iraq was
not cooperating fully with the U.N. inspectors. The inspectors
evacuated Baghdad on Wednesday.

LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain made clear on Thursday
that it would reject any plea to halt its military operations with
the United States against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Asked what the reply would be to a request from Italy to halt
the strikes, a spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair said that
"the answer to that is that there is a military operation under
way."
</P>
<P>
As for Britain's view on the strong criticism by Russia, the
spokesman said, "It is for everybody to express their views as
they see fit. We are confident in the operation that has been
launched and robust in our defense thereof."
</P>
<P>
Blair's cabinet was reported to have discussed the crisis for
40 minutes on Thursday morning and the spokesman said Blair was
confident that British public opinion had a "very solid
understanding of the position."

the United States and Britain for their missile strikes against
Iraq and regretted over the incident.

Kazakh foreign ministry said in a statement issued in the
capital city of Astana that Kazakhstan was "deeply regretful and
upset" at the attacks and called on the U.N. Security Council to
convene an urgent meeting to seek a solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the use of force by the United States

in the international community had again led to the escalation of
the tense situation in the Middle East and an intensification of
the international situation.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the statement said, Iraq must fully honor its
obligations as specified in the U.N. resolutions and the April 23

<HEADLINE> Egypt Regrets U.S. Air Strikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Thursday expressed
regret at the overnight air strikes against Iraq by the United
States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
An official statement issued in the day called for necessary
steps taken by the concerned parties to contain the crisis and
avert further deterioration of the situation to secure regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
Egypt urged the protection of the Iraqi people against further
sufferings.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the eruption of the Iraqi crisis in February, Egypt
has been calling for efforts to find a peace solution to the
crisis, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, meanwhile, has also called on Baghdad to abide by the
United Nations Security Council resolutions to safeguard the
country and its people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced to halt partial or full cooperation with the
U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, in February, August and
November this year. It eventually rescinded its decisions through
international mediations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched missile attacks on Iraqi military
and security targets most of the night Wednesday to contain what
U.S. President Bill Clinton said President Saddam Hussein's threat
to its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The attacks came after UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler accused
Baghdad of not fully cooperating with U.N. weapons inspections, as
it promised about one month ago to avert an imminent strike.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM is responsible for overseeing the elimination of Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, a must for the U.N. Security Council
to lift the crippling economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> 5 Palestinians Injured in Protest Against U.S. Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- At least five Palestinians
were injured in clashes with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank in
protest against the U.S. air strike against Iraq Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Clashes erupted in Hebron, Bethlehem, Ramallah and other West
Bank towns as Palestinian protesters threw stones at Israeli
soldiers who fired rubber bullets in return, Jerusalem Media and
Communications Center, a Palestinian news service, reported.
</P>
<P>
It said five Palestinians, including a local crewman for a
U.S. television network, were injured in violent clashes in
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians were protesting against the surprise missile
attack on Baghdad launched by U.S. and Britain at around
midnight Wednesday. They burnt U.S., British and Israeli flags.
</P>
<P>
The air strike came only hours after U.N. chief inspector
Richard Butler submitted a report over the weapons inspections in
Iraq to the U.N. Security Council, accusing Iraq of failing to
cooperate with the U.N. Special Commission, or known as UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian officials said they do not support the
air strike, stressing that dispute can only be resolved by
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"We don't condone the use of force by the United States.
We believe solutions should come from peaceful means," Saeb
Erekat, senior Palestinian negotiator with Israel, said in a
televised speech. "This is a sad day for us," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, adviser to Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat, said the U.S. military action will not
solve problems but only increase suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"We, as the Palestinians, feel solidarity with the Iraqi
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
These reactions were less strong compared with those during
the 1991 Gulf War, sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
1990, when the Palestine Liberation Organization expressed its
support for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and staged large-scale
demonstrations against the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The PNA has kept a low-profile in recent confrontations
between the U.S. and Iraq, refraining from condemning Washington,
the major mediator in its peace-making with Israel.

Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson said in a statement that

Sweden regretted at the attack, Persson said. But he added

ANKARA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Commenting on the U.S. air
raids on Iraq, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said on
Thursday that his country is concerned about the latest
developments in its neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is taking necessary measures against these negative
developments, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The developments which started by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
in 1990 and which caused a chronic crisis between the U.N. and
Iraq, led to serious sufferings in the region and Turkey," Cem
said.
</P>
<P>
Cem also disclosed that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright phoned Turkish President Suleyman Demirel at 22:30 local
time (2030 GMT) Wednesday and conveyed him a message from
U.S. President Bill Clinton about the air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The strike took place at about 2200 GMT, midnight in Iraq with
a declared aim to destroy Iraq's military capability.
</P>
<P>
But Cem pointed out that the U.S. has not requested to use
Incirlik base in southern Turkey's Adana province.
</P>
<P>
The multinational forces led by the U.S. used the base to
bombard northern Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> UN Special Envoy on Afghanistan to Visit Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Special Envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi will arrive here Friday for talks with
Pakistani and Taliban leaders on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
"Brahimi will exchange views with Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz and other officials on his talks with Iranian
leaders," a U.N. official requesting anonymity said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy, currently in Tehran, held talks with Iranian
leaders on the murder of Iranian diplomats and a journalist by
Taliban fighters in Mazar-e-Sharif in August.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Brahimi is also likely to meet Taliban
leaders during his stay here.
</P>
<P>
"We have invited the Taliban for the talks and are hopeful that
a team of Taliban officials will come from Kandahar," he said.
</P>
<P>
It will his second visit to the region in three months. He
visited Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan and some Central Asian
countries in October this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. official, one of the topics of Brahimi's
talks with Pakistani leaders would be the proposed meeting of the
Six Plus Two group in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdul Aziz Kamilov, during his visit to
Pakistan in November, invited the Taliban to participate in the
Tashkent meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan militia, however, had set a condition that they
should be invited as a government rather than a group.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi's forthcoming visit comes after a resolution by the
U.N. Security Council this month, threatening the Taliban with
sanctions if the militia did not agree to the establishment of a
broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
The Russia-sponsored resolution urged both the warring sides in
Afghanistan to end fighting and peacefully resolve the crisis.

<HEADLINE> OAU Meeting on Conflicts Opens in Ouagadougou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- About 18 African leaders
Thursday gathered in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, to
try to find ways to end conflicts on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting of the fourth ordinary session of the
Central Organ of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution at
the summit level is expected to consider the report of an OAU
high level delegation which visited Ethiopia and Eritrea earlier
to mediate in the Ethio-Eritrean border dispute.
</P>
<P>
The summit is also to consider the report by OAU
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim on the crisis in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Other issues on the agenda include conflicts in Burundi,
Angola, Guinea Bissau and Comoros.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of all the countries involved in the conflicts as well
as those of member countries of the Central Organ were present at
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Both DRC President Laurent Kabila and the rebel
representatives are now in Ouagadougou, but Kabila refused to
hold direct talks with the rebels, as it has always been his
position.
</P>
<P>
While answering Xinhua reporter's question, Salim said he is
certainly expecting a breakthrough on the DRC issue, but all
depends on the result of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out the invitation of the rebels from DRC to the
meeting, because it is a meeting of heads of state and
government.
</P>
<P>
In his report to be delivered to the summit, Salim suggested
for a two-phase solution to the DRC crisis.
</P>
<P>
The first phase will aim at the attainment of a cease-fire,
withdrawal of foreign troops and deployment of a peace-keeping
force.
</P>
<P>
The second phase would involve political dialog aimed at a
peaceful solution to the crisis, the report said.

WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Thursday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton on Wednesday launched the largest
military operation of his two terms in office, putting U.S. and
British forces against Iraq in what he called a "strong sustained"
attack from the air against the sources of President Saddam
Hussein's military power.
</P>
<P>
-- Returning to Washington poised to impeach President Bill
Clinton, House Republicans Wednesday night postponed Thursday
morning's climatic floor session after vigorous debate about
whether delay would play into the hands of a White House on the
verge of defeat.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The joint American-British attack, which is expected to last
at least until this weekend, began with a wave of more than 200
Tomahawk cruise missiles, most of them launched against facilities
believed to be used by the Iraqis for the manufacture of storage
of weapons of mass destruction. The United States will likely be
force to leave a large force in the region for several more years.
</P>
<P>
-- Republicans in Congress were bitterly divided over the
airstrikes against Iraq, and the Senate majority leader, Trent
Lott, fiercely attacked President Bill Clinton's policy.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton went on TV to say he ordered the
attack after a U.N. report said recent arms inspections had been
blocked. U.S.-British attacks are expected to last two to four
days.

PRAGUE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard
Kukan on Thursday said Slovakia supports taking very tough
measures to prevent Iraq from producing weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>

The foreign minister expressed the hope that the strikes would
make Iraq start constructive dialogues with the international
community, as required by relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Horrible Memory for Iraqi Teenager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- For Ali Suleiman, a
15-year-old Iraqi boy, the dawn of December 17 has been etched in
his mind when a tragic incident occurred in his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
A cruise missile streaked across the sky and slammed into the
main street of most populous Karrada District at 1:15 a.m. (2330
GMT). Ali was injured on his left arm by a shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
The boy later recalled that he was standing with his two
brothers on a lane next to the Karrada main street when he saw a
15-meter-long missile whistled by over his head with a frightening
white light.
</P>
<P>
Then came the deafening explosion, irritating white smoke
billowed up and the air was filled by a smell of sulphur. "I was
shocked to my roots," Ali said.
</P>
<P>
When the day broke, more aftermath of the strike exposed to the
light: a two-meter-deep, six-meter-wide pit left by the missile
explosion in the middle of the street, shattered windows in
destroyed buildings nearby and branches of hit trees littering the
road.
</P>
<P>
The explosion also broke water pipes and water filled up the
large pit. Mud is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
A witness said the blast waves have caused the bricks on the
walls to fly in different directions, hitting passerbys.
</P>
<P>
Usually, the Karrada main street was the most busy place in
Baghdad. But on Thursday morning, traffic was blocked and the
street was crowded with civil defense workers and traffic police
to clear up the site and rescue the injured.
</P>
<P>
The missile which fell on Karrada district was one of the about
200 Tomahark missiles fired by the U.S. and British forces on
Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
The strike took place at around midnight local time Thursday
and U.S. President Bill Clinton said the raid was a retaliation
for Iraq's defiance of the U.N. Special Commission, which oversees
Iraq's disarming of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The attack, which has killed at least two Iraqis and wounded 30
others, was launched to destroy Iraq's military capability, Clinton
added.
</P>
<P>
The surprise strike came just hours following a report by UNSCOM
chief Richard Butler, who accused Iraq of refusing to hand over
weapon-related documents demanded by UNSCOM and failing to grant
weapons inspectors unfettered access to suspected sites.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 led to the 1991 Gulf War, and
the weapons inspections in Iraq to ensure it clears off all
weapons of mass destruction. But Iraq has run into several
standoffs with the U.N. over weapons inspections.

the way in the first round, slowing down his pace in the last 20
meters.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old, who set an Asian record of 10 seconds in the
100m semifinals, said his main goal is to win the 200m gold medal,
saying "I have always taken 200m as my event actually."
</P>
<P>
In the women's 200m qualifying round, Damayanthi Darsha of Sri

Li Xuemei in the semifinals as the latter slowed down her pace.

finals, India's legendary P.T. Usha finished fourth in the second

<HEADLINE> East Asians Continue to Dominate Asiad Track Cycling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- After the Beijing and
Hiroshima meets, East Asian teams continued to dominate the Asian
Games track cycling events, taking five out of the seven golds at
stake at the Hua Mark Velodrome here in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, winning the other two golds, is the only central
Asian country which could challenge the powerhouses like Japan,
South Korea and China.
</P>
<P>
Men's sprint is still Japan's domain, with Keirin racers
Yoichiro Kamiyama and Nariaki Mabuchi completing a one-two finish.
</P>
<P>
But the victories have the historical significance as Kamiyama
becomes the first professional cyclist grabbing an Asian Games
gold.
</P>
<P>
However, Japan lost the men's 1-km time trial to South Korean
Ji Sung-Hwan.
</P>
<P>
South Korea became the winners again in the team pursuit event,
beating old rival Kazakhstan in the final to repeat its victory in
Hiroshima four years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the central Asian state is still unbeatable in the
individual longer distance races, as Vadim Kravchenko kept his
4-km pursuit title and his compatriot Sergey Lavrenenko excelled
in the heatly contested 40-km points race.
</P>
<P>
China proved its strength in the women's events by claiming all
the golds and silvers.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qingzhi successfully retained her 3-km individual pursuit
title in her last Asiad competition and Wang Yan battled against a
fatal disease to triumph in the sprint.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei emerged as the potential title contender in the
next Games as it won three bronzes here.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the team, who came empty-handed from Hiroshima,
attributed the progress to shifting focus from long distance
events to shorter ones.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Hits 5.5 Percent in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The provisional seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate for the period September-November 1998
was 5.5 percent, and the provisional underemployment rate was 2.9
percent, according to the latest labor force statistics released
Thursday by the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
For the period August-October 1998, the seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate was revised marginally downwards, from the
earlier provisional figure of 5.3 percent to 5.2 percent, while
the underemployment rate remained the same as the earlier
provisional figure of 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the period September-November 1998 with
August-October 1998, the increase in the unemployment rate occurred
mainly in the decoration and maintenance, manufacturing, business
services, import/export trades and transport sectors.
</P>
<P>
As to the underemployment rate, increases were scored in the
manufacturing, decoration and maintenance and retail sectors. The
unemployment and underemployment rates in the other major sectors
remained relatively stable.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest figures, Government economist K Y Tang
 said that both the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate and the
underemployment rate showed a further rise in September-November,
as the downward adjustment in the economy continued along with
reduced business volumes and further down-sizing in the corporate
sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that on current indications, and having regard to the
fact that both are lagged indicators of economic activity, the
unemployment and underemployment rates were likely to stay high in
the short term.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Education and Manpower Joseph W P Wong reaffirmed
the Government's commitment to do its utmost to help the
unemployed return to the workforce as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is undergoing a major economic adjustment brought on
largely by repercussions of the regional financial turmoil.
Unemployment will remain on the high side for some time as a
result of corporate down- sizing and layoffs during this process.
</P>
<P>
"However, several positive developments have emerged in the
most recent period. These include declining local interest rates,
moderating inflation and a rebound in asset prices, which have
helped to improve sentiments in the local market.
</P>
<P>
"These, together with the inherent flexibility of our economy,
should enable Hong Kong to emerge more robust and competitive in
the longer term," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Absorb Foreign Investment: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to give
priority to attracting more foreign investment, An Min, assistant
minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon after the Fifth Chinese Mainland, Taiwan
and Hong Kong Trade and Economic Forum opened here, An Min listed
the major measures China is adopting to absorb more foreign
investment as the following:
</P>
<P>
-- further optimizing the industrial structure of foreign
investment. Foreign investment is mainly encouraged in such
sectors as agriculture, industries-based high and new
technologies, basic industries, infrastructure, environmental
protection industry, and export-oriented industry;
</P>
<P>
-- Continuing to enlarge areas for foreign investment in
petrochemical industry, construction sector, service trade, the
exploration and development of mineral and tourism resources and
water transportation. More liberalization will be adopted for
foreign investment in service industries such as accounting, legal
and consulting services, air transport and freight forwarding
business;
</P>
<P>
-- Further improving the geographic pattern of foreign
investment. The state continues to support the eastern area in its
efforts to develop capital- and technology-intensive industries
and export-oriented industries, and gives priority to central and
 western areas in the arrangement of a group of projects of
agriculture, water conservation, communications, energy, raw
materials and environmental protection for attracting foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Foreign invested enterprises in the eastern region are
encouraged to reinvest in the western and central regions, and
when foreign investment ratio is over 25 percent in such projects,
they will be deemed as enterprises with foreign investment,
eligible for relevant treatment;
</P>
<P>
-- Absorbing foreign investment through multiple channels and
ways. Efforts will be continuously made to absorb investments from
Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and Southeast Asian nations. Efforts
will be intensified to attract investments from Japan and North
American and European Union countries;
</P>
<P>
-- And actively guiding the investments by multinational
corporations, and improving the investment environment.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong investments in the mainland, An said that Hong
Kong has always been the single largest source of overseas
investment for the mainland, with the number of investment
projects and realized value of foreign direct investment both
accounting for over half of its total stocks.
</P>
<P>
With Hong Kong's many advantages in financing, information,
market development, management and cultural intermediary, and the
mainland's fairly strong manufacturing base, abundant technical
personnel and relatively low labor cost, the two sides can
complement each other in many fields, especially in the field of
scientific and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said the 21st century will be an era of knowledge-based
economy. Cooperation between the two sides in the areas of science
and high technology and their related industries can certainly
become a new economic growth point for both sides.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Withdraw Diplomats From Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem said Thursday that most officials in the Turkish
Embassy in Iraq are preparing to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming pullout of diplomats was decided on after the
U.S. air strike against Iraq, Cem said at a press conference, but
he did not give a specific time of the pullout.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched air raids on Iraq Wednesday night,
killing at least two Iraqis and wounding 30 others.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said that the raids was staged in
retaliation for Iraq's defiance of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM), which monitors Iraq's disarming of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that Turkish Ambassador to Baghdad Selim Karaosmanoglu
and several embassy officials will stay behind "upon their own
will."
</P>
<P>
He also said that Turkey attaches great importance to the
protection of territorial integrity and political unity of
Iraq. But Iraq should fully abide by the U.N. Security Council
resolutions, he added.
</P>
<P>
The council imposed sanctions on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 and maintains that the sanctions will not be lifted
until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has cleared off all its banned
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Turkey believes that Iraq, which is an important member of the
international society, should gain its place again and the
sanctions on Iraq should end, Cem stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey also requests the end of the pain and sufferings of
the Iraqi people who pay the heaviest price in the crisis," he
added.

agricultural scientists offered their advice on Chinese future
agricultural development in a book, "Agriculture in China
1949--2030", which was published today.
</P>
<P>
In the 400,000-character book, Chinese and foreign experts

technology, and the ability to initiate and promote international
agricultural cooperation and exchange.
</P>
<P>
They recommend that Chinese agricultural teaching, research,
and extension systems be united to serve the farmers. And China
should greatly increase investment in agricultural research.
</P>
<P>
They also advice China to increase water-usage efficiency and
find new water resources and control environmental
pollution. China should establish a sound, credible and timely

<HEADLINE> Greece Hopes Air Strike Against Iraq to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Greece hoped that the air
strikes launched by the United States and Britain against Iraq
would be of short duration and would end soon, a statement
released by the Greek Foreign Ministry Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first official reaction by the Greek government to
the military actions against Iraq, which started late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the cautiously worded statement, the foreign ministry said
that non-implementation of U.N. resolutions and obstacles to their
implementation by Iraq were worthy of condemnation, but the people
of Iraq were not responsible for the actions of their government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry stressed that the trials the Iraqi
people had suffered for some time must be ended through
cooperation between the Iraqi government and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, two meetings chaired by Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis and Deputy Foreign Minister Yiannos Kranidiotis
were convened respectively to discuss the developments in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government had been directly informed of the
possibility of a military strike by the U.S. on Iraq during
Wednesday's meeting between Kranidiotis and U.S. ambassador to
Greece Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a group of Greece's ruling party MPs
have reportedly begun collecting signatures for a petition to be
sent to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The petition condemns the U.S. and British air raids against
Iraq, calling them "an infringement of international law and a
unilateral initiative taken outside of the framework of the United
Nations."

<HEADLINE> German Reunification Mode Inapplicable for China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Nations Resolution No.2758 expelled the representative
of the Taiwan authorities from the United Nations and its
subordinate organizations in October, 1971. The government of the
PRC thereafter resumed its UN membership, while East and West
Germanys were both UN members in 1973.
</P>
<P>
Tao said more than 160 nations recognize the government of the
PRC as the sole legitimate government representing China, with
only 20-odd countries maintaining official ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
While not a single country maintains diplomatic ties with both
sides across the Taiwan Straits, East and West Germanys
simultaneously maintained diplomatic relations with third
countries, according to Tao.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that East and West Germanys recognized each other
and maintain formal ties, while Chinese people and the PRC
government have always opposed "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Tao pointed out that Taiwan authorities are simply trying to
use the German mode of reunification as a tool to replace the
mainland's socialist system with capitalism, or to indefinitely
maintain separation across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The German mode proposed by Taiwan authorities is also designed
to counter the "one country, two systems" principle, said Tao.
</P>
<P>
He said the smooth return of Hong Kong to the motherland
convinced an increasing number of Taiwan compatriots of the
mainland's sincerity in realizing reunification and enabled them
to better understand the "one country, two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Germany achieved reunification after four decades
separation, Tao expressed hope that Taiwan authorities will comply
with contemporary trends and take practical steps under the "one
China" principle to ensure the early reunification of the
motherland.

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns of Risk of TB Transmission in Air Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) has given a caution to the world's 1.4 billion air
passengers that they should take proper measures to minimize risk
of infection of tuberculosis (TB).
</P>
<P>
"We want to make air travel safer, reduce the risk of TB
transmission and increase passengers' confidence that they are
adequately protected from risk of infection when they travel,"
said Dr Mario Raviglione of WHO's Communicable Disease Operational
and Epidemiological Research unit here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said this when launching a booklet entitled "Tuberculosis
and Air Travel: Guidelines for Prevention and Control."
</P>
<P>
These guidelines would serve as a substantial aid to air
passengers. While stressing the risk is low, WHO said that TB
transmission during air travel has been documented.
</P>
<P>
Within the next decade, the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) expects that more than 2 billion passengers
per year will travel by plane.
</P>
<P>
"Long-haul flights combined with the confined space of a
passenger cabin and the close proximity to co-passengers from the
entire world may facilitate the spread of contagious diseases,"
said Dr Claus Curdt-Christiansen of the ICAO.
</P>
<P>
"It is to be hoped that WHO's guidelines will be studied by all
doctors related to the airline industry and its regulatory
agencies and that the recommendations given will be implemented
without delay by health authorities and airline companies
worldwide," said Curdt-Christiansen.
</P>
<P>
In the guidelines, WHO suggested that maximum efficiency air
filters be installed and properly maintained on all aircraft and
ground delays kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
It advised anyone with infectious TB to postpone travel until
they become non-infectious, adding that "boarding can and should
be denied to persons known to have infectious TB."

NANJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The dismembered remains of
Chinese victims who had died as a result of bacteriological
experiments carried out by invading Japanese troops during the War
of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1937-45) were
discovered earlies this year in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
The remains were discovered last August at a construction site

including one female. The victims were between 17 and 38 years of
age. The heads were found in wooden boxes, with some boxes holding
several heads, and others containing skeletal remains.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Military pathologists collected samples of bones, boxes
and dirt at the excavation site and determined that the samples
contained traces of cholera toxins resulting from microbial
separation tests. The pathologists also confirmed that the victims
died as a result of bacterial experiments conducted by members of
the japanese Unit No.1644.
</P>
<P>
Historical documents indicate that the Japanese

However, South Korea hit back with three quick goals to lead
3-1 at half-time before Abbas narrowed the margin midway through
the second half with another penalty corner.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will meet the winner between India and Japan,
looking for its third consecutive Asian title.
</P>
<P>
Two defensive errors took the match away from Pakistan as Jeong
Yong-Keun levelled in the 18th minute when his free hit from
outside the circle hit a Pakistani defender's stick and went in.
</P>
<P>
After Yeo Woon-Gon made it 2-1 in the 26th minute by deflecting
in a penalty corner, Pakistan failed to mark Kang Keon-Wook six
minutes later who cooly pushed in a pass from the right.
</P>
<P>
"In the end, it was those two mistakes that cost us a place in
the final," said Pakistani coach Shahnaz.
</P>
<P>
South Korean coach Koo Jin-Soo said he was looking forward to
winning the final to gain a direct entry into the 2000 Olympics in

<HEADLINE> S. African FM: Using Force Is No Answer to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa did not
believe that using force would resolve the dispute over Iraq's
non-compliance with United Nations resolutions, Foreign Minister
Alfred Nzo said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the air strikes launched overnight by the United
States and Britain on Iraq, Nzo said in a statement South Africa
fully supported all U.N. Security Council resolutions on the need
for Iraq to comply.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa did not believe force would resolve the
issues relating to the activities of the UN special commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Nzo expressed his "deep concern" about the surprise air
strikes against Iraq during a meeting with the deputy chief of
mission of the United States embassy in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The lack of unanimity by the members of the U.N. Security
Council on the decision to strike was of concern to the South
African government, he said.
</P>
<P>
These actions would inevitably lead to greater human suffering
for the people of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Nzo again called on all sides to seek a negotiated settlement
and to avoid any further actions which would aggravate tensions
in the region.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Land Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Li Yuang, vice minister of
the Land and Natural Resources Ministry, said today that
China will further improve enforcement of land protection.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the new Land Law, effective January 1, 1999, will
give land departments under the State Council greater power to
investigate and adjudicate land cases.
</P>
<P>
Land departments at higher levels will have the power to deal
directly with land cases beyond the scope of lower level
departments and punish officials for inappropriate actions in
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed the need to seriously implement the general land
use plan and strictly control land used for urban construction.
</P>
<P>
"Directors of land bureaus at all levels will be responsible
for protecting cultivated land in their administrative
regions," according to Li.
</P>
<P>
He added that China will form a powerful enforcement system and
will strictly deal with illegal land occupation cases.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has handled 30-odd land cases during 1998, with a
number of city, county and township leaders receiving various
levels of punishment and a number of local land bureau directors
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
Ren Yao, former director of the Yanta District Land Bureau in
the northwest China city Xi'an is currently the subject of a
judicial investigation.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Dewan Negara
(Senate) Thursday unanimously approved a motion condemning the
United States and Britain for launching air strikes against Iraq,
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
The Upper House has resolved to convey the resolution to the
U.S. Embassy and British High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, and the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Tabling the motion, Senator Mohd Zuki Kamaluddin described the
attacks as a blatant violation of Iraqi sovereignty and the human
rights of its people.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the U.S. and Britain do not respect the
sensitivities of Muslims who will be welcoming the fasting month,
especially the people of Iraq who are living in fear and sadness,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mohd Zuki said the military action showed that the United
Nations Security Council had failed to prevent the U.S. and
Britain from continuing to bully Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.N. to lift its economic sanction on Iraq as it
has caused the deaths of almost 1.5 million Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
In debating the motion, six senators strongly condemned the
attacks, and urged the U.N. Security Council to immediately stop
the air strikes.

<HEADLINE> WTO Urges Canada to Improve Trade Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization
(WTO) called on Canada here Thursday to improve trade measures in
sensitive sectors like agriculture following a three-day meeting
to review Canada's trade policies.
</P>
<P>
"Areas such as agriculture, textiles and clothing, motor
vehicles and certain services have proved impervious to change,"
said a WTO report.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the WTO said, Canada's preferential arrangements
give rise to questions about their possible distortion of trade
patterns.
</P>
<P>
While Canada's simple average tariff is down to 7.7 percent in
1998, compared with 9.2 percent in 1996, the WTO said, tariff
protection remains significant for food products, textiles,
clothing and footwear, all areas where developing countries could
well have a comparative advantage.
</P>
<P>
"Canada's in-quota access is in some instances reserved for
imports from preferential trading partners," said the
WTO. "Tariffs on out-of-quota supplies are often over 200
percent."
</P>
<P>
The WTO also noted that Canada's new customs tariff, in effect
since January 1, 1998, greatly simplified and rationalized its
import regime. Almost half of all tariff lines are now duty free,
up from a third in 1996 when its trade policies were reviewed
last time.
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that Canada's pursuit of an
outward-oriented strategy, combined with prudent macroeconomic
policies, has been integral to its recent strong economic
performance. Its multi-track approach to international trade and
investment relations has further opened up Canada's economy, and
resulted in greater competitiveness in many sectors of its
economy.

He said Jordan is following the Iraqi crises with extreme
concern and utmost seriousness.
</P>

not solve the crises arsing from the inspection of weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Backs Changes to Bidding Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Australian Olympic officials
welcomed a proposal to change the way Olympic sites are chosen
amid allegations that the existing bidding process has been
corrupted by bribes, reports from Sydney said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
John Coates, Australian Olympic Committee president, said that
he supported a move by International Olympic Committee (IOC)
president Juan Antonio Samaranch to restrict voting on the
cities, limiting it to the IOC executive board.
</P>
<P>
Coates said that in 1994 the IOC members had rejected a
proposal to change the bidding process but he said it was
unlikely they would do that again in the current climate.
</P>
<P>
Under the IOC's current laws the venues for Olympic Games are
decided by a vote of all 114 IOC members.
</P>
<P>
But Samaranch said the IOC should think of studying another
way of electing the Olympic cities, possibly by restricting the
vote to the 11 executive board members.
</P>
<P>
His proposal came just a day after the IOC announced that it
was investigating allegations over payments made in Salt Lake
City's successful bid to stage the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Olympic officials have distanced themselves from
allegations of bribery and corruption although senior officials
believe they have been tarred by the same brush.  Ednitem

SEOUL, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Hyundai Group founder Chung
Ju-yung said Thursday that Hyundai and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) have agreed to create a special
industrial zone for South Korean companies in DPRK's western coast.
</P>
<P>
Chung told a press conference that the Hyundai Group agreed
with Kim Yong-sun, chairman of the DPRK Asia-Pacific Peace
Committee, to establish a 20 million-pyong (66 million square
meters) industrial complex on DPRK's western coast for South
Korean companies.
</P>
<P>
Chung gave the press conference Thursday upon returning to
South Korea through the truce village of Panmunjom after a
three-day visit to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai hopes the industrial zone could be established around
DPRK's western port city of Haeju for South Korean small and
medium-sized companies to further inter-Korean economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to discuss the exact location of the industrial
complex" during the next visit to DPRK next February, Chung said.
</P>
<P>
The business tycoon said that he has invited Kim Yong-sun,
regarded as DPRK leader Kim Jong-il's right-hand man, to visit
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
"Chairman Kim told us that he had no reason to hesitate to make
a trip to South Korea," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chung's latest visit was his fourth to the DPRK this year.
When he visited Pyongyang on October 30, DPRK leader Kim Jong-il

<HEADLINE> German Reunification Mode Inapplicable for China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The German mode of
reunification is inapplicable for China and the purpose of related
claims made by Taiwan authorities is to hinder cross-Straits
reunification and split China in perpetuity, according to a
Chinese law specialist.
</P>
<P>
An article by Tao Zhenghua, a research fellow with the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), points out that the German mode
of reunification centered on a historical process of separation
due to special factors.
</P>
<P>
Germany realized reunification on October 3, 1990, with the
federation's basic law entering effect following an amendment
process, according to Tao.
</P>
<P>
He said the essence of recent calls Taiwan authorities made to
reunify China in accordance with German mode center on "ruling the
country separately first" in advance of "reunification."
</P>
<P>
Tao said China and Germany have completely different histories
and legal backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
Germany's separation resulted from World War II, which is
recognized by international treaties, said Tao, adding that
China's separation resulted from civil war and U.S. armed
occupation of Taiwan to prevent the Chinese people from liberating
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The governments of East and West Germanys were established with
the support of the former Soviet Union and the United States,
while the People's Republic of China (PRC) was resulted from
victory in the Chinese People's Revolution. Taiwan authorities are
simply the remnants of the overthrown government, said Tao.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has always been a part of China in terms of both
territory and population, while East and West Germanys represented
a completely different situation.

About 3,000 students of Cairo University marched into the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Relations between the European
Union (EU) and China "have never been so close as now", according
to diplomatic envoys from the EU Troika countries.
</P>
<P>
In a recent press conference here, Josef Mullner, Charge
D'affairs Ad Interim of the Austrian Embassy to China, said that
the EU has put its relations with China on a par with those of the
United States and other powers.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, China has become an increasingly important partner with
the EU. Since the beginning of this year, the EU has adopted a
series of policies and measures, including suspending the tabling
of proposals against China to the annual Human Rights Conference
of the United Nations and listing China amongst "non-market
economy countries". Moreover, the EU endorsed a policy document
entitled "Building a Comprehensive Partnership with China" to push
ahead EU-China ties.
</P>
<P>
These EU's initiatives have met with positive responses from
China. Chinese leaders Li Peng and Zhu Rongji visited Holland,
Britain, France and other EU nations this year, while the
president of the European Commission Jacques Santer,
vice-president Leon Brittan and the prime ministers of five EU
nations, including Britain and France, paid official visits to
China.
</P>
<P>
German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder hopes to visit China next
May, when he is expected to attend the second EU-China meeting
when his country holds the annual presidency of the EU. German
Ambassador to China Konrad Seitz revealed this today but details
of the visit are still under discussion.
</P>
<P>
The growth of EU-China relations has benefited both sides. The
trade volume between China and the EU has witnessed a noticeable
expansion while China's trade volume with its neighboring Asian
countries decreased this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese customs statistics, the trade volume
between China and the EU reached 33.89 billion U.S. dollars in the
first three quarters of 1998, an increase of 16.6 percent compared
with the same period last year. China's imports from the EU
accounts for 13 percent of its total imports and China has become
the third largest non-European trading partner of the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU's comprehensive engagement with China represents not
only economic considerations, but also the EU's ambitious strategy
to enjoy a bigger role in global affairs. China's rapid economic
growth and its increasingly important world status explains the
basic reason why the EU has adopted a more positive China policy.
</P>
<P>
In a world that is moving towards multi-polarization, a closer
EU-China relationship would certainly benefit both sides, and the
world at large.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Parking Devices to Cover Whole of HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Following a successful
trial, the second phase of a new electronic parking devices (EPDs)
conversion program will cover all but one districts of Hong Kong
by March next year, it was announced here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the launch of the second
phase of the program, Principal Transport Officer Management Peter
Luk said that all districts, except "New Territories" East, will
be equipped with the new parking system.
</P>
<P>
The Transport Department official said that in the initial
phase of the program, about one-quarter of the 14,000 mechanical
parking meters in Hong Kong have been replaced by EPDs. Almost all
the rest -- about 10,000 within most of Hong Kong's districts --
will be converted to new devices in the second phase, which begins
on December 27 and ends next March.
</P>
<P>
In phase one of the conversion program which began in April
this year, a total of 3,500 mechanical meters in some districts on
Hong Kong Island and in Kowloon have been changed into EPDs within
two months.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, the mechanical meters will be replaced by
9,000 electronic parking meters (EPMs) and 50 pay-and-display
machines (PDMs), with the conversion first implemented in
districts on Hong Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
A few mechanical meters in "New Territories" East and some
remote areas will be replaced by EPDs at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
Both EPMs and PDMs are operated by a common smart card and
e-Park Card issued by the Transport Department, with the number of
sales outlets for e-Park Cards to be doubled to 500 in the second
phase.
</P>
<P>
The new parking system has been well received by motorists. The
first phase performed satisfactorily in key aspects including
operation, maintenance and in managing and retrieving relevant
information and data.
</P>
<P>
On average, the utilization of EPMs has increased by 16 percent
compared to the rate drawn by mechanical parking meters before
their replacement while the number of complaints has dropped by 84
per cent.
</P>
<P>
Luk promised to closely monitor the operation of the new
devices and introduce improvements if necessary.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Foreign Debt Goes Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's foreign debt went
down to 84.7 billion U.S. dollars as of December 10, a decline of
10 billion dollars from July last year when the baht began to be
floated.
</P>
<P>
Thai central bank officials said on Thursday that existing debt
levels include 12 billion baht (330 million dollars) in loans from
the International Monetary Fund, which pointed to the sharp fall
in private-sector foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Current foreign debt levels stood at about 60 percent of the
country's Gross National Product (GNP), well below the 80 percent
level considered dangerous.
</P>
<P>
The central bank predicted that foreign debt would fall to 48
percent of GNP within the next several years.
</P>
<P>
The terms of the obligation debt had also changed, with
short-term debt now accounting for just 26 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would have to begin repaying its loans to the IMF
within 18 months, according to the officials.

ATHENS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Greece's armed forces have been
since Wednesday closely monitoring the situation in Iraq following
air strikes launched overnight by the U.S. and Britain against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Greek National Defense General Staff's operations center
had been put on alert since Wednesday after the evacuation of
U.N. arms inspectors from Iraq, the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) quoted sources close to the National Defense General
Staff (GEETHA) as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Greece had no involvement in the events, the sources said,
adding that 11 Greek U.N. observers, currently at the Iraqi border
with Kuwait and in northern Iraq, were facing no problems.
</P>
<P>
The Greek media on Thursday also expressed their opposition to
the air strikes, saying that President Bill Clinton had launched
the military attacks against Iraq in order to postpone the
impeachment vote by U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Greece has repeatedly said that it opposes the settlement of
Iraq's disputes with U.N. arms inspectors through military

hoped for an earliest possible end to the military actions.
</P>
<P>
Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen said that he totally

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Excellent co-operation
between Police of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) and South China's Guangdong Province has brought down the
figures of illegal immigrants, according to deputy commissioner of
Hong Kong SAR's Police here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An eight-member delegation of Hong Kong Police led by Wong
Tsan-kwong, the deputy commissioner, returned from Shantou of
South China's Guangdong Province Wednesday evening after a two-day
meeting with the Guangdong Border Defense Bureau (GDBDB).
</P>
<P>
"The meeting examined ways to further enhance liaison and the
efficiency in the handling of intelligence in combating illegal
immigration," a Police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides reviewed the anti-illegal immigration tactics and
explored various means to further strengthen enforcement action
which included the exchange of skills and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased with the encouraging results in the
anti-illegal immigration work brought about by the excellent
co-operation between Hong Kong Police and the GDBDB," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
During their visit to Shantou, Hong Kong Police delegation
viewed the illegal immigration and smuggling blackspots in the
city and the delegation was also briefed on GDBDB's measures to
fight against illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
The GDBDB patrol vessels made a first ever visit to Hong Kong
SAR in June and the Hong Kong Marine Police made a reciprocal
visit to Guangdong in September.
</P>
<P>
By November this year, 13,201 illegal immigrants have been
arrested, which represented a 20 percent drop compared with 16,435
illegal immigrants netted during the corresponding period last

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- American forces launched the "Desert Fox" operation on
Wednesday by carrying out "substantial" bombings against Iraq.
The extraordinary session of the U.S. House of Representatives on
the impeachment procedure of President Bill Clinton scheduled for
Thursday has been postponed.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin arrived in Canada on

communities of the country.
</P>
<P>
-- By putting the United Nations Security Council before a fait

the U.N. arms inspectors presented a negative report on Iraqi
cooperation in disarmament. France deplored the "gearwheel"
which led to the U.S. strikes.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian FM Condemns Military Strikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Thursday condemned the unilateral
military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"This violates the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes
and the Charter of the United Nations," he said in a statement
released by the Foreign Ministry here.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the unilateral action on Iraq has set a
dangerous precedent and Malaysia urged member countries of the
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC) to oppose in the strongest manner this action by
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia counsels dialogue and consultation which is essential
to maintain the credibility of the United Nations process to
monitor Iraq's disarmament program. Malaysia sees no justification
for the military action which constitutes an aggression against
Iraq and which has also undermined the mandate of the U.N.
Security Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council
should be convened immediately to discuss the situation and to
bring a stop to the military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said: "Iraq on its part must also ensure full
compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions. The
eight-year-old sanctions have already exacted an excessive toll on
Iraq and its people and, in this regard, the latest U.S. military
strikes are totally ill-conceived. They only further undermine
peace and security in the region."
</P>
<P>
"Force cannot be used as a means to deal with international
disputes except where aggression has been committed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday in Hanoi, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad also condemned the U.S.-led air strikes on Iraq, saying
"We don't think that there should be any use of force."

BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The use of force by the US and

Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
China is deeply concerned about the possible consequences,
Jiang said in talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin

<P>
The Russian President called Jiang this afternoon and the two

</P>
<P>
Yeltsin praised China's stand on this issue, saying Russia can
never accept the military actions unilaterally taken by the United
States and Britain without the authorization of the UN Security
Council, especially at a time when it was holding discussions over
weapons inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Today's action has grossly violated the U.N. Charter and
international rules, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang outlined China's principled position on the crisis and
emphasized that China insists on a peaceful solution to
international disputes and opposes the use of force in world
affairs.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Cabinet Discusses Precautions After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti cabinet held
an extraordinary meeting Thursday morning to discuss necessary
precautions after the U.S. launched military strikes against Iraq
overnight.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Al-Dekheel, the deputy prime minister and minister of
state for cabinet affairs, said the meeting reviewed the situation
after the air raid which took place at about midnight local time
(2200 GMT) Wednesday, the official news agency Kuna reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also listened to a number of reports by ministers on
defensive and security preparations to maintain the country's
sovereignty and stability, Al-Dekheel said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting stressed the need to secure basic services and
requirements for citizens and residents, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 triggered the 1991 Gulf War
and led to the U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq designed to ensure
that Baghdad clears off all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Disputes over weapons inspections between Iraq and the
U.N. Special Commission, which oversees Iraq's disarmament, have
erupted into several crises.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dekheel said the cabinet has entrusted all concerned bodies
to take measures to face various emergencies and urged all
citizens to give assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said the cabinet will follow up the Iraqi crisis, but
expressed hope that all reasons behind the escalation of tension
will be addressed and all the people in the region be able to live
in peace.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced in a televised national
speech Thursday morning that he ordered the strike in retaliation
for Baghdad's obstruction of international weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has said that about 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles
were fired at targets in Southern and Northern Iraq, as well as in
Baghdad.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Plant More autumn and Winter Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China's farmers planted more
crops in this year's autumn and winter season which will help
alleviate shortages due to the severe floods which devastated this
summer's grain harvest.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the floods, official estimates indicate that
the harvest fell to 113.1 billion kilograms, eleven percent less
than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has revealed that
there has been a 2.2 percent increase in the late seasons'
plantings.
</P>
<P>
This followed a survey of 40,000 rural households in 700
counties which indicates that grain growing areas will actually be
down by 0.4 percent, to 29.8 million hectares, but that there will
be increased plantings of other crops.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Agriculture there were plans to
plant more than 30 million hectares of grain. However, the NBS
believes that because of comparatively lower returns on grain,
farmers are now more enthusiastic about growing high cash yield
crops.
</P>
<P>
For example, because of rising prices, farmers have increased
areas planted with oil-bearing crops and there will also be an
increase in the planting of vegetables and crops used for forage
this winter.
</P>
<P>
The NBS survey shows that the areas planted with wheat, a major
winter grain crop, will have decreased by 1.1 percent to 25.6 ha
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture noted that this season's planting
still faced some unfavorable conditions such as drought in the
northern part of the country, even though there has been unusually
high temperatures.

<HEADLINE> UK's Highest Court to Reopen Debate Over Pinochet Immunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Law Lords decided on
Thursday to open a fresh hearing into the question of whether
former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet has immunity from
extradition.
</P>
<P>
The House of Lords, the Highest Court in the United Kingdom, had
been asked by Pinochet's lawyers to set aside its previous rule
which said that he had no immunity.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers argued that one of the judges involved in the
previous decision was biased because of his close association with
the human rights group Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
After spending two days on listening to Pinochet's Lawyers'
arguments, a special panel agreed that a fresh hearing should be
held to decide whether the 83-year-old general should enjoy
immunity.
</P>
<P>
The new hearing is scheduled to be held in January. If
Pinochet wins, he will be free to leave Britain and will not face
trial in Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet is being detained in Britain on a Spanish warrant
seeking his extradition to face charges of murder. A Spanish
judge accused him of responsibility to the deaths and
disappearances of 3,000 people during his 17-year rule which ended
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
On November 25, a panel of five Law Lords ruled by three to two
that he had no immunity from prosecution as a former head of state
and a current Chilean senator.
</P>
<P>
One of the three judges who ruled against Pinochet, Lord
Hoffmann, is chairman of Amnesty's charitable arm while his wife
was an administrative assistance in the human rights body.
</P>
<P>
"Lord Hoffmann, who did not disclose his links with Amnesty
International was disqualified from sitting," Lord
Browne-Wilkinson, who presided over the appeal, said. The other
four judges sitting with him said they agreed.

<HEADLINE> Winter Flu Packs Tianjin Hospitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Hospitals in China's north
coast port city of Tianjin have been almost swamped with thousands
of patients after a major flu outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Now doctors are worried there may be a shortage of medicine.
</P>
<P>
At the city's Children's Hospital, long lines of sufferers
formed waiting to buy medicines or to be treated by doctors.
</P>
<P>
Harassed staff said the hospital has received more than one
thousand patients a day over the past few weeks, most of whom are
stricken by this latest strain of flu which has been sweeping
northern China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from eight major hospitals in the city show that
more than 10,000 people have caught the flu in the last couple of
days. Some hospitals have warned that they have nearly exhausted
their supplies of flu medicine.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts said the flu epidemic has been caused mainly
by abnormal weather conditions, especially sudden changes of
temperature. Over the past four days, the mercury has stayed at
around 10 degrees Celsius, a rare phenomenon in this part of China
at this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
Other doctors at the Tianjin Disease Prevention Center fear
the flu virus might have come from abroad and might have slightly
mutated from the usual strain, making it more difficult to treat.
</P>
<P>
Doctors are now calling for more publicity to show people how
to prevent catching flu and are advising the increased use of a
flu vaccine to stop further outbreaks.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Seen Fall and Bounce on Singapore Bourse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Share prices were seen fall
and bounce on Singapore Stock Market Thursday following the
U.S.-led air raids on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) inched up 5.54 points
to 1,364.64 at close, bouncing off the intra-day low of 1,324.62
points.
</P>
<P>
Share prices plummeted in the morning session following the
U.S.-led strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The bounce emerged in late morning as some investors came back
into the market hunting for value on hopes that the U.S.-led air
strike on Iraq would be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said these investors held the view that the air raids
would not last beyond the weekend.
</P>
<P>
They said the entry into the market by bargain hunters turned
banks and blue chips from losers into gainers.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover increased to 200.37 million units worth
316.28 million Singapore dollars (about 191.86 million U.S.
dollars). Losers outstripped gainers by 189 to 61 with 169
counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
KepB w0006 remained at the top of the actives chart of the day
with a turnover of 12.58 million units. KepLand was the second
most heavily traded stock with a volume of 8.09 million units
done. Wing T was next with 7.74 million counters changing hands.

11.00 Singapore dollars. Elec&AMP;E rose by 29 cents to end at 15.05
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> British Muslims, Peace Groups Protest Iraq Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- British Muslims and peace
groups on Thursday condemned U.S.-initiated and U.K.-supported air
strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Muslim groups and peace activists organized protests outside
Downing Street, where Prime Minister Tony Blair announced the air
raids on Wednesday evening London time. Someone daubed graffiti
on Britain's Cenotaph war memorial near Blair's office.
</P>
<P>
"The attack is a panic reaction by a besieged president,
totally irresponsible and the work of a leader bent on saving his
presidency," Reuters quoted the leader of the self-styled Muslim
Parliament of Great Britain, Ghayasuddin Siddiqui, as saying in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui said that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, "a creation
of the West allowed to survive the Gulf War, has once again been
used as a justification for maintaining a strong military presence
in the Arabian Peninsula," according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
The hardline Muslim group Al-Muhajiroun was organizing
demonstrations for midday Thursday outside Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
"This is a war against Allah," Al-Muhajiroun declared in a
statement. It said it was hypocritical of the West to use its
latest high-technology weapons to destroy Iraq's "weapons of mass
destruction."
</P>
<P>
"There is no justification for continuing the blockade against
the Muslims of Iraq, let alone renewing U.S. and British military
attacks," Al-Muhajiroun said.
</P>
<P>
Also, the National Peace Council planned a candlelit vigil for
Thursday evening outside Blair's office, including a left-wing
member of the prime minister's Labor party, Tony Benn, Reuters
said.

<HEADLINE> China's Consumer Index Edging Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December (Xinhua) -- China's Consumer Index, an
important indicator of the economic situation, edged down last
month, according to figures released by the National Bureau of
Statistics today.
</P>
<P>
The November Index of Consumer Expectations dropped by 0.9
points on the October base to 91.5 points, according to a survey
of 4,200 consumers conducted by the NBS's Economic Monitoring
Center.
</P>
<P>
Two other indices, related to current economic conditions and
actual consumers, also dropped by small margins.
</P>
<P>
The results indicated that China should pay more attention to
its consumer economic policy, which is a major springboard for
economic development, the bureau noted.
</P>
<P>
Only 38 percent of respondents agreed that the country will
maintain sustainable growth over the next five years. The ratio is
nine percentage points lower than in the previous month, noted the
bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Index of Current Economic Conditions, which indicates
consumer views on current economic conditions, has also dropped
0.9 point to reach 86.4 points.
</P>
<P>
The NBS suggests that the country needs to adopt measures to
help consumers understand more about current world and domestic
economic developments and to stimulate the consumer market.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Launches Fight To Tackle Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Burning coal in the city
center was banned from today in China's capital of Beijing, just
one of 19 emergency measures that officials are taking to curb the
serious air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's vice-mayor Wang Guangtao said, "All boilers within
the city's third ring road should now use clean fuel such as
natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas."
</P>
<P>
He warned that no new coal-burning facilities should be
built.
</P>
<P>
Other measures introduced from today to clean up Beijing's
highly polluted atmosphere include enforcing strict regulations on
the scrapping of old automobiles and introducing new control
standards on car exhaust emissions, as well as expanding the
greenbelt.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has also ordered all building firms
to wall off their sites to keep dust and debris from being
spread. It is estimated that Beijing's 5,000-plus construction
sites are responsible for nearly half of the city's air-borne dust
clouds.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has suffered from severe air pollution during recent
years, mostly because its residents burn 28 million tons of coal
every year. In winter, 90 percent of the sulphur dioxide, 50
percent of the nitrogen oxide and 40 percent of suspended
particles in the air are produced from such coal-burning.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 1.4 million motor vehicles choking up the
city's roads and highways also add to the pollution
problem. Exhaust fumes have become a major air pollutant.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that by using tough measures the municipal government
plans to improve the city's environment by next year and even more
so by the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
rocketed more than 1.5 percent higher Thursday after United
States-led bombing raids on Iraq ignited interest in oil, gold and
"defensive" stocks.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index finished 42.7 points up at
2,740.0, slightly off its intra-day peak of 2,741.0.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index surged 25.4 points or 2.71 percent to
961.8, while the all industrials index shot up 66.5 points to
4,915.9.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market opened higher on the air strikes news,
with gains in the price of gold and oil overnight spurred on those
sectors.
</P>
<P>
"(The market) is very firm on the back of the Iraq situation,"
said Macquarie Nevitts client adviser Steve Mayne.
</P>
<P>
He said firmer commodities prices overnight fuelled gains among
resource stocks.
</P>
<P>
"The oil stocks were up because of a fear of an oil shortage
because of the attacks," Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks were buoyed because the precious metal was often
regarded as a safe haven investment during times of international
crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among oil and gas stocks, Woodside Petroleum gained 15.8 cents,
Santos surged 18 and Novus Petroleum climbed nine.
</P>
<P>
The gold index rose 33.6 points to 1,134.7, with Lihir climbing

WMC climbing 20.22 and MIM easing one cent.
</P>
<P>

Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was a mixed day for banking stocks, with the industry
sub-index gaining 53.7 points to 6,271.0.
</P>
<P>
The National Australia Bank was the only "Big Four" player to
lose ground, shedding one cent, despite chairman Mark Rayner
forecasting further growth in business and profitability over the
current year.
</P>
<P>
ANZ made the most ground, picking up 28 cents or 2.66 percent,
while Commonwealth added 24 and Westpac rose 15.
</P>
<P>
In the telecommunications sector, Telstra charged 22.9 cents
higher, AAPT jumped 16 cents on turnover of 1.4 million shares and

<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Three criminal gangs involved
in smuggling fake money have been smashed and police have seized
fake notes of over 80 million RMB yuan, 26.7 million U.S. dollars
and 180 million Marks, a senior official with the Ministry of

Renminbi notes intended for distribution in the province. Another
seven suspects, from Taiwan and Guangdong, were arrested.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Battle To Save Chinese Leukemia Student </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Help has been flooding in
from all over China, including Taiwan, for Chongqing university
student Zhang Yu who has leukemia and needs an urgent but very
expensive bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old senior student at Chongqing Normal College,
was only diagnosed with leukemia in October and was told that a
bone marrow transplant was the only cure.
</P>
<P>
With such treatment costing several hundred thousand yuan it
was out of the financial reach of Zhang's family who are only
salaried workers.
</P>
<P>
But several influential newspapers like Beijing Youth Daily and
Yangcheng Evening News in Guangzhou took up Zhang Yu's cause and
made him a household name. Since their campaign took off
nationwide donations have reached nearly two hundred thousand yuan.
</P>
<P>
Now the crucial search for a matching bone marrow donor is
under way but the probability of finding a match is only one out
in 10,000, according to medical experts.
</P>
<P>
Even with the help of reporters from the Chongqing Morning
Post and Yangcheng Evening News, who conducted a thorough search
of the Guangzhou Marrow Donor Registry, a suitable match could not
be found.
</P>
<P>
Finally an urgent plea was faxed to Taiwan's Tzu Chi Taiwan
Marrow Donor Registry which has a profile of more than 16,0000
donors.
</P>
<P>
The response was encouraging and preparations are now under
way to send samples of Zhang's blood for tests to Taiwan this
Friday, courtesy of the Macao Airline.

WARSAW, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Polish government said
Thursday that it is necessary to take military actions against
Iraq after political means failed to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi authorities had refused to implement the U.N.
resolutions and their cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission
had been suspended, said a government statement.
</P>
<P>
In order to make Iraqi President Saddam Hussein adhere to
U.N. resolutions, it is necessary to take military actions, the
Polish Press Agency quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Poland also held out hope that the actions will not
bring damage to the civilians.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek
told reporters that he "deplored and was disappointed" over the
fact that the Iraqi crisis was not solved through political means
and the United States and Britain had to resort to force.

He did not say whether Poland would join the military actions
or not.

LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said on Thursday that Britain will be "heavily involved in
the next wave of air strikes against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, we'll be contributing about a fifth of the manned
aircraft raids," he said in an interview with BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
He said he had no reason to believe that the raids, which began
late Wednesday evening, were not successful.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Secretary also confirmed that Wednesday night's
raids had been carries out with United States cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
Further strikes would go ahead with the aim of degrading Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons program and diminishing its war
machine, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the end today," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
There are 12 British Air Force Tornado attack aircraft based in
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
"We have exhausted all other avenues," British Prime Minister
Tony Blair said in a statement delivered on Wednesday night less
than half an hour after the start of Operation Desert Fox around

</P>
<P>
Blair's announcement came about 35 minutes earlier than United

<HEADLINE> OAU Suggests Phased Solution to Congo (K) Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim has
suggested a two-phase solution to the crisis in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The suggestion is contained in a report Salim is expected to
deliver to the fourth ordinary session of the Central Organ of
the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and
Resolution at summit level, scheduled to open Thursday in
Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
The first phase should aim at the attainment of a cessation of
hostilities, the signing and actualization of a cease-fire, and
the deployment of an international peace-keeping force under the
auspices of the United Nations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The second phase should see the initiation of broader
political dialog involving groups other than the armed rebellion
to negotiate and forge a political dispensation that will meet
the aspirations of all Congolese, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report regretted that though great efforts have been done
by individual African leaders, the OAU and the U.N. to solve the
DRC crisis, the result has been very frustrating, with the lack
of any significant breakthrough so far.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general warned that if the crisis in DRC is
allowed to continue and escalate, it will have catastrophic
consequences not just for the Great Lakes region, but the whole
African continent.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the report also noted that there is now a
consensus on basic principles to be observed, including the need
for an immediate cease-fire, respect for the sovereignty of the
DRC, the withdrawal of foreign troops and political dialog within
DRC.
</P>
<P>
Salim noted that a foundation for a peaceful solution has
already been laid by previous efforts, and what is left to be
done is for the OAU Central Organ to help the conflicting parties
to narrow their differences for the attainment of peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to OAU sources, both Congolese President
Laurent Kabila and the rebel representatives are now in
Ouagadougou, but by Wednesday night, it was still not clear if
the rebels would be invited to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Kabila has not changed his position and refuses
direct dialog with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
About 24 African leaders and 30 delegations are expected to
attend the two-day meeting, which is scheduled to discuss
conflicts in Angola, Burundi, Guinea Bissau, the Comoros as well
as the dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

ISLAMABAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday expressed
grave concern and regrets for the U.S. strikes against Iraq and
called for immediate halt to these strikes.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply distressed over the sufferings caused to the
Iraqi people and the loss of civilian life and property in Iraq,"
said a press release by the Foreign Office Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan called for immediate halt to these strikes, it said.
"We feel the pain of the long suffering of the Iraqi people as a
result of continuing sanctions and repeated military strikes."
</P>
<P>
"Their hardships and tragedy must come to an end", it noted.
</P>
<P>
It said that "Pakistan believes in the peaceful resolution of
disputes and the avoidance of use or the threat of use of force."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan, therefore, supports implementation of and compliance
with all U.N. Security Council resolutions on a non-selective and
non-discriminatory basis," said the release.
</P>

It said Pakistan urges the United Nations Security Council to
take urgent measures to find a solution of the issue through
diplomatic means instead of use of force.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "Pakistan calls for ensuring the preservation of
Iraq's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and
immediate alleviation of the sufferings of the Iraqi people," the

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Condemns U.S. Air Strikes on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon Thursday strongly
condemned the air raids launched by the U.S. and Britain on Iraq,
demanding the two countries immediately stop the aggression.
</P>
<P>
"We condemned this assault and asked why only Israel in the
Middle East can be free of any punishment or pressure for its
occupation of Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian lands and its
neglect of international laws," Prime Minister-Designate Salim
Hoss told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
After months of disputes over weapons inspections, U.S. and
British forces early Thursday launched the biggest air strikes
against Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The attack came hours after a report by the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) chief Richard Butler, who accused Baghdad of
failing to fully cooperate with UNSCOM on disarming Iraq as
required in U.N. resolutions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said it seems that Iraqi people, especially children,
elderly and women, will suffer more than what the eight-year-old
U.N economic sanction has caused.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed on Iraq following its invasion of
Kuwait and the Security Council maintains that the sanctions will
not be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has eliminated all
its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Hoss also called on U.S. to stop the assault on Iraq and lift
the sanctions on it to respect Iraqi people's human rights.

<HEADLINE> Asian Games So Far So Good, Says OCA Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A top Olympic Council of Asia
official said here on Thursday the Asian Games had been a success
which only needed a "perfect ending".
</P>
<P>
Wei Jizhong, OCA's Sports Committee chairman, said highly of
the efforts of the Bangkok people to ensure a successful event.
</P>
<P>
"There were some problems with the Asian Games before the
start, but up to now, I can say that the Bangkok Asian Games are a
success," said Wei, who had visited the Thai capital almost every
month to monitor the preparation for the Games.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have already had a good start, we still need a perfect
ending. Everybody must work harder to make sure it is the best
Games ever."
</P>
<P>
Wei said that he was expressing his own views and OCA president
Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah would make the final assessment
upon the conclusion of the Games.
</P>
<P>
"It's just my personal evaluation. The Sheikh will evaluate
how successful the Games are after the closing ceremony," he said.
</P>
<P>
We said the Asian Games was one of the best ways to promote
Asian sports.
</P>
<P>
"Ten world records and 48 Games marks have been set and about
29 delegation has won medal here up to Wednesday against 22 in
Hiroshima," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Games has 36 medal sports and two demonstration
events.
</P>
<P>
"Many people have criticised the OCA, saying there are too many
sports or too many athletes," said Wei.
</P>
<P>
"But we've shown that the OCA policy is a correct one. We
prefer to look at it positively.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to promote sports or a sport in a country is to
win a medal at the Asian Games. If a government sees that its
country can win a medal, they will put in more money to develop
that sport."

<HEADLINE> WTO Urges Canada to Improve Trade Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization
(WTO) called on Canada here Thursday to improve trade measures in
sensitive sectors like agriculture following a three-day meeting
to review Canada's trade policies.
</P>
<P>
"Areas such as agriculture, textiles and clothing, motor
vehicles and certain services have proved impervious to change,"
said a WTO report.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the WTO said, Canada's preferential arrangements
give rise to questions about their possible distortion of trade
patterns.
</P>
<P>
While China's simple average tariff is down to 7.7 percent in
1998, compared with 9.2 percent in 1996, the WTO said, tariff
protection remains significant for food products, textiles,
clothing and footwear, all areas where developing countries could
well have a comparative advantage.
</P>
<P>
"Canada's in-quota access is in some instances reserved for
imports from preferential trading partners," said the
WTO. "Tariffs on out-of-quota supplies are often over 200
percent."
</P>
<P>
The WTO also noted that Canada's new customs tariff, in effect
since January 1, 1998, greatly simplified and rationalized its
import regime. Almost half of all tariff lines are now duty free,
up from a third in 1996 when its trade policies were reviewed
last time.
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that Canada's pursuit of an
outward-oriented strategy, combined with prudent macroeconomic
policies, has been integral to its recent strong economic
performance. Its multi-track approach to international trade and
investment relations has further opened up Canada's economy, and
resulted in greater competitiveness in many sectors of its
economy.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Senate Condemns U.S. Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Senate Thursday
unanimously passed a resolution condemning the U.S. air attack
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted by the Senate after a debate on the
issue termed the attack as one against the whole Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
It urged the international community and the U.N. Security
Council to take immediate measures to stop the attack on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Winding up the debate in the Senate, Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz called upon all parties concerned to resort to
dialogue as a mean to resolve the conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said progress towards this end can only be achieved by
adhering to the U.N. resolutions and respect for Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Aziz regretted that the use of force against Iraq comes at a
time when billions of Muslims are preparing for the holy month of
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
He said the attack had added to the miseries of the Iraqi
civilian population and imposed a threat to regional peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
The attack has sent a wave of concern and anguish throughout
the world particularly the Muslim world, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Pakistan has consistently supported implementation
of all U.N. resolutions without selective application in true
letter and spirit.
</P>
<P>
While supporting the U.N. resolutions, Pakistan has
consistently opposed the use of force and wants peaceful
resolution of the conflict through diplomatic efforts, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan supports the statement made by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Thursday morning expressing sadness
at the failure of the U.N. to prevent the attack.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has called for continuing cooperation between Iraq and
the U.N. weapons inspectors and a comprehensive review of Iraq's
compliance with the Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan feels that Iraq has complied substantially
with the resolutions and there was no immediate danger of any
non-compliance.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Denounces U.S. Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Thursday
denounced the overnight air strikes by the United States and
Britain on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The strike will "not help settle pending issues" between Iraq
and the U.N., AL chief Esmat Abdel-Meguid, who is on a visit to
Italy, said in a telephone interview with Egypt's Voice of Arab
radio Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British decision to strike Iraq was "a unilateral
one which did not garner the U.N. Security Council approval,"
Abdel-Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of missiles rained down on Iraq at around midnight
local time (2200 GMT) Wednesday, killing two people and wounding
30 others.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said the raid was a retaliation for
Iraq's defiance of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), which
oversees Iraq's disarming of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The airstrike came only hours after UNSCOM chief Richard Butler
reported to the U.N. that Iraq failed to fully cooperate with
UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
He accused Baghdad of refusing to hand over weapons-related
documents demanded by UNSCOM and obstruct the work of weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said the attack was launched against an Arab state
which has been implementing and abiding by U.N. Security Council
resolutions, expressing concern that it "will only complicate
things."
</P>
<P>
The chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab organization also lashed
out at Butler, saying he was "not objective" in dealing with the
U.N. arms inspections in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Official Says Peso Unlikely to Appreciate Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso is unlikely
to appreciate further as "an excessively strong peso is just as
unsustainable and destabilizing as an excessively weak peso,"
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of local exporters, Singson said that the
central bank would continue to allow the market to determine the
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The market-determined exchange rate would be "supportive of our
external competitiveness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that the central bank always believes in achieving
an overall balance in market conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, the market sentiment Thursday drove again back the
peso to a closing rate of 39.45 to the U.S. dollar although it
reached an intra-day high of 39.44 to the dollar and intra-day low
of 39.59.
</P>
<P>
Bank treasurers initially expected the peso to appreciate in
the last remaining days of the month following dollar inflows from
some investors, loan proceeds and returning overseas contract
workers.
</P>
<P>
While there was initial optimism that the peso could strengthen
to 37 to the dollar, market sentiment has kept the currency at 39
pesos against the greenback.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Crisis Adds Spark to Australian Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-led air strikes on
Iraq attracted offshore buyers to the "safe-haven" Australian
markets Thursday, boosting the Australian dollar and bond prices.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar found support from overseas buyers early,
reaching a high of 62.60 U.S. cents at midday.
</P>
<P>
However, local interests met the rally with afternoon selling,
pushing it back to finish flat and close to its lows for the day.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended at 62.37 U.S. cents, steady with
Wednesday's close. It traded within a range of 62.20 and 62.60
during the day.
</P>
<P>
Steve Nitis, senior manager corporate foreign exchange at
Commonwealth Bank, said the drama in Iraq had led to the
Australian dollar being quite well bid by "quality names" from
offshore.
</P>
<P>
He said the offshore support had been predicated on an
improvement in fundamentals such as a firmer gold price and a
turn-up in the Commodities Research Bureau Index.
</P>
<P>
Nitis said the outlook remained bullish for the currency over
the next month and the next move would more likely be to 63 to 64
U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The federal government's mid-year economic outlook, reported by
Treasurer Peter Costello, was overshadowed by events in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The government revised its forecasts for economic growth up to
3.25 percent, from the election-time estimate of 2.75 percent, for
1998/99.
</P>
<P>
Economists, reflecting on the upgrade, said it remained a
conservative estimate and growth could still rise further on the
upside.
</P>
<P>
Costello declared that the Australian economy was a solid rock
that was outperforming the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
At the close here Thursday the Australian dollar was buying
72.38 Japanese yen from 72.46 and 1.0398 German marks from 1.0339.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leaders Leave for Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A 35-member delegation led
by Ali Mahdi Mohamed left Somalia Thursday for Tripoli, Libya.
</P>
<P>
The delegation included senior officers from the recently
announced administration of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to Ali Mahdi Mohamed who briefed the journalists
before his departure, their unexpected journey to Libya is at the
official invitation of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi of Libya.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi said he will meet Hussein Mohamed Aidid who is
currently in Cairo and will join the delegation to Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi said the 3-5 days visit to Libya may pave the way
for a national reconciliation conference for all the Somalis and
called on the Somali politicians to get ready for helping the
establishment of a government of national unity in the near
future in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Such conference which was scheduled to be held in the town of
Baidoa was postponed for several times, and the last time was set
to meet on January 15 following a four-month delay announced by
the so-called national coordination committee co-chaired by Ali
Mahdi and Hussein Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The Libya visit by the top political leaders of Mogadishu is
also taking place at a time when Colonel Abdullahi Yussuf Ahmed,
the president of the recently established regional administration
of Northeastern Somalia known as Puntland, is also visiting
Libya.
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi Yussuf had been one of the two Darod clan leaders
who boycotted the Cairo peace deal late last year after accusing
Egypt of not being neutral in the political affairs of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The politicians now believe that Gaddafi is trying to mend the
disruption over all reconciliation process of the country, a very
difficult goal to be achieved since the Somali politicians never
or very rarely change or renounce their political views
concerning the power sharing of the country.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Mogadishu leaders are having their own
problems here back home where several leaders are firmly opposing
to their administration.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi said they are meeting Abdullahi Yussuf in Libya.
</P>
<P>
"Let's hope something positive will come out of that," he said
with some considerable doubt.
</P>
<P>
"Libya is one of those Arab countries given the mandate to
help sort out the problems of Somalia and restore the nation back
on its feet," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Since Mogadishu's administration was announced, Libya has been
helping Ali Mahdi and Hussein Aidid with all it can including
cash money for the payment of the encamped 3,000 police force of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said Mohamed Hajji Ibrahim Egal, the president
of the break-away republic of Somaliland, was also invited to
visit Libya to attend the meeting by the Somali politicians.
</P>
<P>
However, sources close to Egal's office said he had declined
to accept the offer at this particular time. The sources said
Egal would only accept such a meeting when a unique
administration is founded for southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, faction leader Osman Ali Atto reportedly will not
attending the Libya meeting.

MADRID, December 17 (Xinhua) -- After "careful" consideration,
the Spanish government said Thursday that it supported the
U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government should be held "responsible" for the
current situation, Spain said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the Iraqi government to fully resume cooperation
with the United Nations to end Iraqi people's "sufferings" caused
by the situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most of the opposition parties of Spain condemned
the U.S. and Britain for their strikes. Some said the raids were
"lacking the least legal foundation," which would bring about
"unexpected consequences."
</P>
<P>
The United States began airstrikes against Iraq in the early
hours Thursday, just one day after the United Nations Special
Commission on Disarming Iraq pulled out all its staff from
Baghdad.

BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- K. Damayanthi Darsha of Sri
Lanka, gold medalist in the women's 400 meters, beat 100m champion
Li Xuemei in the 200m semifinals on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Darsha defeated Li in the last few meters since the Asian
record holder of China apparently slowed down her pace.
</P>
<P>
Darsha clocked 23.16 seconds against Li's 23.35, which was far
behind her Asian record of 22.01 run in the Eighth Chinese
Naitonal Games last year.
</P>
<P>
With the top three in each of the two groups qualifying for
Friday's finals, India's legendary P.T. Usha finished fourth in
the second group in 24.27 and was out of the contention.
</P>
<P>
The Indian veteran, who has crashed in the 100m and 4X100m
relay, has only one event of 4X400m relay left in her fifth Asian
Games.
</P>
<P>
"She is not in a good shape since she has an injury in her
leg," India's coach Hargovind Singh said.
</P>
<P>
Li, who overcame a fever and stomach problem to win the 100m on
Monday, said yesterday that there will be no problem for her to
win a third gold medal from the 200m event.
</P>
<P>
"After winning the two events of 100m and 4X100m, I've got more
confidence," she said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Hopes for Quick End to Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government hopes the
U.S.-led attacks on Iraq will end quickly and that events will go
in the direction of a political solution to the crisis within the
framework of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Italian Senate, Dini said the Italian
government hopes that the military action launched late Wednesday
"will end as soon as possible and that initiatives necessary for a
political solution within the framework of the United Nations can
be started up."
</P>
<P>
He said he was following the developments in close contact with
Premier Massimo D'Alema and that he had conferred over the
telephone during the night with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
"The Italian government is following events unfolding in Iraq
and the American initiative to strike military objectives in Iraqi
territory with great concern," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
According to the Italian government, the crisis is caused by
Iraq's failure to comply with U.N. resolutions and repeated
failure to cooperate with weapons inspectors. This failure to
cooperate, said Dini, has "stopped the commission from carrying
out its duties of searching for and eliminating weapons of mass
destruction."
</P>
<P>
At this point, he said the government hopes the strikes will
end quickly to give way to a settlement within the
U.N. framework.

had ordered the air strikes, saying that, in halting at the
last-minute attacks in November, "I gave Saddam a chance, not a
license."

</P>
<P>
-- An atmosphere of shocked dismay descended upon United Nations
headquarters Wednesday night as Kofi Annan, the U.N. Secretary

violence in the Gulf and avert the decision taken by Washington and

<HEADLINE> U.S. Throws Hundreds of Tomahawks on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The first waves of the
U.S. airstrikes against Iraq Wednesday will have sent 200-300
Tomahawk cruise missiles on Iraqi targets, senior U.S. defense
officials said.
</P>
<P>
As dawn broke over Iraq, U.S. spy satellites and U-2 spy planes
carried out overflight missions to assess the destruction wrought
by the first wave of strikes, the Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
The attack started Wednesday at 5 p.m. EST -- midnight Iraqi
time -- with sea-launched cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
Primary targets for the Tomahawks were Iraqi military
communications nodes and facilities within several of Iraq's
sprawling presidential palaces, a senior defense official was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
U.S. defense officials said that top-priority targets include
suspected biological and chemical weapon manufacturing and storage
sites, weapons delivery assets such as missile factories, and
facilities to manufacture and store mobile missile launchers.
</P>
<P>
The officials also said that with the arrival of the USS Carl
Vinson carrier battle group Friday, the U.S. Navy will be able to
launch upwards of 500 more cruise missiles at Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon used cruise missiles and radar-evading aircraft in
the first wave of strikes to avoid casualties. But following
phases of the airstrikes will involve conventional U.S. warplanes.
</P>
<P>
The United States is sending 1,500 Army troops to join 3,000
already in Kuwait. In addition, hundreds more will deploy with
Patriot missile defense batteries along with a special nuclear,
chemical and biological defense unit.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Wednesday that the
"serious and sustained" strikes were not expected to eliminate
Iraq's arsenal or end the need for a massive U.S. military
presence in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to degrade (Saddam's) capacity to threaten his
neighbors with chemical, biological or nuclear weapons and the
means to deliver them," Cohen said at a Pentagon news conference.
"We're not seeking to eliminate it."

<HEADLINE> No Air Traffic Increase in U.K. Air Base in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- There is no increase in air
traffic in the British military air base of RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus
following the combined U.S.-U.K. air strikes on Iraq, the base's
spokesman Jon Brown said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brown said, however, the base is ready to help out, if
and when necessary.
</P>
<P>
Normal air traffic at the British military air base RAF
Akrotiri, west of Cyprus' southern coastal town of Limassol,
consists of weekly flights to and from U.K. carrying personnel
and other flights as required.
</P>
<P>
Brown said the U.S. has not so far requested Britain's
permission to use the base.
</P>
<P>
He did acknowledge that when the equipment originally went
out to the Gulf, "some of it came via Akrotiri, some time
ago".
</P>
<P>
Asked if there are any contingency plans because of the current
situation in the Gulf, Brown said the bases as a military force
"always have contingency plans for all sorts of scenarios".
</P>
<P>
Brown said the U.S. has a detachment in Akrotiri, which
is the support flight for their Beirut embassy.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Unveils Record Breaking Buick Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The first Buick-New Century
car produced by Shanghai General Motors came off the assembly line
today and the company was immediately hailed for breaking new
records in auto production.
</P>
<P>
The factory was only set up 18 months ago and the chairman and
CEO of the General Motors in the U.S., who drove the white car
into the history books, praised the management and workforce for
their efforts.
</P>
<P>
Mr Smith's co-driver was Shanghai GM president Chen Xianglin
while Shanghai Communist Party chief Huang Ju was given the honor
of pressing the production line's start button.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Pudong New Area, Shanghai GM is the largest
motor vehicle joint venture in China. It was set up in June, 1997
by Shanghai Motor Vehicle Group and GM in the United States at a
cost of 1.52 billion U.S. dollars, invested in a 50:50 ratio.
</P>
<P>
It boasts the most advanced assembly line technologies in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The new model can use both leaded and lead-free petrol, which
is in line with China's efforts to protect the environment by
encouraging the use of lead-free fuel.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai GM plans to put two versions of the car - the New
Century and the Dynasty - into mass production in April, 1999,
with annual output targeted at 100,000.
</P>
<P>
This will increase the annual motor vehicle production
capacity of Shanghai, the country's largest auto manufacturing
center, to 400,000 and the joint venture plans to develop other
models from 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has now designated the motor vehicle
industry as a pillar industry of its Ninth Five-Year-Plan
(1996-2000).

<HEADLINE> Exports of China's Light Industrial Products Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Despite the negative impact of
the Asian financial crisis and this summer's serious flooding,
exports of China's light industrial products have grown
significantly this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Customs Office, the export volume reached
40.4 billion U.S. dollars in the first nine months of this year,
up 6.6 percent over the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the export valume of machinery and
electronic products hit 11.4 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of
7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
An official from the State Administration of Light Industry
attributed the increase to efforts in making maximum use of the
best ways to export products and to Chinese companies seeking out
more overseas markets during the year.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the increase in exports was also attributed
to the opening of factories abroad and to the state allowing some
enterprises to export their products without interference.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China has so far set up more than
300 factories in 30 countries, including the United States,
Germany, France and some Southeast Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has expressed deep concern
over the U.S. air strikes against Iraq, urging all parties
concerned in the current Iraqi crisis to remove tension.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's words came following surprise air raids launched by
the U.S. and Britain on Iraq at around midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Mubarak said Wednesday that Egypt is a partner in the
Mideast peace process and in ensuring stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the remarks after meeting with visiting
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, who arrived
here Wednesday to brief Mubarak on the outcome of his talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton paid a three-day visit last Saturday through Tuesday to
Israel and the Palestinian areas to try to get the stalled Wye
agreement back on track. But the three-way meeting on Tuesday
failed to make significant progress.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Mubarak received a message from French President Jacques
Chirac Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The message was delivered by Jerome Meneau, the board chairman
of the French water research and projects company Suisse Leopard.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from meeting with Mubarak, Meneau said that his
company is ready to contribute to infrastructure projects and
mega-industrial and economic schemes underway in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- The fourth fair of Egyptian village products will open
Thursday to display products for the fasting month of Ramadan,
including fresh vegetables, fruit, dairy and leather products and
ready-made garments. The fair will last for 10 days.

<HEADLINE> Australia Raises Forecast for Growth in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
Thursday boosted its forecast for gross domestic product (GDP)
growth in 1998/99 to 3.25 percent despite the Asian economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
And it said the budget surplus in the current financial year
was estimated to be 3.3 billion Australian dollars (2.06 billion
U.S. dollars), 580 million Australian dollars (362.5 million U.S.
dollars) higher than previously estimated and more than double the
previous fiscal year's surplus.
</P>
<P>
"What the picture today shows is in the face of the Asian
financial fury with some parts of Asia contracting by as much as
10 percent, the Australian economy has been a solid rock, a strong
rock, outperforming the world," Treasurer Peter Costello told
reporters while releasing the government's mid-year outlook.
</P>
<P>
The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook for 1998/99 boosted
growth for 1998/99 to 3.25 compared with 2.75 percent forecast in
the government's pre-election outlook.
</P>
<P>
However, GDP growth was seen slowing in 1999/2000 to 2.75
percent, in year average terms.
</P>
<P>
The document also boosted expected employment growth for
1998/99 to 2 percent, from 1.75 percent previously forecast, but
falling back to 1.25 percent in 1999/2000.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate was seen at a year average of 8 percent
this fiscal year - unchanged from earlier forecasts due to an
expected slowing in domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Inflation was seen lower than previously expected, with the
consumer price index (CPI) expected to rise by 2 percent in
1998/99 compared with 2.5 percent in earlier forecasts.
</P>
<P>
In 1999/2000, inflation is expected to rise slightly to 2.5
percent but Costello pointed out that it would remain within the
monetary policy target band of 2-3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The mid-year review saw the Australian budget staying in
surplus into the outyears, although there was some impact from the
introduction of the federal government's tax package.
</P>
<P>
The mid-year review said the current account deficit was set to
widen to 32 billion Australian dollars (20 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1998/99, or 5.5 percent of GDP, reflecting the weaker
international environment.
</P>
<P>
Costello said the government remains committed to maintaining
its strong fiscal position, "and will be taking a highly
disciplined approach during the coming budget processes."
</P>
<P>
The current fiscal outlook is consistent with the maintenance
of surpluses while economic growth remains sound, and the
objective of halving Commonwealth General net debt remains on
track, he added.

<HEADLINE> Former Vice-President Joins Nigeria's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's former Vice-President
Alex Ekwueme has formally declared his ambition to seek
nomination as flag-bearer of the People's Democratic Party (PDP)
in the February 27 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The former vice-president made the announcement Wednesday in
Kaduna, northern Nigeria, during a public lecture organized by
the Ahmed Bello University, the New Nigerian reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that he wanted to be president because he has a vision
of a great Nigeria where probity, accountability, integrity and
transparency are enthroned.
</P>
<P>
He has a vision of a Nigeria where free and compulsory
education is the norm, where agriculture is supported and food is
in abundance, where utilities work and industries are in
production, and where the health of the citizens is given its
priority, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ekwueme promised to work assiduously to restore the country as
a showcase for social justice, peace and prosperity, a country
expected to assume its formal role as the authentic leader of the
growing Africa Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
He restated his suggestion that the country should have three
vice-presidents in the next civilian government, saying that the
arrangement will instill a sense of belonging in governance among
the constituent units of the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Ekwueme, an Ibo from the eastern part of the country, was the
vice-president in the second republic of the Federal Government
headed by former President Shehu Shargari.
</P>
<P>
He maintained a low profile politically until a few months to
the end of General Sani Abacha's life in June when he emerged as
leader of the G-34 coalition of politicians to oppose Abacha's
plan to transform himself into a civilian president.
</P>
<P>
Ekwueme, an educated architect and businessman, has nurtured
the G-34 into a political party, the People's Democratic Party
which analysts have described as the most national of all the
political parties in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
During the December 5 local government elections, the PDP
scored five percent votes and above in all the 36 states and the
Federal Capital Territory in the country with 459 out of 774
chairmanship positions of the local governments.

<HEADLINE> Largest Asset Sale in Thailand Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The largest asset sale of 56
closed financial firms in Thailand has proved to be a failure,
sources at the Financial Restructuring Authority (FRA) said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The FRA, set up to manage liquidation of the 56 financial
companies which closed last year, launched the auction on
Wednesday as the largest one-day sale in history.
</P>
<P>
Assets worth 371 billion baht (10.3 billion U.S. dollars) were
offered for sale. But bids for only nine of the 45 lots up for
sale were accepted by the FRA board. Six of the lots attracted no
bids, while the remaining 30 lots had bids under benchmark prices
set by the FRA.
</P>
<P>
Bids on the nine lots sold totaled 37 percent of the 371
billion baht in assets involved, fairly high considering that up
to 90 percent of the total loan portfolio offered by the FRA in
the auction is non-performing.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the auction will be split by creditors of the 56
companies next year, with the central bank, the largest creditor,
having a 90-percent share.
</P>
<P>
The FRA will negotiate with participating investors next week
on whether they would increase their bids or accept the
profit-sharing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Under the profit-sharing, the FRA would allow investors to buy
assets below the benchmark prices. But future capital gains on the
assets would be shared with the government.
</P>
<P>
FRA chairman Amaret Sila-on said he was disappointed with the
auction results and deemed the auction "a failure."
</P>
<P>
He said failure to pass crucial legal reforms, particularly new
foreclosure and bankruptcy procedures, was a major factor for the
poor auction results, Amaret said.
</P>
<P>
Delays by parliament in implementing legal reforms had
increased risks for investors, he said, adding that Political
friction about the asset sale process, as well as social dissent,
had also discouraged some investors from participation.
</P>
<P>
Several opposition politicians, academics and businessmen have
attacked the auctions on nationalistic grounds, charging the
process would result in local assets being sold cheaply to
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Others have voiced concerns that investors were colluding with
borrowers of the 56 companies to buy back loans cheaply at the
expense of public taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
The FRA has said it will prosecute any investors found to have
colluded with borrowers, and maintains that the auction process
has been in line with the best international practices.

Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs) captured during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war, bringing the number of released Iraqi POWs to
55,150.
</P>
<P>
Ahmand Safavi, an Iranian official in the western Kermanshah
province told the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) on Thursday
that the 375 Iraqi POWs were released at Khosrawi border point in
line with an agreement recently reached between Iranian and Iraqi
officials in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
He said representatives from the two countries from the
International Committee of the Red Cross were present at the
releasing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has so far set free 39,364 Iranian POWs since the
two neighbors started swap of POWs in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq reached an agreement in January to step up
their efforts to solve the remaining issues between them.
</P>
<P>
In April, Iran swapped 5584 Iraqi pows for 319 Iranian
pows. Since may this year, the two sides also exchanged the
remains of several hundred Iranian and Iraqi soldiers killed.

<HEADLINE> French Military Chief Opposes Missile System in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The setup of a deterrent
missile system in the Gulf can only raise instability in the
region, said J.P.Kelche, visiting Chief of Staff of the French
Joint Forces on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with his counterpart Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed
Al-Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kelche said
U.S. recommendation to establish the defensive missile system in
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member countries to counter
nuclear proliferation in the region will further threaten regional
stability and security.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Oman, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Such an anti-ballistic missile system will not be "100 percent
proof," but encourage adversaries to build up their military
capabilities instead, said Kelche, who arrived here last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It can be interpreted by neighbors as a sign of mistrust and
fuel the arms race," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kelche said France considers that security can be achieved in
the region through peaceful solutions to state-to-state
disagreements, which means "the sincere pursuit of the peace
process between Israel and the Palestinians and the compliance by
all, including Iraq, with Security Council resolutions."

<HEADLINE> Experts Say Microelements Help Increase Rice Yields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese specialists have
found that most plants need microelements in addition to manure
and that a balanced supply of microelements may help increase
yields of the plant and improve the quality of the products.
</P>
<P>
Seven microelements, especially boron, molybdenum and zinc,
can effectively increase the yields of rice, according to
experiments made by local specialists.
</P>
<P>
The experiments show that the output of low-yielding rice
paddy applied with manure which contains boron, molybdenum and
zinc is up 21 percent compared with conventional fields.
</P>
<P>
Experts also said that different regions have different
specialities because of the variant structure of microelements in
the field. The famous Longjing green tea is produced only in the
areas around Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province, because the
fields in the region have higher contents of silicon, potassium
and phosphorus and low contents of calcium, magnesium and
manganese.
</P>
<P>
The quality grapefruit produced in southern Zhejiang province
and the walnut in western Zhejiang are also attributed by experts
to the content of certain microelements in the field.

HANOI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice President
Hu Jintao said here Thursday that China attaches great importance
to the development of friendship and cooperation with Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"We also value highly the role Malaysia plays in international
and regional affairs," Hu said at a meeting with Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Hu, who is here on a three-day official visit to
Vietnam, congratulated Mahathir on his country's success in

BRUSSELS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier

<HEADLINE> OCA Against All Kinds of Corruption, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Asian sports ruling body
was strongly against all kinds of corruption, said a top OCA
official on Thursday following the allegations that an agent had
tried in vain to bribe a Chinese athlete to throw a match.
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 task of OCA is against doping. The No. 2 is against
all kinds of corruption," said Wei Jizhong, Chairman of OCA Sports
Committee.
</P>
<P>
An agent had contacted a Chinese table tennis player in a
bribery attempt which the Chinese rejected categorically, Wei said
in an interview by Xinhua News Agency Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"An agent who speaks Chinese tried to bribe the player with a
certain amount of U.S. dollars. The Chinese refused clearly the
offer, saying he or she competes under OCA spirit and the
Bangkok Asian Games motto," the OCA official said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese athlete reported to Chef de Mission about this.
The chief immediately asked him or her to remember the face of the
agent in order to catch him.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately they failed to do it, the agent disappeared
after the refusal by the Chinese player."
</P>
<P>
Wei said he would submit a report on the alleged bribery
attempt to OCA Director General Mr. Muttaleb Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, China's deputy Chef de Mission Li Furong told a press
conference that a Chinese athlete had rebuffed a bribery attempt
from a person who asked the athlete to throw a match in exchange
for money.
</P>
<P>
"Gold medal and sportsmanship are not for sale. Never," said
Li, also vice chairman of the Chinese Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Chinese athlete told the briber that even 100,000
dollars would not force him or her to give up the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"The national interest and the honor of the country cannot be
exchanged for money," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese offical didn't name the player who had been
contacted by the agent.
</P>
<P>
China has swept all but the men's singles titles in the Asian
Games table tennis. The 20-year-old Wang Nan won four golds from
the mixed doubles, women's team, singles and doubles events, while
China's other gold came from the men's team.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Kim Taek Soo downed Chinese Liu Guoliang for the
men's singles top honor, winning over the dual Olympic champion
four times in row in as many months.

<HEADLINE> Albright Defends U.S.-British Airstrikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Wednesday night defended U.S.-British
airstrikes against Iraq despite strong opposition by other United
Nations Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to use force because other means simply have
not worked," Albright told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"Showdowns last fall, last winter, last month were all
concluded without air strikes after Iraq promised to cooperate
fully with U.N. weapons inspectors. Throughout, we worked hard to
maintain Security Council unity by allowing time and then more
time for Iraq to live up to those promises," she said.
</P>
<P>
"As the United States' chief diplomat, I can tell you that we
exhausted every diplomatic approach and every possibility," she
said, adding that "Saddam Hussein blew it."
</P>
<P>
But the United States and Britain were alone when they began
the raids on Iraq at 21:49 GMT Wednesday and their military
action against Iraq aroused strong opposition from other United
Nations Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China condemned the military action and said that
the airstrikes violated the U.N. Charter. The two countries
demanded immediate halt to the military attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
France, which fought alongside the United States and Britain in
the 1991 Gulf War, disassociated itself from the military action
and said it could have grave consequences on the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is they have no answers as to how to make (Iraq)
comply" with U.N. Security Council disarmament demands, Albright
said in dismissing the opposition.
</P>
<P>
"And the bottom line is that it would be very nice if those who
do not support our approach had an approach that worked," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, Albright said that she was satisfied with the support
from other countries for the U.S. approach and that the Pentagon
had the military cooperation it needed in the region to carry out
its mission.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Oppose U.S. Air Strikes on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian officials
said Thursday that they do not support the U.S. air strikes
against Iraq, stressing that dispute can be resolved only by
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"We don't condone the use of force by the United States. We
believe solutions should come from peaceful means," Saeb Erekat,
senior Palestinian negotiator with Israel, said in a televised
speech Thursday. "This is a sad day for us," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, adviser to Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Chairman Yasser Arafat, said the U.S. military action will not
solve problems but only increase sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"We, as the Palestinians, feel solidarity with the Iraqi
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The surprise missile attack on Baghdad launched by U.S. and
Britain came at around midnight Thursday only hours after
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) chief Richard Butler submitted a
report over the weapons inspections in Iraq to the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Butler accused Iraq of having failed to live up to its promise
to provide full cooperation to UNSCOM, which oversees Iraq's
disarming of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian reactions were less strong compared with those
in the 1991 Gulf War, sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
1990, when the Palestine Liberation Organization expressed its
support for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and staged large-scale
demonstrations against the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The PNA has kept a low-profile in the recent confrontations
between the U.S. and Iraq, refraining from condemning Washington,
the major mediator in its peace-making with Israel.
</P>
<P>
But hundreds of Palestinian youths in a refuge camp in the
Palestinian-ruled Bethlehem demonstrated Thursday morning to
protest against the U.S. strike. They burnt U.S. and Israeli
flags.
</P>
<P>
In another West Bank city of Ramallah, Palestinians marched on
the streets Thursday to show their solidarity with the Iraqi
people, Jerusalem Media and Communications Center, a Palestinian
news service, reported.

BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- After Beijing and Hiroshima,
East Asian teams continued to dominate the Asian Games track
cycling events, taking five out of seven golds at stake at the Hua
Mark Velodrome.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, which wom the remaining two golds, is the only
central Asian country which could challenge powerhouses like
Japan, South Korea and China.
</P>
<P>
Men's sprint is still Japan's domain, with Keirin racers
Yoichiro Kamiyama and Nariaki Mabuchi completing a one-two finish.
</P>
<P>
But the victories have historical significance as Kamiyama is the
the first professional cyclist grabbing an Asian Games gold.
</P>
<P>
However, Japan lost to the men's 1-km time trial title to South
Korean Ji Sung-Hwan.
</P>
<P>
South Korea became the winner again in the team pursuit event,
beating old rival Kazakhstan in the final to repeat its victory in
Hiroshima four years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the central Asian state is still unbeatable in the
longer individual distance races, as Vadim Kravchenko kept his
4-km pursuit title.
</P>
<P>
In the heatly contested 40-km points race, Kazakhstan's Sergey
Lavrenenko excelled.
</P>
<P>
China proved its strength in women's events by claiming all the
golds and silvers.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qingzhi retained her 3-km individual pursuit title won in
last Asiad competition and Wang Yan battled against a fatal
disease to triumph in the sprint.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei emerged as the possible title contender in the next
Games as they won three bronzes here.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the team, who came empty-handed from Hiroshima,
attributed the progress to shifting focus from long distance events to
shorter ones.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea supports the United
States' airstrikes against Iraq, the Foreign Affairs and Trade
Ministry said Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The Korean government understands and supports the position of
the U.S. government that its military action was unavoidable,"
said a ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said, South Korea hopes that the
military targets will solely be confined to Iraq's military
capabilities and that no Iraqi civilian casualties will result as
a consequence.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the current Iraqi crisis will be resolved at the
earliest possible date through Iraq's immediate and unconditional
implementation of relevant U.N. resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Stephen
Bosworthy called on South Korean Foreign Affairs and Trade
Minister Hong Soon-young to explain the background of airstrikes
and asked for Seoul's support, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain conducted airstrikes against Iraq
in the early hours Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said five people were killed and more than 30 wounded in
the airstrikes and all victims were citizens.
</P>
<P>
The airstrikes came just one day after the United Nations
Special Commission on disarming Iraq's mass destruction weapons
withdrew all its staff members from Baghdad.

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said such

"It is quite unacceptable for us that certain states launch

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh Takes Measures to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has taken a series of
measures to develop its tourism industry and has made encouraging
progresses in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian country has seen an upward trend in foreign
tourist arrivals and foreign exchange earnings in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, tourist arrivals in the country were 140,112. The
figure rose to 156,231 in 1995, 165,887 in 1996, and 186,000 in
1997, an increase of 11.5 percent, 6.18 percent, and 12 percent
respectively, according to the Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation
(BPC), the national tourism organization.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange earnings, which were only 759.4 million taka
(15.7 million U.S. dollars) in 1994, increased to 955.2 million
taka (19.7 million dollars) in 1995 and 1.175 billion taka (24.2
million dollars) in 1996, a growth rate of 26 percent and 22
percent respectively. Earnings in 1997 recorded a remarkable
53-percent increase to 1.8 billion taka (37.1 million dollars)
from 1996.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry has been blessed by the country's rich
natural and tourism resources, such as its beaches, hills,
forests, wildlife, tribe villages, archaeological and historical
sites and cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
The government has been giving high priority and importance to
the tourism sector in efforts to develop the national economy and
promote the country's image abroad, especially in
tourist-generating countries like the United States, Japan and
those in Europe and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
To formulate a united policy for rapid development of the
tourism sector, the government has formed the National Tourism
Council with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as its head. Meanwhile,
tourism has been declared as an industry with policy incentives
for investment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The government encourages foreign investment in the sector
either through joint ventures or on a 100-percent foreign
ownership basis.
</P>
<P>
The government has also announced a number of incentives for
both local and foreign investors who are interested in this field,
including tax exemption on royalties, foreign loan interests and
capital gains from transfer of shares, avoidance of double
taxation on foreign investors on the basis of bilateral
agreements, and exemption of income tax on salaries for up to
three years for foreign technicians.
</P>
<P>
Under the national policy of development and promotion of
tourism, the BPC has established various tourism facilities in the
country, including hotels, motels, youth hostels, restaurants,
picnic spots, and land and water transport facilities.
</P>
<P>
Duty-free shops and recreational facilities have also been
built up in tourism-potential areas of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Human resources development in the field of tourism is also
getting due attention. The National Hotel and Tourism Training
Institute supported by the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) and the International Labor Organization (ILO) has been
expanding training facilities and trained about 16,000 people in
hotel and tourism.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the World Tourism Organization has prepared a
tourism master plan for Bangladesh with financial assistance from
the UNDP.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is now implementing the recommendations of the
master plan in phases within the framework of the country's
national five-year plan (1997-2002). A five-year plan for the
development of tourism has also been formulated and received an
allocation of 3 billion taka (61.9 million dollars) for the public
sector.

<HEADLINE> Angola Calls for Repulsing UNITA Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Angola's Defense Ministry
Thursday called on all armed forces to fight courageously and
repulse the attacks by the National Union for Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
"Armed UNITA forces led by Jonas Savimbi have once again
plunged the country into the abyss of war. Their intention is to
overthrow the existing democratic system and to realize their
dream of seizing state power by armed force," said a statement of
the ministry issued on the eve of the Army Day which falls on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Large scale clashes between the Angolan government army and
UNITA forces broke out since mid-November. The UNITA which
should have been demilitarized under the U.N. inspection turned
out allegedly with dozens of tanks and long-range cannons and
downed several government fighter planes with ground-to-air
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said the government army has suffered
great setbacks while the UNITA occupied the most parts of Huambo
and Bie provinces and besieged their capitals.
</P>
<P>
A great number of refugees are currently fleeing from the
fighting zones whereas international humanitarian organizations
and government officials are also withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
Taking this into account, the Angolan government denounced
UNITA for cheating the United Nations and international
community. One the other hand, it accused the U.N. observer
mission of incompetence and negligence and asked the U.N. to
withdraw its peace-keepers from this southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Issa Diallo, the U.N. special envoy to Angola, said here
Wednesday that despite the current emergency situation in the
country, he still believed there would be a "positive ending" to
the peace process.

<HEADLINE> India Strongly Deplores Air Strike on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- India Thursday strongly
deplored the air strike on Iraq by the United States and Britain
and called for an immediate halt to the military action.
</P>
<P>
"It is particularly regrettable that this unilateral step has
been taken at the very time when the U.N. Security Council is in
session to discuss the development there," Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee told parliament in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This attack raises serious questions regarding the functioning
of the collective and consultative procedures of the U.N. Security
Council. It also undermines the ability of the council to verify
Iraq's compliance with the relevant Council resolutions," Vajpayee
said.
</P>
<P>
It has been India's view that the use of force in this
situation would be counter-productive, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-British air attack on Iraq was strongly condemned
Thursday in both houses of parliament here with members charging
U.S. President Bill Clinton with trying to divert international
attention from his possible impeachment.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the opposition in the Lower House, Sharad Pawar,
said the manner in which the U.S. carried out the attack on Iraq
needs to be strongly condemned. The opposition leader in the Upper
House of Parliament, Manmohan Singh, said the unilateral action of
the U.S. was uncalled for.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa May Recognize Palestine State: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is likely
to be among the first countries to recognize the new state of
Palestine if it is declared next May, Business Day newspaper said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As leader of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), South Africa has
taken a high profile on the Middle East in recent weeks, it said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has repeatedly said he will
declare statehood if there is not sufficient progress on the
land-for-peace deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat gained the support of the NAM of 113 developing
countries at its Durban summit in September, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting resolved to recognize an independent Palestinian
state with east Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces a
right-wing no-confidence motion in parliament, warned he would
freeze all troops redeployments if Arafat continued with plans to
a declaration of independence.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton, who left the Middle East
Tuesday, has failed to persuade Israel to carry out troops
withdrawal from occupied territories scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Should the Palestinian state be proclaimed on May 4, the South
Africa Foreign Ministry can be expected to apply the Montevideo
requirements, an internationally recognized sovereignty test, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
It also quoted diplomatic sources as saying that most European
Union countries can be expected to joint the majority of
non-aligned countries in recognizing Palestinian independence.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Clinton's visit to Palestinian-controlled
territory, the first by a sitting U.S. president, was seen by
Palestinians and many Israelis as implicit U.S. recognition of
Palestinian independence aspirations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official With Tibetan Buddhist Origins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Waldain, a Living Buddha, is
no longer simply a senior monk at a temple, but a local official
as well.
</P>
<P>
The 48-year-old Waldain is deputy director of the culture
bureau in the Aba Autonomous Prefecture of southwest China's
Sichuan Province. In spite of his age, he still wants to learn
more to help the economic development in his prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Waldain was deputy magistrate of Changqing County in Shandong
Province as part of an exchange program from 1996 to 1998. He was
a kind of envoy between the Han and Tibetan people for years. In
Shandong, he made a lot of Han friends and helped form a
poverty-alleviation partnership between about 130 Han households
in the east and ethnic minorities in the west. Although most of
the Han families were not rich, they sent family member to the
Southwest at their own expense and offered financial aid to
Tibetan and Qiang children for their education.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jiamian, a Chinese sociologist, calls the sending of
ethnic minority officials to prosperous coastal areas to learn
about developing the economy a significant move. The program helps
broaden the scope of ethnic minorities and narrow the gap between
eastern and western parts of China, he says.
</P>
<P>
Waldain was identified as the spiritual descendent of the
Living Buddha of Caodeng Temple in Barkam County in Sichuan and
began to study Tibetan classic scriptures at the age of three.
</P>
<P>
When China resumed the practice of the college entrance exam
system in the late 1970s, Waldain entered the Art Department of
the Central Institute for National Minorities and became a Living
Buddha with a college degree.

<HEADLINE> Baghdad Rocked by U.S., British Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and British missiles
pounded Baghdad early on Thursday, the heaviest missile attack on
Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The first blast were heard at 00:49 a.m. local time (2149 GMT
Wednesday) and were followed by a series of explosions. The
explosions shook the building of Xinhua's Baghdad Bureau in
Mansur, Adrus District where electricity had been cut off.
</P>
<P>
Washington and London immediately announced that the air
strikes, code-named Operation Desert Fox, had begun.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua correspondents in Baghdad saw clouds of smoke drifted
across some parts of the city and the acrid smell of smoke hung
around the city center.
</P>
<P>
The air raids sirens sounded briefly over the Iraqi capital at
00:20 a.m. local time. Half an hour later, anti-aircraft guns
opened up in downtown and fired off two more sustained volleys.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic bursts of fire continued. Eyewitnesses said the
missiles landed around one of the palaces of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein in central Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
At 02:00 a.m. local time, Xinhua correspondents, on the way to
the Information Center, saw the capital, with a population of four
million, became silent at the intervals of the explosions and
there were few visible signs of panic. At some intersections,
military policemen were checking the passing cars. Some ambulances
were running on the streets, indicating casualties.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports from one Baghdad hospital said at least two
people have been killed and 30 others injured during the attacks.
</P>
<P>
At a teaching hospital in Baghdad's Yarmouk District, hospital
wards were filled with patients suffering from burns. Some moaned
with pain.
</P>
<P>
Culture and Information Ministry officials said a U.S. missile
landed in a residential area, injuring four people and causing
damages to civilian property. The officials said it had caused
damage to a drinking water network. A two kilometer stretch of the
street was flooded.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein admitted on Thursday that
several targets were hit in Iraq and he called on the Iraqi people
to stand up to face "the new round of U.S.-British aggression."
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation, Saddam said on December 16 and
17, the U.S. and Britain which he called "evils", as they have
done in the past eight years, launched strikes against Iraqi
targets.
</P>
<P>
"Fight the enemies of God, the Arab nation and humanity. God
willing, you will be the victors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sirens sounded the all-clear in Baghdad after the raids lasted
about six hours. Residents heard the sirens signaling the end of
five rounds of attack at about 6:40 a.m. local time (0340 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The strikes came shortly after chief U.N. weapons inspector
Richard Butler issued a report on Tuesday, saying Iraq was not
cooperating fully with U.N. weapons inspectors who evacuated from
Baghdad on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Coffee Output Expected at 45,000 tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 17 (Xinhua) - Tanzania's coffee
production in the 1998/99 crop year is expected to reach 45,000
tons, surpassing an earlier official estimate of 43,000 tons,
local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Harvesting of the arabica and robusta coffee crop in the
southern regions has so far yielded about some 20,000 and 13,000
tons of coffee respectively, while unwashed varieties were put at
3,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
A bumper harvest of the arabica coffee crop in the northern
regions, which is usually between May and March, is also
expected, trading officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
With a currently coffee price for arabica at about 175 U.S.
Dollars per 50-kg bag at export auctions, coffee export this year
is expected to earn Tanzania some 158 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The coffee production was recorded at 37,000 tons in 1997/98
season due to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
As Tanzania's leading cash crop, coffee accounts for nearly 20
per cent of the total foreign exchange earnings estimated at
about 700 million US Dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has made an ambitious plan to increase its coffee
output to between 80,000 and 100,000 tons by the year 2004.

<HEADLINE> Russia Outraged by U.S.-U.K. Airstrikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday reacted
strongly against the airstrikes against Iraq, demanding an
immediate end to the use of force against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin said the actions, launched by the
United States and Britain "flagrantly violated the United Nations
Charter" and norms of international law.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev has canceled a visit to Brussels
on Yeltsin's instructions, Itar-Tass reported. He was scheduled
to attend a meeting of the Russia-NATO Joint Permanent Council.
</P>
<P>
In Madrid, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said the airstrikes
would not only complicate the situation in the Gulf, but also
sustain more grave and profound aftermath.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is meeting with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
Security Council Secretary Nikolai Bordyuzha and General Staff
Chief Anatoly Kvashnin presumably on the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
Speakers of Russia's two houses of parliament also condemned
the missile strikes.
</P>
<P>
Yegor Stroyev, chairman of the Federation Council, or upper
house of parliament, said the strike would d make it more
complicated for the Russian parliament to ratify START II, the
Russia-U.S. treaty on reduction of strategic nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
At the State Duma, or lower house of parliament, lawmakers set
aside their planned agenda and started discussing the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist party, the largest
Duma faction, described the use of force against Iraq as "an act
of international terrorism with most far-reaching consequences".
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that Yeltsin has ordered Ivanov to
cut short the visit and return to Moscow immediately.
</P>
<P>
Russia has long been an opponent to the use of force against
Baghdad. Only Wednesday night, Yeltsin telephoned French President
Jacques Chirac, calling for a political solution to the Iraq
crisis over weapons inspections.

<HEADLINE> Russian President Condemns U.S.-U.K. Strikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
strongly condemned the U.S. and British air strikes against Iraq
on Thursday, and called for an immediate end to the military
action.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said in a statement that such a development of the
situation, to which Russia is decisively opposed, evokes the most
serious concern, a feeling of dismay and deep alarm.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-U.K. strikes, which has caused casualties and serious
material damage, crudely violated the U.N. Charter, generally
accepted principles of international law and the norms and rules
of responsible behaviour of states on the world arena, he said.
</P>
<P>
The strike was carried out at precisely the moment when the
U.N. Security Council was discussing the Iraq problem, he said,
adding that the resolutions on Iraq taken by the Security Council
provide no basis whatsoever for such action.
</P>
<P>
The strike is a blow to the whole system of international
security, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been undertaking consistent and intensive efforts to
solve the Iraq problem quickly, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"We are still convinced the potential of a political-diplomatic
settlement of the Iraq crisis has not been exhausted, which was
confirmed on the whole by the normal process of cooperation
between Iraq and the United Nations recently," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to settle the Iraq problem only by
political-diplomatic means on the basis of observing resolutions
of the United Nations Security Council and international law, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, the military strikes have seriously damaged the great
work of recent years on the post-crisis settlement in the Gulf and
on dismantling the potential of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction
and their means of delivery, Yeltsin said.

<HEADLINE> Israel On Alert Though Chances of Being Attacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Although defense officials
said the chances of being attacked by Iraq is "minimum," Israeli
military was on high alert and civilians were urged to update
their gas mask kits Thursday following U.S. air strike against
Iraq at midnight.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been holding
consultations with senior officials since the U.S. launched the
strikes over alleged Iraq's non-cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors, and they will meet again later Thursday, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministry has ordered the troops to be on alert with
radar systems redeployed to detect any coming missiles, and the
officials said Patriotic missile systems and other U.S. defense
equipment are available.
</P>
<P>
During the standoff between Iraq and the U.S.-led forces in the
1991 Gulf War sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990,
Baghdad fired 39 Scud missiles armed with conventional warheads
at Israel, the closest ally of the U.S. in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The attacks killed one Israeli and wounded scores of others and
caused extensive property damage in the Tel Aviv area.
</P>
<P>
On the heel of the Gulf War, the U.N. Security Council adopted
resolutions to authorize the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) to
oversee Iraq's disarming of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM have repeatedly run into standoffs with Iraq during the
weapons inspections, which several times drew the U.S. on the
verge of using force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But as in the latest crisis over the weapons inspection last
month, Israeli officials have stressed that Israel is "outside the
conflict" and that the chances of being attacked by Iraq in
retaliation are very low.
</P>
<P>
A local daily, the Jerusalem Post, reported Thursday that
U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke of the possibility of an attack
on Iraq with Netanyahu Tuesday just before his departure from a
three-day visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was then quoted as still saying: "Israel is outside
the conflict, and in any case will know how to protect itself if
there is a need to do so."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said Netanyahu was informed by the White
House of the attack several minutes before it took place at around
midnight.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai called a meeting of his
senior staff after reports of anti-aircraft fire emerged from
Baghdad. "Preparations are being made," a ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Gas mask distribution centers were opened and citizens were
urged to make sure their gas mask kits are updated and they have
plastic sheeting and tape on hand to seal the doors and windows
if Iraq launched an missile attack.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the panic during the Gulf crisis when people
formed long lines outside the mask distribution centers, life on
the streets is normal and people are calm.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians demonstrated in
the West Bank Thursday morning to protest against the U.S. air
strikes against Iraq overnight but the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has not made comments on the military action.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinian youths in a refuge camp in the
Palestinian-ruled Bethlehem, where U.S. President Bill Clinton
visited Tuesday, burned U.S. flags while demonstrating in the
town.
</P>
<P>
In another West Bank city of Ramallah, Palestinians marched
on the streets to show their solidarity with the Iraqi people,
Jerusalem Media and Communications Center, a Palestinian news
service, reported.
</P>
<P>
The PNA, however, has kept a low-profile stand in the latest
Iraq-U.S. conflict as it did in the last confrontation between the
U.S. and Iraq in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
Although sympathizing the Iraq people, the PNA has refrained
from criticizing the U.S., who helped broker the Wye peace deal
between Israel and the Palestinians, in the recent crises in the
Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Giant Owl Wipes Out 3,000 Chickens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A rare giant owl attacked and
killed more than 3,000 chickens on a farm in east China's Zhejiang
Province but the protected species wasn't given the same treatment
after being captured.
</P>
<P>
Instead the farmer, Shan Baiju, has actually taken the bird
under the wing of his own family and feeds it daily with snacks of
beef and pork.
</P>
<P>
His farm had been the target of the huge owl, which has a wing
span of 1.5 meters, and once before and then lost 946 chickens.
</P>
<P>
Local police were convinced it was the work of human criminals
until Shan showed them the creature which had been caught by
another farmer in his village.
</P>
<P>
Shan, who has a reputation as a hard worker and who earlier
this year was chosen as one of the region's "Ten Best Science
Trail Blazers", told police he would have killed the bird because
it has cost him more than 10,000 yuan but knew it was protected
and felt it his duty to let it live.
</P>
<P>
The owl's havoc-wreaking was finally brought to an end when
fellow farmer Wan Bailin tackled the 2.5-kg bird of prey with his
bare hands.
</P>
<P>
But despite Shan's kindness the owl is bad tempered even though
he often gives it a meal of his remaining chickens.
</P>
<P>
This surly attitude, though, has not changed the 28-year-old
farmer's mind and he continues to look after the owl.

<HEADLINE> 2 killed, 30 wounded in U.S. Air Strikes, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- At least two people have been
reportedly killed and another 30 wounded in U.S. air strikes on
the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The wounded have been taken to hospitals, according to doctors
of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
However, a precise number of casualties is not immediately known
because the victims scattered in the different sites which were
hit by U.S. missiles.
</P>
<P>
Despite the ongoing air strikes, Baghdad residents went to the
streets as usual and many vehicles were seen in the downtown of
the city as well.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the Iraqi people might have become
accustomed to air strikes as they have experienced them on several
occasions in the past.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the U.S. launched air strikes, Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein called on the Iraqi people to "fight the enemies of
God, enemies of the nation and enemies of humanity."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, at a U.N. Security Council meeting,
Iraq's U.N. envoy Nizar Hamdoon accused chief weapons inspector
Richard Butler of producing a biased report Tuesday which
concluded that Baghdad had not fully cooperated with the
U.N. monitors and triggered the air strikes.

<HEADLINE> Maize Output Falls in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The output of maize harvested
this year in Zambia dropped by 30 percent to only 650,000 tons
compared with about 960,000 tons harvested in 1997, according to
Standard Chartered Bank.
</P>
<P>
The production of maize, staple food for Zambians, is less
than half of the maize output of the 1996 harvest year, when the
maize production was as high as 1,410,000 tons, the bank said in
its latest publication available here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This year's output is the lowest since 1991, necessitating
substantial imports in the final quarter this year and early next
year that will have adverse implications for both inflation and
exchange rate of the country's currency.
</P>
<P>
The production of soya, rice, sorghum and sunflower also fell
but there were important gains in cotton with an increase of 47
percent to 110,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The non-traditional exports have declined by five percent
because of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
according to the bank.

<HEADLINE> Imbalance in Rural Development Draws Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- While some residents in Huaxi
Village in east China's Jiangsu Province are enjoying their luxury
houses and cars, needy villagers in a number of northwestern
mountain areas are depending to some extent on government aid to
survive.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old reform and opening-up drive has brought about
great changes for China's countryside as a whole, but due to
climatic, geographic and historical differences, rural development
has been uneven.
</P>
<P>
Economists have called for greater government concern for the
growing economic imbalance among rural people living in different
areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xinmin, an expert with the Rural Investigation Team of
the State Statistical Bureau, has studied this imbalance in
eastern, central and western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Rural people in developed eastern provinces, mainly coastal
ones, have benefited from the booming township and village-run
industries, which are mostly export-oriented, and in 1997 their
exports amounted to 621.9 billion yuan (75 billion US dollars),
91.1 percent of the total exports made by all of China's rural
industries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, farmers in resource-rich central areas are making a
good living from mining and farming. But for those living in
western China, rural development has been greatly hampered by
poorer climate and transportation facilities, and a lack of
resources.
</P>
<P>
The statistician also attributes the imbalance to differences
in policies, investment levels and the preparedness of local
villagers.
</P>
<P>
This imbalance has caused notable gaps in both economic
development and individual income, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the gross national product (GNP) in the eastern,
central and western regions stood at 6.346 trillion yuan, 2.467
trillion yuan, and 1.17 trillion yuan respectively, while
per-capita income ranged from 2,746 yuan, 1,931 yuan and 1,404
yuan in these three regions.
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon has worried some local economists. Well-known
Chinese economist Hu An'gang has repeatedly said that if the
problem of regional developmental imbalance is not properly
addressed, the growing gaps among areas may lead to catastrophic
social problems and directly damage the country's political
stability.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese experts have urged the government to ensure
coordinated growth in these three sections of the country and
speed up the development of underdeveloped provinces by adopting
effective policies and measures, especially increasing investment
in the underdeveloped western areas and encouraging cooperation
between developed and underdeveloped regions.

<HEADLINE> China's Stance on Entering WTO Reaffirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China's trade minister has
said that China's policy on entering the World Trade Organization
(WTO) remains firm, according to today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
China has always held a positive attitude about entering the
WTO, said Minister Shi Guangsheng of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, just before he left for the United States to attend
the Sino-U.S. Joint Commission of Commerce and Trade.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for China's entry into the WTO still continue
after 12 years of efforts on our part, Shi added, because the
resolution of this issue is not only up to China, but also
requires flexibility on the part of other parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
As a developing nation, China must open its markets step by
step, and we cannot accept excessive demands, he reiterated.
</P>
<P>
However, he denied pessimistic views against China's entry
efforts held by some members of the international community,
saying that these views are groundless.
</P>
<P>
China wants to enter the WTO, and is making every effort to
achieve this goal, Shi stressed.
</P>
<P>
China will still be able to solve existing problems after
entering the WTO, if they cannot be solved at present, he added.

NAIROBI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Cabinet Minister
Nicholas Biwott has disclosed that the long-awaited East African
passports will be launched on January 4, next year.
</P>
<P>
Biwott said Wednesday that the passports were ready to be
issued but the exercise could not proceed due to technicalities
in the other two countries, namely, Uganda and Tanzania,
according to Daily Nation newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of the common passport had been delayed because
Uganda and Tanzania were yet to register and issue their citizens
with identification cards like their Kenyan counterparts, the
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He said it was after the issuance of identity cards was
through that the new passports were supposed to be issued,
otherwise there was a risk of issuing the new document to aliens.
</P>
<P>
Biwott, who is the East African Cooperation and Regional
Development Minister, said cooperation among the three countries
had excelled with free movement of people across the borders.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia called for an
end to the on-going use of force against Iraq, saying that the
current crisis was "artificially created."
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent representative to the United
Nations, told a late-night session of the Security Council
Wednesday that the "unprovoked act of force" by London and
Washington "violated the principles of international law and the
U.N. Charter."
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Iraq was being subjected to massive
missile strikes which had resulted in casualties.
</P>
<P>
"Justification for today's unilateral act was based on the
report" presented by the Chairman of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM), Richard Butler, who said that Baghdad failed to fully
cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Butler had presented "a distorted picture of what was taking
place in Iraq," Lavrov said. He had "grossly abused his authority"
and his action led to the deterioration of the situation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Russia was convinced that resolution of the Iraqi problem
was possible only through political and diplomatic channels and
the norms of international law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There were Russian citizens in Baghdad, if their lives were
imperiled, there would be serious consequences," he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks to Provide Euro-Related Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The China Industrial and
Commercial Bank (CICB) is to provide a series of Euro-related
banking services starting on the same day that the new single
currency Euro is launched on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the CICB said today that those services will
include the opening of Euro accounts, settlements, remittance and
collection business as well as letters of credit, all in the new
Euro. It will also report on the exchange rate of the Euro in
relation to the renminbi and the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
He explained, however, that during the transition period from
January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2001, the use of the Euro will be
limited to the payment of spot exchange transfer accounts. During
this period, customers can conduct business in spot exchange
loans, capital security and guarantees via Euro spot exchange
accounts.
</P>
<P>
He added that the CICB has made considerable preparation for
what is hoped will be next year's smooth launch of Euro banking
services. So far the bank has accomplished the installment and
trial operation of software for clearing facilities in a dozen of
its branches, and has adjusted its foreign exchange computer
accounting software.
</P>
<P>
According to sources in banking circles, the CICB is the first
Chinese bank to announce details of its Euro banking services.

<HEADLINE> Agent Contacts Chinese Athlete in Failed Bribery Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- An agent had contacted a
Chinese table tennis player in a bribery attempt which the Chinese
rejected categorically, a top official of the Olympic Council of
Asia told Xinhua Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"An agent who speaks Chinese approached a Chinese table tennis
player, trying to buy a match with a certain amount of U.S.
dollars. The agent didn't specify how much," said Wei Jizhong,
chairman of OCA's Sports Committee.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese athlete refused clearly the offer, saying he or
she competes under OCA spirit and the Bangkok Asian Games motto,"
Wei said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese athlete reported to Chef de Mission about this.
The chief immediately asked he or she to remember the face of the
agent in order to catch him. Unfortunately they failed to do it,
the agent disappeared after the refusal," the OCA official added.
</P>
<P>
Wei said he would submit a report on the bribery attempt to Mr.
Muttaleb Ahmad, Director General of OCA.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese athlete has rebuffed a bribery attempt from an
unidentified person who asked the Chinese to throw a final in
exchange for money, a Chinese sports official said early in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Li Furong, deputy Chef de Mission of the Chinese delegation,
told Xinhua that a person had repeatedly visited the Chinese
athlete and tried to buy the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"Gold medal and sportsmanship are not for sale. Never," said
Li, also vice chairman of the Chinese Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Chinese athlete told the briber that even 100,000
dollars would not force him or her to give up the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"The national interest and the honor of the country cannot be
exchanged for money," said the Chinese sports official.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Thursday described the U.S.-British air strikes against
Iraq as "very unfortunate," and ordered the evacuation of
Filipinos in Iraq if needed.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who is on the first day of his two-day state visit to
Vietnam, said it was "very unfortunate" that "violence" erupted
anew in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the conflict could be settled
immediately to spare unnecessary loss of lives, according to a
Philippine News Agency report from Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he ordered the evacuation of Filipinos in Iraq if
needed after Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon updated him
on the situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Siazon, who is with the president in Vietnam,
regretted the use of force in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We have always believed that disputes should be settled
through peaceful means and through negotiations. At the same time,
however, we also believe that all U.N. resolutions should be
complied with," he said.

<P>
Yunnan started increasing spending on fixed assets the middle
of this year to spur economic development, with 70 percent of it
going to farm construction, transportation, telecommunications,
urban construction and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Li Jiating, the province's governor, says that the increased
spending is meant to boost domestic demand and reduce the impact
of the Asian financial crisis and to create a good environment for
the World Horticulture Fair next year.
</P>
<P>
More than 9 million people are expected at the fair, to be held
in the provincial capital, Kunming from May 1 to October 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has spent 10 billion yuan improving
infrastructure in Kunming and a billion-yuan project at Kunming
Airport will soon be completed. The terminal building is being
expanded to 74,000 sq.m. to handle 10 million passengers annually.
</P>
<P>
The province has also put 8 billion yuan into highway
construction to give it an improved highway network that will run
to Thailand, Sichuan province in the north, Myanmar in the west,
and Guizhou in the east.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Che Zhimin, deputy head of of Provincial Government's
Economic Research Center, says that the spending has offset the
negative impact of the Asian financial crisis. Every one billion
yuan in fixed assets spending will increase GDP growth by 0.6
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> S. African Inflation Set to Peak Below 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's inflation
looks set to peak below 10 percent, with consumer inflation
ticking up to 9.4 percent in November from 9.0 percent in
October, Business Day newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the Statistics South Africa figures released
Tuesday suggested inflation was at or near a peak and South
Africa could begin looking forward to sharply lowered inflation
next year.
</P>
<P>
Month on month, the consumer price index did not rise at all,
helped by a fall in the housing component of the index as a
result of a cut in mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
Core inflation, which excluded interest rates and certain
volatile food prices, remained unchanged at 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank's monetary policy is usually based on core
inflation instead of headline inflation.
</P>
<P>
Economists said South Africa's inflation performance suggested
interest rates could decline early in the new year unless the
balance of payment put a spoke in the wheel.
</P>
<P>
Business Day quoted Standard Bank's economics division as
saying that if 9.4 percent was inflation's peak, it would be
below the previous upper turning point of 9.9 percent in April
last year.
</P>
<P>
As mortgage rates fall next year, headline inflation will fall
rapidly, reaching about three percent by September.
</P>
<P>
The inflation forecast for next year is six percent, compared
with an estimated average of 6.9 percent for this year.
</P>
<P>
The banks said if inflation remained subdued next year and
there was not too much pressure on the exchange rate, the repo
rate could reach 15 percent by the end of next year, compared
with 19.4 percent at the moment.
</P>
<P>
The repo rate is the rate at which the Reserve Bank lends to
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the balance of payments, not inflation, is
the key factor for interest rates.

<P>
KUNMING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- While Southeast Asian
countries are still struggling with the financial crisis and lack
of investment, decreasing production, and falling exports, the
Chinese province of Yunnan just across the border has had some of
the fastest investment growth in China.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Statistics Bureau reported today that the
province has started construction of more than 3,000 new projects
this year and investment in fixed assets is expected to reach 68
billion yuan, an increase 14 percentage points higher than the
nation's average.
</P>
<P>
Financial support from the Central government for Yunnan
amounted to 6.2 billion yuan, an increase that is just behind that
for the cities of Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan borders Laos, Viet Nam and Myanmar and is not far from
Thailand. Half its exports go to Southeast Asia, which provides
half Yunnan's overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
Companies from the Republic of Korea (ROK), Thailand, and Japan
account for 80 percent of the province's overseas investors. But,
the financial crisis caused big decreases in Yunnan's border and
processing trade from January to June, and caused the number of
tourists from Southeast Asia to drop to a fifth what it was in the
same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The province's GDP from January to June grew around 7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Nation and Party Stronger, More Mature: People's Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Twenty years of reform and
opening has made China an economically strong country, and the
Communist Party of China has become more mature, with more
coherent force and authority among the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
This statement is made in a commentator's article signed by Ren
Zhongping in today's People's Daily, China's leading official
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the reforms from 1979 to the present, the article
cited a string of figures illustrating the economic achievements
China has made over the past 20 years, and quoted a World Bank
official as saying that the country needed only one generation to
accomplish what other countries took centuries to do.
</P>
<P>
This period saw three major events: the political turmoil in
China and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the
financial turmoil that has swept Asia since last year, and the
exceeding massive flooding that hit many parts of China this year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's successful handling of these events
proves that China has stood up and become strong and mature enough
to tackle political and economic problems, and fight against
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
"Our strides marching forward can never be stopped by whatever
evil or hostile forces, be they political, economic or natural,"
the article proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
It underlined that building socialism in China does not require
copying any foreign model, but only requires complying with
China's specific national conditions "to learn from, absorb and
apply the advanced fruits of capitalism on the one hand and to
keep to socialism on the other."
</P>
<P>
"The political turmoil in 1989 and other world crises tells us
that reforms carried out in socialist countries must adhere to
the direction of socialism, while the Asian financial turbulence
serves as a caution that attention must be given to economic
safety in the process of opening up to the outside," the article
said.
</P>
<P>
While calling for continued efforts for reform and opening up
and tapping the country's potentials, the article urged the public
to maintain vigilance against negative political and spiritual
influences from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the commentator's article urged unswerving efforts
to fight against corruption, as clean, upright and incorruptible
officials are a must for the success of the socialist cause, and a
decisive factor for the very survival of the Communist Party and
the country.

<HEADLINE> NBA's No.1 Pick Olowokandi Ready to Play in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Center Michael Olowokandi,
the No.1 draft in June by the Los Angeles Clippers, is looking at
Christmas with a different kind of anticipation than most Pepole.
</P>
<P>
Olowokandi has been considering offers to play in Europe as a
result of the league's labor dispute. Bill Duffy, Olowokandi's
agent, says if the players and owners don't reach an agreement by
Christmas, his client will sign with one of several Italian teams
that have contacted him.
</P>
<P>
"We're serious about it," Duffy said. "We'll just wait and see
what happens. There are some deadline issues because players have
to register for the Euro League by January 1. We're proceeding as
though the season will be canceled."
</P>
<P>
Duffy said an unnamed Italian team wanted to sign his clitent
last week. The team offered Olowokandi a contract with a five-day
out that would have allowed him to leave if the lockout ended
within five days of his signing.
</P>
<P>
If Olowokandi were to sign, it would be for the balance of the
season, and Duffy said he would be among the top-paid players in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still hopeful there will be an NBA season," Olowokandi
said."I'm not going to give up until the last. A lot will be
riding on what happens the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed. I didn't think it would come this far. I
believe that whenever you have a dispute, everything is
negotiable."

<HEADLINE> Air Attacks on Iraq Arouse Controversial Responses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Air strikes against Iraq by
the United States and Britain have aroused controversial responses
in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Prime Minister Jenny Shipley expressed her
Government's support for the action and took Saddam Hussein
responsible for the strikes. But at the same time she showed New
Zealand's regrets over the air strikes, saying innocent civilians
will be "inevitable casualties".
</P>
<P>
According to the Evening Post, Prime Minister Shipley told the
Parliament that the attacks on Iraq came after Saddam Hussein had
been given "repeated opportunities to comply with UN weapons
inspectors".
</P>
<P>
"Once more we are seeing Iraq's promises are proving extremely
hollow," she said.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Shipley said she hopes this will be "a shortlived attack",
but clearly it is "necessary to bring Iraq into compliance".
</P>
<P>
Helen Clark, leader of the Labor Party, said in Parliament
while Iraq had flouted UN requirements, the military action
should have been "authorized by the UN Security Council, not by
two members of the council".
</P>
<P>
She said she was concerned that the bombing would "only maim
and kill innocent civilians, not the guilty".
</P>
<P>
Jim Anderton, leader of the New Zealand Alliance, criticized
the bombing and said it would achieve "exactly the opposite" of
what the U.S. intends.
</P>
<P>
"Bombing kills in discriminately. It also does not work. I am
quite certain in my own mind it's not going to work in Iraq," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Politicians, Public React to U.S. Strikes on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. politicians and the
public Wednesday made swift reactions to President Bill
Clinton's order to launch air strikes against Iraq for what he
called its defiance to U.N. weapons inspection resolutions.
</P>
<P>
While lawmakers generally endorsed the president's decision for
the air strikes against Iraq, Senate Majority leader Trent Lott
and some other Republicans questioned the timing, which came on
the eve of a planned House impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
But top Democrats said they fully supported the military
action.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the president acted correctly and responsibly,"
House Minority leader Richard Gephardt, and Senate Minority
leader Tom Daschle, said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
Lott, who in the past has criticized Clinton for not acting
more aggressively in dealing with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, said: "Both the timing and the policy are subject to
question."
</P>
<P>
"While I have been assured by administration officials that
there is no connection with the impeachment process in the House
of Representatives, I cannot support this military action in the
Persian Gulf at this time," Lott said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Many Republicans expressed their fury and they didn't wait
for the bombs to drop to accuse Clinton of manufacturing the
showdown to boost his political standing at the brink of
Thursday's House vote on impeachment, which was now postponed
because of the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"it's certainly rather suspicious timing," said Republican
Representative Tillie Fowler. "I think the president is
shameless in what he would do to stay in office."
</P>
<P>
Republican Representative Ron Paul denounced the military
action, accusing Clinton of using U.S. troops as pawns to avoid
impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
"How many American soldiers and innocent Iraqi children will
die so that this president can hide from justice?" Paul asked.
"This attack has no basis in protecting our national security
and only increases the danger to our people."
</P>
<P>
Republican Representative John Porter said: "I get the
impression that the president considers himself above the law,"
indicating he has switched his position after earlier announcing
he would oppose impeachment on the floor of the House.
</P>
<P>
"Never underestimate a desperate president," warned Republican
Representative Gerald Solomon. "This time he means business.
What option is left for getting impeachment off the front page
and maybe even postponed?"
</P>
<P>
Democrats were outraged that Clinton's motives were being
questioned.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Senator Robert Torricelli, called the Republican
reaction to strikes against Iraq "as close to a betrayal of the
interests of the United States as I've ever witnessed in the
United States Congress. It's unforgivable and reprehensible."
</P>
<P>
The public also was suspicious of the presidential decision
to order the air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"That's ridiculous" said Marcia Shockey, a worker at the
Oklahoma Capitol. "Why would anyone go to war to divert
attention?"
</P>
<P>
David Peterson, manager of a Hooters Restaurant in Phoenix,
said Clinton's decision "looks like a good way to stop his
impeachment." Matt Mallec, a 26-year-old bartender in Downtown
Phoenix, was also suspicious of Clinton's motives.
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic how once again, here he is in hot water and that
gets pushed aside and he comes out looking like a hero again,"
he said as he sat in a booth, watching Clinton on CNN.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of Iraq provoked an immediate reaction both in
Washington and New York.
</P>
<P>
Protesters near the White House shouted for stop of the
bombing. They were soon dispersed by police. In New York some
100 demonstrators gathered at Times Square, shouting: "No blood
for oil!" and "Let Iraq live!"

LIMA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian Foreign Minister
Fernando De Trazegnies Wednesday expressed his regret at the
U.S. air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Although the details of the U.S. decision on the strikes are

Trazegnies said.

Asked to comment on the matter, Peruvian President of Congress

actions or not.

The United States began air strikes against Iraq at 00:49

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Nigeria in 1998: A Year of Renewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since Abubakar took office, a national reconciliation
process had been in progress in Nigeria, with the gradual release
of all political detainees in the country.
</P>
<P>
Among those freed is former head of state, General Olusegun
Obasanjo, who was detained in 1995 for alleged involvement in a
coup plot against Sani Abacha, and many other opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate that the reconciliation drive failed to save
the life of Moshoode Abiola, the widely expected winner in the
1993 annulled presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
On July 7, Abiola, who had been in detention since 1994,
suddenly collapsed while he was discussing his release with
Abubakar and visiting U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Political
Affairs, Thomas Pickering. All efforts to save his life failed.
</P>
<P>
The death of Abiola is surely a national tragedy for Nigeria,
but it might prove a blessing for the Abubakar government, which
was saved from a possible confrontation with the pro-Abiola force
triggered by the death of Abiola.
</P>
<P>
Ever since Abacha's death, there had been strong calls for a
national unity government headed by Abiola, though Abiola himself
later reportedly renounced his presidential ambitions after a
meeting with visiting United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
shortly before his death.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar refused the idea, saying that it poses dangers
unacceptable to his government.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, with the domestic and international support,
Abubakar secured through reconciliation, and quickly embarked on
a new transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
After extensive consultations on both national and
international scale, Abubakar announced scrapping of the
transition structure of Abacha, including the disbandment of the
five political parties and the annulment of all the elections
conducted under the National Electoral Commission installed
during the Abacha's regime.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation on July 20, which sets out his
political and economic plans, Abubarkar announced that a
presidential election would be held in the first quarter of 1999,
while the newly elected civilian president would take office on
May 29.
</P>
<P>
To make preparations for the 1999 general elections, a new
Independent Electoral Commission has been established, nine new
political parties were registered and fresh voters' registration
was held.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar has made it clear from the beginning that he will not
seek to transform himself into a civilian president.
</P>
<P>
While addressing his first international press conference in
Abuja on September 7, he announced that he will retire from the
armed forces after the hand-over of power.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indian automobiles
industry continues to be in the clutches of recession This year,
'Business Standard' said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Poor performance during the six months this year ended
September, 1998 by Telco, the commercial vehicles major in the
country, came as further blow to the industry. The fallen in sales
and profits of Telco subdued the overall results of the auto
players.
</P>
<P>
The aggregate results of 15 automobile companies for the six
months showed a fall in sales by four percent compared with the
same period last year. Operating profits were down by 12 percent.
Rising interest cost by 19 percent pushed the gross profit down by
20 percent and net profit crashed by 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
Segment-wise classification showed that the commercial vehicles
(CVs) segment was hit badly. The sales of CVs showed a steep
decline of 18 percent with Telco falling by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Profit margins of auto companies came under heavy pressure.
While operating profit margin fell to 12.9 from 14.2 percent,
gross margin declined to 9.5 from 11.4 percent and net profit
margin was down to 3.9 from 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nepali King Favors Special Session of Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Nepali King Birendra
Thursday decided to summon a special session of parliament on
December 24 as petitioned by 62 members of parliament, said a
notice issued by the king's Principal Press Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The move ended a week-long political uncertainty arising from a
ruling partner's withdrawal last Thursday from the government.
</P>
<P>
Now Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, whose recommendation
for dissolution of parliament for fresh polls was turned down,
will face a no-confidence motion planned by his former ruling
partner and other parties.
</P>
<P>
After sharing power with the Nepali Congress (NC) for three and
a half months, the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism,
CPN-ML) pulled out, alleging that the NC had failed to implement
the agreements reached with it and other left parties in August.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Prime Minister and NC President Koirala made a
recommendation to the Royal Palace for dissolution of parliament
for general elections on March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Hours later, the CPN-ML and its supporters made a submission to
the palace, calling for a special parliament session to discuss a
no-confidence motion they were planning against the government.
</P>
<P>
After returning home Monday from a medical check-up and
treatment in London, King Birendra began the consultation process.
</P>
<P>
The major parties, including the main opposition Communist
Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML), agreed that
elections were the only way out. But they asked Prime Minister
Koirala to step down to make way for a new coalition government
comprising all the major parties for free, fair and impartial
elections.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, King Birendra, on the advice of the
Supreme Court, accepted the submission by 96 MPs to call a special
parliament session, turning down Prime Minister Surya Bahadur
Thapa's recommendation for dissolution of parliament for fresh
polls.
</P>
<P>
The Himalayan kingdom has witnessed five governments since the
mid-term polls in November 1994, which produced a hung parliament

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Nigeria in 1998: A Year of Renewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along with the political reform process, the present Nigerian
government also started bold and long-awaited economic reforms
by, among others, ordering the merger of the fixed official
exchange rate of one U.S. Dollar to 22 Naira with the Autonomous
Foreign Exchange Market exchange rate by the year end.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation of the dual exchange rates, which have for a
long time been accused of providing a hot-bed for massive
corruption, also paved the way for improved relations between
Nigeria and the international financial agencies such as the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
To combat persistent fuel shortage in the oil-producing
country, Abubakar ordered the repair of major oil refineries and
renounced the state monopoly of fuel import, allowing foreign oil
companies to operate in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
And more importantly, Abubakar announced an ambitious
privatization program that virtually involves all major
state-owned firms, including the National Telephone Firm, the
National Electrical Power Firm and major automobile and steel
plants and dozens of others.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the reform is to attract foreign and private
investment and allow private investors to manage these enterprices
that have become a bottomless hole of huge state funds due to bad
management and corruption.
</P>
<P>
In launching a national war on corruption, Abubarkar ordered
senior government officials to declare their assets and started
investigations into the Abacha government officials, which have
led to the recovery of more than 700 million U.S. Dollars so far.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar's new policies have produced an instant diplomatic
success. In the later half of the year, Nigeria received more
foreign visitors than it did in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Since early July, General Abubarkar has met with a long list
of senior officials from Britain, France, the U.S., the
Commonwealth, the U.N., the Organization of African Unity, the
World Bank and some African countries.
</P>
<P>
At these meetings, Abubakar managed to convince the
above-mentioned countries and organizations to support his
democratization process and requested them to lift the sanctions
against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Nigeria was slammed on with international sanctions
and even temporarily expelled from the Commonwealth for the
execution of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni
minority activists.
</P>
<P>
All the diplomatic shuffles have paid off, as both the
European Union and the U.S. have announced the partial lifting of
their sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group established in 1995
to monitor Nigeria's human rights situation also recommended the
lifting of sanctions against Nigeria during a meeting in London
in October.
</P>
<P>
In a relatively short period of time, Abubakar has won the
hail of most Nigerians for his courage and decisive reforms. But
as the honeymoon is slipping by, Abubarkar, and indeed, the whole
nation will have to prove themselves to be sincere in dealing
with the much tougher challenges they are facing, the ailing
economy, the spreading poverty, and most of all, the finalizatin
of a lasting civil democracy.

<HEADLINE> Bayern, Kaiserslautern Disappointed at Cup Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- German giants Bayern Munich and
Kaiserslautern were disappointed on Wednesday because the
Champions Cup draw made them meet in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
"It's not so good for German football that the two teams are
to meet now," Kaiserslautern captain Ciriaco Sforza said.
</P>
<P>
"You can't pick and choose who you want," said Bayern
president Franz Beckenbauer. "It's no longer international but
has a domestic character. It's because of this that there is a
push by the bigger clubs to have teams seeded so this sort of
thing can be avoided in future."
</P>
<P>
Bayern topped and dashed out of the Champions League's "Group
of Death" which included Manchester United, Barcelona and
Denmark's Brondby.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Bayern beat would-be challengers Bayer Leverkusen
at home and headed the table.
</P>
<P>
Bayern defeated title-holder Kaiserslautern 4-0 in the
Bundesliga this season.
</P>
<P>
Kaiserslautern, which headed by Otto Rehhagel and ranked third
in the Bundesliga now, denied Bayern last season's Bundesliga
title.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have already met once in the quarter-finals of the
1979-80 UEFA Cup. On that occasion, Bayern went through after a
4-1 win at home and 1-0 defeat away.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists: Green Tea Can Kill Tumor Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists reported
Wednesday that the result of their study shows green tea contains
substances that can kill tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
"Our research shows that green tea leaves are rich in anti-cancer
compound," said Dorothy Morre, a professor of foods and nutrition at
Purdue University, at a meeting of the American Society of Cell
Biology in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Morre and her husband James Morre, a chemist and
pharmacologist also at Purdue University, said that, before they began
their study on green tea, they had heard reports of green tea's
purported effects. These reports, they added, led them to set out to
see if there was a mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The husband-and-wife team found green tea contains substances
called epigallocatechin gallate, or EGCg for short, which
interfered with tumor-associated activity, but not interfered with
normal activity.
</P>
<P>
The EGCg limits the acitivity of breast cancer tumor cells grown in
the laboratory, but does not seem to affect normal, healthy breast
cells, the Morres reported.
</P>
<P>
They said green tea and black tea both come from the same bush in
the camellia family, but green tea is much richer in EGCg than other
black tea because the latter has been allowed to ferment, a process
which may interfere with compounds such as EGCg.
</P>
<P>
They said this is one of the first studies to directly link the
EGCg in green tea to anti-cancer activity. More tests are needed to
see if EGCg is active in the bodies of people who drink green tea,
they added.

PHNOM PENH, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Former FUNCINPEC resistance
deputy commander Khann Savoeun has been appointed as first deputy
chief of general staff of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF),
a post vacated by Nhiek Bun Chhay who fled into resistance last
July.
</P>

FUNCINPEC and CPP commanders.
</P>
<P>
Khann Savoeun was the RCAF commander of the Siem Reap
town-based Military Region 4 when factional fighting broke out in
Phnom Penh in July 1997 between loyal security forces of CPP and
FUNCINPEC.
</P>
<P>
When the fighting began, Khann Savoeun fled Siem Reap town for
the Thai border outpost of O'smach, which became a resistance base
for FUNCINPEC before it joined the new government.

BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan army lieutenant
Sergey Lavrenenko won the men's 40-km points race at the Asian
Games here on Thursday, but not without controversy.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old collected 41 points in this highly competitive
120-lap cycling competition, with racers sprinting for points
every six lap.
</P>
<P>
"It was a very difficult competition," said Lavrenenko, bronze
medalist at the 1995 World Championships. "The heat here had an
adverse effect on me."
</P>
<P>
South Korean rider Cho Ho-Sung won the silver medal at 34
points, while Iran's Amir Zargari took the bronze at 21 points.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, arguing that one of the Kazakhstan riders had been
blocking Cho in certain laps, lodged a protest without success
after the competition.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Tomoya Kano, who had once been third during the race,
squandered his chance when he fell with 5 laps remaining. He

<HEADLINE> OAU Meeting Ready in Ouagadougou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, December 17 (Xinhua) -- About 24 heads of state
and 30 delegations from African countries will meet Thursday in
Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso, to discuss conflicts in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, dubbed the fourth ordinary session of the Central
Organ of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for
Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution at summit level,
marks a major collective effort to find solutions to crises in
several African countries that tend to threaten the peace of the
African continent.
</P>
<P>
According to a draft agenda made available to Xinhua, the
two-day meeting is going to discuss the conflicts in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Burundi, Guinea Bissau, the
Comoros and the dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
By late Wednesday evening, a ministerial meeting was still
going on to deliberate further on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
According to an OAU official, both Congolese President Laurent
Kabila and the rebels are now in Ouagadougou but it is not
decided yet if they would be allowed to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Foreign Ministry of Burkina Faso said there
is no change of position on the side of Kabila, who refuses
face-to-face talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim, who was seen at
Wednesday night's ministerial meeting, is expected to deliver
reports on the above-mentioned five issues.
</P>
<P>
The reports, made available to Xinhua, said the foundation for
a peaceful solution to the Congo crisis have already been laid by
previous initiatives launched in and outside Africa.
</P>
<P>
Salim expressed the hope that the meeting will assist the
Congolese parties to conflict "in narrowing the differences and
bridging the gap on positions relating to a cessation of
hostilities, a standstill of the forces and the establishment of
a cease-fire, including, the modalities of its signing."
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Anjouan, the OAU chief said consultations
are still going on to respond quickly to the Comoran government's
request to assist in restoring peace, security and stability
there.
</P>
<P>
Recent conflicts between factions of Anjouan separatists since
December 5 have claimed more than 60 lives and forced local
residents to flee the Island.
</P>
<P>
On December 11, an OAU military delegation ended its
investigation in Anjouan and is believed to have reported its
findings to Salim.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, the meeting will debate on the
report and discuss the possibility of employing a peace-keeping
force in Anjouan.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in Guinea Bissau, the Secretary-General
appealed to both OAU member countries and the international
community to provide logistic and other assistance to enable the
agreed interposition force to be deployed by the target date of
mid-December.
</P>
<P>
The interposition force is agreed on by both the government
and opposition forces in the Nigerian capital Abuja in November.
The parties also agreed to establish a unity government, but
there is still differences about the composition of such a
government, although an opposition member has been appointed as
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Salim's report also blamed the National Union of Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) for the current stalemate in the
peace process of Angola and urged UNITA to comply with its
obligations under various agreements.

</P>
<P>
When asked to describe their feelings about no NBA games being

they couldn't wait until the players get back on the court. The
NBA did not comment on the survey results.

"Upon seeing my life without the NBA, I like it," said
Nicholas Holman of Fort Worth. "I don't occupy myself with all of
the stars and keeping up with the teams. I thought I would really
miss the NBA, but I don't miss it one bit."

The NBA and its players union last met Saturday for 30
minutes. Nothing was resolved and no further talks were scheduled.

<HEADLINE> China Raps at U.K.-U.S. Military Action Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday
night condemned the U.K.-U.S. military action against Iraq as a
violation of the U.N. Charter and international law.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, told a night session of the Security Council, "We were
deeply shocked by this act and condemn it."
</P>
<P>
The military action came as Iraq, with the joint effort by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the international community,
had resumed its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and
progress had also been made in arms verification, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Against this backdrop, the two countries' unprovoked military
action is totally unjustified," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are against acts of power politics of unilateral resort to
the use of or threat of force in international relations, we
believed that such acts contravening the international law and the
norms guiding international relations are in themselves a serious
threat to international peace and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China has always strongly advocated the peaceful settlement
of international disputes and is against the use of or threat of
force in international relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The differences between Iraq and UNSCOM could be properly
solved through dialogue and consultation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The use of force is far from helping with the settlement and
may bring about serious consequences for the implementation of
relevant Security Council resolutions, for the relations between
Iraq and the United Nations, and for the peace and stability in
the region and in other parts of the world," said Qin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese envoy called on London and Washington to
immediately stop military strikes, to avoid any act that may
worsen the situation and to return to dialogue and consultation.
</P>
<P>
On UNSCOM's report on the alleged Iraqi failure to fully
cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors, Qin said, "The leader of
UNSCOM has played a dishonorable role in this crisis, and this
report is one-sided and evasive of the facts."
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM leader, Richard Butler, should be held responsible
for the crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia joined China in condemning the military action against
Iraq. Other Security Council members, including Brazil, Kenya and
Sweden, said that only the 15-member Security Council was obliged
to deal with the crucial issue of peace and war.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Losing Appeal with Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's appeal as a
destination for international investment has deteriorated in the
past three years, according to a recent survey commissioned by the
American Chamber of Commerce in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Questionnaires sent to 400 companies in New Zealand by Waikato
University drew 48 responses from a cross section of industries
who are identified as being overseas-based investors by the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
More than half say they have considered selling or relocating
away from New Zealand in the past three years, with Australia
being the most attractive alternative.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, political instability in the country
is the No.1 problem in attracting investors. This is followed by
Australia as an alternative for investment, rising compliance
costs, slow growth and excessive regulations.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations world investment report published recently
shows New Zealand as the most highly dependent of all developed
countries on foreign direct investment (FDI).
</P>
<P>
From 1986 to 1991, FDI as a percentage of gross fixed capital
formation was 19.2 percent in New Zealand. By 1996 it had risen to
26.7 percent. Percentages of other developed countries have
hovered around 2.6 percent to four percent.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Behind U.S. Air Strikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
ordered military strikes on suspected Iraqi military and security
targets Wednesday, claiming that Baghdad must be punished for
refusing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. strikes came shortly after Chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler's Tuesday report on Iraq's non-compliance
with U.S. resolutions, analysts pointed out that there are other
covert reasons for the U.S. being so eager to launch a military
strike against long-time trouble-maker Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1998, the U.S. has been thrown into
passivity more than once on the Iraqi weapons inspection issue. It
was prepared previously to launch two air strikes against Iraq,
but had called them off at the last minute amid strong worldwide
opposition and mediation.
</P>
<P>
The two aborted strikes gave some the impression that
U.S. influence could be wanning, and that it had been led by the
nose by Iraq. Hard-liners at home also began to criticize the
Clinton administration for being too weak in handling the Iraq
issue.
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate its determination and to regain initiative on
the Iraqi issue, the Clinton administration views the strikes as a
last chance before year's end to give a heavy blow to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
To overthrow the Saddam administration is another reason behind
the strikes. In the November weapons inspection crisis, the
U.S. had already made clear its intention to support opposition
forces to unseat Saddam from inside.
</P>
<P>
In a nationally televised address on Wednesday, Clinton
reiterated the intention of replacing the Saddam regime with a new
one. Besides offering financial support, Washington believes it is
necessary to support Saddam's opponents morally. Launching an air
strike seems to be a good way to achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
The strikes were also thoughtfully timed in light of the
current situation in Washington. Analysts believed that to some
extent domestic considerations are an even more important factor
behind the strikes.
</P>
<P>
In the face of a possible impeachment stemming from the Monica
Lewinsky affair, the White House these days is going all out to
win republicans in the Senate from voting for impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
So far, most of the republicans in the House of Commons have
said they would vote for an impeachment, which makes the prospect
of a house impeachment vote, which is set for Thursday, dim for
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
To prolong the interval before the voting and win support from
those republicans who have not yet made up their mind on the
impeachment issue, as well as to distract public attention from
the Lewinsky case, a military strike against Iraq seems to be a
much-desired option for Washington. Indeed, the house vote has
been postponed because of the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The strikes are also widely believed to be an effort for the
U.S. to strengthen its profile as a middle east peace maker. The
U.S. role in the Middle East has been weakened by its repeated
failure to bring the Middle east peace process on a set track.
</P>
<P>
Since the Israel government is adhering to its hard-line stand,
the implementation of the Wye Peace Accord, which was signed in
October between Israel and Palestine, has been deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
Washington now needs to do something in another front in the
Middle east to prove its leading role in the region, and ensure
that its Mideast strategy remains intact.

UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council ended its night session on Wednesday with members China
and Russia condemning the U.K.-U.S. military action against Iraq.

<P>
"My position is that we are for the resolution of any crisis

China and Russia strongly opposed the use of force against

The military action came as the Security Council was discussing
a report by chief U.N. inspector Richard Butler, who said that
Baghdad failed to fully cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Prison Population Rockets in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of people in
prison in New Zealand has jumped by more than 70 percent and the
prisoners are serving longer sentences for more violent crimes
than they did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a latest prison census, which was taken on November 20,
1997, the Dominion reported Thursday that the census shows there
were 4,935 sentenced prisoners in New Zealand, a country with a
population of less than 3.8 million. The 4,935 prisoners included
4,728 male and 207 female.
</P>
<P>
The number of sentenced male prisoners was up 77.6 percent from
2,662 in 1987 when the first prison census was taken. Sentenced
female prisoners increased 72.5 percent from 120 in 1987.
</P>
<P>
In the foreword to the census report, Justice Secretary Colin
Keating said the rise in the prison population was mainly caused
by a big increase in convictions for violent and serious offenses,
leading to more prisoners serving longer sentences, the
Wellington-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
There was a disproportionate number of Maoris in prison. Maoris
 comprise 14 percent of the general population, but make up 43.8
percent of the male prison population and 42 percent of the
female.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Corrections Minister Nick Smith was quoted as
saying that the census is a "sad commentary" on the level of
offending, particularly violence, in society.
</P>
<P>
"Society is becoming a more violent place and we have got to be
more innovative if we are going to prevent a similar increase in
the next decade," he said.

</P>
<P>
Nigerians entered 1998 with high expectations and keen

its independence from British Colonial rule in 1960, had been a

From June 1994 to June 1995, late military leader Sani Abacha
summoned a constitutional conference which produced a new
constitution for the country, but he never published it until his
sudden death in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional conference asked Abacha to hand over power
to a civilian government but provided no date for him to do so.
In Nigerians' words, it gave him a blank check for him to fill.
</P>
<P>
Ever since Abacha announced a three-year transition program in
October 1995, Nigerians had been waiting for the coming civilian
presidency.
</P>
<P>
But Abacha never took action.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he claimed that it was not new either in Africa or in
other parts of the world for a military general to run for
civilian presidency.
</P>
<P>
As a result, numerous organizations mushroomed in Nigeria to
campaign for Abacha's presidency. The most prominent of them is
an orginization called Youth Earnestly Ask for Abacha, or YEAA.
</P>
<P>
In early March, YEAA launched a mass rally in capital Abuja in
support of Abacha's presidency.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day mass rally, government offices were closed,
police were mobilized to keep order, and various artists groups
were employed for entertainment, even the National Football Team
was called in to boost the morale.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the anti-Abacha rallies organized by
pro-democracy groups were dispersed by police using tear gases.
Some people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
When it seemed that a civilian Abacha presidency was only a
matter of time, Abacha suddenly died of heart attack on the early
morning of June 8, and hence the election went up in smoke. And
Abacha's death triggered off various speculations about the
circumstances of his death, some even suggested a foul play, but
with no proof.
</P>
<P>
On June 9, the Provisional Ruling Council recommended the then
Chief of Defense Staff, Major-General Abdulsalam Abubakar to be
successor to Abacha and he was sworn in as the head of state and
commander in chief of the armed forces at the same day.
</P>
<P>
Sine then, Abdulsalam Abubakar, a 56-year-old career
officer unknown to most world leaders until June 9, has emerged
as the man on whom most hopes rest to rescue Africa's most
populous nation from its collapse.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia, China and Greece
Thursday expressed their strong opposition to the U.S.-led air
strikes against Iraq while France, Germany and Italy expressed
regret over it.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said in Madrid that Russia
condemns the U.S. airstrikes and calls for an immediate halt to
the military operation.
</P>
<P>
The strikes "can not only complicate the situation in the Gulf
but also have more serious consequences, and over a wider area,"
Ivanov was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin
Huasun said on Wednesday that China is opposed to the use of force
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the use of force will not only have serious
consequences for the implementation of the Security Council
resolutions, but also pose a threat to international peace as well
as regional security.
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
While condemning the U.S. airstrikes against Iraq, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi urged the United States to
halt all its military actions immediately.
</P>
<P>
Sun Yuxi said, "We feel shocked at the U.S. military strikes
against Iraq. "
</P>
<P>
The United States has no authorization by the UN Security
Council and "this has violated the UN Charter and the
international norms," Sun.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Secretary Dimitris Apostalakis said Thursday that
Greece opposes military actions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Apostalakis told reporters that Greece opposed "military
options of this kind" as the strikes would not help solve the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Greek media also expressed their opposition to the U.S. and
British military attacks on Iraq in editorial comments.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman said Wednesday that he
deeply deplored the United State's attack against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I deplore it, I believe there are democratic ways, a dialogue
or organizations like the United Nations where (problems) can be
resolved without bringing pain to any country," he said.
</P>
<P>
France regreted what it called the "spiral" which has led to
the military strikes by the United States against Iraq early
Thursday Baghdad time.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry statement said that France also
regrets the serious consequences the strikes would inflict on the
Iraqi civilians.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Thursday that Italy
deeply regretted the U.S.-led air strikes and demanded a rapid end
to them.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq crisis should be resolved through political means by
the United Nations, Dini said.
</P>
<P>
Dini said he had phoned U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and British Foreign Minister Robin Cook Wednesday night
after the first round of air strikes at Baghdad early on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Germany called Thursday for a rapid end to military actions
against Iraq.

He said that Bonn "deplored" the use of military measures in
the Iraqi crisis.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Closes Border with Iraq to Prevent Refugee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordan closed its border with
Iraq earlier Thursday to prevent possible influx of refugees who
flee Iraq as a result of the ongoing United States air strike.
</P>
<P>
"We have closed our borders with Iraq, and we do not intend to
permit the entry of people coming from Iraq," the semi-official
Jordan Times Thursday quoted Interior Minister Nayef Al Qadi as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will not open its border with Iraq for refugees, but it
is willing to offer any possible assistance, if needed, on the
Iraqi side of the border, Qadi added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan's official news agency, the Petra, reported
that the situation remained calm and there was no influx of
refugees along the Jordanian-Iraqi border until 04:30 GMT Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled Iraq and flooded Jordan
during the Gulf war (1990-1991), creating a severe burden for the
kingdom's economy in the following years.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Oil Industry Struggles Due to Price Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's oil
exports in the first 10 months this year went down by 267 million
U.S. dollars due to a continuing world price slump.
</P>
<P>
The Mines and Energy Ministry said Wednesday that oil exports
totaled 1.8 billion dollars in the period as against 2.1 billion
dollars in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Oil output went up from 600,000 to 800,000 barrels a day in
October, prompting a 13 percent surge in exports in the first 10
months.
</P>
<P>
But the prices dropped to 13.29 dollars a barrel in October
from an average of 19.08 dollars in 1997 for the highest-priced
crude.
</P>
<P>
If prices fall below 10 dollars a barrel, the high-cost output
zones in the country may be closed. The production of the
country's crude costs four to five dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
If the slump continues, Colombia could lose 13 billion dollars
worth of oil revenues between 2001 and 2006, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Oil made up the bulk of export revenues for the country in
1997, but it could be surpassed by coffee this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hit on Iraq Unlikely to Affect Clinton Impeachment Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. airstrikes on Iraq
Wednesday prompted House Republican leaders to delay a vote set
for Thursday but were unlikely to affect the support for
impeaching President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"We are not anticipating taking that action tomorrow
(Thursday)," Republican House speaker-elect Robert Livingston
told reporters after a closed-door party meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said lawmakers were to "pass a resolution in support of our
troops," adding that the impeachment vote could come Friday or
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the Capitol Hill, there were indications that "Operation
Desert Fox" was enhancing Republican resolve to refer charges
against Clinton to the Senate for trial.
</P>
<P>
"The suspicion some people have about the President's motives
in this attack is itself a powerful argument for impeachment,"
Republican House majority leader Dick Armey said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, another top House Republican, Gerald Solomon, had
denounced Clinton's action.
</P>
<P>
"We should not be handling the impeachment while the bombs are
in the air, and that's exactly the reason he's doing it," he told
CNN.
</P>
<P>
Republican Spencer Bachus said they are going to impeach
Clinton, adding that any delay would be momentary.
</P>
<P>
The attack "solidified support around impeaching the
president," said Bachus.
</P>
<P>
In a stunning move, Senate Republican leader Trent Lott said he
would not support U.S. air strikes against Iraq, hinting that he
suspected that impeachment had influenced Clinton's action.
</P>
<P>
"While I have been assured by administration officials that
there is no connection with the impeachment process ... I cannot
support this military action," Lott said in a statement, adding
"both the timing and the policy are subject to question."
</P>
<P>
"If, however, military action is taken, all Americans will
fully support our troops in battle," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 435-member House of Representatives was predicted to pass
at least one of the charges of perjury, obstruction of justice and
abuse of power against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
According to a poll Wednesday night by CNN, one third of
Americans believe Clinton ordered the attacks against Iraq to
divert attention from moves to impeach him.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives will delay impeachment proceedings against
President Bill Clinton by one or two days, incoming House Speaker
Robert Livingston said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to ask that all members, Republican and Democrat,
remain available to the call of the chair for further action,
possibly Friday, possibly Saturday, but within the near future,"
Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
The House was scheduled to start debate Thursday on four
articles of impeachment against Clinton in connection with the
Monica Lewinsky affair, which were approved last week by the House
Judiciary Committee. They include two counts of perjury, one of
obstruction of justice and one of abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives' move came shortly after the
U.S. started airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
There was Republican skepticism all around about Clinton's
motives in ordering airstrikes, though.
</P>
<P>
Republicans are likely to convene the House on Thursday and
approve a resolution of support for military personnel, rather
than launch what had been scheduled as a historic debate over the
fate of the nation's 42nd president.

<HEADLINE> Water-Saving Irrigation Used Widely in E. China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
which produces one-tenth of the country's grain, has become the
largest user of water-saving irrigation facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 2.11 million hectares of the province's 4.67 million
hectares of farmland have been covered with a water-saving
irrigation system, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Shang Mengping, an official with the provincial water
conservation department, said that this system has helped local
farmers cut their water consumption by at least 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to Shang, per-capita water resources in the
province stand at only 357 cubic meters, 20 cubic meters less than
even Israel. About 1.8 million hectares of local farmland have
been hit by droughts of varying severity over the past 48 years,
resulting in yearly losses of some 1.5 billion kilos of grain.
</P>
<P>
To offset the impact of droughts, the province experimented
with many water-saving methods, such as leveling the land and
reinforcing existing irrigation canals, in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, Shandong has introduced advanced irrigation
technology and equipment, including spraying, seeping and dripping
methods from the United States, Israel, Australia, Italy and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 4.4 billion yuan has been used by the
province to create a water-saving irrigation network.

BAGHDAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and British missiles
pounded the Iraqi capital of Baghdad early on Thursday, killing at
least two people and injuring more than 30 others so far.
</P>
<P>
The first blast were heard at 00:49 a.m. local time (2149 GMT
Wednesday) and were followed by a series of explosions. The
explosions shook the building of Xinhua's Baghdad Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Washington and London immediately announced that the air
strikes, code-named Operation Desert Fox, had begun.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua correspondents in Baghdad saw clouds of smoke drifted
across some parts of the city and the acrid smell of smoke hung
around the city center.
</P>
<P>
The air raids sirens sounded briefly over the Iraqi capital at
00:20 a.m. local time. Half an hour later, anti-aircraft guns
opened up in downtown and fired off two more sustained volleys.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic bursts of fire continued. Eyewitnesses said the
missiles landed around one of the palaces of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein in central Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports from one Baghdad hospital said at least two
people have been killed and 30 others injured during the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Culture and Information Ministry officials said a U.S. missile
landed in a residential area, injuring four people and causing
damages to civilian property. The officials said it had caused
damage to a drinking water network.

<HEADLINE> North China Replaces South as Leading Grain Supplier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The traditional practice of
"shipping surplus grain from south China to north China" is being
reversed, as north and northeast China have emerged as grain
giants in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the additional grain output of
the plain of the Yellow, Huaihe and Haihe rivers and the three
provinces in northeast China totaled 67.7 billion kilos in the
1984-96 period, accounting for 68 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China, which embraces Jilin, Liaoning and
Heilongjiang provinces with an area of 1.24 million square
kilometers, is expected to become the country's largest grain base
early next century.
</P>
<P>
Jilin Province occupies only one-twentyfifth of China's
cultivated land, but produces one-tenth of the commercial grain
quota set by the state and one-half of the country's maize export,
annually.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the Chinese Academy of Sciences predict that the
grain output of northeast China will climb to 99 billion kilos by
the year 2005, and the region is able to provide 45 billion kilos
of grain annually, which can feed 110 million people, or one-third
of China's future urban population.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, grain production in the country's southern
provinces is shrinking, as the output of land in the middle and
lower reaches of the Yangtze River has shown signs of decreasing
in recent years.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Expects Double-Digit Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province,
whose gross domestic product (GDP) ranks third in the country, is
expected to see its economy grow by around 11 percent this year,
exceeding the targeted nine percent, local analysts forecast.
</P>
<P>
This will help the country realize the national goal of eight
percent growth this year, they say.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Provincial Statistics Bureau show that the
province generated 495 billion yuan in GDP for the first nine
months of the year, up 10.5 percent over the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Although it has been hit hard by the Asian financial crisis,
with exports falling short of the year's growth target of ten
percent, Shandong has done been doing well in many other sectors,
thanks to a series of measures to stimulate domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The province secured a good harvest of major farm crops
including grain, cotton, oil seeds and fruit, with grain output
reaching 43 million tons, laying a sound foundation for
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector also has been picking up, with added
value growing by 12.4 percent for the first ten months, and
experts predict a 12.5 percent rise for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
Added value in the service sector has been increasing at a 11.7
percent rate so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Local experts say that Shandong is capable of maintaining a
stable economy for years to come, and this has made them more
optimistic about the upward trend of the local economy.

<HEADLINE> Ration Coupons Reflect China's History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The old coupons and samples on
display in the Chinese capital of Beijing reflect the tremendous
changes that have taken place in the country over the past 40
years.
</P>
<P>
An unknown number of coupons were a necessity in the country
for buying a wide range of products, from grain to industrial
products for people's daily life, since the central government
issued the first set of coupons in 1953.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the ongoing show put on display more than 1,000
kinds of coupons collected in Beijing alone. They had all been
abolished by 1993 and so was the case in other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
An old bicycle-purchasing card tells the visitors that in 1973
there was only one such coupon for every 50 people, and another 30
industrial coupons were necessary if one wanted to buy a bike.
</P>
<P>
And it may be hard now to imagine that newly married couples at
that time had to get a coupon specially for couples if they wanted
to buy any furniture.
</P>
<P>
The first set of flour coupons was issued by the Beijing
municipal government in November 1953, when the first five-year
plan became effective in China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing issued rationing cards for edible oil on July 1, 1954,
and limited the supply of meat in 1957. And coupons were needed
when Beijingers bought shoes in 1960. There were altogether 102
kinds of goods that required coupons in 1962, 44.8 percent of all
the products then available.
</P>
<P>
"It was a really hard time, and the whole country was in
financial difficulties," said 82-year-old Mr. Bai.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing city government abolished coupons for eggs
and meat on December 1, 1992, and for edible oil on May
10, 1993, because of China's fast-changing economy.
</P>
<P>
However, many Beijingers have kept these coupons as souvenirs
of another time, and some collectors also exchange such items with
one another.

<P>
The National Y2K Task Force, headed by Chairman of the Council
of Information Technology V.K. Samaranayake, comprises 20 eminent
professionals from both public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Samaranayake said that the main problem with most computer
systems is that they use two digits to represent years, but when
it comes to the turn of the millennium the computers will show 00
for 2000, in the same manner as 98 for 1998.
</P>
<P>
"There are embedded chips and other integral parts of the
computer in which the corresponding changes should be made," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Samaranayake said that they had approached all key institutions
in the country and obtained vital information to resolve the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The public must also be kept informed that there is no need for
panic. There are 381 days left and we should make the best use of
that time, Samaranayake said.
</P>
<P>
He explained possible options in dealing with the situation
such as coding the computers from different years. In any event
all the information systems in the country need not be changed
before the turn of the millennium, he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Annan, Saddam on Strikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Following are some of the
remarks made by U.S. President Bill Clinton, UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on the U.S.-led
airstrikes against Iraq on early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in an address to the nation from the Oval office
that he "ordered America's armed forces to strike military and
security targets in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The troops' mission "is to attack Iraq's nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons programs and its military capacity to threaten
its neighbors."
</P>
<P>
"Their purpose is to protect the national interest of the
United States, and indeed the interests of people throughout the
Middle East and around the world."
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has failed to turn over virtually all the documents
requested by the inspectors. Indeed, we know that Iraq ordered the
destruction of weapons-related documents in anticipation of an
UNSCOM inspection."
</P>
<P>
"So Iraq has abused its final chance."
</P>
<P>
Annan called the bombing of Iraq "a sad day for the world."
</P>
<P>
"This is a sad day for the United Nations, and for the
world. It is also a very sad day for me personally. Throughout
this year I have done everything in my power to ensure peaceful
compliance with Security Council resolutions, and so to avert the
use of force."
</P>
<P>
"This has not been an easy or a painless process. It has
required patience, determination and the will to seek peace even
wen all signs pointed to war. However daunting the task, the
United Nations had to try as long as any hope of peace remained. I
deeply regret that today these efforts have proved insufficient,"
</P>
<P>
"What has happened cannot be reversed."
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency,
Saddam said that Iraqis should "fight the enemies of Allah,
enemies of the nation, enemies of humanity."
</P>
<P>
"Allah will be on your side and disgrace will be theirs, now
and on the day of the judgment," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
He said several targets were hit.
</P>
<P>
"Wicked people bombarded several targets on the soil of your
great Iraq, thinking that they will twist your great will and your
determination."
</P>
<P>
Saddam said he was sure that what hurt Iraqis more was not the
attacks but the fact that the aggressor did not "come to meet you
face to face" and depended "on a long technological arm, which is
not a measure of bravery."

<P>
BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea defeated a
Kazakshtan team hit by jinx in the final to retain the men's team
pursuit cycling title at the Asian Games here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mechanical problems made Valeriy Titov and Dmitriy Muravyev
fall only 100 meters into the race, causing the final to restart.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan was apparently deprived of the chance to revenge its
loss to the Koreans at the last Games in Hiroshima when the team
had to race without Titov, who suffered several bruises.
</P>
<P>
South Korea finally clocked four minutes 36.609 seconds, nearly
seven seconds faster than the central Asian team.
</P>
<P>
"We have trained for one whole year and today we finally get
the good result," said Ji Sung-Hwan, who won his second gold after
taking the 1-km time trial title here.
</P>
<P>
South Korean head coach Lee Young-Woo said he was not sure of
winning even when the Kazakhstan team was reduced to three.
</P>
<P>
"I could only say we had 49 percent chance and they got 51
percent. After two of their members fall our chance improved but
two of their riders are very very strong."
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan carried home the silver while China defeated Chinese
Taipei in the third place decider to win the bronze medal.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Records Impressive Export Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's export sector
recorded an impressive 3.69 billion U.S. dollars of earnings
during the first 10 months of this year, 13 percent up from the
same period last year, Central Bank officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the same period last year the earnings were 3.26 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the performance was a direct result of
attractive incentives, which were offered in line with the
government's commitment to developing export-oriented industries
to create employment for youths.
</P>
<P>
Through these incentives industrialists were able to modernize
and upgrade their industries resulting in an overall increase in
productivity, said the bank officials.
</P>
<P>
From January to October, agricultural exports were 873.5
million dollars, 16 percent up from the 750 million dollars in the
same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Industrial exports contributed 2.74 billion dollars. The
decrease in other exports have been offset by the increase in
textiles and apparels, beverages and tobacco and leather and
rubber products, the officials said.

UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) - The Iraqi ambassador to

immediate cessation of the aggression" by the United States and
Britain against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an open session of the 15-member UN Security

Hamdoon accused chief UN weapons inspector Richard Butler of
making a "distorted" report to the UN Security Council that
triggered the military action on early Thursday Baghdad time.
</P>
<P>
"The exaggerated uproar over the Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction is nothing other than a big lie. The other is that
Iraq poses a threat to its neighbors," said Hamdoon.

<HEADLINE> Argentina, Chile Sign Border Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President
Carlos Menem and his Chilean counterpart Eduardo Frei Wednesday
signed a treaty on the limits of continental icefields, ending the
last border dispute between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony took place in the government house and was
attended by foreign ministers, high-ranking government officials
and congressional representatives from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, President Menem said the pact was "a
new stage, a new history and a new path, which will lead to
strength and union between two peoples willing to solve pending
issues in a mature way."
</P>
<P>
Visiting President Frei said that with the signing of the
treaty, the two countries can build a future of integration, peace
and confidence.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, known as the "agreement between the Argentine and
Chilean republics to set the boundary from Mount Fitzroy to Daudet
Hill" establishes a borderline in the disputed icefields.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of a peace treaty between Argentine and Chile
in 1984, the two governments have solved 23 of the 24 pending
zones, which left only the limits of the continental icefields to
be resolved.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Menem and Chilean President Patricio Aylwin signed a
treaty dividing the more than 2,300 square kilometer zone into
1,250 square kilometers for Argentina and 1,057 for Chile. The
pact was rejected by congressional members in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The treaty signed Wednesday has widespread support among
lawmakers in the two countries and is expected to be approved by
both congresses.
</P>
<P>
The pact is signed as good economic and political relations
prevail between the two countries. Recently, Argentina backed
Chile's stand that General Augusto Pinochet should be sent back to
his country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement signed on Tuesday, the Chilean government said
it fully supported Argentina's sovereignty over the Malvinas
(Falklands) Islands.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, a member of the Mercosur, and Chile, an associate
member of the trade bloc, have recorded growing commercial
exchanges of 600 million dollars in 1990 to 2.6 billion in
1997. Trade volume is expected to reach 3 billion dollars this
year.
</P>
<P>
Chilean investments in Argentina total 6 billion dollars and
Chile is one of Argentina' s most important trade and investment
partners.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the new border treaty is expected to further
boost bilateral relations, integration in the Mercosur union and
in Latin America.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Against Lifting Ocalan's Travel Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 16 (Xinhua) - - Turkey will file an appeal
against the decision to lift Abdullah Ocalan's travel
restrictions, said Augusto Sinagra, an Italian lawyer representing
Turkey on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under an Italian court ruling on Wednesday, Ocalan can move
freely within Italy, despite his lack of identification documents.
</P>
<P>
Sinagra called the court's decision "contradictory and
surprising as if a Turkish arrest warrant and extradition request
didn't exist".
</P>
<P>
The appeal will ask Italian authorities to take the "necessary
precautionary measures regarding Ocalan", he said.
</P>
<P>
The original restrictive measures imposed on the Kurdish
Worker's Party (PKK) leader, based on international warrant issued
by Germany, forbade him from leaving the Rome metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
But Germany said that it will not seek to extradite Ocalan to
Germany, because it feared disturbances among the country's
Kurdish community.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Almea said the appeals court
decision changed nothing in practical terms, saying that for
security reasons Italian authorities will continue to keep Ocalan
under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister designate Bulent Ecevit said Ocalan "was
already in fact a free man". Ecevit said that he still did not
know the scope of the ruling, but that since arriving in Italy,
Ocalan "has been able to talk with whoever he pleases and live
with all the comforts".
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said the court
decision referred only to the German warrant, and thus Ocalan
should still be restricted based on Turkey's extradition request.
</P>
<P>
"If the Kurdish leader is released without any conditions, we
will appeal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan is currently under house arrest in Rome, and Italy has
refused Turkey's extradition request because Italian law bars
extradition to countries where defendants could face the death
penalty.

SHIJIAZHUANG, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Geothermal energy and
mineral-water resources have been proved to be abundant along the
Hebei section of the Beijing-Kowloon railway line, according to
the north China's province experts.
</P>
<P>
The provincial geological department estimates that the
geothermal energy along this Hebei section can provide enough
energy for 20 million hectares of greenhouse planting and over 600
billion square meters of heating.
</P>
<P>
The mineral department experts point out that this section is
also more abundant in geothermal resources than any other place on
the Hebei Plains.
</P>
<P>
With geothermal energy, the hub city of Hengshui along the
railway line has been able to solve its heating problems, and the
city of Renqiu has developed 5,333 hectares of greenhouse flowers.
</P>
<P>
The Hebei section of the Beijing-Kowloon line has twelve
mineral-water sites approved by the state, and some of these spots
are also rich in iodine.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- An Australian Catholic peace
group is organizing a protest Thursday outside the U.S. Consulate
in Sydney to protest against the bombing of Iraq by the U.S. and
Britain in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the group Denis Doherty said the protest would
start at 4:00 p.m. Thursday on the corner of Castlereagh Street
and Martin Place, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the Australian government to condemn this cynical,
inhuman bombing of innocent civilians," Doherty told AAP.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated the air strikes may cause up to 20,000
casualties -- men, women and children murdered to try and save the
U.S. president from impeachment," Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
Doherty said the weapons inspection team could not find
evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and engaged in
provocative acts while maintaining sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"These sanctions have killed over one million people since
1991," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Thursday Australia
fully backs the air strikes on Iraq, saying they were inevitable
and unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain announced earlier Thursday that they had
begun their air strikes against Iraq due to Iraq's failure of
cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission on Arms
Inspections.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo, Malaysian Shares Fall on News of Airstrikes on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, Dec 17 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo and Malaysian shares opened
lower Thursday Morning following U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Shares in Tokyo fell 0.6 percent Thursday with the key Nikkei
225 index losing 89.19 points to close the morning session at
14,007.11, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
Investors were particularly wary of foreign exchange trading as
the dollar slid quickly against the yen, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The dollar traded at 116.03-05 at 10 a.m. (0100 GMT), down from
116.65 yen in New York Wednesday shortly before the strikes began.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian share prices also opened lower Thursday following
news of the airstrikes on Iraq, said a report reaching here from
Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Local dealers said the initial reaction was confusion leading
to rapid selling although the downward momentum was easing.
</P>
<P>
In the first half hour of trading, the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange index was down 1.4 percent at 535.47 points, down 7.52
points from Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
A dealer at a bank-linked brokerage said news of the airstrike
took investors by surprise and that their `knee-jerk' reaction was
to sell.

<HEADLINE> China Condemns U.S. Airstrikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China today condemned the
U.S. airstrikes against Iraq and urged the U.S. to halt all its
military actions immediately, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said
today.
</P>
<P>
China's official response came after the UN Security Council's
emergency consultations on Iraq adjourned and shortly after the
U.S. began airstrikes against Iraq at 0:49 a.m. local time (21:49
GMT) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sun Yuxi, the newly-installed spokesman, said, "We feel shocked
at the U.S. military strikes against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. of having no authorization by the UN Security
Council and unilaterally using force against Iraq, saying, "This
has violated the UN Charter and the international norms."
</P>
<P>
Sun stressed that China has always stood for peaceful means to
solve international disputes and is opposed to the use of force
in international relations.
</P>
<P>
EArlier, Qin Huasun, China's Permanent Representative to the
UN, said: "The use of force will not only have serious
consequences for the implementation of the Security Council
resolutions, but also pose a threat to international peace as well
as regional security."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the U.S. air attack, involving
long-range cruise missiles, was made in response to Iraq's
continued defiance of U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the
airstrikes after reading the latest U.N. reports about
noncompliance by the Iraqis and consulting with his national
security staff.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Decides to Delay Impeachment Proceedings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Wednesday decided to briefly delay impeachment
proceedings against President Bill Clinton in connection with the
Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
Republicans are likely to convene the House on Thursday and
approve a resolution of support for military personnel, rather
than launch what had been scheduled as a historic debate over the
fate of the nation's 42nd president.
</P>
<P>
The House had been scheduled to start debate Thursday on four
articles of impeachment approved last week by the House Judiciary
Committee. They include two counts of perjury, one of obstruction
of justice and one of abuse of power in the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting on Capitol Hill, lawmakers said they
expect a delay of a few days, at most.
</P>
<P>
Many of them suggested that the military strikes taking place
against Iraq are politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
Congressman Steve Chabot said that the impeachment matter is
not going to be delayed "indefinitely."
</P>
<P>
"I anticipate we'll take it up over the weekend or early next
week," Chabot. He and other Republicans said that no firm date had
been set.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives' action came shortly after the
U.S. started airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
There was Republican skepticism all around about Clinton's
motives in ordering airstrikes, though.

<HEADLINE> Chronology of U.S. Strikes on Iraq Since Gulf War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States launched
airstrikes, codenamed "Operation Desert Fox," against Iraq on
Thursday following a U.N. report on Baghdad's lack of cooperation
with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The operation were set to be the heaviest since it led
"Operation Desert Storm" to oust Iraqi troops from Kuwait in the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The previous attacks were as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- January 17, 1993: The United States fired more than 40
Tomahawk cruise missiles at a factory near Baghdad suspected of
being linked to a secret nuclear arms program, after it acused
Iraq of establishing surface-to-air missile batteries in southern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
-- June 27, 1993: Two U.S. warships fired 24 Tomahawks at the
headquarters of Iraqi intelligence in reprisal for an alleged
plot to kill former U.S. president George Bush in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
-- July 24, 1993: After Iraqi radars locked on U.S. aircraft, a
U.S. warplane fired a missile at an anti-air positions in southern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
-- October 7, 1994: The United States sent aircraft carriers,
warplanes and 54,000 troops to the Persian Gulf following Iraq's
large-scale troop movements to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. Iraq
withdrew its forces from the border in pressure of U.S. threat of
attacks.
</P>
<P>
-- September 3-4, 1996: In retaliation for an Iraqi army
incursion into Kurdish areas in northern Iraq, the United States
fired cruise missiles at air defence installations, including
radar posts, surface-to-air missile batteries, and anti-aircraft
command and control posts in southern Iraq. The missiles, fired
from warplanes and ships in the Gulf region, left five dead and 19
injured, Iraq said.
</P>
<P>
1997-98
</P>
<P>
After Iraqi President Saddam Hussein decided in October 1997 to
expel US arms inspectors working for the United Nations, the
United States built up an armada in the Gulf to strike Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The showdown was defused in February 1998 by U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan who clinched a last-minute deal in Baghdad
opening the gates of presidential sites to U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
But in October, Iraq broke off all cooperation with UNSCOM, and
only once U.S. bombers were in the air did Baghdad agree to
unconditional resumption of U.N. weapons inspections.

<HEADLINE> China Has Huge Diamond Trade Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Local and foreign sources have
forecast that China's annual diamond sales can be expected to
reach 20 billion yuan by 2000, making the country the world's
third largest diamond market, after the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The British De Beers, the world's renowned diamond supplier,
is singled out for making the forecast by the International
Business News published here.
</P>
<P>
This would mean a new diamond market with huge potential for
diamond suppliers worldwide, since China plans to open up its
diamond market, according to the British De Beers, the world's
renowned diamond supplier and experts.
</P>
<P>
With living standards improving rapidly, China has seen the
steady rise of its diamond trade, with domestic sales topping 3.75
billion yuan last year, up 13.6 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports of processed diamonds have increased to
some 100 million U.S. dollars at peak years.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, the country's leading commercial city, has over 90
local companies processing and marketing diamonds, compared with
only a handful five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government plans to exploit a broader overseas
market for local diamond products by aligning the industry
with international practice.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government plans to open a national
diamond exchange in Shanghai, which is now under construction.

BAGHDAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
on Thursday called on the Iraqi people to stand up to face "the
new round of U.S.-British aggression against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation, Saddam said that on early
Thursday, the U.S. and Britain, which he called "devils", launched
strikes against Iraqi targets, "as they have done in the past
eight years and as we expected."

Saddam said that the purpose of the U.S.-British strikes was to
"twist your great resolve and determination to fight for rights,
dignity and belief."
</P>

The Iraqi president said that Iraqi fighters were now under the
most difficult situation because "enemies are not fighting with
you face-to-face. Rather, they want to conquer us with their
modern weapons."

He called on the Iraqi people to fight and resist "the enemy of
Allah, the enemy of our nation and human being," saying that "with

<P>
NANNING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- People in Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, southwestern China, no longer frown at the
thought of having to travel somewhere with the improvement in
infrastructure construction especially in transportation in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
Liang Xianming, a regional government official, who often goes
on business trips, says that 10 years ago it took seven hours to
drive from the regional capital, Nanning, to Fangchenggang on the
South China Sea, and he had to stop for lunch along the way. But
now an expressway allows him to leave in the morning and return
home to Nanning for dinner.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has put 70 percent of the fixed assets
investment in transportation and telecommunications. From 1990 to
1997, the transportation sector got 16 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi shares a border with Viet Nam and has a long
coastline. River transport has a great deal of potential. Guangxi
has a 653-kilometer expressway under construction between major
cities like Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning, Beihai, and Fangchenggang.
</P>
<P>
All counties and 99.3 percent of the villages in Guangxi are
linked by the highway network.
</P>
<P>
Guigang terminal is being built. When it is completed,
1,000-ton boats will be able to go from Nanning to Guangzhou,
southern China's economic center.
</P>
<P>
According to the Guangxi Transportation Department, its major
ports are now better connected to inland areas and the railway
runs to the ports of Fangchenggang, Qinzhou, and Beihai.
</P>
<P>
The present annual handling capacity of Qinzhou is 14.44
million tons, and Fangchenggang's was 6.5 million tons last year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Airstrikes on Iraqi Military Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Wednesday that airstrikes on Iraq was ordered on "military
and security" targets.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the attacks are aimed at Iraq's weapons programs
and its capacity to attack its neighbors. He said the military
strike is designed to protect the security of the United States,
and the interests of Americans and people around the world.
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with weapons of mass destruction, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he decided weeks ago to give Saddam Hussein one
last chance to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
But he said U.N. inspectors report that Iraq has failed to
cooperate and has in fact placed new restrictions on weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Clinton noted the weapons inspectors weren't able to do their
job. He said even if they were to stay, it would be a "sham." As
he put it, they haven't disarmed Saddam. Instead, he has disarmed
them, through his deceptions.
</P>
<P>
And Clinton, addressing the nation from the Oval Office, said
the situation in Iraq poses a "clear and present danger" to the
stability of the Persian Gulf and to people everywhere.
</P>
<P>
He said he ordered a "strong, sustained" series of airstrikes
that would send "a powerful message to Saddam: If you act
recklessly, you will pay a heavy price."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Wednesday
he had ordered more U.S. air and ground forces in the Gulf to deal
with the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said there would be no time limits, the attack against Iraq
would be carried out for as long as needed.
</P>
<P>
"Any use of force, as the president has indicated, involves
risk. To limit the risk to our troops and our allies, I am
ordering a sharp increase in our forces in the Gulf," Cohen told a
news conference at the Pentagon soon after the airstrikes began.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said Iraq should not misunderstand the U.S.
determination. "We have acted. We do not use force lightly and we
have not done so today."
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Henry
Shelton, said the operation employed U.S. Navy aircraft operating
from bases on land in the region and Tomahawk cruise missiles
launched from ships at sea.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was also deploying additional military forces to
Southwest Asia to bolster the already substantial military
presence in the Gulf region, the general said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also said Wednesday
that the purpose of the military strikes against Iraqi targets is
to degrade the military capacity of the Iraqi regime.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the State Department, Albright said Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's "capacity to develop and brandish such armaments
poses a threat to international security and peace that cannot be
ignored."
</P>
<P>
"One way or another, it must be countered. And degrading that
capacity is the purpose of the strikes on military targets in Iraq
that the president has ordered today," Albright told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
She indicated that "our quarrel is not with the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, we recognize that Iraqis have been the
primary victims of Saddam Hussein's failure to cooperate
internationally and his reign of terror domestically," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States took the lead in establishing a U.N. program
to meet the humanitarian needs of Iraqi civilians and supported
the expansion of that program earlier this year," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
She confirmed that she had consulted by phone with more than a
dozen of her counterparts of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Already deployed in the Gulf region are 24,100 U.S. military
soldiers; 22 ships, eight armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles; and
201 military aircraft, among them 15 Air Force B-52 bombers also
equipped with cruise missiles. The bombers are based on the Indian
Ocean island of Diego Garcia.

<HEADLINE> Australia Fully Support Air Strikes on Iraq: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Australia fully supports the
air strikes by the United States and Britain on Iraq Thursday
morning, which were inevitable and unavoidable, Australian Prime
Minister John Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said having seen the report of U.N. weapons inspection
chief Richard Butler on Iraq's failure to comply with U.N.
sanctions, he believed the U.S. and Britain were left with no
alternative.
</P>
<P>
"Now in those circumstances, regrettable though it may be - any
use of force is always to be regretted and is always a sad event -
I do not believe and the Australian government does not believe
that the United States and the United Kingdom have been left with
any alternative," Howard told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"This has been very much a case of it being unavoidable and
inevitable that if Iraq failed to comply with the earlier
undertakings then similar action to degrade Iraq's military
capacity ... would eventuate."

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reactions to U.S.-led Military Attacks on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-led air strikes
against Iraq on Wednesday have drawn mixed reactions from the
international community with China, Russia and France condemning
the action.
</P>
<P>
In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has
undertaken pains-taking efforts to seek peaceful solution to the
Iraqi crisis, said: "This is a sad day for the United Nations and
for the world," and "also a sad day for me personally."
</P>
<P>
This is the first response from Annan following the U.S. and
Biritish military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations Qin
Huasun said on Wednesday that China is opposed to the use of force
against Iraq. He said the use of force will not only have serious
consequences for the implementation of the Security Council
resolutions, but also pose a threat to international peace as well
as regional security.
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In Madrid, visiting Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
his government would demand at the U.N. Security Council an
immediate halt to the U.S. and British military action against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the attack would not only worsen the Iraqi crisis but
would also have serious international consequences."
</P>
<P>
France also expressed its regret over what it called the
"spiral" which has led to the military strikes by the United
States against Iraq Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry communique said that France also
regrets the serious consequences the strikes would inflict on the
Iraqi civilians.
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, the German government expressed the hope that the
U.S. strikes against Iraq will end quickly as soon as possibly.
</P>
<P>
German government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said Thursday the
federal government regretted that it had come to use military
measures.
</P>
<P>
Heye said that the international community have repeatedly
called on Iraq to comply fully with the resolutions of the
U.N.Security Council.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Wednesday evening that
Iraq must be degraded and diminished by military forces, after
U.S. and British forces attacked Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said his country
supports the U.S. and British air strikes on Iraq and urged
Baghdad to comply with U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard said the U.S. and British
attacks against Iraq was necessary due to "a total failure" by
Baghdad to honor its U.N. weapons inspections agreement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the strikes Wednesday
morning after reading the latest U.N. reports about noncompliance
by the Iraqis and consulting with his national security staff.

UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full

against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sad day for the United Nations, and for the

307 United Nations humanitarian workers who remain in the country,
and with all others whose lives are in danger.
</P>
<P>
It is also a very sad day for me personally. Throughout this
year, I have done everything in my power to ensure peaceful
compliance with Security Council resolutions, and so to avert the
use of force.
</P>
<P>
This has not been an easy or a painless process. It has
required patience, determination and the will to seek peace even
when all signs pointed to war. However daunting the task, the
United Nations had to try as long as any hope of peace remained. I
deeply regret that today these efforts have proved insufficient.
</P>
<P>
What has happened cannot be reversed. Nor can any of us foresee
the future. All we know is that tomorrow, as yesterday, there
will be still an acute need, in Iraq and in the wider region, for
humanitarian relief and healing diplomacy. In both these tasks,
the United Nations will be ready, as ever, to play its part."

<HEADLINE> China Steps up Efforts to Salvage Underwater Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Museum of Chinese History
has created a submarine archaeological research team, the first of
its kind, in the city of Ningbo City in east China's Zhejiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
As a major ancient Chinese commercial port, Ningbo played an
important role in maritime trade between China and many countries
worldwide during the Tang (618-907), Song (960-1279), Yuan
(1271-1368) and Ming (1368-1644) dynasties, said an archaeological
official.
</P>
<P>
According to historical documents, the port of Ningbo was the
starting point for many ships carrying silk and porcelain
articles to Japan and other Asian countries during the Ming Dynasty,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Many of these ships foundered near the port in the East China
Sea, where 230 pieces of historical relics including porcelain
objects and parts of sunken ships were salvaged by Chinese
archeologists this summer, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new submarine research team will map out a plan to salvage
other sunken ships and historical relics from the sea near the
port, he added.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Implement Austerity Policy Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso on Wednesday pledged that no matter what the
consequences, the government would implement an austerity policy
to slash the country's financial deficit.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso also predicted that difficult times are ahead for his
country next year.
</P>
<P>
The statement to private businessmen was seen as an answer to
the demands of some business sectors and labor unions' request
Wednesday for changes in his austerity policy.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso's pledge follows the approval of a rescue package
negotiated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World
Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the world's
20 wealthiest countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the package, Brazil will receive 41.5
billion dollars worth of aid in the next three years. It has
already received a first installment of 5 billion dollars to prop
up the country's foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
The dwindling reserves which were down to 40 billion dollars

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives on Wednesday decided to briefly delay impeachment
proceedings against President Bill Clinton in connection with the
Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
The House was scheduled to start debate Thursday on four
articles of impeachment approved last week by the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting on Capitol Hill, lawmakers said they
expect a delay of a few days, at most.
</P>
<P>
Many of them suggested that the military strikes taking place
against Iraq are politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
Congressman Steve Chabot said that the impeachment matter is
not going to be delayed "indefinitely".
</P>
<P>
"I anticipate we'll take it up over the weekend or early next
week," Chabot. He and other Republicans said that no firm date had
been set.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives' action came shortly after the
U.S. started airstrikes against Iraq.

<P>
BEIJING, December 17 (Xinhua) -- China today condemns the
U.S. airstrikes against Iraq and requests the U.S. to stop its
military action "immediately", said an official from the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The response came after the UN Security Council's emergency
consultations on Iraq just adjourned and shortly after the
U.S. began airstrikes against Iraq at 0:49 a.m. local time (21:49
GMT) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The source, who asked not to be named, told Xinhua by telephone
that that Chinese government has time and again opposed the use of
force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, China's Permanent Representative to the UN, said,
"The use of force will not only have serious consequences for the
implementation of the Security Council resolutions, but also pose
a threat to international peace as well as regional security."
</P>
<P>
Qin said the U.N. Special Commission in charge of dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction led by Richard Butler should
have consulted the council before it withdrew its arms inspectors
from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports claimed that the U.S. air attack, involving
long-range cruise missiles, was made in response to Iraq's
continued defiance of U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
U.S. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Bill
Clinton ordered the strikes after reading the latest U.N. reports
about noncompliance by the Iraqis and consulting with his national
security staff.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China is opposed to the
use of force against Iraq, Chinese Permanent Representative to the
United Nations Qin Huasun said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the use of force will not only have serious
consequences for the implementation of the Security Council
resolutions, but also pose a threat to international peace as well
as regional security.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the disagreement between UNSCOM and Iraq could be
resolved through dialogue and consultations.
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction led by Richard
Butler should have consulted the council before it withdrew its
arms inspectors from Iraq.

<P>
He said council members were disappointed about the UNSCOM
report. "The report is apparently one-sided and does not reflect
the complete picture on the ground," he said.
</P>

Qin's remarks came after the council's emergency consultations

<HEADLINE> Air Strikes May Lead to Humanitarian Disaster in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- An Australian aid agency
warned Thursday of a potential humanitarian catastrophe in Iraq in
the wake of Thursday morning's air strikes by the United States
and Britain against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Robert Yallop, director of CARE Australia's overseas
operations, who has recently returned from Iraq, said the effect
of the bombings, coupled with existing damage to the country's
infrastructure, could see the humanitarian situation dramatically
exacerbated.
</P>
<P>
CARE Australia, a non-governmental aid agency, has a staff
around 15 aid workers operating in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Yallop, who set up CARE Australia's operation in Iraq shortly
after the Gulf War in 1991, said "it is clear the innocent will be
the ones most affected".
</P>
<P>
"I was in Iraq a few weeks ago and I saw with my own eyes the
continuing deterioration in the condition of the Iraqi people,"
Yallop said.
</P>
<P>
"I've seen babies that are born seriously underweight. I mean,
babies that have birth weights of a kilogram, children of three
and four years of age weighing anything from five to eight
kilograms."
</P>
<P>
"You actually wonder what the point of maintaining a sanctions
regime in that kind of context is."
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day, those who will suffer as a result of
this military intervention are those who have suffered over the
past eight years from the impact of the 1991 war, the sanctions
and so on," he said.
</P>
<P>
United States and Britain announced earlier Thursday their air
strikes against Iraq over Iraq's alleged failure of cooperation
with United Nations Special Commission on Arms Inspections.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government has not yet made any comment on the
strikes, and is expected to declare its support for U.S. and
Britain's military action as it did before.

<HEADLINE> Albright: U.S. Aims to Degrade Iraq's Military Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The purpose of the
U.S. military strikes against Iraqi targets is to degrade the
military capacity of the Iraqi regime, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the State Department, Albright said Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's "capacity to develop and brandish such armaments
poses a threat to international security and peace that cannot be
ignored."
</P>
<P>
"One way or another, it must be countered. And degrading that
capacity is the purpose of the strikes on military targets in Iraq
that the president has ordered today," Albright told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
She indicated that "our quarrel is not with the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, we recognize that Iraqis have been the
primary victims of Saddam Hussein's failure to cooperate
internationally and his reign of terror domestically."
</P>
<P>
"The United States took the lead in establishing a U.N. program
to meet the humanitarian needs of Iraqi civilians and supported
the expansion of that program earlier this year," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
She confirmed that she had consulted by phone with more than a
dozen of her counterparts of other countries.
</P>
<P>
"I've found broad understanding about the goals of our action,
because those goals have long had widespread support within the
international community," she added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, U.S. President Bill Clinton said at the
White House that airstrikes on Iraq were ordered on "military and
security" targets.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the attacks are aimed at Iraq's weapons programs,
and its capacity to attack its neighbors. He said the military
strike is designed to protect the security of the United States,
as well as the interests of Americans and people around the
world.

UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said late Wednesday that this is a sad day for the
United Nations and for the world.
</P>
<P>
Annan was responding to the U.S. military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Annan said, " My thoughts tonight are
with the people of Iraq, with the 307 Untied Nations
humanitarian workers who remain in the country, and with all
others whose lives are in danger."
</P>
<P>
"It is also a sad day for me personally. Throughout this
year I have done everything in my power to ensure peaceful
compliance with Security Council resolutions, and so to avert
the use fo force," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"This has not been an easy or a painless process. It has
required patience, determination and the will to seek peace even
when all signs pointed to war. However daunting the task, the
United Nations had to try as long as any hope of peace remained.
I deeply regret that today these efforts have proved
insufficient, " said Annan.
</P>
<P>
"What has happened cannot be reversed. Nor can any of us
foresee the future. All we know is that tomorrow, as yesterday,
there will be still an acute need, in Iraq and in the wider
region, for humanitarian relief and healing diplomacy. In both
these tasks, the United Nations will be ready, as ever, to play
its part," Annan added.

<HEADLINE> Canadian PM Expresses Support for Air Strikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien on Wednesday expressed support for U.S.-U.K. military
actions against iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein has brought this crisis on himself by following
deliberate strategy, at great cost to his country, of obstructing
the work of United Nations weapons inspectors in order to maintain
the basis of a weapons of mass destruction program," said Chretien
in a release.
</P>
<P>
"Canada had hoped that Iraq would live up to its commitments to
cooperate with UN inspectors, as it promised to do last month, "
he said.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, as UNSCOM's report to the Security Council on
December 15 stated, Iraq's conduct "ensured that no progress was
able to be made in either the fields of disarmament or accounting
for its prohibited weapons programs." he said.
</P>
<P>
It is "regrettable that Iraq chose not to live up to its
commitments," added the Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Chretien also noted that Canada will continue to support
U.N. and international humanitarian efforts, such as the Oil for
Food program, to help alleviate the hardships of the Iraqi
people.

<HEADLINE> Urgent  Cohen Vows to Continue Sanctions Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said Wednesday that the UN sanctions against Iraq
should continue until the dismantlement of Baghdad's weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
At a Pentagon press conference, Cohen acknowledged that U.S.
military strikes against Iraq could affect the U.N. Special
Commission's ability to inspect Iraq's weapons programs, but said
sweeping sanctions would remain in place.
</P>
<P>
The original sanctions, which prohibited all Iraqi exports and
required United Nations approval for imports, were intended to
force Iraq to eliminate all of its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
But after years of patchy cooperation from Iraqi authorities,
UNSCOM, the U.N. body supervising the arms controls, says it still
cannot certify banned weapons have been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
"We have given (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein every
opportunity to fully comply with the weapons regime," Cohen said.
"We do intend to keep the sanctions in place until there is full
compliance by the Iraqi government."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Continues Air Strike Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 17 (Xinhua) -- After the first waves of
"substantial" U.S. air strikes against Iraqi targets, Baghdad
appeared calm in the orange glow of road lamps mingled with wisps
of smoke caused by explosions.
</P>
<P>
Cars and ambulances were seen speeding on the empty roads and
extra police patrols have been deployed on the main streets
leading to the city center of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
There was no report of casualties, nor was there any official
Iraqi reaction to the sudden attack. The official news agency INA,
however, said President Saddam Hussein is expected to make a
speech to the nation in about an hour.
</P>
<P>
Foreign reporters were gathering at the Press Center for any
official information. Armed solders in front of the gate checked
every person entering the building.
</P>
<P>
Washington said the air strikes were against military and
security targets to "deplete and diminish" Saddam's capability to
threaten his neighbors and the world.
</P>
<P>
Some windows of civilian houses in Western Baghdad had been
broken by blasts caused by huge and ear-deafening explosions.
Experts here said that the attack involves long-range cruise
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Missiles had been seen dropping in the direction of the one of
the presidential palace in Baghdad - the Radawaniya presidential
palace.
</P>
<P>
A huge smoke volume could be seen from the Mansur District in
the city center and flames also can be seen in the direction of
the Saddam International Airport.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the White House Spokesman Joe Lockhart said that
U.S. President Bill Clinton had ordered the strikes Wednesday
morning after reading the latest U.N. report on the noncompliance
by the Iraqis and consulting with his national security staff.
</P>
<P>
"At the direction of the president, the U.S. military forces
have launched a substantial military strike against Iraq,"
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
There seemed a great deal of criticism of the timing of the
attack. Many believe the attack was launched at least partly to
save Clinton from an imminent impeachment in the House for
perjury, obstruction of justice and misuse of power.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military action has been immediately supported by
Britain. British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Wednesday night
that he had authorized British participation in an attack on Iraq
minutes before.
</P>
<P>
He said that "British involvement will be significant" in the
attack, codenamed "Operation Desert Fox."
</P>
<P>
Blair accused Iraq of "constant lies, prevarication and
breaching of agreed conditions."
</P>
<P>
The attack came just one day after the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq pulled out all its staff
from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler has accused Iraqi regime of not
cooperating with the commission in its inspections of suspected
sites as promised about one month ago.
</P>
<P>
Washington's swift action, without warning, appeared to be
designed to prevent Saddam from getting off the hook again.
</P>
<P>
On October 31, Baghdad announced suspension of all cooperation
with U.N. weapons inspectors in an attempt to bring about an early
lifting of U.N. sanctions, thus triggering a standoff with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Under U.S. military threat, President Saddam Hussein backed off
at the last minute by pledging unconditional resumption of
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors on November 14. The move
narrowly spared the country of a punishing U.S. air attack.

<HEADLINE> Text of Annan Statement on U.S. Military Action Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full
text of a statement by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Wednesday night in his first response to U.S. military action
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sad day for the United Nations, and for the
world. My thoughts tonight are with the people of Iraq, with the
307 United Nations humanitarian workers who remain in the country,
and with all others whose lives are in danger.
</P>
<P>
It is also a very sad day for me personally. Throughout this
year, I have done everything in my power to ensure peaceful
compliance with Security Council resolutions, and so to avert the
use of force.
</P>
<P>
This has not been an easy or a painless process. It has
required patience, determination and the will to seek peace even
when all signs pointed to war. However daunting the task, the
United Nations had to try as long as any hope of peace remained. I
deeply regret that today these efforts have proved insufficient.
</P>
<P>
What has happened cannot be reversed. Nor can any of us foresee
the future. All we know is that tomorrow, as yesterday, there
will be still an acute need, in Iraq and in the wider region, for
humanitarian relief and healing diplomacy. In both these tasks,
the United Nations will be ready, as ever, to play its part."

Clinton noted the weapons inspectors weren't able to do their

<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S. Strikes Iraq to Degrade Its </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States launched
airstrikes against Iraq Wednesday to degrade the latter's ability
to make and to use weapons of mass destruction and to diminish its
ability to wage war against its neighbors, said U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
"And we want to demonstrate the consequences of flouting
international obligations," Cohen said at the Pentagon Wednesday
evening soon after U.S. military forces began the attacks.
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein has been an outlaw for some time. In the
1980s, he used chemical weapons against Iran and against his own
Kurdish minority. In 1990 he invaded Kuwait. In 1991 he fired
Scud missiles at his neighbors," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
He said, at the end of the Gulf War, the United Nations
Security Council demanded that Iraq fully disclose and dismantle
its program to build deadly biological, chemical and nuclear
weapons and the missiles to deliver them. But Saddam has used a
combination of denials, deceptions and delays to evade Security
Council mandates.
</P>
<P>
"At nearly every turn, Iraq has chosen obstruction over
openness, and confrontation over cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the strikes Wednesday
morning after reading the latest U.N. reports about noncompliance
by the Iraqis and consulting with his national security staff.
</P>
<P>
"At the direction of the president, the United States military
forces have launched a substantial military strike against Iraq,"
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
The attack involved long-range cruise missiles, military
officials here said.
</P>
<P>
Later, Clinton said airstrikes on Iraq were ordered on "military
and security" targets.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Defeats Egypt in Mandela Challenge Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's national
soccer team, Bafana Bafana, beat Egypt 2-1 Wednesday to win the
Nelson Mandela Inauguration Challenge title in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Captain Hossam Hassan scored the first goal at the 34th
 minute with a perfect finish, only to be equalized by South
Africa's striker Benedict McCarthy six minutes later.
</P>
<P>
At the 74th minute, McCarthy scored his second goal with a
header when the South Africans got a freekick at the edge of the
box.
</P>
<P>
The match, which was seen as a revenge of Bafana on the
Pharoahs, also gave Trott Moloto his first win as new Bafana
coach.
</P>
<P>
Bafana was defeated by the Egyptians at the African Nations
Cup in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Before the match, South Africa officially launched its bid to
the 2006 World Cup and unveiled its bid logo -- a football with a
sketch of Africa at the center.
</P>
<P>
South African Sports Minister Steve Tswete said: "We have the
infrastructure, we have the facilities, we have the technology,
we have the capacity and we have the will to do justice to the
biggest sports event on earth."
</P>
<P>
"FIFA (Federation of International Football Associations) can
be assured that a World Cup in South Africa will be a unique and
qualified success."
</P>
<P>
"Give us the World Cup, and we will surprise you to an even
greater degree," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A late equaliser by Gianfranco
Zola gave Chelsea a point in a match against Manchester United at
the English Premier League on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zola played a neat one-two with Uruguayan substitute Gustavo
Poyet before neatly clipping the ball over the advancing Peter
Schmeichel with only eight minutes left to continue Chelsea's
record of losing only twice at Old Trafford in their last 24
league games.
</P>
<P>
The classy strike cancelled out Andy Cole's opener which was
the highlight of a dire first period that saw referee Graham
Barber hand out five yellow cards -- all to Chelsea players.
</P>
<P>
Cole capitalised on some loose defending in the visitor's box
to drill home a low effort past Ed De Goey's right hand after
Nicky Butt's shot had hit his feet and bounced kindly for the
United forward.
</P>
<P>
United stay second in the league with 31 points, two behind
Aston Villa. Chelsea are third on 30.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Orders More U.S. Forces to Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said on Wednesday he had ordered more U.S. air and
ground forces to the Gulf to help in the military strikes against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the attack would be carried out for as long as needed
and there would be no time limit.
</P>
<P>
"Any use of force, as the president has indicated, involves
risk. To limit the risk to our troops and our allies I am ordering
a sharp increase in our forces in the Gulf," Cohen said at the
Pentagon soon after the United State began air strikes against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said Iraq should not misunderstand the United States'
determination. "We have acted. We do not use force lightly and we
have not done so today."
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Henry
Shelton, said the operation employed U.S. Navy aircraft operating
from land bases in the region and Tomahawk cruise missiles
launched from ships at sea.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was also in the process of deploying additional
military forces to Southwest Asia to bolster the already
substantial military presence in the Gulf region, the general said.
</P>
<P>
Already in the Gulf region are: 24,100 U.S. military men and
women; 22 ships, eight armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles; and
201 military aircraft, among them 15 Air Force B-52 bombers also
equipped with cruise missiles. The bombers are based on the Indian
Ocean island of Diego Garcia.
</P>
<P>
One aircraft carrier battle group is in the Gulf and another is
on its way.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also said the purpose of the airstrikes against Iraq on
Wednesday was to degrade its ability to make and to use weapons of
mass destruction and to diminish its ability to wage war against
its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"And we want to demonstrate the consequences of flouting

UNITED NATIONS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China is opposed to the
use of force against Iraq, Chinese Permanent Representative to the
United Nations Qin Huasun said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the use of force will not only have serious
consequences for the implementation of the Security Council
resolutions, but also pose a threat to international peace as well
as regional security.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the disagreement between UNSCOM and Iraq could be
resolved through dialogue and consultations.
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq", he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction led by Richard
Butler should have consulted the council before it withdrew its
arms inspectors from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said council members were disappointed about the UNSCOM
report. "The report is apparently one-sided and does not reflect
the complete picture on the ground," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qin's remarks came after the council's emergency consultations
on Iraq have just adjourned and shortly after the United States
began airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Butler reported late Tuesday that Iraq had failed to live up to
its promise to cooperate fully with the U.N. arms inspectors and
he ordered the inspectors to leave Baghdad immediately "for their
safety".

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair announced on Wednesday night the launch of Operation Desert
Fox against Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
"Earlier today, I gave authority for UK forces to be deployed
against Iraq," Blair said outside his Downing street office.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein as a "constant lier",
Blair said he had no option but act.
</P>
<P>
The strikes were aimed at degrading Saddam's capability to
build and use weapons of mass destruction, and diminish the
threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking every possible care to avoid civilian
casualties," he stressed, adding that the quarrel was not with
Iraqi people, but with Saddam" alone, and the evil regime which he
represents".
</P>
<P>
"There is no realistic alternative to military force. We are
taking this military action with real regret but also with real
determination. We have exhausted all other avenues," the Prime
Minister added.

LOS ANGELES, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A record 45.2 million
people in the United States expect to travel 100 miles or more
from home during the Christmas season, according to a survey
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
That figure represents a two percent growth over last year's
44.5 million travelers, said AAA, a non-profit federation of 93
clubs in the U.S. and Canada. Since 1990, Christmas-New Year
travel in the country has jumped 66 percent.

The survey found that 38 percent of travelers plan to visit a
city while another 31 percent expect to go to a town or rural
areas. Other popular destinations include beach, mountains,

<HEADLINE> Blair Says Iraq Must be Diminished by Military Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Wednesday evening that Iraq must be degraded and diminished
by military forces, after U.S. and British forces attacked
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Making a statement outside his Downing Street residence, he
said every care will be taken to avoid civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
"Earlier today, I gave authority for UK forces to be deployed
against Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
US and British forces launched a "substantial" attack on Iraq
on Wednesday, he confirmed, saying in a statement outside 10
Downing Street: "Operation Desert Fox was launched at 10pm London
time".
</P>
<P>
"We have no option but to act," Blair said, noting the strikes
were aimed at degrading Saddam's capability to build and use
weapons of mass destruction, and diminish the threat.
</P>
<P>
Attacking Saddam as a serial breaker of promises, Blair said
Britain had no quarrel with the Iraqi people and was taking every
possible care to avoid civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
"Our military actions are clear: to degrade the capability to
build a newest weapons of mass destruction, and to diminish the
military threat he poses to his neighbor. The targets chosen,
therefore, are targets connected with his military capabilities,
his weapons of mass destruction capacity, and his ability to
threaten his neighbors," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking every possible care to avoid civilian
casualties...Our quarrel is not with the Iraqi people. It's never
had been...Our quarrel is with him alone, and the evil regime
which he represents," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no realistic alternative to military force. We are
taking this military action with real regret but also with real
determination. We have exhausted all other avenues. We act because
we must," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no greater responsibility upon a prime minister
than to ask British servicemen to risk their lives for the sake of
peace and stability in another part of the world and I feel that
responsibility, tonight, profoundly.
</P>
<P>
"British involvement will be significant," he said. The Prime
Minister had earlier spoken to the commander of British forces in
the Gulf, Group Captain Rich Jones, and thanked troops for their
"bravery and professionalism".
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein has no intention of abiding by the agreements
he has made," he said. "Despite constant lies, prevarication and
breaching of the agreed conditions, the weapons inspectors carried
out their task, uncovering in the process vast evidence of weapons
of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
Blair said that last month, in calling off an air strike, the
UK and US had "made that last extra effort". After that, they had
warned there would be "no warnings, no wranglings" next time
Saddam Hussein broke his word: "We made the position crystal clear
to him and the entirety of the world community."
</P>
<P>
"Saddam has no intention whatever of keeping to his word. He is
a serial breaker of promises," he said. "The threat is now, and
it is threat to his neighbours, to his people and to the security
of the world."
</P>
<P>
Blair said that after more than a year of broken promises "we
have no option but to act". The military objectives were to
degrade the Iraqi leader's capability to build and use weapons of
mass destruction and to diminish the military threat he posed to
other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The targets chosen were connected with his military capability,
weapons of mass destruction capacity and his ability to threaten
his neighbours, Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Blair added: "There is no realistic alternative to military
force. We are taking military action with real regret but also
with real determination. We have exhausted all other avenues. We
act because we must."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government announced that MPs are to hold an
emergency Commons debate on Iraq on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Commons Leader Margaret Beckett told the House in a surprise
late-night statement on Wednesday that the scheduled business was
being changed in the light of representations over the worsening
crisis. Within an hour, the air strikes had begun.

<HEADLINE> Slower U.S. Economic Growth in 1999 Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 16 (Xinhua) -- As it enters its eighth
year of expansion, the U.S. economy will continue to grow in 1999,
although the pace will be slower than in recent years.
</P>
<P>
This prediction was made by a panel of noted economists
surveyed by the Bond Market Association which presents about 200
securities firms and banks in the United States. The Association's
Economic Advisory Committee also expects further easing by the
Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee and a 1999 unemployment
rate that remains below five percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
The Association said in a report Wednesday that the U.S. gross
domestic products will average a 2.1 percent growth rate in 1999,
as measured from the fourth quarter 1998 to the fourth quarter
1999. While that reflects a still growing economy, the Association
said, the rate is noticeably below the 3.4 percent GDP growth rate
the economists forecast for 1998.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, Merrill Lynch said Tuesday in a briefing that
its economists expects U.S. GDP growth to slow to 2 percent in
1999, down from 3.7 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
As for interest rates, the Association's Economic Advisory
Committee expects to see rates for the 30-year Treasury move down
to 4.75 percent by this time next year from the current monthly
average expected to close 1998 at 5.1 percent. The Federal Funds
will decline to 4.40 percent, down from the current monthly
average of 4.75 percent. Merrill Lynch, however, expects Fed funds
rates to be down to 4 percent by mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
Inflation remains in check with the panel projecting the
Consumer Price Index will increase by 2.0 percent in 1999, the
Association said, although that rate is higher than the
economists' forecast of 1.6 percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Association identifies the threat of deteriorating economic
conditions in Asia and Latin America as "a potentially serious
drag" on the U.S. economy. Consumer spending was also seen as a
potentially destabilizing force.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending has remained strong, the Association said,
but that has been spurred by strong equity valuations. However, if
consumer spending were to stall due to stock market problems of
concerns in other areas of the economy, U.S. growth could slow
abruptly.
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of the euro, the economic panel sees the
common currency as speeding the development of the European
capital markets, although the euro would not be a near-term rival
to the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency. Some economists at the
panel said the initial uncertainty of the new currency might drive
up interest rates in Europe and benefit U.S. markets.

</P>
<P>
Under U.S. military threat, President Saddam Hussein backed off
at the last minute by pledging unconditional resumption of
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors on November 14. The move
narrowly spared the country of a punishing U.S. air attack.

ANKARA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey hopes that the situation
in Iraq should become normal soon, a senior Turkish official said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry official, who asked not to be named, made
the remark soon after the United States began air strikes against
Iraq at 0:49 local time (21:49 GMT) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official said that "when the normalization in Iraq is not
secured, it is harmful not only to the people in Iraq, but also to
Turkey."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Iraq must comply with the resolutions of United
Nations Security Council," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Weighing Debate Plans Owing to Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Congressional leaders
said Wednesday they were considering whether impeachment debate on
President Bill Clinton should go ahead as scheduled on Thursday in
the event of air strikes against Iraq, but no decision had been
made.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt had met incoming speaker of
the House of Representatives Bob Livingston and they had agreed to
discuss the need for contingency plans at party caucus meetings
due later Wednesday, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
Earlier CNN reported that Congressional leaders had decided to
postpone the debate because of the latest confrontation with Iraq,
which was sparked by a new U.N. report accusing Baghdad of
refusing to cooperate with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, a Republican,
said the decision would depend on how long any strikes went on and
whether they were successful.
</P>
<P>
"It would be awkward to have an impeachment vote during a
bombing in Iraq," Hyde said after the closed meeting of House
Republican leaders. Later he told reporters no decision had been
made.
</P>
<P>
"This is just some rumor going around," said Michelle Davis,
spokeswoman for House Majority Leader Dick Armey, when asked if
the debate had been postponed.
</P>
<P>
The House is scheduled to open its second presidential
impeachment debate in history on Thursday. The leadership was
meeting later in the day to decide exactly how the debate and vote
would proceed.

WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said President Bill Clinton ordered the strikes
Wednesday morning after reading the latest U.N. reports about
noncompliance by the Iraqis and consulting with his national
security staff.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's order to strike Iraq was made because of Iraq's
continued failure to allow U.N. weapons inspections, Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
Military sources here said the attack began with long-range
cruise missiles and would last up to four days.
</P>
<P>
"At the direction of the president, the United States military
forces have launched a substantial military strike against Iraq,"
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton planned to address the nation on television Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott criticized the military
action even before it was formally announced.
</P>
<P>
"While I have been assured by administration officials that
there is no connection with the impeachment process in the House
of Representatives, I cannot support this military action in the
Persian Gulf at this time," his statement said.
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, top military officials put into action plans
that had been put on hold a month ago. The military planners
envisioned an attack lasting up to four days led by the cruise
missiles.
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokesman James Rubin read a long list
of U.S. grievances with Iraq that included barring inspection of
the office of the ruling Baath party, stripping suspect sites of
files and furniture and buzzing a U.N. helicopter.
</P>
<P>
"This is a grave matter," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"Both the timing and the policy are subject to question," he
said in a statement issued shortly before the sound of
anti-aircraft guns erupted over Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The House was scheduled to begin debate on four articles of
impeachment against Clinton on Thursday, with votes likely on
Friday. House leaders were discussing plans to postpone
impeachment votes in the event of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
The attack involved a series of cruise missile strikes against
large numbers of targets, said a senior military officer at the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"Time on target was 5:05," the officer said, indicating that
the attack was to have taken place at late afternoon Washington
time.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Wednesday announced the approval of disbursing about
957 million U.S. dollars for Indonesia to help the country to
overcome its economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the completion of the third review under the
Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Alassane D. Ouattara, Deputy
Managing Director of the international financial institution
noted, "the Indonesian economy has remained on the stabilization
path under the most difficult circumstances."
</P>
<P>
"Continued policy implementation, despite an environment of
political uncertainty, has helped improve market sentiment, and
the rupiah has strengthened considerably. Inflationary pressure
has eased and marked progress has been made in stabilizing the
food situation. There are also encouraging signs that business
confidence and the outlook for the real economy has begun to
improve," the IMF official said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ouattara also cautioned that Indonesia still faced
many challenges, "notably in restructuring the banking system and
the corporate sector."
</P>
<P>
The loan assistance is part of the IMF-led international aid
package totaling some 23 billion dollars for the crisis-ridden
country approved on October 31, last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) Wednesday announced the approval of the
first of its emergency structural adjustment loan equivalent to
2.5 billion U.S. dollars to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The resources will be utilized to help the country strengthen
the banking sector, deepen macroeconomic reforms and improve the
social safety net in such areas as education, health and
employment.
</P>
<P>
The loan, the largest single financing operation ever by the
IDB, is part of up to 9 billion dollar in emergency lending to
Latin America so far this year by the bank.
</P>
<P>
The IDB also approved a 350 million dollar emergency loan to
Colombia for reform of the energy sector, as well as a 250 million
dollar loan to Argentina for municipal reforms.
</P>
<P>
The emergency loans, to be disbursed in conjunction with
programs also supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees No Change of Course by Iraq on weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday it did not believe that Iraq would change course and
opt for cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"There is no end in sight for this pattern of obfuscation,
obstruction or outright violation," State Department spokesman
James Rubin told reporters. "We can find no grounds for optimism
that the Iraqi leadership, if left to its own devices, will
suddenly change course and opt for cooperation in the new year,
or, if it remains in power, in the new millennium."
</P>
<P>
Rubin described as "grave" the situation reported by UNSCOM
chairman Richard Butler who said Iraq had failed to fulfil a
pledge given one month ago not to hinder U.N. inspections of his
weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
Rubin's comment came as U.S. forces stood poised for a
possible attack on Iraq. But Rubin declined to discuss whether
President Bill Clinton might order a military strike, which the
president said could take place without further warning.
</P>
<P>
Asked what would happen next, he said: "Stay tuned." He said
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had discussed Iraq on the
telephone with several foreign ministers, including those from
Britain -- the closest U.S. ally in the Gulf -- France and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Rubin dismissed suggestions that the moves in Congress to
impeach Clinton over his conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair
might affect decision-making on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the current situation was determined by Iraq.
"The timing here is generated by iraq's failure to comply."

Lavinia Milosovici - Gina Gogean and Simona Amanar," Belu said.

Admitting the existence of blank spaces between championships,

championships in China and hopes for leading places both in the
team and the individual events."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Israel Heads Toward Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- After two and a half years
in office, the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is heading towards the beginning of its end.
</P>
<P>
Facing a critical no-confidence vote in the parliament which
he seems certain to lose next Monday, Netanyahu said Wednesday he
would initiate early elections if he could not muster a necessary
majority for his policy on the peace process with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Likud gathering, Netanyahu defended his
decision, which was reaffirmed by the cabinet Wednesday morning,
to suspend the pending troop withdrawal from the West Bank
stipulated by a recent land-for-peace deal over alleged
Palestinian violations.
</P>
<P>
He said his principal that Israel will not carry out its part
of the agreement until the Palestinians fulfill all their
obligations "is needed by Israel" and is "widely supported."
</P>
<P>
He called on coalition members and opposition members in the
parliament to support his decision. "If there is no necessary
majority to support this decision...I will initiate new elections
in order to get from the people the mandate," he said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were seen as a last bid to win back those
hardliners in his coalition who vowed to topple his government
and to form a unity government with the Labor Party before
being forced to initiate early elections.
</P>
<P>
But the last choice, early elections, seem to be Netanyahu's
only choice.
</P>
<P>
Some hardliners in his coalition, who were angered by his
signing of the Wye agreement with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and expressed support for early elections, would not
change their minds because of his remarks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu froze the troop withdrawal for two weeks and played
tough during U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to the region by
insisting the Palestinians meet new demands before Israel begins
troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
His muscle flexing is widely viewed as a gesture to woo the
hard-liners rebels, but they said they had seen too much such
performances before and were unimpressed this time.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Labor Party, which has been working to
advance early elections, will certainly not be interested in
rescuing the troubled prime minister from the brink of being
toppled.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak rejected Netanyahu's remarks
Wednesday quickly, repeating his call for early elections. He has
already called in three top media experts from the United States
to help him run for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
As he often did before, Netanyahu could still be able to buy
more time to stablize the coalition.
</P>
<P>
He could withdraw the no-confidence motion, which was put
forward by a coalition party last week in an attempt to avoid an
immediate defeat in a vote on an early elections bill, and
returned to where he was at that time -- facing a bill to dissolve
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
But since some hardliners were determined to end his
government, he might still lose many other no-confidence
votes. Many cabinet minister believe that the current government
could not hang on any longer.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts point out that it's actually in his interest if
Netanyahu initiate early elections himself since it would enable
him to be in charge of setting the elections timetable.
</P>
<P>
Some say the earlier he does this, the better his chances of
being reelected. Actually, when Netanyahu made a tough speech
Tuesday after a three-way summit with Clinton and Arafat at the
Erez border crossing, some said he had started his election
campaign already.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Surge with Prospects of Iraq Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) - Oil prices rose sharply on
Wednesday as a new row between Iraq and the United Nations over
weapons inspections threatened to trigger a military strike by the
United States against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Benchmark Brent blend futures closed 79 cents higher at 11.38
U.S. dollars a barrel after dipping last week to a lowly 9.60
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Prices soared after the United Nations ordered its weapons
inspectors to leave Baghdad following a report by chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler accusing Iraq of failing to restore
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defence Department officials in Washington said that a
military strike could come quickly.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, said
oil exports would have to stop if the U.S. launches military
strikes against his country, according to a Reuters report.
Despite the brewing crisis, industry sources said Iraqi oil sales
under the U.N.'s oil-for-food exchange continued as normal on
Wednesday, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
Oil monitors are in place at Iraq's Gulf port of Mina al-Bakr
and at the northern border with Turkey where a pipeline runs crude
to the Turkish Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
Dealers were also preparing for a meeting on Thursday of
ministers from OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries) producers Saudi Arabia and Venezuela and non-OPEC
Mexico, the main architects of agreements earlier this year among
producers to cut 3.1 million barrels per day from world supplies.
</P>
<P>
The supply curbs thus far have failed to revive a market
weighed down by a towering stockpile and failing demand.
</P>
<P>
Oil this year averaging 13.46 dollars a barrel, is at a 22-year
low and down from 19.30 dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Over Use of Sunscreen Increases Risk of Skin Cancer: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Heavy use of sunscreen
may encourage excessive exposure to the sun, thus increasing the
risk of skin cancer, the Washington Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 631 European schoolchildren conducted by European
researchers suggested that those with the highest use of sunscreen
were also the ones most likely to have moles caused by sun
exposure, a predictor for developing skin cancer later in life.
</P>
<P>
The researchers concluded that sunscreen use is linked to
developing the moles because the lotion may encourage
recreational sun exposure.
</P>
<P>
Fewer moles were found among those who regularly wore
protective clothing or who had less sun exposure, said the
researchers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Dips in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. industrial
production declined 0.3 percent in November for the fourth time in
six months, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The dip was largely attributed to last month's unseasonable
warmth and the economic slump that began in Asia last year.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the continued low mortgage rates, the country's
housing construction remained strong.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production decline in November, followed a 0.2
percent increase the previous month, according to the Federal
Reserve. That was due to a 3.4 percent plunge in utility output.
Warm weather reduced the demand for electricity and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing output was unchanged, as declines in production
of iron and steel, farm machinery, aircraft and autos offset
increases in computers, household appliances and construction
materials.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report released today, the Commerce Department
said builders started construction of new housing units at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.65 million, down 2.7 percent
from the previous month but still close to July's 11-year high of
1.70 million.
</P>
<P>
Apartment building recorded a steep drop but builders continued
to pour foundations for new single-family homes at a rapid rate.
</P>
<P>
November's decline in housing starts came entirely in
multi-unit buildings, down 26.4 percent to a rate of 298,000. In
contrast, single-family housing starts jumped 5 percent to a rate
of 1.35 million, the highest level since February 1984.
</P>
<P>
Even without December's results, 1998 already has proved to be
the busiest year for builders since 1987. During the first 11
months of the year, builders started 1.50 million units _ both
single-family and apartments. That compares with 1.47 million for
all of 1997 and 1.62 million during 1987.
</P>
<P>
Regionally in November, housing starts fell 5.6 percent in the
Northeast to an annual rate of 152,000, a six-month low. They were
also down in the Midwest, 7.2 percent to a rate of 324,000, and
the South, 6.5 percent to 772,000. But they jumped 12 percent to
401,000 in the West.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, building permits for housing, a leading indicator
of housing starts, fell 2.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.65 million.
