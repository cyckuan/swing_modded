<HEADLINE> 'X-Files' Creator Has 'Harsh Realm' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In what is considered a new golden age of  
television drama, Chris Carter has played a singular role -- and not 
entirely by design. 
</P>
<P>
	``The X-Files,'' which Carter created and which enters its  
seventh season Nov. 7, has become an entrenched cultural 
phenomenon, made stars out of David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson 
and likely will endure as a movie franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	But the series that deftly blended tales of aliens and the  
paranormal with dashes of poetry and humor hasn't proved easy to 
exploit. ``Touched by an Angel'' and ``7th Heaven,'' for example, 
have helped beget other wholesome family dramas such as 
``Providence''; the success of ``Dawson's Creek'' flooded TV with 
teen-obsessed series. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to capitalize on the ``X-Files'' essence, however, have  
foundered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dark Skies,'' ``Space: Above &AMP; Beyond'' and ``Strange Luck''  
are among the failed sci-fi series in recent years. Carter's own 
``Millennium,'' an eerie look at the battle between good and evil, 
couldn't fulfill its own milestone name; it ended last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Carter is venturing forth with another signature series,  
``Harsh Realm,'' debuting 9 p.m. EDT Friday on Fox. Among the 
Carteresque elements: A future imperiled by power-mad despots, a 
stalwart hero to fight them, a shifting reality to confound him and 
us. 
</P>
<P>
	There are even familiar faces. The chief villain, Gen. Omar  
Santiago, is played by Terry O'Quinn, who was featured on 
``Millennium,'' while that series' star, Lance Henricksen, makes a 
cameo appearance in the first episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Bairstow (``Party of Five,'' ``Significant Others'') plays  
Thomas Hobbes, a military hero who has faced the brutality of war 
in Sarajevo and now is eager to enter civilian life with his 
fiancee, Sophie (Samantha Mathis). 
</P>
<P>
	But he's got one last assignment, and it's a doozy -- test out  
the latest combat training toy, a computer simulation program named 
``Harsh Realm.'' Hobbes finds that's no understatement as he's cast 
adrift in a ``Mad Max''-like totalitarian world of desperation and 
lawlessness. Winning this virtual reality ``game'' is his only 
ticket out. 
</P>
<P>
	Suggest to Carter that the series possesses the dark, despairing  
soul and look of ``Millennium,'' and he begs to differ. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think so. It's a look into a possible future, but I  
think it's a bright look, a look at how you might influence or 
affect the future if you remain a good person,'' Carter said in an 
interview from Vancouver, British Columbia, where the series is 
filmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The writer-producer suggests that ``Harsh Realm'' fits in nicely  
with other movies and TV series that are recognizing Americans' 
thirst for social cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at war movies that are playing to big audiences; we want  
something that's going to bring us together. ... We have a need to 
work together, and this is a show that I think plays to those 
impulses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter sees elements of his trademark series in ``Harsh Realm.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I think what I'm doing here, as I've done on 'X-Files,' is  
creating romantic heroes in the literary sense,'' he said. That's 
classic literature, with Homer's ``The Iliad'' and ``The Odyssey'' 
and Joseph Conrad's ``Heart of Darkness'' cited as influences. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretty lofty for a series drawn from a comic book series (also  
called ``Harsh Realm''). Except for the virtual reality aspect, 
Carter says he has ditched most of the source material. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really not a science-fiction aficionado, so this is really  
just an opportunity to tell stories in a parallel world which 
presents a perfect and natural allegorical opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter is splitting his time between ``Harsh Realm'' and ``The  
X-Files,'' between Vancouver and Los Angeles, where the latter 
series moved after five years in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether this will be the last hurrah for ``The X-Files'' is  
unclear. Fox, which owns the show, will make that decision sometime 
early next year, Carter said. His contract, along with Duchovny's, 
ends after this season, with Anderson signed for another season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it is the final season or not, to be honest,''  
Carter said. ``As I always say, I want to make it the best season. 
So if it is or not, we're still going to do the same good work.'' A 
suit filed against 20th Century Fox Film Corp. by Duchovny, who 
claims Fox gave its own stations sweetheart deals on ``X-Files'' 
reruns that affected his profits, has not created problems on the 
set, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``David and I just co-wrote an episode together, so there's no  
tension for me,'' said the soft-spoken Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox could decide to continue the series (airing 9 p.m. EDT  
Sunday) without its creator's involvement. How would he feel about 
that? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to pretend to know what I would feel until I have  
to feel it,'' Carter replied, in an appropriately oblique 
``X-Files'' fashion. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....  
</P>
<P>
	AND STILL GROWING: The world's population is expected to reach  
an astounding 6 billion this month. To mark the occasion, and to 
examine what continued growth would mean, PBS is airing ``Six 
Billion and Beyond'' on Friday (check local listings). The 
hour-long documentary, narrated by actress Blythe Danner, looks at 
international attitudes toward population growth and how 
individuals, as well as countries, approach the issue.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Faces Zimbabwe at Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- If John McEnroe was hoping to ease into his new  
role as U.S. Davis Cup captain, he is taking the long route. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States was drawn Thursday to play at Zimbabwe in a  
potentially tricky first-round World Group match Feb. 4-6. The 
matches will be played in Harare, capital of the southern African 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough travel trip, but I like our chances,'' McEnroe  
said at a news conference in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	With the volatile McEnroe in charge and Andre Agassi back on the  
team, the Americans will be heavy favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zimbabwe, which upset Australia away from home in two years  
ago, has a strong veteran team led by brothers Byron and Wayne 
Black. And the Americans will have to cope with a long trip to an 
unfamiliar country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a very tricky first match for John,'' said Boris  
Becker, the former three-time Wimbledon champion who manages 
Germany's Davis Cup team. ``They will have to travel to Africa 
after the Australian Open. That will be hard on the players, and 
the Black brothers perform well under pressure. America has to play 
with its best team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe said he recently talked to Pete Sampras about playing.  
</P>
<P>
	Then he dropped to his knees with his hands clasped as in  
prayer, saying, ``Here's the nature of my talk with Pete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he realizes it's the right thing to do.'' McEnroe  
said. ``I think his priorities have shifted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe also noted that Todd Martin has indicated a desire to  
play and said he would like Jim Courier to consider playing 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think things are turning around in a positive way,'' McEnroe  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimbabwe's top tennis official described the pairing with the  
United States as a ``dream draw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be the biggest sporting event ever in Zimbabwe,''  
tennis federation president Paul Chingoka said. ``It can't get any 
bigger than this. Just think. A small nation like ours hosting a 
giant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The result of the match doesn't matter so much. Having  
McEnroe, Agassi and hopefully Sampras coming to town will have a 
huge impact on the development of tennis in Zimbabwe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The matches will be played on an indoor hard court at the  
5,000-seat City Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's already sold out,'' Chingoka said. ``The atmosphere will  
be electric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Davis Cup crowds in some countries can be rowdy and  
unruly, Chingoka said the Americans will have nothing to fear in 
Harare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zimbabwe is a sporting country,'' he said. ``The fans will  
applaud the Americans. They will never be hostile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Americans beat Zimbabwe, they will next face either  
Britain or the Czech Republic in the second round. That throws up a 
possible repeat of this year's thrilling first-round match at 
Birmingham, England, where the Americans, with Martin and Courier 
playing singles, beat Britain's Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The other leading countries in America's top half of the draw  
are Spain, which entertains Italy, and Russia, which plays at home 
against Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia, which beat the United States in this year's  
quarterfinals, plays France in the final at Nice Dec. 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australians will open next year's competition in  
Switzerland, Germany will be at home against the Netherlands, 
France will play in Brazil, and Slovakia entertains Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe was appointed U.S. captain last month, capping a long  
campaign to be put in charge of the team. He succeeded Tom 
Gullikson, who captained the team for six years but bore the blame 
for the U.S. defeat to Australia in suburban Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe is one of America's most successful Davis Cup players,  
compiling an overall record of 59-10 and playing on five 
championship winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the draw, McEnroe got a boost when Agassi  
announced he would play in the first round. Agassi, who is back at 
No. 1 in the world rankings after winning the French Open and U.S. 
Open this year, had vowed earlier this year never to play Davis Cup 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, who has had a history of run-ins with the U.S. Tennis  
Association, changed his mind when McEnroe was appointed, 
announcing at the U.S. Open that he would play Davis Cup next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to be the best captain ever so far,''  
Agassi said. ``He'll bring a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of energy, a 
lot of experience. It's an advantage to have someone on your team 
with his kind of fighting spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras has been sidelined with a herniated disc in his back, an  
injury which forced him to pull out of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe said he would not put himself on the team to play  
doubles, ``unless I cannot get anybody to go to Zimbabwe.''

<HEADLINE> Cycling Wants Pre-Race Drug Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERONA, Italy (AP) -- Faced with growing costs of largely  
ineffective anti-drug tests, the International Cycling Union will 
place more emphasis on prerace medical controls, the governing 
body's president said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hein Verbruggen, speaking after an ICU congress at the World  
Championships, said the difficulty in catching drug cheats was ``a 
major problem'' for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must reflect on the great number of cases undetected by  
anti-doping tests, which are very costly,'' Verbruggen said. ``In 
the future we must give more emphasis to medical controls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-drug tests, mainly from urine samples, cost the ICU $2.7  
million a year -- money he said would be better spent on blood tests 
that measure the red blood cell count. 
</P>
<P>
	A high count can occur naturally, but also signal the use of the  
banned growth hormone EPO. Under ICU rules, a cyclist can be kept 
out of competition for at least two weeks -- officially, in an 
effort to safeguard the athlete's health -- if the red blood cell 
level exceeds 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A cyclist from Moldova was banned from Wednesday's elite men's  
time trial at the championships following a prerace blood test. 
</P>
<P>
	The most prominent rider sidelined this year was 1998 Tour de  
France and Giro d'Italia champion Marco Pantani. He was kicked out 
of the Giro in June, hours before the start of the next-to-last 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Verbruggen said the ICU wants to standardize testing procedures  
around the world as of January, but it will not object if national 
Olympic committees or cycling federations choose to independently 
adopt more stringent testing policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Luckily the popularity of our sport continues to be very  
good,'' he said, ``and let's hope that the problem of doping is 
going to vanish in the coming years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues, Verbruggen said:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The International Olympic Committee has authorized the ICU to  
administer blood tests on cyclists at next year's Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ICU members are divided over whether to drop caffeine and  
other light stimulants from the list of banned substances. In the 
coming months, an ICU commission will discuss the possibility of 
handing offenders a warning rather than an immediate suspension for 
such substances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want two extra cups of coffee to influence multistage  
races such as the Giro d'Italia, Tour of France or Vuelta,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- By the end of January, the ICU will decide whether to erase  
all of the sport's standing world records to start the millennium 
with a clean slate.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The Associated Press erroneously reported Oct.  
5, in an obituary about U-Haul International Inc. founder Leonard 
S. Shoen, that the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection as a result of a 1995 court judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, neither Phoenix-based U-Haul International Inc. nor its  
holding company, Reno, Nev.-based Amerco Inc., filed for bankruptcy 
protection. Five directors of Amerco Inc. sought personal 
bankruptcy protection after they were ordered to pay a $461 million 
judgment stemming from an family battle over control of the 
company.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Inside the sprawling brick church, Pastor Arthur  
Brazier approaches the pulpit. Some 3,500 parishioners pack the 
plush red pews in the regal amphitheater, swaying and singing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stragglers, late after scrambling for a spot in one of the  
church's four parking lots on a desolate commercial strip, squeeze 
into balcony seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here, we don't bring the Scripture down to our level,'' the  
78-year-old pastor declares. ``Here, we rise to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The congregation erupts with a chorus of amens and applause.  
</P>
<P>
	As Brazier scans the sea of faces, the reality is inescapable:  
the 100-member congregation he took over in 1960 is all grown up. 
The Apostolic Church of God now has more than 14,000 members and a 
multimillion-dollar budget. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago and around the country, the black megachurch has  
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Megachurches, defined as those that draw more than 2,000  
visitors each Sunday, first attracted national attention in the 
mid-1990s. Predominantly white churches were noticed first. But in 
1997, the last time attendance was compared, two black megachurches 
were the fastest-growing in the country, says John Vaughan of 
Church Growth Today, a research center in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, there are at least 60 black megachurches. The  
largest, in or near Chicago, Baltimore, New Orleans, Los Angeles 
and Atlanta, boast memberships between 8,000 and 24,000. With 
donations from their mostly middle-class members, many are building 
at record pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, they hold two to three Sunday services, and the two  
largest have built sanctuaries that seat 8,000 and 10,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the explosive growth?  
</P>
<P>
	``African-Americans have moved into the middle class, and  
they're not finding Shangri-La,'' Brazier says. ``They are 
beginning to realize that material gain doesn't give you everything 
you need. There is something missing for a lot of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adds Raymond Laseter, an Apostolic member: ``People are catching  
hell outside the church. They're looking for something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the current boom began in the 1980s, large black churches  
flourished from the end of the 19th century through the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	In African-American history, black megachurches are not new;  
they flourished from the end of the 19th century through the 1930s. 
But experts say the current boom, which started in the 80s and took 
off in the 90s, is unique. 
</P>
<P>
	``The megachurch is more than a church with a huge attendance,''  
says Scott Thumma, a sociologist at the Hartford Seminary in 
Connecticut. ``Megachurches offer a unique way of being religious 
in modern society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks as well as whites flocking to megachurches, extending the  
concept of comparison shopping to the spiritual world. After 
shopping around, both groups are drawn to the lively services, 
inspirational pastors and the ``message of action and empowerment'' 
in the megachurches, Thumma says. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks diverge, though, on the social end. Many middle-class  
churchgoers, increasingly distant from black urban life, are 
looking for ways to connect with other blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Holly, a member of an Afrocentric megachurch in Chicago,  
sought out Trinity United Church of Christ after growing weary of 
living and working in places where he was one of the only black 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Many blacks are also seeking out churches that work to rebuild  
the neighborhoods that some members left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Churches are the ones that are going to bring about the  
changes,'' says Brenda Sampson, 50, an Apostolic member. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, her congregation will spend over $500,000 to  
encourage community development and feed the hungry in its 
distressed South Side neighborhood. Outside the church, Brazier 
founded two groups that develop housing and commerce near the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	When people like Sampson and Holly find the right mix of  
qualities, ``they don't ask if they're at grandma's Baptist 
church,'' says Robert Franklin Jr., president of the 
Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The traditional black Methodist and Baptist church, Brazier  
says, was a turnoff for many. 
</P>
<P>
	``The music is classical, folks are quiet and there are few  
hallelujahs and amens,'' Brazier says. ``They get bored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many blacks rejected those churches during the civil rights  
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many saw their old churches as highly moralistic places that  
had a guilt-inducing quality,'' Franklin says. ``They were insular 
and didn't talk much about transforming the world or serving the 
poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their place, several megachurch styles have evolved. Some are  
Afrocentric. Others offer ``theological nationalism,'' which Dwight 
Hopkins of the University of Chicago Divinity School describes as 
``something positive about black folks coming together in their own 
style.'' A few, like Brazier's, take a more traditional approach 
toward Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	Most share several fundamentals. They tend to emphasize  
spirituality above all else and preach a conservative theology, 
though the majority take more liberal views on social and political 
issues, Thumma says. 
</P>
<P>
	Most black megachurch leaders also recognize that their members  
crave practical as well as spiritual guidance. The result is a 
seven-day-a-week church with programs covering everything from 
single parenting and Bible study to AIDS education. 
</P>
<P>
	On a typical Tuesday night at Apostolic, about 100 cars are  
parked in the lots. Inside, past signs advertising a health fair 
and a ``marriage night out,'' sounds of a choir practice fill the 
120,000-square-foot building. 
</P>
<P>
	Upstairs is the men's ministry. In an austere classroom, about  
25 men in their 20s and 30s, give their all to God. Equipped with 
dog-eared Bibles and T-shirts that read, ``Apostolic Man, Saved and 
Kept by God's Power,'' the group spends two hours reading 
Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need a 40-ouncer (malt liquor) and Jesus Christ,'' leader  
Ronald Smith cries out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need some crack cocaine and Jesus Christ,'' he follows.  
</P>
<P>
	``But just give me Jesus Christ.''  
</P>
<P>
	With a roar, the men belt out a final call: ``Amen!''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Spent $13M on Microsoft Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In its first public accounting of the money  
the government has spent prosecuting the Microsoft Corp., the 
Justice Department said its landmark antitrust trial and earlier 
legal actions against the software giant cost it $13.3 million over 
the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure includes about $7 million investigating and suing  
Microsoft in the trial pending before U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson, described as among the most significant business 
lawsuits in decades. The first phase of a two-part verdict could 
come as early as this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts described the $7 million as paltry compared with the  
expense of other major antitrust cases, where costs easily can run 
$750,000 each month. Justice opened its current case in June 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's really rather modest for a case that has been as hard  
fought as this one has, with the caliber of lawyers and economists 
they've put on,'' said Tyler Baker, a Dallas antitrust lawyer who 
has been following the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc., for example, spent $20  
million over 10 months unsuccessfully fighting antitrust enforcers 
to allow its merger in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department last year asked the judge to force  
Microsoft to reimburse its legal costs, but the agency typically 
doesn't ask for attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they succeed on the merits ... it wouldn't be uncommon for  
the judge to order Microsoft to reimburse the costs,'' said Joe 
Sims, an antitrust lawyer in Washington and former senior Justice 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also acknowledged it's paid economists and other  
experts outside the government for advice on how to punish 
Microsoft if the company were to lose the case, but refused to 
identify them or their pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also revealed it has spent $194,140 for public  
relations, including $147,381 for publishing court documents and 
other information about the case on its Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's disclosures came in response to a written  
demand from U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, a Republican from Microsoft's 
home state of Washington. The figures did not include amounts paid 
by the 19 states suing the company along with Justice; attorneys 
general in those states have denied requests for such information. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton has been a close ally of Microsoft in its current legal  
fight and earlier this year predicted the company might lose 
because he said Jackson is a ``second- or third-rate judge.'' The 
senator said he regretted the remark after his comments were 
published in newspapers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, the world's largest software company with $19.7  
billion in sales this year, hasn't disclosed its own legal fees and 
declined comment. But the company's financial records showed 
``general and administrative expenses,'' which include its lawyers' 
fees, were $689 million this year, up 59 percent from last year's 
costs of $433 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even imagine what Microsoft is spending,'' said George  
Cary, an antitrust lawyer in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also is involved in high-profile litigation against  
Sun Microsystems Inc. in California and against Caldera Inc. in 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	In its federal antitrust case, Microsoft is using both in-house  
lawyers and attorneys from New York-based Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell. In 
financial papers, Microsoft blamed its increases in administrative 
expenses partly on ``higher legal fees, litigation costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fees paid to Justice attorneys are significantly less. Lead  
lawyer David Boies, hired from private practice, initially agreed 
to half his $250 hourly rate, then agreed to a $104,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure (the government's bill) is a small fraction of what  
Microsoft paid its lawyers in that period,'' said Kevin Arquit, a 
New York antitrust lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're defending the antitrust equivalent of a capital  
murder case, you're not likely to be pinching pennies,'' Sims 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Zuck, director of the Association for Competitive  
Technology, a trade group that includes Microsoft, said the 
government's spending bodes ill for the nation's high-tech 
industry: ``If ... it's this cheap to do it, we could be awash in 
lawsuits and really grind the industry to a halt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government opposed Microsoft's merger with Intuit Inc. early  
in the 1990s and negotiated a consent decree with the software 
giant in a related antitrust lawsuit in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 3, Rangers 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- This is the reason Joe Torre insisted the New  
York Yankees keep Andy Pettitte. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte, once again proving he's at his best in the biggest  
games, took his turn at shutting down Texas as the Yankees beat the 
Rangers 3-1 Thursday night for a 2-0 lead in their AL division 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Gonzalez homered in the fourth, ending the Rangers'  
postseason scoreless streak at 25 innings. But that was all they 
managed in 7 1-3 innings against Pettitte, the left-hander New York 
nearly dealt away at the July 31 trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Ledee's tiebreaking double in the seventh off loser Rick  
Helling and a bases-loaded walk to pinch-hitter Jim Leyritz in the 
eighth put the Yankees one win away from their second consecutive 
3-0 sweep of Texas in the opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series champions will try to finish it Saturday night  
at Texas when Roger Clemens pitches against Esteban Loaiza. 
</P>
<P>
	No surprise, it was Pettitte who put them in position to advance  
to the next round. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte almost missed out on this party when the Yankees came  
close to trading him to Philadelphia more than two months ago. At 
the time, Pettitte was struggling at 7-8 and seemed distracted, 
possibly by his father's heart problems back in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But Torre, with help from general manager Brian Cashman,  
convinced owner George Steinbrenner not to make the deal. 
Steinbrenner agreed, and challenged Pettitte to ``show what kind of 
man he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since, Pettitte backed up his manager's confidence. And  
against Texas, he looked every bit as focused as the pitcher who 
won the clinching Game 4 of last year's World Series and the 
crucial Game 5 of the 1996 Series against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte gave up one run and seven hits in 7 1-3 innings,  
walking none and striking out five. 
</P>
<P>
	Every Yankees infielder rushed to the mound to offer pats of  
congratulations to Pettitte when Torre brought in reliever Jeff 
Nelson. Pettitte received a standing ovation from the crowd of 
57,485 -- a stark contrast to the rude treatment the fans gave him 
earlier this year -- and he responded with an enthusiastic wave of 
his cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson struck out Ivan Rodriguez and Gonzalez, and Mariano  
Rivera pitched the ninth for a save. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Brosius, MVP of the 1998 World Series, hit a tying double  
in the fifth for his first hit of his postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	New York got the one more run it needed in the seventh after  
Tino Martinez led off with a walk and took third on Chili Davis' 
single. Ledee, a World Series hero last year but sent to the minors 
early this season, delivered a fly-ball double to right-center for 
a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz drew his bases-loaded walk in the eighth from Mike  
Venafro. 
</P>
<P>
	After being blanked 8-0 in Game 1, the Rangers rewarded Gonzalez  
with exuberant high-fives after he reprised his role as a 
Yankees-killer with a line-drive homer into the left-field stands 
in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez put on incredible power show in the 1996 playoff series  
against New York with five home runs, including two against 
Pettitte. Still, Texas had scored only one run in 45 playoffs 
innings -- all against the Yankees -- until he connected. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte got his revenge in the sixth, though, getting Gonzalez  
to ground into a double play after a leadoff single by Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte, as he often is in October, was toughest in the  
tightest spots. He escaped a first-and-second, no-outs jam in the 
second, then kept the Rangers from adding to a 1-0 lead in a tense 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Kelly led off with a single and took third on Lee  
Stevens' double. Mark McLemore struck out and Clayton, after taking 
a minute because he had trouble shaking the weighted doughnut off 
his bat, grounded out to a slightly drawn-in Brosius at third. 
</P>
<P>
	Rusty Greer ran the count full before striking out on a breaking  
ball in the dirt, and Pettitte pumped his fist and shouted as he 
left the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	New York tied it in the bottom half of the fifth when Tino  
Martinez opened with a single and, running on a 3-2 pitch with two 
outs, scored as Brosius when doubled off the left-field wall beyond 
Greer's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer, cut in the ear and left jaw  
by a foul ball in Game 1, wore a gag gift in the first inning -- a 
military helmet with a Yankees logo. He had a bandage over his 
wounds. ... Clemens and David Cone, who would pitch Game 4, flew 
ahead to Texas to rest up for their starts. ... Clemens is 1-2 with 
a 3.88 ERA in nine career starts in the postseason. Loaiza will be 
making his first playoff appearance. ... Rodriguez, a Gold Glove 
catcher, tumbled into the first-base stands to catch Chuck 
Knoblauch's foul pop in the sixth.

<HEADLINE> Helms Leads Test Ban Treaty Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the straightest of faces, Sen. Jesse  
Helms intoned: ``This is the final hearing by the Foreign Relations 
Committee on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What North Carolina Republican didn't mention Thursday was that  
it was also the first. 
</P>
<P>
	Feared by many Democrats but praised by conservatives, Helms has  
long been a thorn in the side of the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he is a leading opponent of President Clinton's effort to  
win ratification of the global pact to ban all nuclear test 
explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have any possibility of this treaty  
passing,'' he says with a beam of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not the first time Helms, 79, has thrown up obstacles for  
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, he single-handedly scuttled the nomination of former  
Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, a fellow Republican, to be 
ambassador to Mexico. He simply refused to hold hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	If that helped cement his nickname ``Senator No,'' so be it,  
Helms told an audience of conservatives earlier this year. ``Saying 
no is part of the job. ... And I plan to say `no' to a few more 
things this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms also contributed to making life difficult for diplomat  
Richard Holbrooke, whose Senate confirmation as U.N. ambassador 
took more than a year. That delay was exacerbated by the 
administration itself in a prolonged ethics investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms eventually supported Holbrooke -- but only after extracting  
a pledge from him to press for ``reforms'' at the United Nations, 
including lower U.S. payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms also has served notice on the administration that he  
believes the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Treaty belongs in ``the 
dustbin of history'' and should be reviewed by the Senate and 
nullified. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jesse Helms has never seen a treaty or an agreement that he's  
ever liked,'' said Daryl Kimball, director of the Coalition to 
Reduce Nuclear Dangers, an advocacy group supporting the test-ban 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has used his near-dictatorial authority to its fullest  
extent in blocking the Senate from considering this treaty for two 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A vote is set for Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Knowing support for the treaty among Republicans was nearly  
nonexistent, Helms and Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
abruptly decided to call the bluff of Democrats who were protesting 
the lack of Senate movement on the pact -- submitted back in 
September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	When the White House and Democrats signaled they wanted more  
time to rally support, Helms threatened to block any such delay -- 
unless Clinton requested it in writing and promised not to press 
for action ``for the duration of his presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, Clinton declined.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked by a reporter why he was making such a severe demand on  
the president when he could easily block the treaty from coming up 
again as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Helms 
reflected a moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could do that,'' he said finally. ``But that would not be  
strong enough to suit me. I want his signature on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the committee's senior Democrat,  
called Helms' demand ``preposterous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Biden, who would be chairman of the committee if Democrats  
regained the Senate, enjoys warm relations with Helms despite their 
repeated policy clashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love you, but I find your characterizations interesting,''  
Biden told Helms at Thursday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms also enjoys friendly relations with Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright -- who went out of her way to court him from her 
first days on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello Madeleine,'' he said warmly as he shook her hand on  
Thursday as she prepared to testify, even though the two are locked 
on opposite sides of the test-ban issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms chuckles when he notes that it's the Clinton  
administration and Senate Democrats who now want a delay on the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was perfectly willing to keep the treaty in the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee and I did a pretty good job at it for a 
while,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Heisman Hopeful Warrick Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State receiver and Heisman  
hopeful Peter Warrick was arrested today on grand theft charges 
stemming from an alleged theft at a department store. 
</P>
<P>
	Also arrested on grand theft charges was Seminoles receiver and  
Warrick's roommate Laveranues Coles. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players were suspended from Saturday's game against Miami  
and could be suspended for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the players said they were cooperating with  
police. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we grabbed clothes and ran out,'' Coles said  
Tuesday. ``It's not like that at all. They wanted to question us 
about some things. We went and answered some questions and that's 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick sounded confident that he and Coles would be cleared of  
any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like I killed the president,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Coles and Warrick were arrested in 1998 in separate incidents.  
</P>
<P>
	Coles was charged with simple battery, a misdemeanor, in a  
domestic incident when he allegedly struck his stepmother outside 
her home. He was suspended for last year's opener against Texas A&AMP;M 
and later served 150 hours of community service. He also was 
suspended for this year's opener for academic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting  
arrest, both misdemeanors, for an altercation in the parking lot of 
a Tampa fast-food restaurant. The charges were eventually dropped.

<HEADLINE> Los Angeles Eyes Existing NFL Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles Saints would seem a natural.  
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals would work, too, in the City of Angels.  
</P>
<P>
	Bills doesn't fit, and LA Vikings has a ridiculous ring about  
it, but then the Los Angeles Lakers kept their name when they moved 
from Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing to Houston in the bidding for the NFL's expansion  
franchise, Los Angeles put out the welcome mat Thursday for any 
team owner unhappy in his present city. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams in New Orleans, Arizona, Buffalo and Minnesota are  
considered possible candidates. Al Davis, who took the Raiders out 
of the LA Coliseum and back to Oakland after the 1994 season, has 
made noise about returning to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Some think there's a good chance Los Angeles will lure an  
existing team; others believe the city will remain without pro 
football for many more years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real possibility, whether the owners would merely be  
posturing for their existing communities, or actually be a real 
threat to relocate,'' said David Carter, analyst for the Sports 
Business Group. ``Either way, it's going to keep the dialogue 
going. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll have a bunch of owners jockeying for position in Los  
Angeles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much or all of that could turn out to be merely using the threat  
of moving as leverage to get a better deal in their present cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Leigh Steinberg, agent for such NFL quarterbacks as Troy Aikman,  
Steve Young, Drew Bledsoe and Jake Plummer, doesn't think Los 
Angeles will have a team anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Southern Californians have shown themselves unwilling to  
commit public tax funds to a private stadium. Who would build a 
stadium for a team?'' said Steinberg, who several years ago was 
involved in a failed effort to keep the Rams in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Roski would very much like to help provide the stadium.  
</P>
<P>
	Roski, the real estate developer whose group lost out in the  
expansion derby, can extend the same $400 million offer, a 
remodeled Coliseum, to any interested NFL owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski spearheaded the new Staples Arena downtown, built with  
$375 million of private financing. 
</P>
<P>
	John Semcken, an executive with Roski's firm, said an owner who  
moved his team to the Coliseum could be expected to make enough 
annually -- between $50 million and $70 million -- to rank among the 
league's top three or four teams in that regard. 
</P>
<P>
	Semcken also said that if a team moves to Los Angeles it could  
begin play before the Houston expansion franchise does in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mentioning the Rose Bowl as possible for a temporary stadium  
while the Coliseum was being remodeled, Semcken said, ``If we can 
convince someone to move, we might have a team playing even sooner 
than 2002.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roski probably would want to acquire a minority ownership in a  
team that moved to the Coliseum. Carter believes that would be a 
wise move, saying LA fans would have trouble accepting a ``used 
team'' with an out-of-town owner perceived as a carpetbagger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Local ownership will be able to market in Los Angeles,''  
Carter said. ``Marketing here is very different from other 
cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said he will continue  
working to put a team in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``What would be in Los Angeles' favor is a competitive team in  
the New Coliseum, and that's what we're attempting to do,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If a team wants to move to Los Angeles, it apparently wouldn't  
do so with the NFL's blessing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we are in the business of keeping teams where they  
are, committing them to their current fan bases and getting 
stadiums built in our existing markets,'' NFL commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue said earlier this week.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Grand Jury May Report Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The grand jury investigating the death of  
JonBenet Ramsey was scheduled to meet today and Friday, and one 
adviser says he knows of no further meetings set for the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not be surprised if there wasn't some kind of  
announcement next week, as opposed to waiting until the 20th or 
even the week of the 20th,'' Adams County District Attorney Bob 
Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, one of four metro-area prosecutors who have advised  
District Attorney Alex Hunter on the case, was referring to the 
legally mandated conclusion of the grand jury's term. It was 
originally set to end April 21, but a judge extended it at the 
prosecution's request to Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-year-old JonBenet was found strangled, beaten and her wrists  
bound with cord in her home on Dec. 26, 1996. Her millionaire 
parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, have been identified as suspects 
but maintain they are innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the grand jurors were spotted at the Boulder County  
Justice Center on Wednesday, all appearing to leave by 
midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzanne Laurion, spokeswoman for Hunter's office, said, ``It  
would be my thinking that perhaps an explanation today is that a 
review session was scheduled.'' The grand jury has held several 
informal evidence review sessions since it began meeting.

<HEADLINE> Bipartisan Agreement on Tax Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats and Republicans on a key Senate  
committee largely agree that an expired business research tax 
credit should be made permanent, but they are far apart on how to 
pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there is disagreement on the Senate Finance  
Committee about whether average taxpayers who claim personal 
credits should get permanent or temporary protection from the 
complex alternative minimum tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all a matter of money,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick  
Moynihan, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans want to use projected budget surpluses to offset  
most of the cost of a five-year, $28.7 billion proposal from 
Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del. In addition to the 
permanent AMT fix and research credit, Roth's bill would extend 
several other business credits by five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are developing an alternative of up to $20 billion  
that raises the money through other tax increases. Aside from the 
permanent research credit, it renews most of the other credits for 
a shorter time and would only fix AMT temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither party's lawmakers want an estimated 1 million taxpayers  
to face higher alternative minimum taxes just for claiming breaks 
such as the $500 per child tax credit on their federal returns. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats, led by President Clinton, are resisting any tax  
package that would spend projected budget surpluses, as Roth's bill 
would in four of the five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going along with anything that isn't paid for,'' said  
Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats had identified $19.9 billion in offsets to pay for  
their bill, including closing corporate tax shelters, renewal of a 
Superfund environmental cleanup tax and a modification of foreign 
tax credits, said Finance Committee sources who spoke on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth is proposing only to offset the fiscal 2000 cost of $1.7  
billion -- the GOP needs that money for spending on government 
programs -- by increasing estimated tax payment requirements for 
people earning $150,000 or more. In addition, companies would be 
prevented from claiming the research credit until Oct. 1, 2000, 
when the 2001 fiscal year begins. A House GOP version totaling 
$23.3 billion also would spend surplus money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has threatened to veto the bill if it  
spends the surplus before Social Security and Medicare are 
safeguarded for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the measure  
could prove too popular to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president wants to veto the R&AMP;D tax credit ... go right  
ahead. His days are numbered anyway,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth's bill also includes five-year extensions for credits  
businesses can claim if they hire workers from certain 
disadvantaged or ethnic groups and those coming off welfare. The 
House version has 30-month extensions. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure includes a five-year extension of a credit for  
electricity produced by wind and certain kinds of biological 
material -- including a poultry waste provision sought by Roth for 
Delaware's chicken producers. These provisions are not in the House 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Both bills would extend an oil and gas investment deduction and  
an exemption for foreign corporate income from banking, insurance 
or finance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roth bill also would make permanent a deduction for  
employers who pay education expenses for their workers.

<HEADLINE> Scots Give U.S. Muted Reception  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) -- Americans Tom Lehman, Payne Stewart  
and Mark O'Meara, playing for the first time in Europe since their 
controversial Ryder Cup win, got a muted but polite reception from 
Scottish golf fans as the Dunhill Cup began today. 
</P>
<P>
	Applause was light -- particularly for Lehman -- but there was no  
hint of fans trying to get even for the behavior of their American 
counterparts at the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the weather cooperated on a sunny fall day with light  
breezes wafting in off the Firth of Tay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different kind of golf fan you've got here,'' said  
Chris Bell, applauding as Lehman rolled a long approach putt on No. 
3 at the Old Course to within inches. Lehman faced New Zealand's 
Michale Campbell in his match. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate our golf here, and we'll never forgive the  
supporters. The American fans were out of order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three Americans were mobbed for autographs today at the  
practice green, mostly by excited teen-age boys. Only their accents 
belied they were Scottish. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they cheated, but I wanted a memento,'' said 14-year-old  
Paul Jensen, showing off autographs from Lehman and O'Meara. ``We 
got no problems with Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His friend, Stuart Adamson, 15, was hoping to see one more  
American. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish Tiger was playing, he's brilliant,'' Adamson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Almost two weeks after the Americans pulled off the greatest  
comeback in Ryder Cup history, they're still disparaged in Britain 
for the way they did it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lehman the monster asks for forgiveness as he enters the  
lion's den,'' The London Daily Mail said on Wednesday, describing 
the former British Open champion as the ``Ryder Cup bete noire'' 
and ripping the Americans for ``playing fast and loose'' with golf 
etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
	An openly religious man, Lehman wants forgiveness from the  
European fans and Ryder Cup players, 10 of whom are in the 
four-day, 16-nation Dunhill Cup. The British media has been rough 
on him. 
</P>
<P>
	``What better place to come and set things straight than St.  
Andrews,'' said Lehman, speaking just a wedge away from the famous 
stone clubhouse of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club -- the venerable 
custodian of the game's rules and etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's of concern to me that my reputation has been somewhat  
damaged,'' said Lehman, whose behavior was called ``disgusting'' by 
European assistant captain Sam Torrance when the American led a 
charge across the 17th green in a premature victory celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never walked on anybody's line,'' Lehman said. ``I'm not a  
monster. I'm not a rogue. I'm not a hooligan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman said he ``sent letters to the people I want to deal with  
directly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal of the letters that I wrote and the phone calls I  
made was that we can leave friends. I definitely don't think it's 
worth losing friendships over a golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to let you know the Americans and myself are very  
much aware of the honor and courtesy of golf, the history of 
golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torrance is playing for Scotland following the withdrawal of  
Colin Montgomerie with a dental problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The withdrawal of Europe's No. 1-ranked player wiped out any  
possible showdown with American golfers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans and Scots are two of the four seeded teams and  
could face each other in Sunday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart and O'Meara, lauded in the British press for being  
gracious in victory, blamed a handful of fans for problems that saw 
Jane James -- the wife of European captain Mark James -- spit on, and 
American caddie Jerry Higginbotham beat up for carrying the bag of 
a Spain's Sergio Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably 80 to 100 of those 30,000 were not true golf fans ...  
and they treated the Ryder Cup as they would treat going to a 
football game, or a basketball game or a hockey game,'' Stewart 
said. ``They don't understand the etiquette that's involved in the 
game of golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it was horrible the way everybody was treated,'' O'Meara  
admitted. ``Because of eight or 20 or 12 fans, you don't label all 
Americans, the whole Ryder Cup as being a disgrace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman called some of the partisan cheering ``inevitable'' as  
the United States rallied on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very sorry for running out on the 17th green, we're very  
sorry if ... you thought we haven't respected you (European 
players),'' Lehman said. ``It was never the intention to show any 
lack of respect or lack of courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
	``But in the excitement of the day, the excitement of the  
moment, things just spilled out. ... We can't do anything about it, 
we don't feel good about it, we just have to go on and get over 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Bonallack, the just-retired secretary of the Royal and  
Ancient who likened The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., to a 
``bearpit,'' said no extra security was planned on this ancient 
links guarded jealously by winds off the Firth of Tay. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman has already had problems off the course. Lost luggage  
forced him to play a practice round Tuesday in jeans, breaking the 
club's strict dress code. Royal and Ancient officials later said 
he'd been given dispensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman was also reportedly accused by golf broadcaster and  
former Ryder Cup player Peter Alliss of changing his character from 
unassuming to demanding since winning the British Open in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't comment on any of this until I have spoken to Peter  
and ask him if he made these comments,'' Lehman said. ``Anyone who 
knows me knows that I do not go around demanding this and that. 
It's a load of bunkum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is seeded No. 1 in the tournament, followed by  
No. 2 Spain -- with Ryder Cup stars Jose Maria Olazabal, Miguel 
Angel Jimenez and Sergio Garcia -- followed by two-time defending 
champion South Africa and Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	In other pairings today, it was Sweden vs. Italy, Scotland vs.  
Paraguay, Australia vs. Japan, South Africa vs. China, England vs. 
India, Spain vs. France and Ireland vs. Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Wrestler Gorilla Monsoon Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLINGBORO, N.J. (AP) -- Robert ``Gorilla Monsoon'' Marella, a  
true giant of professional wrestling who body-slammed Muhammad Ali 
and debated Jesse Ventura, has died of a heart ailment. 
</P>
<P>
	The 62-year-old former teacher, died Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6, 400-pound Marella turned to the pro wrestling game  
in 1960 when a promoter offered him $500 per week to don the 
tights. 
</P>
<P>
	As Gorilla Monsoon, Marella soon shared world tag-team titles  
with Walter ``Killer'' Kowalski and ``Cowboy'' Bill Watts. Playing 
a villain's role at the time, Marella gained notoriety for his feud 
with longtime champ Bruno Sammartino. 
</P>
<P>
	Marella's career in the ring lasted until the early 1980s, when  
he became one of the World Wrestling Federation's top ringside 
television announcers. He co-hosted WWF telecasts at a time when 
the high-flying entertainment genre was booming in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	Marella frequently shared the microphone with former wrestler  
Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura, with whom he often argued over the 
importance of fair play in the ring. Ventura now is governor of 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger generation of wrestlers was honored to have the  
rotund Marella analyze their moves and holds, said fellow pro 
wrestler King Kong Bundy. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was somebody who knew the business,'' Bundy said. ``A great  
guy, a real class act all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marella also wrote a weekly pro wrestling column for the  
now-defunct Philadelphia Bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
	A son, Joey Marella, became a WWF referee in the 1980s. He died  
in an auto accident in Burlington in 1994. Thereafter, Robert 
Marella appeared on television less frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	``When his son got killed in a car accident, I think that took a  
lot out of him,'' King Kong Bundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marella did serve as interim president of the WWF in 1997 -- at a  
time when the industry admitted openly that the outcomes of its 
matches are scripted. 
</P>
<P>
	Heart problems forced Marella to scale back his work with the  
WWF. He also suffered from diabetes in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Ali's Daughter Making Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERONA, N.Y. (AP) -- With a grin, Laila Ali predicted a win. In  
her mind, the bout will be a rout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to knock her out,'' Laila said Thursday on the eve  
of her first professional boxing match. ``I'm coming to knock 
somebody out, not just to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laila, the second-youngest of Muhammad Ali's nine children, will  
make her debut tonight at Turning Stone Casino against April 
Fowler, a veteran of one pro fight. Laila promised that her 
infectious smile, which lit up a room full of microphones and 
cameras, would soon disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see me tomorrow, you're going to see a whole 'nother  
look,'' she promised. ``Right now, I have cameras in my face and 
I'm a very charming person. That other side of me is showing, but 
tomorrow is going to be a whole 'nother story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Fowler was not impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't tell me it was her for two weeks,'' Fowler said.  
``When I accepted the fight, I did not know it was her. After I 
found out it was her, I freaked out. Then after they told me she's 
never even been in the ring, I kind of eased up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler, who lost her debut way back in March 1998, came dressed  
in black. If she was nervous, she easily hid any anxiety behind a 
pair of dark sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just a name to me,'' said the 5-foot-6 native of  
Michigan City, Ind., who weighed in at just under 164 pounds. ``I'm 
not getting in the ring with her father, I'm getting in the ring 
with her. The pressure's not on me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laila was all too aware of that. Because of the hoopla, she has  
requested that the fight not be shown on television or videotaped. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's enough pressure on me as it is,'' said the 5-foot-10  
Laila, who weighed in at 168. ``I've said what I have to say. Now I 
have to deliver. I don't know exactly how I'm going to feel, but 
I'm comfortable in the ring. It will be a new feeling for me. I 
know what I'm capable of doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be staged in a 2,600-seat auditorium, and 600  
tickets were still available late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Providing room for the media promised to be more challenging  
than attaining a sellout. Promoter Mike Acri said about 90 
journalists from faraway places such as France, Germany, Italy, 
Sweden, Holland, Brazil and Japan will be there to record the 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
	The headliner of the seven-bout card understood all the fuss.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know you guys are not here for me,'' said 34-year-old  
Donovan ``Razor'' Ruddock, who will continue his comeback against 
journeyman Jose Ribalta in a 10-round bout. ``She's taking all my 
press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laila said her mother, Veronica, the third of Muhammad Ali's  
four wives, will be there, but she wasn't sure about her father. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like my father to be here, but it goes two ways,''  
said Laila, who operates a nail salon in Los Angeles in her spare 
time. ``Even though he's my dad and he's around me and my boxing 
career, it makes me nervous because he is the greatest and I feel 
like I can't do things wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That her parents weren't thrilled with her decision to box was  
not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm totally fine with the fact that he doesn't really want me  
to box,'' said Laila, 21, who was too young to see her father fight 
in person. ``He'd rather me just go to school like I was going to. 
He doesn't want me to get hurt, but he never once told me not to 
box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So box she will.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll feel better about this whole thing after I fight because  
there's so many questions, so many people wondering, so many 
expectations,'' said Laila, who was 7 when her parents divorced. 
``I'm the one you guys are going to be looking at. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, I don't feel like everyone's here for just me.  
It's the name. That is what puts the pressure on me. I'm always 
going to be recognized as Muhammad Ali's daughter. I can't say, `I 
want everyone just to see me for me' because that's not going to 
happen until I do what I need to do.''

<HEADLINE> Colombian Tribe Wins Custody Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- After months at a Bogota adoption center  
at the center of a bizarre custody battle, a pair of 8-month-old 
twins will be returned to their Indian tribe after its elders 
promised not to hurt the children. 
</P>
<P>
	Customarily, the U'wa tribe abandons newborn twins in the forest  
or tosses them into rivers, believing they are ill-equipped for 
life and bring bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan and Keila Aguablanca were spared that fate when their  
parents left them in a public health clinic three days after their 
Feb. 11 birth. Their case drew attention to customs many Colombians 
consider barbaric and put the U'wa once again in the public 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	The combative 8,000-member tribe threatened mass suicide in 1997  
in a successful protest to stop oil drilling on their lands and has 
become a cause celebre among many U.S. environmentalists and 
indigenous rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Stung by the negative publicity in the Aguablanca twin case, the  
group decided to fight the adoption process and demand the 
children's return. 
</P>
<P>
	The director of Colombia's Institute for Family Welfare, Juan  
Manuel Urrutia, said Thursday that the government had decided to 
return the twins to the U'wa after the tribe ``agreed to place the 
rights of these two children above their cultural beliefs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the babies would be returned within 10 days.  
</P>
<P>
	The U'wa's legal adviser, Ebaristo Tegria, said the tribe's  
leaders had met and agreed to make an exception to the people's 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most important now is that the youngsters return to the  
community,'' Tegria said in a telephone interview from Cubara, a 
town 200 miles northeast of Bogota just outside the U'wa 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal spokesman Jose Cobaria said Juan and Keila's parents had  
been isolated from the rest of the community so they could be 
cleansed of impurities linked to the birth. For four years, he 
said, they could not visit other houses or share food with 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal leaders said the children would be returned to their  
parents.

<HEADLINE> Gillette Loses Case Against Norelco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled against Gillette Co.,  
which had sued shaving rival Norelco over commercials depicting 
traditional razors as animated ferocious creatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette took issue with the ads -- which had titles such as  
``Twin Blade Serpent'' -- for Norelco's electric Reflex Action 
Razor, and filed suit in 1996 claiming the spots were false and 
disparaging. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the advertisements never mentioned Gillette by name,  
Gillette alleged the commercials maligned the entire category of 
wet, or non-electric, razors. The ads stopped airing two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Gillette) has not established how consumers interpreted the  
commercials and therefore the court is unable to determine whether 
the commercials as understood by consumers are false or 
misleading,'' U.S. District Judge Reginald Lindsay wrote in his 
43-page ruling, which was released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased for obvious reasons,'' said Rich Sorota, senior  
vice president of marketing for Norelco Consumer Products. ``We're 
pleased (the judge) found we were absolutely truthful. ... Our 
product did produce less irritation than blades (with regard to) 
nicks and cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Boston-based Gillette said they are considering  
appealing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to believe Norelco used exaggerated visuals and  
claims that were unfair and untruthful,'' said spokesman Eric 
Kraus. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette had sought a permanent injunction against Norelco that  
would have barred the company from ever producing ads that cast 
aspersions on wet shaving. To be granted injunctive relief, 
plaintiffs generally must prove they've suffered irreparable harm, 
loss or damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Norelco, based in Stamford, Conn., is a division of Philips  
Electronics N.V. of the Netherlands. Gillette controls 70 percent 
of the men's shaving products market and 50 percent of the women's 
market.

<HEADLINE> Allison's Wrist Injury Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Boston Bruins forward Jason Allison has torn  
cartilage in his wrist, and he could need surgery if it continues 
to worsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison, who played in Thursday night's 4-3 loss to the Ottawa  
Senators, said one doctor told him to rest, while another told him 
he needed surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are all kinds of tears in the muscle,'' he said  
Thursday, a day after an MRI revealed the damage. ``There are 
different options. If it gets better, I can play with it and rest 
it on the off days. If it doesn't, I'll have to take a little time 
off to get the swelling down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allison, who will continue to play for now, said the injury  
worsened when he took faceoffs on opening night against Carolina on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been battling on faceoffs,'' he said. ``(Faceoffs) are  
something I have to make my game better. I have to get a little 
stronger.''

<HEADLINE> Mets vs. Cubs in Japan Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball finally made it official Thursday,  
announcing that the New York Mets and Chicago Cubs will play the 
first regular-season games outside of North America, opening next 
season in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-game series will be in the Tokyo Dome, home of the  
Yomiuri Giants, on March 29 and 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are then off until April 4, when the Mets play their  
home opener against San Diego and the Cubs play in the St. Louis 
Cardinals' opener. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the trip, the Cubs will play exhibition games on  
March 27 at the Yomiuri Giants and the Seibu Lions the following 
day. The Mets will play at the Lions on March 27 and at the Giants 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Assuming financial projections are met, each player on the trip  
gets about $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	This will mark the third time regular-season games are played  
outside the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	New York and San Diego played a three-game series at Monterrey,  
Mexico, in 1997, and the Padres and Colorado Rockies opened the 
1999 season with a game at Monterrey. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's first choice was to have the Mets and Cardinals open  
in Japan, but St. Louis declined. The Cubs agreed to the trip in 
mid-August, and details were worked out during the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
	The players' association and the commissioner's office still  
must agree to roster sizes and waiver changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Current rules call for teams to cut their active roster to 25  
players by the first opener in the major leagues. That means they 
have until two business days before the first opener to place a 
player on unconditional release waivers without having to pay his 
entire salary for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yomiuri Shimbun, a division of the company that owns the  
Tokyo Giants, is sponsoring the trip. Profits are split by the 
commissioner's office and the players' association.

<HEADLINE> Devils Acquire Center Steve Kelly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils have acquired  
center Steve Kelly from the Tampa Bay Lightning for a seventh-round 
draft pick in the 2000 entry draft, the team announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly, 22, joined the Devils from the IHL's Detroit Vipers. He  
was Edmonton's first choice and the sixth overall selection in the 
1995 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly, a 6-foot-1, 190-pounder, split the 1998-99 season between  
Tampa Bay and Cleveland of the IHL. In his four seasons in the NHL 
he had four goals and six assists for 10 points, and 56 penalty 
minutes in 85 games played for Edmonton and Tampa Bay.

<HEADLINE> Bill Helps Cover Immigrant Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government would reimburse state  
and local governments for $1.6 billion more in costs associated 
with illegal immigration under a Senate GOP plan introduced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, sponsored by Arizona Republican Sens. Jon Kyl and John  
McCain, would spend the money over four years to pay for emergency 
medical care for illegal immigrants and processing illegal aliens 
who commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government already reimburses state and local  
governments for jailing criminal aliens, a $585 million program 
that Kyl said only provides 40 percent of the actual costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Border states such as Arizona ``are losing millions of dollars a  
year of expenses they incur because of the federal government's 
inability to control the borders,'' Kyl said. Getting Congress to 
approve the money ``won't be easy,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will not be enough money,'' Kyl said. ``We're just trying  
to reduce the burden on the states that are bearing the brunt of 
this illegal immigration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kyl-McCain proposal would make the money available to the 17  
states with the biggest illegal immigration problems. It would 
provide $200 million a year from 2001 through 2004 for processing 
criminal aliens and $200 million a year for medical care -- 
primarily emergency care -- to illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
	Border states and counties have complained for years that they  
are being overwhelmed by the costs of jailing, educating and 
providing medical care for illegal immigrants. California, Arizona, 
Texas, Florida, New York and New Jersey all sued the federal 
government to force it to reimburse some or all of those costs, but 
federal courts rejected those lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	In Santa Cruz County, Ariz., for example, a study found that  
34.4 cents of every dollar the county spends on law enforcement and 
the justice system goes to processing illegal immigrants. That 
includes about $1.1 million of the $2.7 million sheriff's budget 
and more than half of the county's court budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Those costs ``are a federal responsibility and should not be  
shirked by those in Washington who don't live with the problem of 
illegal immigration in their midst,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	An immigrant advocate also said he agreed with making the  
federal government pay more of those costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal government collects more taxes from immigrants  
than state and local governments do,'' said Thomas Saenz, a lawyer 
with the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-sponsors of the plan include Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison,  
R-Texas; Pete Domenici, R-N.M.; Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.; and Dianne 
Feinstein, D-Calif.

<HEADLINE> Computer Warfare Used in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The U.S. military acknowledged for the first  
time Thursday that it used a form of computer warfare against 
Yugoslavia as part of NATO's air war last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  
Staff, made the remark during an interview in which he discussed 
the Pentagon's decision to assign U.S. Space Command the 
responsibility of coordinating both the defense of military 
computer networks and attacks on enemy networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked broadly if U.S. information ``weapons'' were used against  
Yugoslavia during the Kosovo campaign, Shelton replied, ``You can 
assume that we in fact employed some of our systems, yes.'' He said 
the ``systems'' were offensive in nature, but he would not be more 
specific about how they were used. 
</P>
<P>
	A defense official said later that Shelton was referring to a  
broad range of ``information operations'' involving computers that 
may have included cyber-attacks on Yugoslavia's air defense 
network. Shelton would not specify the target of the U.S. computer 
attacks and did not discuss the results. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather not be specific about how we used it, to be  
frank,'' he said. ``I don't want to divulge too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton spoke to reporters traveling with him and Defense  
Secretary William Cohen aboard an Air Force jet from Norfolk, where 
they attended a ceremony to mark the renaming of U.S. Atlantic 
Command to U.S. Joint Forces Command. The change is part of a 
broader revision of the Unified Command Plan that includes the 
assigning of computer network defensive and attacks 
responsibilities to Space Command. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference after the ceremony, Shelton said the  
Pentagon is concerned about the vulnerability of military computers 
to intrusions not only by private hackers but also by enemies in 
times of war. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any question, as we look to the future,  
that our information systems throughout America and specifically 
within the Defense Department will be more and more subject to 
attack,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Space Command, headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base in  
Colorado Springs, Colo., was given the responsibility to develop 
defenses against attacks on military computer networks as of Oct. 
1. One year later, it will take on the added task of coordinating 
the development of offensive ``weapons'' for cyber-warfare, several 
defense officials said. The individual services are doing that work 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Space Command's main mission is to provide missile warning and  
space surveillance as part of the air and space defense of the 
United States and Canada. It also plans for strategic ballistic 
missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Norfolk ceremony, Cohen said that the newly named Joint  
Forces Command, commanded by Navy Adm. Harold Gehman Jr., has been 
given the added responsibility of coordinating U.S. military 
support to civilian agencies in the event of an attack on American 
territory with nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen stressed that the Joint Forces Command would be in a  
support role in such an event, leaving a civilian agency such as 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Justice Department 
to take the lead. Even so, some civil liberties groups contend that 
involving the military is a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are supposed to believe that turning our military into a  
national police force will somehow strengthen our democracy?'' 
American Civil Liberties Union official Gregory T. Nojeim asked 
rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
	Gehman said the military should be used to help respond to major  
disasters, as it does now in the case of hurricanes, floods and 
other natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should think the taxpayers would be upset if they thought  
that we weren't preparing to help out the citizens in the case of a 
catastrophic event,'' Gehman said.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Grand Jury May Report Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The grand jury investigating the death of  
JonBenet Ramsey met today, and one adviser says he knows of no 
further meetings set for the group after this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not be surprised if there wasn't some kind of  
announcement next week, as opposed to waiting until the 20th or 
even the week of the 20th,'' Adams County District Attorney Bob 
Grant said. He said another meeting was set for Friday, but that 
was the only other one he knew of. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, one of four metro-area prosecutors who have advised  
District Attorney Alex Hunter on the case, was referring to the 
legally mandated conclusion of the grand jury's term. It was 
originally set to end April 21, but a judge extended it at the 
prosecution's request to Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-year-old JonBenet was found strangled, beaten and her wrists  
bound with cord in her home on Dec. 26, 1996. Her millionaire 
parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, have been identified as suspects 
but maintain they are innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the grand jurors were spotted at the Boulder County  
Justice Center on Wednesday, all appearing to leave by 
midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzanne Laurion, spokeswoman for Hunter's office, said, ``It  
would be my thinking that perhaps an explanation today is that a 
review session was scheduled.'' The grand jury has held several 
informal evidence review sessions since it began meeting.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Software Malfunctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Glitches in software being installed to run the  
Nasdaq Stock Market's stock quote display system during after-hours 
trading sessions forced the temporary shutdown of three electronic 
trading networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Instinet, Island and Brass Utility, known as Brut -- three of the  
largest electronic communication networks, or ECNs -- were all back 
online early Wednesday afternoon after blackouts ranging from 2 1/2 to 
3 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	A Nasdaq spokesman said the software meltdown caused delays in  
transfers of information on Nasdaq's SelectNet system, which is an 
electronic network that links all Nasdaq market participants. 
</P>
<P>
	When brokers and Nasdaq market makers tried to complete trades  
on the three affected ECNs via SelectNet, the orders came through 
late and were, in many cases, canceled or otherwise disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	The delays on SelectNet eventually forced the Nasdaq to remove  
stock price information related to the three ECNs from the Nasdaq's 
price quote display system, effectively shutting the ECNs down. 
</P>
<P>
	The blackouts began around 10 a.m. EDT. Island was back online  
at 12:37 p.m.; Instinet at 1 p.m., and Brut at 1:04 p.m., according 
to the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an issue today with the slowness of the SelectNet  
system. Thus, we reduced the volume of activity by removing several 
high traffic ECNs temporarily from the system, both voluntarily and 
at our request, to allow the rest of the market to operate 
normally,'' J. Patrick Campbell, the Nasdaq's chief operating 
officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The blackout didn't go over well with at least one of the ECNs.  
</P>
<P>
	Cameron Smith, Island's legal counsel, complained that Nasdaq  
withdrew Island's quotes from the Nasdaq's display system without 
Island's consent, causing Island to lose the 25 percent of its 
business that is channeled through Nasdaq's systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's troubling for us,'' Smith said. ``Because of the delays,  
we were denied trades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brut president Brian Hyndman said his ECN risked losing  
credibility with its customers. But he was philosophical about the 
blackout. ``We want Nasdaq to correct the problem so we can all 
move forward. It was really just a bump in the road,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instinet officials didn't immediately return calls seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, it's because of ECNs that offer extended hours  
trading sessions to their customers -- including the three that were 
hit Wednesday -- that the Nasdaq agreed to keep its quote display 
system open until 6:30 p.m., 75 minutes past the traditional 5:15 
p.m. closing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq officials said they expect to begin offering the extended  
quotes on Monday, pending approval from the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq announced last month that its systems that track stock  
prices and trading volume will keep operating longer to help 
provide more information to investors who trade after hours through 
electronic networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is significant because price and volume information on  
after-hour trades on all ECNs will become available at one central 
source for the first time. Currently, after-hours investors only 
can see trades conducted on the networks they use, although the 
ECNs have discussed creating a central information system.

<HEADLINE> House Approves HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proclaiming a big victory on patients' rights,  
House Democrats celebrated passage of a sweeping bill meant to rein 
in HMOs, while acknowledging that it could be difficult to get the 
Senate to go along. 
</P>
<P>
	The bipartisan measure was approved Thursday by a wide margin,  
275-151, giving House Democrats virtually everything they wanted, 
including a patient's right to sue, but setting up potentially 
contentious negotiations with the Senate, which passed a 
considerably more modest version earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	All sides agreed that the politically charged battle to give  
patients more leverage against HMOs was far from over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, none of this is worth anything if we don't get a  
law,'' said Rep. Charlie Norwood, the Georgia Republican who bucked 
his party's leadership and joined with Democrats to push the bill 
through the House after concluding Republicans would support only 
limited reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would allow lawsuits against health insurance  
companies in state and federal courts, with no limit on potential 
awards. But no new suits would be allowed in the version the Senate 
passed in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill covers every American with private health  
insurance, while much of the Senate bill would affect only a 
fraction of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have a lot of work to do before this bill becomes the  
law of the land,'' President Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would guarantee access to reasonable emergency  
room care, give patients the right to see pediatricians and 
obstetricians without permission from primary care doctors, and 
would require HMOs to pay for routine care associated with clinical 
trials. It would require HMOs to disclose a host of information and 
allows patients to take their complaints to outside arbitrators. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout two days of House debate this week, Democrats argued  
that patients needed protections from health maintenance 
organizations and managed care plans. These plans control costs by 
eliminating unneeded care, but many Americans fear they will be 
denied care they need, and HMO reform has proven politically 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argued that giving patients new powers --  
particularly the power to file lawsuits -- would drive up the cost 
of health care and prompt employers to drop coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-eight Republicans joined 206 Democrats and one independent  
in favor of the House bill, while 149 Republicans and two Democrats 
voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Republicans stayed together, led by Sen. Bill  
Frist, R-Tenn., a heart surgeon who used his experience with 
patients to argue that Republicans were looking out for their best 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the House, Republican doctors took the opposite tack.  
Norwood, along with Rep. Greg Ganske, R-Iowa, a plastic surgeon, 
left their party and co-sponsored a bill with Democrats. Rep. Tom 
Coburn, R-Okla., an obstetrician, declined to join them, but he 
pushed GOP leaders to support a limited right to sue, a first. 
</P>
<P>
	All eyes are now on House and Senate leaders to see when they  
might appoint members of a conference committee to work out 
differences between the their bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Don Nickles, the No. 2 Senate Republican, vowed to ``work  
aggressively'' to defeat the more sweeping House provisions. And 
many speculated that GOP congressional leaders would take their 
time appointing members of a conference committee to reconcile the 
two bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there would be a conference committee this year, House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert's spokesman, John Feeherey, said: ``I 
wouldn't want to rule it. I wouldn't want to rule it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A delay might, in fact, help Democrats, as next November's  
elections approach and pressure to pass an HMO bill increases. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, Democrats couldn't conceal their glee after handing  
Republicans and Hastert the year's sharpest legislative defeat.	   Hastert repeatedly said he was content to simply let the House 
``work its will.'' But he is well-versed in the dicey politics 
surrounding the HMO issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot afford to be held responsible for killing patient  
protection legislation,'' Hastert told rank-and-file Republicans in 
a closed-door meeting Thursday, according an account provided by a 
GOP source on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who hold a narrow majority in the House, were in a  
tough spot from the start. Many of the more conservative 
Republicans believed no new federal law was needed to regulate 
health maintenance organizations and other managed care plans. 
Others were pushing for a strong bill. 
</P>
<P>
	It took Hastert until this week to endorse any bill, and the GOP  
strategy was fuzzy until debate opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, under pressure from the GOP leadership, many  
Republicans supported an alternate that allowed limited new 
lawsuits. But it wasn't enough, and the GOP version of patients 
rights was defeated, 238-193, with 29 Republicans voting no. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably wish they would have gotten a lot more involved  
sooner,'' said Rep. Ray LaHood, an Illinois Republican who 
supported the more modest bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Business and insurance groups lobbied heavily. The National  
Association of Manufacturers, for instance, promised to get 
companies to tell their employees that any increase in health care 
premiums should be blamed on members of Congress who supported this 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't work. Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said he would be  
thrilled if employers advertised his vote. ``If they keep up that 
threat,'' he said, ``I'll pay for the printing.''

<HEADLINE> $3.75B Fen-Phen Drug Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- American Home Products Corp. resolved one of  
the largest product liability cases ever Thursday by agreeing to 
pay $3.75 billion to settle claims that its once-popular fen-phen 
diet drug combination caused dangerous heart valve problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement covers thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide,  
along with any of the roughly six million people who took the drugs 
even if they didn't sue. 
</P>
<P>
	It will include money to pay those who say they were made ill by  
the drugs and for future medical monitoring for those who are still 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Individual benefits will range from $30 for prescription refunds  
to a maximum of $1.5 million per person for people with serious 
health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending a judge's approval, initial payments will begin later  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement terms call for payments to continue for about 16  
years. With interest earned over that time, the total amount paid 
could rise to $4.83 billion, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement ensures that all class members will be treated  
with parity and fairness,'' said attorney Stanley Chesley, one of 
the plaintiffs' chief negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home, based in Madison, N.J., made fenfluramine, the  
``fen'' in the fen-phen combination, and gave the drug a brand name 
of Pondimin. It also made Redux, a chemical cousin which is covered 
in the settlement. In September 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration successfully pushed the company to withdraw the 
drugs from the market after a Mayo Clinic study linked fen-phen to 
potentially fatal heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement ``offers peace of mind to those who used the  
drugs and permits the company to move beyond the uncertainty and 
distractions of litigation,'' said John R. Stafford, American 
Home's chairman, chief executive and president. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis L. Hoynes, senior vice president and general counsel,  
reiterated the company's position that the drugs were safe for most 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scientific studies conducted to date and clinical  
experience indicate that the health of the overwhelming majority of 
people who took Redux or Pondimin has not been adversely 
affected,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On news of the settlement, shares of American Home rose $3.50,  
or 8 percent, to $48.62 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home said Thursday it faces about 6,500 suits involving  
more than 11,000 people over the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement is optional, allowing users to pursue lawsuits on  
their own. However, if American Home believes too many refuse to 
participate, it can terminate the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	A toll-free telephone number (800-386-2070) has been established  
to provide information on the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement covers all claims except for patients who say  
they suffer from primary pulmonary hypertension, a rare but serious 
lung disorder. The company said it decided to deal with these cases 
separately because they are few in number. It also noted that 
fen-phen's label included a warning that the drug could cause the 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement includes about $2.32 billion to pay for injuries,  
$1 billion for medical monitoring and drug refunds, and $429 
million in plaintiffs attorney fees. The company has also agreed to 
pay $25 million for heart disease research. 
</P>
<P>
	Payments to be made during the next two years are anticipated to  
total $1.85 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the settlement would cause it to record  
expenses of about $3.29 billion, after taxes and insurance 
coverage. American Home took in about $13 billion in revenue last 
year and earned $2.5 billion in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In the only verdict yet to be rendered in any fen-phen lawsuit,  
Debbie Lovett, 36, of Grand Saline, Texas was awarded $23.3 million 
in July by a jury for heart damage she suffered after taking 
fen-phen for more than three months. Last month the company said it 
settled the case for less than 10 percent of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	A civil trial had been under way in New Jersey over whether the  
company should be liable for the cost of medical monitoring, but 
was suspended earlier this week as the settlement appeared near.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Test Ban Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *BARRY SCHWEID   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton urged the Senate on Thursday  
to ``do what's right for America'' and ratify an international ban 
on nuclear weapons tests. Facing potential rejection of the treaty, 
Clinton hoped for postponement of a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives the people who made early commitments, I think  
wrongly, but they did it, the chance to move to doing the Senate's 
business the way the Senate should do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate votes on and rejects the treaty next week, it  
would be the first time in modern history an arms control pact was 
turned down on Capitol Hill. It also could signal the collapse of 
bipartisan support for arms control in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, trying to reverse the tide, invoked a ``moral  
responsibility for future generations'' even as supporters conceded 
there seemed little chance to muster the two-thirds vote needed for 
Senate approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said the treaty ``gives us tools to strengthen our  
security'' and ``to throw away these tools will ensure more testing 
and more development of more sophisticated and more dangerous 
nuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before a political fund-raising trip to New York,  
Clinton said ``future generations won't forgive us if we fail that 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was not trying to ``beat up'' Republican  
opponents but was asking that ``we do what is in the national 
interest. Let's just do what's right for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is bigger than party politics,'' he said. ``This is  
bigger than personal politics. This is about America's future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright planned a pitch for the  
treaty before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., told the committee there was precedent  
for delaying the vote, citing the treaty to ban chemical weapons. 
Levin said a delay would give senators more time to propose changes 
in the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the senior Democrat on  
the committee, said he was ready to vote now. ``The single-most 
important thing this committee can do is to attend to this 
treaty,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposing the treaty, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said the  
approval of 30 nations would be required to carry out an on-site 
inspection, thereby permitting opponents of the United States to 
block monitoring of suspicious activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, meanwhile, told the Senate  
Armed Services Committee that rejection of the 154-nation 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ``would announce that the United 
States refuses to lead on this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testing is not needed to make sure U.S. nuclear weapons would  
work, Richardson said. The nuclear stockpile is ``safe, secure and 
reliable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Republican and Democratic leaders sought ways to postpone  
a vote, a group of conservatives led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., 
kept up pressure for proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has rejected their demand that Clinton put in  
writing any request to delay a vote on an international nuclear 
test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservatives also want Clinton to promise -- in writing --  
not to seek to revive the treaty during the 2000 presidential 
election year, a condition the White House has also rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., served notice on  
Senate leaders that he planned to block any effort to postpone a 
vote, whether Clinton seeks it in writing or not. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has made the treaty a top priority ``and  
should live with the consequences,'' Inhofe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats acknowledged there seemed to be little way either to  
win ratification or persuade Republican leaders to postpone the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to kill it, I guess they can do it,'' Biden told  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty has virtually no Republican support.

	SANBU, Japan (AP) -- Laura Davies shot a 4-under-par 68 Thursday  
to share with two Japanese players the first-round lead in the 
$741,000 Takara World Invitational. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> House Approves HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Capping a two-year struggle, the House  
approved a sweeping bill meant to give patients a stronger hand in 
dealing with their health insurance companies, including a 
controversial new right to file lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	The final vote, 275-151, came after intense lobbying on both  
sides, including President Clinton, who phoned lawmakers from Air 
Force One. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time we asked the insurance industry to be responsible  
for its actions,'' said Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., who joined 
with Democrats to push the bill -- first to the House floor and then 
to passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, the House rejected a GOP-backed patient  
protection bill that included new rights to sue, but only in 
federal court and only in limited circumstances. That vote was 
238-193, with 29 Republicans joining all but two Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	For two years, Democrats have put the GOP on the defensive over  
the politically popular HMO issue. Republican leaders, struggling 
with a slim majority and a fractured caucus, did not endorse any 
bill until debate opened on the issue this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But they worked fiercely in recent days to rally support for  
their version. Many Republicans reluctantly supported it in hopes 
of defeating the broader Democratic bill, and supporters painted it 
as a compromise between the Democratic approach and doing nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a solid, balanced approach that I urge you to  
support,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``The 
difference in these bills is how far you go. How far you give 
license to the trial lawyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats argued that it did not go far enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``It fails to hold health care providers accountable. It lets  
them off the hook,'' said Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the House bill must be reconciled with a considerably more  
limited version already approved by the Senate. The Senate bill has 
no new rights to sue and excludes many Americans from other patient 
protections. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the House rejected, 284-145, the most modest of four  
competing patient-protection bills. Backed by Rep. John Boehner, 
R-Ohio, it would have given patients now new rights to file 
lawsuits. It was the first choice of conservative Republicans and 
their allies in the business and insurance industries. 
</P>
<P>
	It also rejected a similar plan backed by Reps. Amo Houghton  
Jr., R-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Backers hoped it would 
attract more Democrats, but it failed 269-160. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law now effectively bans such lawsuits for millions of  
Americans, even if they are injured or die because of an HMO's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill approved today allows patients to sue HMOs in federal  
or state court and to collect whatever damages a jury might award. 
</P>
<P>
	Managed care has dominated the health debate on Capitol Hill all  
year, as Congress responds to voters' frustration over cost cutting 
and fears they may be denied needed care. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, hoping to keep Democrats united, Clinton today sent a  
letter to Capitol Hill restating his strong support for a broad 
bill that would give patients a host of new rights, including broad 
new rights to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leaders feared that concerns over how to pay for it  
may cost them votes, but Clinton sought to clarify that he still 
strongly supports the bill. He promised not to sign any bill that 
was not fully paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I endorse this legislation without reservation,'' Clinton said  
in a letter to Gephardt. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some Republicans argued that the threat of a  
lawsuit is needed to force insurance companies to provide promised 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tell welfare mothers, we tell deadbeat dads ... you have to  
be responsible for yourself,'' said Norwood, the leading Republican 
backer of the right to sue. Health insurance, he said, is ``the 
only industry in America where we say you are absolutely protected 
from being responsible for your actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP strategy has been to focus attention on the uninsured,  
as Republicans argue that new rights will drive up the cost of 
insurance and force employers to drop coverage. Hammering the point 
Wednesday, Republicans pushed through a bill, 227-205, aimed at 
reducing the ranks of the uninsured, which now stand at 44 million.

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian shares ended higher Thursday on Wall  
Street's gains, while the region's biggest market, Tokyo, rose for 
the sixth straight session on growing optimism about Japan's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained  
240.13 points, or 1.34 percent, to close at 18,136.55. The average 
had risen 0.63 percent on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is pretty strong. The outlook for the Japanese  
economy is bright,'' said Sachio Ishikawa of Chuo Securities in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent positive signs -- such as two straight quarters of  
economic growth -- have fueled optimism that Japan may have 
weathered the worst of its downturn. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was trading at 107.92 yen  
on the Tokyo foreign exchange market late Thursday afternoon, up 
0.56 yen from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing that a strong yen could hamper economic recovery,  
Japan's vice finance minister Haruhiko Kuroda said Thursday that 
the strengthening of the yen has eased slightly. A stronger yen 
makes Japanese goods less competitive abroad and could hurt 
corporate earnings if sales suffer as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares closed higher although prices were unable  
to hold onto big early gains that followed Wall Street's overnight 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index rose 95.22 points, or 0.7 percent, to close  
at 13,113.20. 
</P>
<P>
	The index had gained 0.1 percent on Wednesday and investors  
started a buying spree early Thursday that pushed the blue chips up 
1.8 percent by midday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders had taken their cue from the 1.8 percent gain of the Dow  
Jones industrial average in New York on Wednesday, but prices 
drifted lower in the afternoon in the absence of any domestic 
market-moving news. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Shares rose on gains on Wall Street and other regional  
markets. The SET index gained 2.55 points, or 0.65 percent, to end 
at 397.64. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Shares fell as investors cashed in on recent gains. The  
JSX Composite Index fell 3.404 points, or 0.6 percent, to 585.345. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Shares rose 2.9 percent on optimism over possible  
elections and Malaysia's bank merger plan. The Composite Index rose 
20.54 points to 734.73. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Shares rose on Wall Street's overnight gains. The PSE  
Index ended up 14.11 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,071.64. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Shares climbed 1.5 percent as Wall Street's rally lured  
investors into the Taiwanese market. The Weighted Price Index rose 
110.37 points to 7,612.00. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Shares rose on strong gains in the futures market. The  
All Ordinaries Index rose 15.2 points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,912.

The Straits Times Index rose 19.26 points, or 0.92 percent, at 
2,119.97 points. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: Shares rose on hefty gains by market heavyweight  
Telecom Corp. of New Zealand. The NZSE-40 closed up 11.88 points,

<HEADLINE> Settlement Over Saipan Sweatshops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ralph Lauren and Donna Karan are among five  
major clothing retailers that have agreed to settle a class-action 
lawsuit which claimed workers on a Pacific island manufactured 
clothes under sweatshop conditions, plaintiffs' lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Litigation is still pending against factories in Saipan and  
several other U.S. companies including The Gap, Tommy Hilfiger and 
Wal-Mart, said Al Meyerhoff, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. Four 
other companies have agreed to the settlement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nine of the nation's premier fashion houses have agreed to do  
the right thing in Saipan,'' Meyerhoff said. ``The other retailers 
have some explaining to do why they don't agree to this plan to 
clean up intolerable factories in Saipan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, which Meyerhoff said was reached Wednesday,  
calls for retailers to establish a fund to finance an independent 
monitoring program, provide money to the workers, create a public 
education campaign and pay attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the five companies did not return phone  
messages after business hours. 
</P>
<P>
	It requires the approval of a federal judge.  
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs contend that garment employees on the Pacific  
island work under oppressive conditions and are paid low wages, 
violations of American labor laws and international human rights 
treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies agreeing to the terms were Ralph Lauren,  
Phillips-Van Heusen, Bryland L.P., Donna Karan International and 
The Dress Barn Inc., according to Meyerhoff. The retailers who 
agreed to the settlement in June were Nordstrom Inc., J. Crew Group 
Inc., Cutter &AMP; Buck Inc. and Gymboree Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the agreement, workers will be protected from what  
Meyerhoff described as indentured servitude. Young women are often 
recruited from China, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Thailand with 
promises of good wages and agree to be brought to Saipan for a fee, 
sometimes as high as $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The women then agree to pay off that fee with their wages, he  
said. The settlement requires factory owners to ensure that 
employees have not paid a recruitment fee. If they have, the 
factories must reimburse them. 
</P>
<P>
	About 14,000 sweatshop workers, mostly young women, are  
currently on the island, but the class-action lawsuit represents 
about 50,000 women, including past workers, Meyerhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saipan is a 13-mile-long Western Pacific island in the Northern  
Marianas. Labor activists claim that 32 Saipan factories -- mostly 
owned by Chinese, Japanese and Korean subcontractors -- stamp 
clothing with ``Made in the USA'' tags, which makes consumers 
believe the items were made in compliance with U.S. labor laws.

<HEADLINE> Playoffs Feature Tough Pitching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Same story.  
</P>
<P>
	Different ending.  
</P>
<P>
	As the results from baseball's postseason trickle in, this much  
is already apparent: Pitching still dominates, but it's just not 
the dominant pitchers we expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The name ``Cy Young'' turns up in Greg Maddux's trophy case  
almost as many times as his own. But who won the first real 
must-win game Atlanta faced this year? 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Millwood.  
</P>
<P>
	And while even casual fans should recognize the only member of  
the Braves' staff with an outside shot at the Cy Young award this 
season, it's hard to look past the Big Three of Maddux, Tom Glavine 
and John Smoltz and settle on Millwood's name. Not that pitching 
coach Leo Mazzone had trouble finding the youngster. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been our best starter all year,'' Mazzone said very  
matter-of-factly after Millwood threw a complete-game, one-hitter 
to even the division series with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``And considering the company he keeps,'' Mazzone added,  
``that's saying something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may say something about the Braves as well.  
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta is making an unprecedented eighth straight run into the  
postseason, but has only one World Series title to show for it. As 
much as the Big Three dominate the regular season -- they own seven 
Cy Youngs between them -- Smoltz is the only one who remains just as 
unbeatable in the postseason, 11-3 for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing Game 1, Maddux, the best pitcher of his era, is a  
very average 9-9 in the postseason (with one save); Glavine, an 
even less-impressive 9-11. 
</P>
<P>
	But Atlanta isn't the only town where it pays dividends to pay  
attention to who's pitching once the regular season is done. 
</P>
<P>
	At $8.25 million, Roger Clemens is the most expensive pitcher on  
the Yankees' staff. But he won't get the ball until Game 3 for a 
very good reason. Clemens' postseason mark in nine starts is 1-2. 
Compare that with New York's Game 1 winner, Orlando Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	`El Duque'' cost the club $2.2 million last season, but that  
only hints at the bargain he's become. In three career postseason 
starts, he's 3-0 and has allowed just one run in 22 innings. But 
even he may not turn out to be the bargain of the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans in Cleveland like to call Bartolo Colon a younger version  
of Boston ace Pedro Martinez. But until they hooked up in the 
opener of the Red Sox-Indians division series, the comparisons were 
hardly flattering. 
</P>
<P>
	Colon, who makes just $625,000, had been matched up three times  
during the regular season against Martinez, who makes $12.5 
million. And when Colon departed Game 1 after allowing just five 
hits and two runs in eight innings, he still hadn't beaten Boston. 
But he left the Indians in much better shape than did Martinez, who 
strained his back while covering first base on a routine grounder 
to the right side. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk about a shift in momentum. There were two very unsettling  
jinxes colliding in the game. On one side was the Red Sox' 1-17 
postseason streak, dating back to Bill Buckner's miscue in the 1986 
World Series. The one win, coincidentally enough, belonged to 
Martinez and came against Cleveland in the opener of last year's 
series. On the other side was the Indians' streak of eight straight 
losses in playoff openers. 
</P>
<P>
	So relieved were the Indians fans to see Martinez go that they  
greeted Boston reliever Derek Lowe with an ovation. They must have 
known something, because Lowe was even tougher on the Indians' 
lineup than Martinez during the regular season, holding them to a 
1-for-30 performance. 
</P>
<P>
	But this being the postseason, Jim Thome hit a two-out, two-run,  
game-tying homer off Lowe in the next inning and the Indians 
eventually won on Travis Fryman's RBI in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	The momentum spilled into Thursday and threatened to become an  
avalanche when Boston announced Martinez wouldn't be available 
until Game 5 -- assuming the series stretches that far. 
</P>
<P>
	Few people intimidate hitters more than Martinez, but Randy  
Johnson, Arizona's 6-foot-10 left-hander, has to be one of them. 
Johnson is also one of the few NL pitchers to have a better season 
than Millwood -- they finished 1-2 in the ERA race, and could do the 
same in Cy Young balloting. But the postseason might turn out to be 
another story. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's loss in Game 1 of the Mets-Diamondbacks series was his  
sixth straight in the postseason, a major league record. The game 
wasn't decided until Johnson left after walking Melvin Mora in the 
ninth. Arizona manager Buck Showalter went to Bobby Chouinard, then 
played a hunch and let him face red-hot Edgar Alfonzo, instead of 
using closer Matt Mantei. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like he was best suited for the situation,'' Showalter  
said after Alfonzo hit a grand slam off Chouinard. ``He's done the 
job for us most of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that should have been the tip-off.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes 2, Flyers 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Ron Francis had a goal and an assist and  
Arturs Irbe made 30 saves as the Carolina Hurricanes beat the 
Philadelphia Flyers 2-0 Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss marks the first time in the Flyers' 33-year history  
that they have gone scoreless in their first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Bates Battaglia also scored for the Hurricanes, who are picking  
up where they left off last year when they allowed a franchise-low 
202 goals. Carolina surrendered only one goal in its 3-1 
season-opening win at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Irbe, who set a Carolina franchise record last year with six  
shutouts, has 20 for his career. He was especially strong in the 
second period when the Flyers outshot the Hurricanes 11-0 in the 
first 10 minutes, 15-6 overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia failed in three power-play attempts and is 0-9 in  
its first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis gave the Hurricanes a 1-0 lead at 4:52 of the first  
period when he flicked the puck off the skate of Flyers goaltender 
John Vanbiesbrouck from the front of the right circle for an 
unassisted goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, who recently replaced holdout Keith Primeau as  
Carolina's captain, assisted on Battaglia's goal at 13:18 of the 
second period. Battaglia rebounded a wrist shot over 
Vanbiesbrouck's shoulder after the goaltender failed to control 
Francis' shot from the slot. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time Philadelphia was shut out in consecutive games was  
in February 1995, when Ottawa and Florida each won 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers defenseman Eric Desjardins played in his first game since  
losing eight teeth after being hit by Kirk Maltby's slap shot in an 
exhibition game at Detroit on Sept. 28. Desjardins wore a special 
plastic and mesh cage to protect his mouth.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Leaning Toward Reform Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan says  
he is likely to leave the GOP to seek the Reform Party's nomination 
-- a move he says has ``the Washington establishment in mortal 
terror.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting Wednesday morning with Reform Party chairman  
Russell Verney, Buchanan said he is ``leaning toward'' mounting a 
third-party presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real possibility,'' he said at a book-signing after the  
hourlong meeting. ``We are looking into it very hard right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said political attacks on him and the Reform Party show  
that Democrats and Republicans fear a viable third-party candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a fear on the part of the establishment that maybe  
this time a third-party candidate who gets in the debates will walk 
away with the presidency of the United States,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who twice has sought the Republican nomination, plans  
to announce a decision by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Verney said that while Reform Party officials have not endorsed  
a candidate, Buchanan has enough grassroots support to petition to 
compete in the 30 state primaries in which the Reform Party is not 
automatically on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	The party will choose a nominee at a national convention next  
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker also is considering  
seeking the party's nomination. Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the 
highest elected Reform Party member, is cool to a Buchanan 
candidacy and has urged real estate tycoon Donald Trump to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, interviewed Wednesday on ``Dateline NBC,'' said he feared  
that if Buchanan joined the Reform Party he would move the party to 
the fringes and make it less appealing to mainstream candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	But Trump said he would not run simply to thwart Buchanan.  
</P>
<P>
	``That wouldn't be the reason I'd run,'' he said. ``I wouldn't  
run unless I really thought I had a chance to win the entire 
election. It wouldn't be worth it to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reform Party founder Ross Perot has not ruled out a third  
presidential race, although members of the splinter American Reform 
Party already have voiced opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot did not meet with Buchanan Wednesday and plans to stay  
silent throughout the nominating process, Verney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said if he were to win the nomination, the party's  
rolls would grow as disenchanted Republicans and Democrats seek 
alternative candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Republican front-runner George W. Bush, Buchanan said the  
Texas governor is unprepared for the nation's highest office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is his depth, his knowledge, his wisdom,''  
Buchanan said. ``The governor has not exhibited any depth on 
foreign policy whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the criticism Buchanan's book, ``A Republic, Not an  
Empire, has received for questioning U.S. involvement in World War 
II, hundreds of book buyers waited in line for hours to meet 
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Sprouse, a 60-year-old telecommunications worker from  
Garland, said he traditionally has voted Republican but would 
change his party allegiance if Buchanan ran on the Reform Party 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd vote for the man, not the party,'' said Sprouse. ``America  
needs a choice.''

<HEADLINE> Mars Failure Probe Leader Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arthur G. Stephenson, director of NASA's  
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., will head the 
investigation into the failure of the Mars Climate Orbiter mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft was lost Sept. 23 as it entered orbit around  
Mars. A preliminary investigation indicated that the cause was 
failure to convert measurements from one system to another. 
</P>
<P>
	One group of technicians was using the metric system, normally  
used in science worldwide, while another reportedly supplied 
measurements in the English system. The measurements were used in 
navigating the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephenson was appointed to head the investigation on Wednesday  
by NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin. 
</P>
<P>
	Other members of the investigation board will be named shortly  
and their initial findings are due Nov. 3.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Curbs Cellular Phone Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- BP Amoco plans to warn customers against using  
cellular telephones at its gasoline pumps in the United States amid 
concern that electronic impulses could start a fire, a company 
spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk is slight, but London-based BP Amoco doesn't want to  
take any chances, said Linda McCray, a company spokeswoman in 
Cleveland. The company will post warning signs at Amoco and BP 
stations by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are unaware of any incidents here in the U.S. in which a  
cellular has been linked to a fire or an explosion,'' she said. 
``This is not a ban -- this is a precautionary warning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said customers still will be allowed to use cell phones away  
from gas pumps. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chevron Corp. also plans to warn against using cell phones.  
The company will place warning decals on gas pumps later this year, 
said Nancy Malinowski, a Chevron spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	The city of Cicero, Ill., a Chicago suburb, recently passed the  
first law in the nation banning the use of cellular phones at gas 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cell phone manufacturers have included warnings against such use  
in owner's manuals for years because they say that under certain 
conditions, cell phones could help generate sparks. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute, which is looking into the  
reports, has so far found no substantiated reports of fires.

<HEADLINE> Allison's Wrist Injury Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Boston Bruins forward Jason Allison has torn  
cartilage in his wrist, and he could need surgery if it continues 
to worsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Allison, who played in Thursday night's 4-3 loss to the Ottawa  
Senators, said one doctor told him to rest, while another told him 
he needed surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are all kinds of tears in the muscle,'' he said  
Wednesday, a day after an MRI revealed the damage. ``There are 
different options. If it gets better, I can play with it and rest 
it on the off days. If it doesn't, I'll have to take a little time 
off to get the swelling down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allison, who will continue to play for now, said the injury  
worsened when he took faceoffs on opening night against Carolina on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been battling on faceoffs,'' he said Thursday.  
``(Faceoffs) are something I have to make my game better. I have to 
get a little stronger.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Twins Owner May Sell Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Twins owner Carl Pohlad has  
agreed to sell his team to Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor and Wild 
lead investor Robert Naegele Jr. if a new stadium is built, WCCO-TV 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman, who sought the sale as part of plan  
to build a new stadium, ad not seen documents that outlined the 
proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
	WCCO-TV reported the purchase price would be $120 million. Under  
the agreement, Pohlad would hand over control of the team to Taylor 
and Naegele. 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal would be contingent on St. Paul voters approving a Nov.  
2 referendum that includes a financing plan. The deal also would 
need approval from the Minnesota Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, major league baseball owners must approve any  
transfer, a process that usually takes 6-to-18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Wild spokesman Bill Robertson said no agreement had been reached  
but both sides continued talks.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Assigns Computer Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a sign that the Pentagon sees a growing  
threat from cyber-warfare, it is assigning to U.S. Space Command 
the responsibility for defending the military's computer networks, 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Space Command, headed by Air Force Gen. Richard Myers and  
headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colo., also will develop 
cyber-attack capabilities starting in October 2000, a senior U.S. 
military officer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said  
the Pentagon envisions possible computer attacks on enemy air 
defense networks, for example, in times of war. ``We want to 
explore that potential,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, Space Command will focus on defending the  
military's computer networks from outside attack, the officer said. 
The Pentagon has become increasingly concerned recently at the 
vulnerability of its computers not only to private hackers but also 
to possible deliberate attack from enemy forces. 
</P>
<P>
	These moves are part of a series of changes the Defense  
Department announced today in its Unified Command Plan, which 
spells out the roles, missions and structure of nine major combat 
commands. Under a 1986 law, the Pentagon is required to review the 
command plan at least every two years. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton approved the 1999 plan on Sept. 29, although  
it was not disclosed publicly until today. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen was flying to Norfolk, Va.,  
today to trumpet another change to the command structure -- the 
renaming of U.S. Atlantic Command to U.S. Joint Forces Command, 
headquartered in Norfolk. The change reflects an increased emphasis 
on joint training among the services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Joint Forces Command also will have the added responsibility  
of running a special task force -- to be headed by a two-star 
general from the reserves -- to support civilian agencies such as 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency in managing the aftermath 
of an incident on U.S. territory involving a nuclear, chemical or 
biological weapon, a senior defense official. 
</P>
<P>
	This official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
disaster-response capability was being established as a result of 
Clinton's May 1998 order to agencies to improve their ability to 
handle incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The magnitude of an ... (incident) like that is immense, and  
we just want to be prepared,'' the official said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Lower; Dow Down 49.07 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned lower today as investors took  
profit from yesterday's hefty jump in prices and worried about a 
spike in unemployment claims. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 49.07 at 10,587.71. Broader stock 
indicators also dropped. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 
4.03 at 1321.37, and the Nasdaq composite index was off 1.93 at 
2,855.28. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that the number of Americans  
filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week to the 
highest level in more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists fear a tight job market will push employers to offer  
higher wages and benefits to attract qualified workers. Those costs 
could drive up prices and spark inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve opted against raising interest  
rates for a third time this year. But the central bank, expressing 
concerns that a tight labor market could lead to inflation down the 
road, held open the door to another bump up in rates before year's 
end. Higher interest rates hurt stocks because they can hurt 
corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists believe Fed policymakers may raise rates at  
their next meeting on Nov. 16 . 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Yahoo! rose 8 to 184, after the Internet portal  
reported quarterly earnings results late Thursday that proved much 
stronger than analysts expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, General Electric, slipped 3/8 to 123 1/2 after the Dow  
component posted third-quarter profits that beat Wall Street 
forecasts by a penny. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow on Wednesday climbed 187.75 to 10,588.34. The Dow has  
rebounded nearly 375 points, or 3.7 percent, since last Wednesday, 
when it reached 10,213.48, its lowest point since April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 113.6 million shares, 
down from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index was down 1.45 at 428.31  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.3 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.2 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.8 percent, and France's AC-40 was up 
0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Rookie, Veteran Look To Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More Than Ready, a rookie, and Yagli, a veteran,  
will try to bounce back from defeat in two Grade I stakes Saturday 
at Belmont Park and re-establish their standing as major players in 
the Breeders' Cup races. 
</P>
<P>
	More Than Ready, who lost for the first time in six starts when  
he finished third, beaten only a half-length in the one-mile 
Futurity on Sept. 19 at Belmont, will oppose six other 2-year-old 
colts in the 1 1-16-mile Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory probably would make More Than Ready the favorite for  
the 1 1-16-mile Breeders' Cup Juvenile on Nov. 6 at Gulfstream 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-year-old Yagli also will be looking to re-establish  
himself as the likely horse to beat in the 1 1/2-mile Breeders' Cup 
Turf by beating six rivals in the 1 1/2-mile Turf Classic 
Invitational. In his last start, he had a three-race winning streak 
snapped when he finished seventh in the Sword Dancer on Aug. 14 at 
Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	The Champagne and Turf Classic are two of five Grade I weekend  
stakes at Belmont that will serve as Breeders' Cup preps. 
</P>
<P>
	Contested on Sunday will be the 1 1/4-mile Jockey Club Gold Cup,  
the 1 1/8-mile Beldame for fillies and mares and the 1 1-16-mile 
Frizette for 2-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid, the Belmont Stakes and Travers winner, will make  
his debut against older horses, including Behrens, the handicap 
division leader, in the weight-for-age Jockey Club Gold Cup. The 
sensational Silverbulletday also will make her debut against older 
fillies and mares in the Beldame. Entries for all three Sunday 
races were to be taken today. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's races will be part of an ESPN-2 telecast from 4  
p.m.-5:30 p.m. EDT. The three Sunday stakes will be televised by 
NBC from 2:30 p.m.-4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the best 2-year-old race of the year,'' said John Kimmel,  
trainer of Champagne starter Chief Seattle, who finished fourth in 
the 1-mile Futurity, in which More Than Ready was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Others entered Thursday in the $400,000 Champagne were High  
Yield, winner of the Hopeful at Saratoga; Bulling, third in the 
Sanford and fourth in the Saratoga Special; Greenwood Lake; 
Settlement, the Hopeful runnerup; and Traditionally, making his 
stakes debut. Each starter will carry 122 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``By far, he is the horse I'm most concerned about,'' Kimmel  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	More Than Ready was supposed to start in the Hopeful, but got a  
fever and was taken out of training briefly. The Futurity was the 
first start in 52 days for the colt. Three of his five wins were in 
the six-furlong Sanford on July 29 and earlier in the Flash and 
Tremont at Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bill Mott-trained Yagli, being pointed to the Breeders' Cup  
Turf, won the Gulfstream Park Handicap, Manhattan Handicap at 
Belmont and the United Nations Handicap at Monmouth Park before 
finishing seventh in the Sword Dancer on Aug. 14 at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Yagli's rivals will be Val's Prince and Single Empire,  
1-2 in the 1 3/8-mile Man o'War on Sept. 11 at Belmont. Two others 
will be Dream Well, a stakes winner in France and third in the 
Irish Champion Stakes, and Sunshine Street, fourth in the Irish 
Champion, both of whom will be making their U.S. debuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the field for the $600,000 Turf Classic are Fahris  
and Star Performance. Each starter will carry 126 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Others entered in the $600,000 Turf Classic are Fahris, Star  
Performance, Dream Well, Single Empire and Sunshine Street. Each 
starter will carry 126 pounds.

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A prosecutor who was probing possible  
military involvement in the murder of Roman Catholic Bishop Juan 
Gerardi resigned on Thursday and fled the country in fear -- 
following the path of a judge in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with a local radio network, Prosecutor Celvin  
Galindo said he was ``frustrated at not reaching the end (of the 
case), but I believe that in reaching the end of the case I would 
run a very great risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from an undisclosed location in the United States,  
Galindo also questioned the ability or will of Guatemala's 
government to resolve the high-profile murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sadly in Guatemala there is a lack of security conditions to  
continue, and above all the internal support to be able to continue 
on so grave a case as this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerardi, the 75-year-old head of the Guatemalan church's human  
rights office, was bludgeoned to death on April 26, 1998, two days 
after releasing a major report cataloging human rights abuses 
during the country's 36-year civil war and blaming most of them on 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
	The first judge and prosecutor overseeing the case were forced  
to resign after international complaints that they had gone out of 
their way to ignore evidence the army might be involved. They had 
arrested another priest on suspicion of the murder. That man was 
later released. 
</P>
<P>
	The second judge, Henry Monroy, quit in March after only a month  
on the job and fled to Canada. He said he had received death 
threats after authorizing investigation of possible political 
motives in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Galindo implied that his children had been threatened, though he  
did not give details. ``When they begin to meddle with them, then 
they began to exercise more pressure,'' Galindo said, adding that 
his children ``have no blame for what I have been doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galindo had been investigating the movements of soldiers around  
Gerardi's house at the time of the slaying. He had ordered DNA 
analyses of blood from the scene compared with those of several 
soldiers and also had subpoenaed some military log books. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he felt ``satisfied in the sense that I believe we have  
advanced quite a lot. We leave a basis ready for a solution of the 
case whenever they want to resolve it, or find the will to resolve 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Independent human rights activist Helen Mack Chang said that  
just as Galindo had begun to build scientific evidence against 
those involved in the case, ``the pressure began, the death 
threats, and he had to withdraw. It is very sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very worried and really we greatly lament this because  
it brings us to the conclusion there is no political will to 
clarify this crime,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor's office announced that the new prosecutor would  
be Anibal Sanchez Merida and it insisted he would have full support 
for his investigations.

	House Rejects Modest HMO Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House members today rejected the most modest  
of four competing patient-protection bills as they confronted the 
politically charged issue of HMOs and whether injured Americans 
should be allowed to sue them. Managed care has dominated the 
health debate on Capitol Hill all year, as Congress responds to 
voters' frustration over cost cutting and fears they may be denied 
needed care. The House defeated, 284-145, a bill sponsored by Rep. 
John Boehner, R-Ohio, which would have given patients no new rights 
to file lawsuits. Federal law now effectively bans such suits for 
millions of Americans, even if they are injured or die because of 
an HMO's decision.

	Trump Moves Toward Presidential Run  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York tycoon Donald Trump said today that  
he has formed an exploratory committee to help him determine 
whether he can win the White House as a Reform Party candidate. 
``We're looking at the very strong possibility that we could win -- 
and not just the (third party) nomination,'' Trump said in a 
telephone interview from New York. In a further sign of Trump's 
seriousness, he is meeting tonight with Minnesota Gov. Jesse 
Ventura -- the Reform Party's leading elected official. Ventura is 
trying to find a candidate he can back in what is shaping to be a 
fractious nomination fight.

	$3.3B Offered to Nazi Labor Victims  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorneys for Nazi slave-labor survivors said  
today the German government and industries have offered $3.3 
billion to compensate for World War II atrocities and labeled the 
offer ``an enormous disappointment.'' ``I told the German 
delegation they have done more harm to the German government and 
German people than they can ever imagine,'' said Mel Weiss, an 
attorney for survivors in class-action suits in U.S. courts. ``The 
offer amounts to about $300 million or less in 1940 terms,'' he 
said.

	Cincinnati Gun Lawsuit Dismissed

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- An Ohio state judge today dismissed the city's  
lawsuit against gun manufacturers, a distributor and three trade 
associations on the grounds that it was vague and unsupported by 
legal precedent. Today's action was the first dismissal of such a 
suit, a lawyer for gun manufacturers said. Jim Dorr, a Chicago 
lawyer for gun makers Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co. Inc., of Southport, Conn., 
and Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., of Springfield, Mass., said he hopes to 
use the ruling by Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Robert 
Ruehlman in seeking the dismissal of 17 similar lawsuits

	VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico (AP) -- Furious rains sent swollen rivers  
raging through the streets of the Gulf coast city of Villahermosa 
and caused mudslides that killed dozens in eastern Mexico's coastal 
mountain ranges as rain continued in some areas today. In low-lying 
areas, people isolated by rising rivers clung to trees or rooftops 
awaiting help. At least 123 people throughout Mexico were killed by 
mudslides and floodwaters and more than 150,000 others were driven 
from their homes by the rains that flooded 10 states in eastern and 
southern Mexico.

little chance to prevail. Clinton asserted the treaty ``gives us 
tools to strengthen our security'' again held out the possibility 
that a vote, now scheduled for Tuesday in the Senate, could be 
postponed. Clinton spoke before leaving for New York City for a

hundreds of Korean refugees were killed by U.S. soldiers in the 
early days of the Korean War. It marked the first time government 
investigators had formal interviews with people who have long 
contended that retreating American soldiers kept South Korean 
refugees under a railroad bridge at the hamlet of No Gun Ri and 
killed hundreds of them in July 1950. The investigators also 
visited the bullet-scarred railroad bridge.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Up in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's biggest retailers reported today  
that sales rose modestly in September as the robust U.S. economy 
continued to encourage shoppers to spend despite volatility in the 
stock market, stormy weather and rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd, which battered the East Coast in the middle of  
last month, boosted sales at discounters and home improvement 
stores -- which benefited from shoppers stockpiling everything from 
flashlights to food. 
</P>
<P>
	Many department stores, however, were hurt by the storm, which  
caused extensive flooding that closed malls and roadways. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are still anxious to spend. That hasn't changed a  
bit,'' said Kurt Barnard, president of the newsletter Barnard's 
Retail Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. ``The only factor 
playing into last month was the hurricane, which gave many stores 
in the East a whipping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers continue to enjoy one of their strongest years in  
recent history. They have benefited greatly from the resilient U.S. 
economy with low unemployment and tame inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Many merchants, however, have worried in recent months that  
borrowing and spending would slow after the Federal Reserve raised 
interest rates twice this summer to try to keep the economy from 
overheating and to head off a resurgence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Fed's rate hikes have unsettled investors and shaken  
the stock market, consumers so far haven't slowed their spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``On balance, retailers are doing well and nothing points yet to  
a significant slowdown,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst at 
Lehman Brothers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners in September were the discount chains, such as  
Wal-Mart and Target, which continue to draw consumers with their 
wide selection and affordable prices. Kmart, however, reported 
disappointing sales due to aggressive price-cutting by competitors 
on back-to-school merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Specialty stores, such as the Limited, also reported healthy  
sales, luring shoppers with their trendy fashions, such as stretchy 
pants and vests. Cooler weather moving into parts of the country 
also lifted clothing sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprising analysts was Sears, which reported  
better-than-expected sales after months of disappointments. Strong 
demand for appliances, consumer electronics and women's apparel 
boosted sales last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a jump on its competitors, Wal-Mart reported Tuesday  
that its sales from stores open at least a year rose 7.2 percent in 
September compared with a year ago, while total sales rose 26.4 
percent from year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store  
sales, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Selected figures on September's sales at leading retail chains:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears, same-store sales rose 4.1 percent, total sales were flat  
with a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart, same-store sales up 2.5 percent, total sales up 4.5  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney, same-store department store sales down 0.1  
percent; same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores up 10.1 percent; 
total sales up 8.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson, same-store sales up 6.9 percent, total sales up  
11.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated, same-store sales up 3.7 percent, total sales up 15.7  
percent. Federated's total sales include revenues from the Internet 
and catalog seller Fingerhut, which was acquired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores, same-store sales up 1.7 percent, total  
sales up 6.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited, same-store sales up 8 percent, total sales up 1  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap, same-store sales up 7 percent, total sales up 28 percent.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Launches Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The Air Force today launched a $42  
million navigation satellite aboard a Delta rocket that was 
supposed to carry up a different spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing-built rocket should have lifted off earlier this year  
with another Global Positioning System satellite. But that 
satellite was damaged on the launch pad in May when rain leaked 
onto it. 
</P>
<P>
	A new GPS satellite was loaded onto the rocket, which soared at  
8:51 a.m. following multiple weather delays. The successful launch 
brought the number of operational GPS satellites in orbit to 28. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the Air Force's first launch from Cape Canaveral since  
a Titan rocket dumped a military communication satellite into the 
wrong orbit back in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force hopes to launch the rain-damaged satellite next  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Global Positioning System, originally designed for the  
military to pinpoint locations, is booming in the commercial 
market, too. Many luxury cars have GPS devices to help drivers find 
a route, and they are also used by aviators, boaters and even 
hikers.

<HEADLINE> Waco Probe Stalls on Capitol Hill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Majority Leader Dick Armey said Thursday  
he no longer sees a need for fresh hearings on the 1993 Waco siege, 
a new indication the GOP's zeal for reinvestigating the fiery end 
to the standoff is fizzling. 
</P>
<P>
	Expressing confidence in independent investigator John Danforth,  
Armey told reporters, ``I don't know that we will see any 
compelling need'' for House hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey's comments and recent remarks by other congressional  
Republicans are a sharp change from last month, when party leaders 
thundered that new revelations about the government's use of force 
against the Branch Davidians required in-depth congressional 
hearings and Attorney General Janet Reno's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, where Democrats only need to pick up six seats to  
win control in next year's election, some Republicans grew nervous 
that yet another investigation of the Clinton administration might 
backfire with voters. 
</P>
<P>
	There's more enthusiasm in the Senate for new investigations of  
Reno's agency. But the focus on Waco has been diluted by other 
complaints against the Justice Department -- such as allegations 
that it botched an investigation of Chinese espionage charges -- and 
muddied by Republican infighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's Waco fatigue,'' said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., a  
member of the House panel investigating Waco. He prefers postponing 
hearings until spring. ``There's a feeling that the political risk 
may be higher than the political gain of pursuing this subject at 
this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government Reform Committee Chairman Dan Burton, R-Ind., has  
promised to move aggressively with hearings. His investigators 
expect to receive more than a million Waco-related documents from 
the Justice and Defense departments within a week in response to a 
subpoena. Burton did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The revelations that sparked the furor include the FBI's  
admission that its agents fired potentially flammable tear gas 
canisters at the compound April 19, 1993, which the agency long 
denied. The FBI says the canisters, launched hours before the start 
of the fire that consumed the compound, bounced harmlessly off the 
roof of a nearby bunker and did not contribute to that fire. About 
80 Davidians died that day. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 9, the day after Reno announced Danforth's appointment,  
Armey said he wanted the House probe to be more sweeping than the 
independent prosecutor's: ``I want to know it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., agreed that  
congressional investigators should ``do it in the broadest possible 
way.'' He said the revelations made him doubt the conclusion that 
the Branch Davidians, and not the FBI, started the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Senate Republicans have been feuding among  
themselves over the investigation's scope and proper venue. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, wanted  
his panel to handle it. Instead, Lott last month announced a task 
force led by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a Judiciary Committee 
member, that would investigate the espionage charges as a first 
priority. Waco would be secondary, along with charges of Democratic 
campaign fund-raising abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats pre-emptively boycotted the task force as another in a  
string of ``partisan witch hunts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to take this thing out of the committee structure to  
really form a major, major fishing expedition to get this person or 
get that person,'' Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told Specter 
during a contentious Judiciary Committee meeting Thursday. Specter 
denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	But faced with such opposition, Hatch has made another pitch to  
take over the investigation. In an Oct. 5 letter to Specter 
obtained by The Associated Press, Hatch said the probe would have 
more credibility if it were done by a Judiciary Committee panel 
with the Democrats' participation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's momentum also was stalled by a turf battle between  
Specter and Danforth, a highly respected former GOP senator from 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	In two letters to Hatch and Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the  
committee's ranking Democrat, Danforth complained that Specter's 
staff was interviewing witnesses in violation of an agreement 
Danforth had struck with the Judiciary Committee. The Sept. 17 
letter complained about interference. In the Sept. 21 letter, also 
obtained by The Associated Press, Danforth said he had instructed 
the Texas Rangers ``not to consent to interviews or searches of 
evidence by Judiciary Committee staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specter agreed to back off until the end of October.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Wants To Aid Working Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETERBOROUGH, N.H. (AP) -- Offering relief to parents juggling  
jobs and families, Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley 
today proposed a $26 billion program of education grants for 
parents and children and an expanded family and medical leave law. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a plan that looks ahead to our long-term interests in  
human terms not just economic ones,'' Bradley said in remarks 
prepared for a campaign speech today at New Hampshire's Contoocook 
Valley Regional High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Nostlagic for his boyhood family dinners at a reliable 6:30 p.m.  
sharp, Bradley painted a familiar modern-day American portrait -- 
Dad working late, Mom at a meeting, kids dashing to the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new global economy just doesn't care about the 6:30 dinner  
hour,'' Bradley said, adding a poke at the Clinton-Gore 
administration's boast of economic success. ``A prosperity that 
fails to bolster families is a hollow and unsustainable one,'' 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $26 billion, 10-year cost of new grants for early childhood  
education and parent-friendly community colleges would be paid for 
-- like his $65 billion-per-year universal health plan -- from the 
federal budget surplus that is projected to reach about $1 trillion 
over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included in the package is an older-person's version of  
President Clinton's ``Americorps.'' With a goal of enlisting 
500,000 volunteers over three years, Bradley would offer a tax-free 
stipend of up to $200 a month to senior citizens who give at least 
15 hours per week to approved nonprofit youth programs such as the 
YMCA, Boys and Girls Clubs, school tutoring, or faith-based 
mentoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all in this together,'' said the former senator from  
New Jersey. ``And what individual families cannot build on their 
own, we can all build together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing a proposal voiced by Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday,  
Bradley said he would expand to workers in firms at least 25 
employees the popular Family and Medical Leave Act. The 1993 law, 
which currently applies only to businesses with 50 or more workers, 
guarantees them 12 weeks' unpaid leave to tend to a new child, a 
seriously ill family member or their own personal illness. 
</P>
<P>
	He said workers also should be given an additional 24 hours each  
year to meet other family obligations, such as attending 
parent-teacher conferences, taking a child to the dentist or 
helping an elderly relative with medical appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley aides appeared caught off guard when told late Wednesday  
that Gore, Bradley's rival for the Democratic presidential 
nomination next year, had articulated the same proposed changes to 
the family-leave law at a New York fund-raiser a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's plan would give $2 billion per year to state and local  
partnerships -- comprised of groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, 
Parent-Teacher Association, local child welfare agencies and 
churches -- to find new ways of tackling needs for child care, 
school readiness, parenting education and special services for 
children with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty percent of the new money would be reserved to bolster  
existing programs, such as Head Start, with the balance intended to 
pay for new services. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, Bradley said, ``operates under the simple  
understanding that we all have a shared responsibility for our 
children. Government, acting as a catalyst, can provide the kind of 
supporting infrastructure that families need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley would offer $2 billion over five years in competitive  
grants to community colleges that do a better job of matching high 
school graduates' needs with demands in the local job market, 
providing flexible class schedules and on-site child care for 
working parents and improving students' technological skills. 
</P>
<P>
	The programs' remaining costs involve the proposal for a senior  
volunteer corps. 
</P>
<P>
	``My proposal focuses on four areas that are of vital concern to  
all families and is premised on a simple idea: That if you have 
health care coverage, good child care, educational opportunity and 
supportive work environments, you can be a better parent,'' Bradley 
said.

<HEADLINE> NIH Head Leading NYC Cancer Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The director of the National Institutes of  
Health is resigning to become president of the Memorial 
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Harold Varmus said Thursday he will leave office Dec. 31 and  
assume his new job Jan. 1. He has directed the NIH since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``It clearly seems to me that people who run large institutions  
should be moving on after a period of time,'' Varmus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Varmus, 59, has been involved in cancer research for 30 years,  
and shared the 1989 Nobel prize in medicine for discovering a 
family of genes that helped scientists understand how cancer 
develops. 
</P>
<P>
	As director of NIH he has been one of the most powerful men in  
science. The position also put him at the center of controversial 
matters ranging from the battle against AIDS to the use of embryos 
in research and freedom of information in scientific matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said Varmus  
``brought new energy, vision and excitement to the world's greatest 
scientific institution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Varmus said he urged President Clinton to appoint a new NIH  
director before Clinton's term is up, and to consider active 
scientists for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	At Sloan-Kettering, Varmus will succeed Dr. Paul Marks, a former  
teacher of his at Columbia University, where Varmus received his 
medical degree in 1966. Marks had announced his intention to step 
down late last year.

<HEADLINE> Negotiators Agree on Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate negotiators completed work on  
a $268 billion defense spending bill that slows the Air Force's 
F-22 ``stealth'' fighter program but will keep the radar-evading 
jets flying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be business as usual'' at the Pentagon, Rep.  
Jerry Lewis, D-Calif., chairman of the Appropriations defense 
subcommittee, told reporters Thursday. ``If we're going to deal 
with fewer and fewer dollars, we have to deal with them wisely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appropriations bill now goes back to the House and Senate  
for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
	It provides $4.5 billion more for the fiscal year that began  
Oct. 1 than President Clinton requested, and $17.3 billion over 
last year's levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The increases include money to help pay for a 4.8 percent  
across-the-board military pay raise also included in a defense 
authorization bill signed earlier this week by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The final version of the bill retains a Senate-passed measure  
that would give the president permanent authority to waive all 
sanctions on India and Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic and military sanctions were imposed automatically after  
both nations conducted back-to-back nuclear tests in 1998. Congress 
temporarily waived a ban on the sale of agricultural goods. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense bill gives the president the authority to waive both  
economic and military sanctions. Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., a 
sponsor of the waiver provision, called the action ``good news for 
farmers (and) for the aircraft industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a citizens group that opposes the F-22 criticized the  
decision to keep the fighter program alive. ``This fig leaf 
solution serves nothing. It just extends the F-22 debate into next 
year,'' the Council for a Livable World said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate negotiators finished their work at a  
closed-door session late Wednesday and released details Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, the final version included a compromise reached by  
negotiators last week on the F-22, the most expensive jet fighter 
ever built. 
</P>
<P>
	The House had voted to suspended the line entirely, while the  
Senate bill would have given the Air Force the full $1.8 billion 
requested by the administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The compromise recommends a year's delay in production and would  
give the Air Force $1 billion for the program instead of the $1.8 
billion, some of which could be used to buy test planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill sets aside $300 million to reimburse Lockheed Martin  
Corp., the prime contractor, in case the planes fail the testing 
and the program is terminated. Otherwise, the money could be spent 
to help build the planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force hopes to buy up to 339 of the jets. But Rep. John  
Murtha of Pennsylvania, the senior Democrat on the defense 
subcommittee, said Thursday it seemed unlikely the Air Force would 
be able to buy more than about 140 of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're never going to build the numbers that are there,'' he  
said. ``They're going to become more expensive. The money just 
isn't there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would make a $375 million installment on a $1.5  
billion LHD-8 mini aircraft carrier to be built at a shipyard in 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's hometown of Pascagoula, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy did not want funds to start building the ship until  
fiscal 2005, but Lott persuaded the Senate to put $500 million in 
its version of the spending bill. The original House bill had 
provided nothing.

	PHOENIX (AP) -- The town of Gilbert just outside Phoenix is free  
to celebrate ``Bible Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union had sued  
Gilbert and Mayor Cynthia Dunham on the grounds that her 
proclamation of the week was unconstitutional. But U.S. District 
Judge Roslyn O. Silver ruled the suit invalid because the 
plaintiffs suffered no legal injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said whether Bible Week violates the doctrine of  
separation of church and state should be determined by ``political 
branches of government subject to majority rule,'' or at least 
should await a plaintiff who could prove legal standing to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case never belonged in court,'' said Walter M. Weber, an  
attorney with the American Center for Law and Justice who helped 
represent Dunham. ``The mayor is once more free to proclaim Bible 
Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Bible Association in New York created Bible Week in  
1941 to bring communities together. Proponents say the week is 
meant to encourage people to read the Bible and to recognize its 
historical and cultural roots in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, the association asks one mayor and one governor to  
send letters urging other states and cities to proclaim Bible Week. 
Last year, Gov. Jane Hull and Dunham responded, proclaiming Nov. 
22-29 as Bible Week in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The celebration was put on hold after Silver issued a temporary  
restraining order.

 *Donkeys headed for Honduras are blessed    	
</P>
<P>
	PERRYVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Ten Mammoth Jack donkeys bound for  
Honduras to help in the Central American country's year-old 
hurricane recovery were blessed before their departure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Richard Davis blessed the animals in a ceremony at a  
ranch south of Perryville. The donkeys will be sent to Honduras in 
late October to stand at stud with horses to create work mules. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mammoth Jacks, the largest variety of donkeys, were  
collected by Heifer Project International, a Little Rock-based 
charity that sends food- or income-producing animals to developing 
countries. Religious services often are conducted before the 
animals are shipped. 
</P>
<P>
	``St. Francis called the animals, wild and tame, his brothers  
and sisters,'' said Davis, from St. Francis Roman Catholic Church. 
A donkey that had been across the field when Davis began the 
blessing walked over to the priest during the rite. 
</P>
<P>
	The blessing came on the eve of the day the church honors St.  
Francis, a 13th century monk who renounced his parents' fortune and 
became the patron saint of animals and nature.

 *Church 'haunts' youth with sins    	
</P>
<P>
	ARVADA, Colo. (AP) -- A gay wedding that ends in tragedy is this  
year's featured Halloween scenario at Hell House. 
</P>
<P>
	For five years, Abundant Life Christian Center has presented a  
kind of haunted house mixed with morality play to show young people 
how they will be punished for sinning. 
</P>
<P>
	The church is affiliated with Assemblies of God, a pentacostal  
denomination. It says worshippers number about 500 each Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the same-sex marriage, this year's Hell House,  
which runs 12 nights beginning Oct. 15, also features such sins as 
a teen-ager losing her virginity to a young man with HIV, a girl 
who takes drugs at a ``rave'' party, and an intoxicated driver who 
causes a fatality, associate pastor Keenan Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning from last year, he said, are an abortion scene and  
depictions of heaven and hell. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including liberal and moderate religious leaders, say  
Hell House concentrates too much on sin, hell and punishment, and 
not enough on God's love. 
</P>
<P>
	But Roberts said people ``need the hell scared out of them.''  
</P>
<P>
	In the gay wedding scenario, one of the partners will later die  
of AIDS as punishment, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the couple kisses, one of the men will be played by a  
woman, he said. ``I'm just not going to have two guys kissing.''

 *Anglican leader says diversity has limits    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The world leader of the Anglican Communion rejects  
the common view that diversity is ``the defining characteristic of 
Anglicanism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a major address, Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey said,  
``We do not live by the principle, 'Anything goes.' I, and I guess 
most of us, do not accept that there are no cardinal doctrines, 
beliefs or limits to orthodoxy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carey's comments, at the worldwide Anglican Consultative Council  
at Dundee, Scotland, were reported by the Anglican Communion News 
Service. The council includes clergy and lay delegates from each 
independent national branch of Anglicanism, including America's 
Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting concluded without taking a position on the divisive  
homosexual issue, but the council did pass statements on 
disarmament, nuclear weapons, unrest in East Timor, Mideast peace, 
the Cuba trade embargo and international debt.

 *Not just homemakers    	
</P>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The monthly gathering of Mormon women,  
long referred to as a ``homemaking meeting,'' is getting a name 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Jan. 1, Mormon women will follow a program of ``Home,  
Family and Personal Enrichment.'' Earlier in the century, they met 
monthly on a weekend afternoon, usually for quilting or other 
home-based activities. And in recent decades, the meetings have 
shifted to evenings as more women began working outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
	The change was announced during the annual meeting of the  
General Relief Society, the main women's group of The Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new program, women will get a 15-minute lesson on a  
spiritual topic, then spend 60 to 90 minutes learning practical 
skills associated with the topic, according to Virginia Jensen, 
first counselor to the presidency of the Relief Society. That could 
include home repairs, gardening, service, or the traditional 
quilting. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the group introduced a declaration for Relief  
Society members, which emphasizes support for the traditional 
family and an absolute authority of the church's all-male 
priesthood. 
</P>

 *A Lutheran guide to homosexuality    	
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America is  
offering members a short course on the morality of same-sex 
behavior. The textbook lays out conservative and liberal options 
but draws no conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Current church policy welcomes homosexuals but forbids same-sex  
relationships for clergy and blessing ceremonies for gay and 
lesbian couples. Liberals among the 5.2 million members want to 
change that. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Paul Jersild, who teaches at the Evangelical Lutherans'  
seminary in Columbia, S.C., represents the liberal view in the 
text, ``Talking Together as Christians About Homosexuality.'' The 
conservative spokesman, the Rev. Gilbert Meilaender of Valparaiso 
(Ind.) University, is from the Lutheran Church -- Missouri Synod. 
</P>
<P>
	While Meilaender says the entire Christian tradition, and  
several Bible passages, prohibit same-sex relationships, Jersild 
argues that Christians' modern experiences compel a ``re-evaluation 
of what the Bible says.''

<HEADLINE> 42 Dead Dolphins Wash Ashore in Fla </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) -- Forty-two dead bottle-nosed dolphins  
have washed ashore since August, and the cause of their deaths is a 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	A 500-pound male dolphin was found Wednesday and brought to the  
National Marine Fisheries office for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what's killing them,'' said Wanda Jones, a  
graduate student working with the agency. ``We just know the 
dolphins are dying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones has sent tissue samples for analysis from the 12 most  
recently discovered animals. The tissue will be checked for red 
tide, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
	Red tide is caused by tiny organisms that can release a toxin  
that kills fish by paralyzing their gills. 
</P>
<P>
	While red tide hasn't been shown to kill dolphins -- which are  
mammals and don't have gills -- large numbers of dolphins have 
sometimes died in areas where a red tide bloom has been detected. A 
red tide outbreak was found in two bays near Panama City in August 
and early September.

<HEADLINE> The Donald Eyes the White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump is very, very rich. Which doesn't  
mean that his talk can't be cheap. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, The Donald announced that he'd formed an  
exploratory committee to determine his viability as a presidential 
candidate for the Reform Party. But in the past, the billionaire 
developer's done a lot of talking about a lot of things -- remember 
the United States Football League? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Trump has amassed a $1.6 billion fortune through savvy  
projects like the Grand Hyatt Hotel, Trump Tower and his Atlantic 
City casinos. But Trump occasionally has -- how to say this? -- made 
announcements that didn't amount to much. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many news-making projects exist only in his imagination,''  
read the headline on a November 1996 Trump article in the New York 
Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Take 1990, when Trump floated word that he might build a  
125-story tower -- the world's largest -- on the Los Angeles site of 
the old Ambassador Hotel. Simultaneously, city officials were 
knocking down Trump's plans for a similar edifice in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics howled that Trump was playing one city against the  
other. Trump was unmoved -- the massive building ``will only go to 
one,'' he promised. 
</P>
<P>
	It went to neither.  
</P>
<P>
	After a protracted legal battle, Trump sold his stake in the Los  
Angeles property without building anything. His Manhattan plans for 
a 150-story tower, announced in 1985, were wildly downscaled; 
construction on that West Side project continues today. Now absent 
the Television City office tower, the first of the apartment 
buildings in the complex are being occupied. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the Trump Organization announced plans for a possible  
Trump Tower Moscow. They're still waiting, comrade. Trump made 
similar comments about Trump Towers in Tokyo and Sao Paolo; none 
materialized. 
</P>
<P>
	Ditto an announced 1994 foray into Las Vegas. Five years later,  
Trump's casino holdings remain strictly in Atlantic City, N.J. 
Ditto a 1992 proposal for a high-tech theme park in the New Jersey 
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics point to a common theme: publicity, spelled T-R-U-M-P.  
Trump creates headlines to feed a massive ego, they carp. And Trump 
certainly has enjoyed the attention. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1991, for example, Trump stood outside a Manhattan  
courthouse waving a $10 million check and announcing that his 
divorce from wife Ivana was final. He made all the papers, but the 
divorce wasn't finalized until more than two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1989, Trump made an unsolicited takeover offer of $7  
billion for AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines. Eleven days 
after the bid created headlines, Trump withdrew it -- before it was 
ever formally presented to stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicity is always good, but candidate Trump would bring other  
things to the table. 
</P>
<P>
	He has experience with debt; hell, he wrote ``Trump: The Art of  
the Comeback,'' a whole book about his return from a $975 million 
financial black hole. 
</P>
<P>
	He's quite the spin doctor; when a jury awarded the USFL just $1  
in its $1.3 billion lawsuit against the NFL, New Jersey Generals 
owner Trump called it ``a great moral victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump also had predicted a USFL-NFL super-duper bowl by 1990,  
perhaps played in the modestly named Trump Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, well.  
</P>
<P>
	While politicians and unfulfilled promises are not strange  
bedfellows, Trump has at least one more political drawback: his 
germ-phobia keeps him from shaking hands, much less kissing babies. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the curses of American society is the simple act of  
shaking hands,'' the potential politico wrote in his ``Comeback'' 
book. ``I happen to be a clean-hands freak.''

<HEADLINE> UPS Ending Some Gun Deliveries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service said today it will stop  
delivering handguns through its regular service, saying it was 
taking the step to help prevent thefts of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Monday, Atlanta-based UPS -- which handles the vast  
majority of firearms shipments -- will ship handguns only through 
its Next Day Air service, which costs three to four times as much 
as ground service. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has become more than ever a tremendous issue of concern  
to our society,'' UPS spokesman Norman Black said. ``Society is 
concerned about these weapons falling into the wrong hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UPS' Next Day Air service is a separate, more controlled system  
where packages are handled by fewer people and stay in the system 
for only one night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Chambers, executive director of the Sporting Arms and  
Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute, said overnight delivery costs 
about $25 more per gun, or about four times as much as ground 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we're trying to come to grips with. We're looking  
for alternative methods,'' Chambers told The Morning Call in 
Allentown, Pa., which reported the new UPS policy in a story 
published today. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will continue to ship long guns, rifles and shotguns  
by ground. Those guns are not as attractive to thieves as handguns, 
said another UPS spokesman, Robert Godlewski. 
</P>
<P>
	Godlewski acknowledged that shipping by air will be more  
expensive for gun manufacturers and dealers. But he said, ``We're 
going to err on the side of safety. If that costs more money, then 
that's the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each business day, Atlanta-based UPS delivers 12 million  
packages via its trademark brown trucks and brown-uniformed 
employees. UPS handles up to 75 percent of guns sent from 
manufacturers to distributors and nearly all firearms shipped from 
distributors to dealers, Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Jannuzzo, vice president of Glock Inc., said the gun  
manufacturer will continue to ship with UPS, but the increase in 
cost will be passed on to dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too substantial to absorb,'' said Jannuzzo, who works at  
Glock's U.S. headquarters in Smyrna, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, federal investigators said 130 Glock guns being shipped  
via UPS were stolen from a series of shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it will cut out the theft problems, it will be a good  
thing,'' Jannuzzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black couldn't say how many guns have been stolen from the UPS  
ground system in the past. He knew of no cases where a gun stolen 
from UPS had been used in a crime and a lawsuit resulted. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``our attitude is that even one such instance is one too  
many, and we just had to find some way to improve the security 
around these shipments,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Air Force Launches Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The Air Force today launched a $42  
million navigation satellite aboard a Delta rocket that was 
supposed to carry up a different spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boeing-built rocket should have lifted off earlier this year  
with another Global Positioning System satellite. But that 
satellite was damaged on the launch pad in May when rain leaked 
onto it. 
</P>
<P>
	A new GPS satellite was loaded onto the rocket, which soared at  
8:51 a.m. following multiple weather delays. The successful launch 
brought the number of operational GPS satellites in orbit to 28. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the Air Force's first launch from Cape Canaveral since  
a Titan rocket dumped a military communication satellite into the 
wrong orbit back in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force hopes to launch the rain-damaged satellite next  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Global Positioning System, originally designed for the  
military to pinpoint locations, is booming in the commercial 
market, too. Many luxury cars have GPS devices to help drivers find 
a route, and they are also used by aviators, boaters and even 
hikers.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Curbs Cellular Phone Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- BP Amoco plans to post signs warning customers  
not to use cellular telephones near gasoline pumps at its U.S. 
stations by year end, a company spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The precautionary measure is prompted by concerns that  
electronic impulses from a cellular phone could help ignite fires 
if gasoline or gas fumes are present. The risk is slight, but 
London-based BP Amoco doesn't want to take any chances,said Linda 
McCray, a BP spokeswoman in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The signs at the Amoco and BP stations will have a picture of a  
cell phone enclosed in a red circle with a slash through it, McCray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a ban -- this is a precautionary warning,'' McCray  
said. She said customers still will be allowed to use cell phones 
away from gas pumps. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Malinowski, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based  
Chevron Corp., told The Plain Dealer that Chevron will place 
warning decals on gas pumps later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The city of Cicero, Ill., a Chicago suburb, recently passed the  
first law in the nation banning the use of cellular phones at gas 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cell phone manufacturers have included warnings against such use  
in owner's manuals for years because they say that under certain 
conditions, cell phones could help generate sparks. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute, which is looking into the  
reports, has so far found no substantiated reports of fires.

<HEADLINE> Poll: N.Y. Senate Race Tightens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Rudolph Giuliani has been hurt by his battle  
with the Brooklyn Museum of Art, narrowing the gap between him and 
potential Senate rival Hillary Rodham Clinton, according to a poll 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the New York City mayor's standing improved among the  
state's largest voting group, white Catholics, in the wake of the 
museum showdown, according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll from Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion  
found the mayor favored by 46 percent of the state's voters while 
42 percent backed Mrs. Clinton, a statistical dead heat based on 
the poll's margin of error of 4 percentage points. Other polls have 
also shown them about even. 
</P>
<P>
	A Marist poll last month had Giuliani, a Republican, leading the  
Democratic first lady, 49 percent to 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Mrs. Clinton's aides said she had filed a  
``statement of candidacy'' with the Federal Election Commission, 
another signal she intends to run for the seat being vacated by 
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for her political committee, said  
the filing was not a formal declaration of candidacy, but simply a 
technical change allowing her to raise $2,000 from individual 
donors instead of the maximum $1,000 she has been raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has been operating under an FEC statement of candidacy  
since April, Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new poll found the mayor's unfavorable rating among New York  
voters had climbed to 39 percent, the same level as the first 
lady's. In last month's poll, the mayor's unfavorable rating was at 
30 percent while Mrs. Clinton's was at 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty percent of those polled this time around said their  
opinion of Giuliani has gotten worse since the flap over the 
Brooklyn museum's exhibit ``Sensation'' began. Twenty-one percent 
said their opinion of the mayor had improved because of the way he 
handled the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The show includes a black Virgin Mary surrounded by naked body  
parts and dried elephant dung. The mayor has said he wants to cut 
off city funding for the museum because of the exhibit, which he 
called ``sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has said that while she disapproves of the exhibit,  
she would not strip the museum's funding. 
</P>
<P>
	White Catholics traditionally make up 40 percent to 45 percent  
of the vote in statewide elections, and Giuliani -- himself a white 
Catholic -- saw his standing among that group improve. 
</P>
<P>
	In last month's poll, white Catholics favored Giuliani over Mrs.  
Clinton, 57 percent to 34 percent. In the latest poll, Giuliani 
topped Mrs. Clinton, 60 percent to 29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton continued to have the edge among women, 46 percent  
to 41 percent, while Giuliani was tops among men, 52 percent to 37 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 702 registered voters was conducted Sunday  
and Monday.

<HEADLINE> Devils' Goalie Ejected for Slashing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Martin Brodeur was kicked out of  
the New Jersey Devils' game with the Pittsburgh Penguins for 
slashing Matthew Barnaby early in the first period on Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Brodeur received a match penalty with attempt to injure from  
referee Paul Stewart after whacking the back of Barnaby's legs with 
his stick at 14:32. The penalty called for an automatic review by 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident in New Jersey's home opener happened just seconds  
after the Penguins' pesky player bumped Brodeur after the 
goaltender handled a loose puck in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Brodeur skated back into his crease and hit Barnaby, a move  
which might have reflected the goaltender's frustration after 
giving up three goals to Aleksey Morozov in the opening 12:39. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who was the trail official on the play, had a good view  
of the incident, but his major call seemed to surprise Brodeur. He 
was also called for a four-minute minor for roughing on Saturday 
night in New Jersey's season opener against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnaby had to be helped off the ice, but he returned for the  
second period. 
</P>
<P>
	The ejection was the first of Brodeur's seven NHL seasons.  
Veteran Chris Terreri took over and stopped all seven Penguins 
shots on their five-minute powerplay. 
</P>
<P>
	Remarkably, Brodeur lasted longer than Penguins starter Tom  
Barrasso. He left after 8:22 and was replaced by Peter Skudra. No 
explanation was made, although Barrasso left shortly after becoming 
entangled with Randy McKay while trying to make a kick save on a 
shot by Devils defenseman Scott Niedermayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrasso had a knee injury coming into the game but it wasn't  
clear whether he had aggravated it.

<HEADLINE> Mutual Funds Assets Soar / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's money market mutual funds

Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets in retail money market mutual funds rose by $9.51 billion  
to $904.71 billion, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $6.17 billion to $752.78 billion for the week ended Wednesday,

<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.520 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.496 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.74 percent from 4.71 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield rose to 4.70 percent from 4.69 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.85 percent from 4.82  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 
4.81 percent from 4.80 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
57 days, unchanged from a week earlier, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.08 percent as of 
Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts held steady at 0.84 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.40 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.37 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.75 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.74 
percent; 5.03 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 5.02 percent; and 
5.27 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 5.25 percent.

<HEADLINE> Power Beads Attract the Masses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Imagine if you could find happiness, wealth and  
willpower just by wearing a bracelet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound far-fetched? Not for the millions of Americans who are  
buying into the latest New Age craze -- powerbead bracelets, which 
promise to do everything from boost intelligence to offer relief 
from PMS. 
</P>
<P>
	From the giant department stores to local street vendors,  
merchants can't keep enough of these brightly colored bracelets in 
stock. And everyone is buying them: the young and old, men and 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look down at my wrist and I remember I need to be strong.  
It's a great inspiration,'' said Sarah Lessen, a 30-year-old New 
Yorker who wears a rock quartz powerbead bracelet representing 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Modeled after Buddhist prayer beads, powerbeads were originally  
marketed last year by Zoe Metro, a New York designer, and soon 
copied by numerous others. 
</P>
<P>
	The beads are semi-precious stones that are thought to have  
certain powers depending on color. If you wear a rose quartz bead, 
love may come your way, while turquoise may bring healing and 
mother of pearl may attract money. 
</P>
<P>
	Each bracelet, which is strung on an elastic band, is typically  
made up of one type of stone -- and the beads don't change colors 
like mood rings. 
</P>
<P>
	Powerbeads' popularity comes as an increasing number of  
Americans look to Eastern spirituality for direction. Many people 
also are taking to yoga and using ``feng shui,'' the ancient 
Chinese art of object placement that says if you put things in 
certain places, it will help your well-being and give you energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans today are taking a mental account of what is  
important in life. They are more mystical and inspirational,'' said 
trendwatcher Irma Zandl, who runs the market research firm Zandl 
Group. ``Powerbeads fit right into that ... they are about being 
positive and feeling good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Metro was inspired to develop powerbeads after seeing the  
Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama wear a few beaded bracelets. 
</P>
<P>
	She began her line with wooden beads last fall, and then moved  
into semi-precious stones in January. By August, they were flying 
off store shelves at many big department stores and pricey 
boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were laughing when they first saw them. They didn't get  
it,'' said the 30-year-old Princeton graduate who sells her $20 to 
$40 bracelets under the Stella Pace brand. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the goal is not to have people just believe in it, but we  
want them to try it and see what works with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her beads are so popular that knockoffs are flooding the market,  
many selling for as little as $1. Some retailers, including 
Ross-Simon, will soon offer pricier powerbeads with diamond and 
gold accents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is buying these powerbeads, all ages, all sexes,  
across the country'' said Jennifer deWinter, associate general 
merchandise manager at Saks Fifth Avenue. ``Rarely do you get a 
trend that appeals to so many people. It's incredible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of what shoppers pay, many seem convinced that the  
beads possess some power -- and look good too. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrities, including Madonna and Richard Gere, have been  
spotted wearing the powerbeads. And as the prices have dropped, 
they have found their way onto the wrists of the masses, from 
schoolgirls to corporate executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Vivian DiMare bought a powerbead bracelet that  
signifies energy and she's already feeling a difference -- she is 
more alert and isn't as exhausted from her job as an office manager 
for a large New York public relations firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's probably mind over matter, but I have to admit  
that since I put this bracelet on, I have been staying up late and 
feel great,'' said 47-year-old mother.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Financier Indicted on 36 Counts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Rogue financier Martin R. Frankel was  
charged with fraud and money-laundering in a 36-count federal 
indictment, the U.S. attorney's office announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, 44, under arrest in Germany, is accused of absconding  
with more than $200 million in insurance company assets he was 
supposed to be investing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Keefe, who withdrew as Frankel's U.S. lawyer last week  
after federal authorities froze all of the fugitive's assets, said 
the indictment will make it easier to extradite Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment -- the first federal counts against Frankel --  
charges him with 20 counts of wire fraud, 13 counts of money 
laundering and one count each of securities fraud, racketeering and 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Each wire fraud charge carries a maximum penalty of five years  
in prison; each money laundering charge is punishable by up to 20 
years in prison, as are the racketeering and conspiracy charges. 
The securities fraud charge carries a maximum term of 10 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of all charges, Frankel faces a maximum of 410  
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment accuses Frankel of running a ``racketeering  
enterprise'' which bought up insurance companies. Frankel then 
siphoned the insurers' cash reserves and used them to purchase 
mansions, cars, diamonds and gold, prosecutors claim. 
</P>
<P>
	It says that from sometime before mid-1991 through May 1999,  
Frankel and unnamed associates concocted a scheme to defraud 
insurance companies. The indictment alleges that as part of the 
scheme, the cash reserves from the insurance companies would be 
invested with Frankel operating as Liberty National Securities 
Inc., Frankel's unlicensed brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	After he received the assets, Frankel ``converted, stole, and  
embezzled the majority of funds for the personal use and benefit of 
himself and others known and unknown to the grand jury,'' according 
to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	In total, more than $200 million was stolen by Frankel, the  
indictment alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel disappeared from his fortress-like Greenwich mansions in  
early May. Days later, firefighters responding to an automatic 
alarm found the homes littered with smoldering documents and a 
``to-do'' list upon which item No. 1 was ``Launder money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, a native of Toledo, Ohio, had been barred from  
securities trading years earlier by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. He worked from his two-home compound in suburban New 
York City, which featured numerous television sets, computers and 
the high-tech tools of international finance. 
</P>
<P>
	When it appeared his financial dealings were about to be exposed  
some time in early May, investigators say, Frankel fled to Europe 
with a wad of cash and a cache of diamonds, living first in Italy 
and later in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel was arrested in Hamburg, Germany, on Sept. 4. He remains  
in a prison there, awaiting extradition to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel has said he plans to fight extradition, although both  
his American and German lawyers have said they plan to quit the 
case because Frankel has no money and cannot pay them. 
</P>
<P>
	Keefe said Thomas G. Dennis, chief federal public defender in  
Hartford, was appointed as Frankel's lawyer earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis could not be reached immediately for comment. A message  
was left at his Hartford office. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel's new lawyer in Germany, Dirk Meinecke, could not be  
reached immediately. A call to his office late Thursday went 
unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say Frankel's unlicensed brokerage siphoned at least  
$218 million from insurers in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Oklahoma and Tennessee. A lawsuit filed by some of the companies 
puts the loss at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Mississippi have said they plan to ask a grand  
jury for indictments against Frankel and his associates for 
allegedly stealing more than $200 million from insurance companies 
in that state. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi Insurance Commissioner George Dale said Thursday he  
welcomes the federal case. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping this could lead to us being able to recover some of  
the millions of dollars we think belong to our re-insurance 
companies,'' Dale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee has filed a warrant against Frankel charging him with  
theft of more than $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Davis, a district attorney general in Tennessee, said he was  
pleased by the federal indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It couldn't happen to a nicer guy,'' Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Accused N.J. Swindler Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Martin A. Armstrong Jr., the New Jersey  
financial adviser who prosecutors say swindled Japanese investors 
out of $950 million, pleaded innocent Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, 49, of Maple Shade, N.J., entered the plea during a  
routine appearance before Magistrate Judge Douglas F. Eaton in U.S. 
District Court in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who is free on $5 million bail, appeared in court in  
a business suit. When asked how he pleaded, he said, ``Innocent 
your honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eaton then picked from a wooden wheel the name of Judge Lawrence  
M. McKenna, who will preside over the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Armstrong said: ``This case is far more  
complicated than anyone suspects. I'm innocent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to comment further as did his attorney, Marc Durant.  
</P>
<P>
	Durant has said prosecutors have grossly exaggerated the amount  
of money they allege his client lost for investors as the founder 
and chairman of Princeton Economics International Ltd. of a 
Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges Armstrong sold about $3 billion in  
securities to foreign investors through Princeton Global Management 
Ltd., an investment fund he controlled. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the promissory notes were described to  
investors as conservative investments before Armstrong squandered 
the funds on risky trading ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong has been charged with conspiracy to commit securities  
fraud, securities fraud and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege Armstrong has significant assets in offshore  
bank accounts.

<HEADLINE> Braves Bounce Back Against Astros  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Top that, Tom Glavine.  
</P>
<P>
	After one of the best-pitched games in postseason history, the  
Atlanta Braves arrived at the Astrodome on Thursday very much alive 
against Houston in the best-of-5 opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Glavine, the starter in Game 3 against Astros ace Mike  
Hampton, faces the unenviable task of following up Kevin Millwood's 
series-tying one-hitter in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even going to try'' to duplicate that performance,  
Glavine said after a light, 1 1/2-hour workout. ``I just want the same 
result, a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros will have their best pitcher on the mound. Hampton  
was an NL-leading 22-4 during the regular season, putting him among 
the favorites to win his first Cy Young award. 
</P>
<P>
	But one gets the feeling he would gladly trade his chance at the  
Cy Young for a victory that would put his team in a commanding 
position to win a postseason series for the first time. Game 4 is 
Saturday, also at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	If a fifth game is needed, it would be Sunday at Turner Field.  
</P>
<P>
	``In this game, all the awards and accolades don't mean a lot,''  
Hampton said. ``What means something is for the guys around you to 
have confidence that you can do the job. It's been a great year for 
me, but I've got a lot of confidence in them, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Killer B's -- Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Derek Bell --  
will be reunited for the Astros in Game 3, although a more 
appropriate nickname might be the Killer Z's the way they've 
snoozed through the postseason. Biggio has a career average of 
.125, Bagwell .121 and Bell .069. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Bell had a disappointing, injury-plagued season,  
forcing him to the bench for most of the last month and the first 
two games of the division series. 
</P>
<P>
	But manager Larry Dierker plans to insert Bell in right field --  
the third different player to start at that position against the 
Braves -- and also put Matt Mieske in left. They provide two more 
right-handed bats against the left-handed Glavine, who had won his 
last eight decisions against the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good feeling to be back in there,'' said Bell, who hit  
only .236 with 12 homers in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves swept the Astros in the opening round of the playoffs  
two years ago, finishing off the series in Houston. This time, the 
Astros seized the home-field advantage by winning Game 1 in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to be 1-1 instead of 0-2,'' Bell said. ``We can  
relax and have fun. The pressure is on them. We've got the next two 
games at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine will surely give up more hits than Millwood, but the  
Braves have the right pitcher on the mound under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing his first eight career decisions to the Astros,  
Glavine hasn't lost in his last 10 trips to the mound, going 8-0 
with a 1.30 ERA. His last loss against Houston came on June 25, 
1991, by a score of 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a comfort zone here,'' Glavine said, gazing around the  
spacious Astrodome. ``Also, their lineup hasn't changed a whole lot 
over the course of the last few years. I know these guys and I know 
what I'm trying to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, career records are much like mutual funds -- past  
performance is no guarantee of future success. The Astros proved 
that in Game 1 by beating Greg Maddux, who had a 19-9 career record 
against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at Maddux's numbers,'' Bell said. ``But we won the first  
game. In the playoffs, you can throw all that out the window. It 
comes down to who's ahead in the ninth inning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Killer B's are trying to break their 3-year-old  
playoff slump, Atlanta's MVP candidate, Chipper Jones, would like 
to see a few good pitchers after carrying his team offensively in 
the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was 1-for-5 in the first two games, walking three times  
and twice making outs while swinging anxiously at 3-0 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally, I would swing the bat on 3-0,'' he said. ``But in  
these kind of situations, where every at-bat is under the 
microscope, it's hard to be patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones will try to break out against his offseason hunting buddy,  
having forged a relationship with Hampton when both were high 
school stars in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two or three years, they have met in south Georgia  
for a deer-hunting trip, ``just two rednecks who are never too far 
from their roots,'' Jones said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a real mutual respect for each other,'' he said. ``But  
I'm sure at about 3 or 4 o'clock tomorrow, that friendship will be 
put on hold for a few hours.''

<HEADLINE> United Airlines Slashes Commissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- In what could spur another round of industrywide  
cuts in travel agents' commissions, United Airlines announced it is 
reducing the fee it pays agents for selling tickets from 8 percent 
to 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	United, the nation's largest air carrier, expects the change,  
announced Thursday, to save $150 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Other airlines did not immediately respond to the announcement.  
The last three times United cut commissions, the other airlines 
eventually followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel agents denounced United's move, which is effective today  
and applies to both domestic and international tickets, as being 
anti-consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's rising at United is the price the consumer will  
ultimately pay for the airline ticket,'' said Joe Galloway, 
president of the American Society of Travel Agents in Alexandria, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	United said it will pay agents a 5 percent commission for all  
tickets purchased in the United States for travel within the 
country, with a maximum payout of $50 for round-trip travel and $25 
for one-way travel. 
</P>
<P>
	For international travel, the maximum pay out will be $100 for  
round-trip travel and $50 for one-way travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's announcement is part of our continuing efforts to  
examine all facets of our cost structure,'' United Airlines 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim Goodwin said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	William Gallagher of Gallagher Travel Service Inc. in Chicago  
said the likely result will be that travel agents will charge fees 
for services they previously provided for free.

	``For example, you call asking for the lowest fare from A to B,  
that will cost you X number of dollars,'' he said. ``We haven't 
charged a fee in the past. There is no question we will have to 
now.''

<P>
	Travel agents sell about 80 percent of the airline tickets sold  
in the country, Galloway said. 
</P>
<P>
	``United is trying to force the cost of distribution onto the  
shoulders of consumers,'' he said. ``Consumers will be forced to 
pay more because they won't have adequate comparative information 
that travel agents alone provide. Or they will have to pay more 
because the travel agent will be forced to charge more or raise 
service fees for crucial services that consumers seek from them.''

<HEADLINE> Coelho Wall Free of Donors' Names </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While raising money for a Portuguese-American  
memorial wall in connection with a 1998 world's fair in Lisbon, Al 
Gore's campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, said contributors' names 
would be engraved on the monument. 
</P>
<P>
	The only names now on the 8-by-60-foot sculpture, ``The Wave,''  
are those of the artists, according to a check by The Associated 
Press in Lisbon. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho, as commissioner general for the U.S. pavilion at Expo 98  
in Lisbon, took out a $300,000 personal loan to get the sculpture 
built, and formed the Luso-American Wave Foundation to repay the 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department inspector general, in a report made public  
last weekend, said the pavilion's books carried the costs of the 
sculpture as a liability, and taxpayers could be responsible for 
any unpaid bills. The report also cited mismanagement of the 
pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho's attorney, Stanley Brand, said Thursday that the names  
would be engraved on the wall, but he did not know when. He said 
Coelho this week repaid the outstanding balance of more than 
$119,000 on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand said he did not have precise figures on how much of the  
loan was raised from donors other than Coelho, but estimated the 
figure was $150,000 to $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The sculpture, in the shape of a wave, is a memorial to honor  
the contributions of Portuguese who emigrated to the United States. 
Coelho is a Portuguese-American. 
</P>
<P>
	The expo's Internet site said, ``Contribute to The Wave and have  
your name engraved on the monument.'' The notice also said a family 
name could be included. 
</P>
<P>
	The Luso-American Wave Foundation's certificate to operate and  
its articles of incorporation were revoked Sept. 7 by the District 
of Columbia government, ``for having failed and/or refused to file 
reports and pay all fees due and owing on or before April 15, 1999 
and 1998.''

<HEADLINE> Sunscreen Maker Buys Rival's Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, N.J. (AP) -- Coppertone sunscreen maker Schering-Plough  
Corp. said Thursday it has bought the rights to sell the Bain de 
Soleil line of sun care products from rival drug maker Pfizer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough, based here, and Pfizer, based in New York, did  
not disclose terms of the cash deal they concluded Wednesday. The 
Federal Trade Commission previously approved the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough now has exclusive rights to sell Bain de Soleil  
products in the United States, Puerto Rico and a few other small 
markets. The company also acquired trademarks for the Bain de 
Soleil line, including Orange Gel+E, and the new Streakguard line 
of sunless tanning creams. 
</P>
<P>
	Coppertone products, the leading sun care brand in North  
America, are sold by the Schering-Plough HealthCare Products 
business, based in Liberty Corner. 
</P>
<P>
	``This allows us to reach a broader spectrum of the sun care  
market,'' said Schering-Plough spokesman Bob Consalvo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coppertone is sort of positioned as the traditional American  
sun care brand'' and has a strong line of sunblock products, 
Consalvo said. ``Bain de Soleil is positioned as a premium, upscale 
brand'' and is strong in sunless tanning products. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough, the maker of Claritin allergy medications and  
Dr. Scholl's foot care products, reported 1998 sales of $181 
million for its Coppertone line, which is sold in few markets 
outside North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Consalvo said Schering-Plough has an option to buy rights to  
sell Bain de Soleil products in Canada and probably will exercise 
that later. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are other companies that sell Bain de Soleil in other  
parts of the world,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> House Rejects GOP-Backed HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House today rejected a GOP-backed patient  
protection bill and set the stage for a showdown vote on a White 
House-endorsed plan giving Americans broad new rights to file 
lawsuits against their health insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
	With the outcome uncertain to the end, President Clinton and  
Vice President Al Gore lobbied lawmakers by telephone. The GOP 
measure was defeated 238-193, with 29 Republicans joining all but 
two Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders had worked fiercely in recent days to rally  
support for their version, which offered patients a limited right 
to file lawsuits -- but only in federal court and with limits on how 
much money plaintiffs could collect. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans reluctantly supported the GOP leadership bill  
in hopes of defeating the broader Democratic version, which 
appeared to have enough Republican support to prevail. Had the 
leadership won a majority it would have wiped out the broader 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the GOP-backed bill painted it as a compromise  
between the Democratic approach and doing nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a solid, balanced approach that I urge you to  
support,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``The 
difference in these bills is how far you go. How far you give 
license to the trial lawyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats argued that it did not go far enough.  
</P>
<P>
	``It fails to hold health care providers accountable. It lets  
them off the hook,'' said Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	The rejection cleared the way for a vote on the White  
House-backed bill, sponsored by Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., and 
Charlie Norwood, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if this bill passes, it must be reconciled with a  
considerably more limited version already approved by the Senate. 
The Senate bill has no new rights to sue and excludes many 
Americans from other patient protections. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, the House rejected, 284-145, the most modest of  
four competing patient-protection bills. Backed by Rep. John 
Boehner, R-Ohio, it would have given patients now new rights to 
file lawsuits. It was the first choice of conservative Republicans 
and their allies in the business and insurance industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law now effectively bans such lawsuits for millions of  
Americans, even if they are injured or die because of an HMO's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Managed care has dominated the health debate on Capitol Hill all  
year, as Congress responds to voters' frustration over cost cutting 
and fears they may be denied needed care. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, hoping to keep Democrats united, Clinton today sent a  
letter to Capitol Hill restating his strong support for a broad 
bill that would give patients a host of new rights, including broad 
new rights to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leaders feared that concerns over how to pay for it  
may cost them votes, but Clinton sought to clarify that he still 
strongly supports the bill. He promised not to sign any bill that 
was not fully paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I endorse this legislation without reservation,'' Clinton said  
in a letter to Gephardt. ``I cannot support a bill that is a 
patients' bill of rights in name only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House was considering a total of four plans, each of which  
gave patients new power to demand care and take disputes to outside 
arbitrators. But there were major differences over details, notably 
whether patients should be given new rights to sue -- and, if so, 
whether to limit them. 
</P>
<P>
	Later today, the House also rejected a plan backed by Reps. Amo  
Houghton Jr., R-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. It was quite 
similar to the Coburn-Shadegg bill but was offered in hopes of 
attracting more Democrats. It failed 269-160. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some Republicans argued that the threat of a  
lawsuit is needed to force insurance companies to provide promised 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tell welfare mothers, we tell deadbeat dads ... you have to  
be responsible for yourself,'' said Norwood, the leading Republican 
backer of the right to sue. Health insurance, he said, is ``the 
only industry in America where we say you are absolutely protected 
from being responsible for your actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For two years, Democrats have put the GOP on the defensive over  
the politically popular HMO issue. House Republican leaders, 
struggling with a slim majority and a fractured caucus, did not 
endorse any bill until debate opened on the issue this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But they worked hard Wednesday to rally opposition to a sweeping  
bill backed by Norwood and virtually all the Democrats, including 
Clinton. That bill gives patients new power to see specialists, get 
emergency room care and take denials of care to an outside panel of 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
	Most controversially, it allows patients to sue HMOs in federal  
or state court and to collect whatever damages a jury might award. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into this week's debate, Democrats appeared to have the  
votes they needed to pass their HMO bill. But they said Wednesday 
that they may lose the votes of some conservative Democrats because 
there was no way to pay for the HMO bill, estimated to cost the 
federal government some $7 billion in lost tax revenue over 10 
years. The bill, if it became law, likely would mean higher 
insurance premiums, which means businesses would be able to take 
higher tax deductions on their insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP strategy has been to focus attention on the uninsured,  
as Republicans argue that new rights will drive up the cost of 
insurance and force employers to drop coverage. Hammering the point 
Wednesday, Republicans pushed through a bill, 227-205, aimed at 
reducing the ranks of the uninsured, which now stand at 44 million.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuits Over Star-Bulletin Closing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The state and a group of residents are suing in  
an attempt to stop the closing of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin. They 
say shutting the newspaper down while it is still profitable 
deprives readers and advertisers of competition in violation of 
antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The separate lawsuits were filed Wednesday in U.S. District  
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Gannett Co. Inc., which owns the competing morning Honolulu  
Advertiser, will pay Liberty Newspapers Ltd. Partnership more than 
$30 million to close the still-profitable Star-Bulletin, according 
to the lawsuit filed by Save Our Star-Bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
	The scheduled Oct. 30 closing of the 117-year-old afternoon  
paper would leave the Advertiser as Hawaii's only statewide daily 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our feeling is that as long as Liberty was making money and  
was profitable, there is no way we can justify the buying out of 
Liberty by Gannett,'' Gov. Ben Cayetano said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two newspapers have operated under a Joint Operating  
Agreement since 1962. It allows them to share production and 
distribution costs but maintain separate news gathering and 
editorial departments. The agreement was set to expire in 2012. 
</P>
<P>
	The private group's lawsuit accuses Gannett and Liberty  
Newspapers of using the Newspaper Preservation Act to create a 
one-newspaper monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most blatant example to date of a shutdown-for-pay  
agreement in the newspaper industry,'' said Donald Baker, one of 
two former federal attorneys representing SOS-Bulletin. ``The 
surviving paper ends up with a monopoly, the shutdown paper's owner 
gets a pile of money and the community suffers a big loss of 
independent news and editorial voices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. Fisch, president and publisher of The Honolulu  
Advertiser, wouldn't comment because he hasn't seen the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Rupert Phillips, Liberty's chief executive officer, has refused  
to disclose the amount of Gannett's payment. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced last month he was closing the newspaper because it  
was no longer providing a sufficient return on his investment. 
Phillips also said investors were collecting a 12 percent return on 
the paper, whereas mainland papers were returning up to 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Those involved in Save Our Star-Bulletin include a University of  
Hawaii regent, two former lieutenant governors, a former Honolulu 
city council member, a former Star-Bulletin reporter and a real 
estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs are paying for the lawsuit with their own money  
with help from The Newspaper Guild-Communications Workers of 
America, said Richard Port, former head of the state Democratic 
Party and one of the seven plaintiffs.

<HEADLINE> UAW, Ford Talk Recessed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With a union-set deadline approaching, Ford Motor  
Co. and the United Auto Workers are to continue negotiations Friday 
over a new contract for about 100,000 workers, the automaker said 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks went late into the evening Wednesday, resumed early  
Thursday and recessed about 9 p.m. Thursday, Ford spokesman Ed 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bargaining is to resume sometime Friday morning, Miller said,  
adding the company was ``real optimistic'' a tentative deal could 
be reached before the union-set deadline of midnight Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very hopeful that we're going to reach a settlement,''  
Miller said late Thursday. ``There aren't any issues we can't 
resolve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW's setting of a deadline at Ford could signal trouble  
over Ford's plan to spin off or sell its parts unit, Visteon. UAW 
leaders have been vigorously opposed to a spinoff of Visteon, which 
has about 23,500 UAW members, saying it could lead to pay cuts, 
plant closures and fewer union jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Labor Day parade in Detroit, many marchers carried  
signs depicting Visteon as ``the alien within'' Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	The disagreements are a change for Ford, which has emphasized  
its close relations with the union for several years. The last time 
the UAW held a national strike against the company was 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ford talks continued as workers at General Motors Corp. and  
its former parts unit voted on new contracts. The four-year deals 
provide raises of 3 percent a year, a $1,350 signing bonus and 
improvements in pensions and work rules. They also allow workers at 
Delphi Automotive Systems to transfer back to GM when openings 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW is expected to announce the results of the ratification  
votes early next week.

<HEADLINE> Dole Promises Anti-Drug Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taking a stand at the Mexican border,  
Republican presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole today promised a 
strong fight against illegal drugs and an unhesitating cutoff of 
U.S. aid to any foreign country that fails to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Elizabeth Dole will lead a crusade with the goal of  
a drug-free America,'' Dole said in remarks prepared for delivery 
at Borderfield State Park on the California-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not and will not -- under any circumstances -- support the  
legalization of marijuana or any other drug,'' she said. As for 
Clinton, ``he lacks the moral authority to send a message that 
drugs aren't cool,'' Dole added. 
</P>
<P>
	The get-tough address is her third in a rollout of what aides  
call the four cornerstones of her campaign: education, national 
defense, drugs and, still to come, taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Her campaign hoped Dole's focus on illegal drugs would earn her  
credit for leadership on an issue that voters do not rank as a 
priority public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pundits and pollsters tell me that drug abuse is not an  
important issue. But I don't get my passion from polling,'' Dole 
said. She noted studies that show a doubling of teen drug use since 
1992, the year Clinton was elected. 
</P>
<P>
	With her back to Mexico, Dole stood about 30 feet from the  
border fence as she made her remarks. Afterward, a Dole campaign 
worker slipped a copy of her speech through the fence to a Mexican 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 people, mainly campaign workers, looked on from the  
California side. About 10 people watched from the Mexico side. 
</P>
<P>
	On the international front, Dole said Clinton has rendered  
hollow the United States' ``certification'' process, whereby 
foreign countries with lax counter-narcotic efforts are supposed to 
be punished with economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Clinton certified Mexico as an ally in fight against  
drugs despite its disappointing record of extraditing of drug 
criminals and a declines last year in cocaine and heroin seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time we throw down the gauntlet and cease timid  
negotiations with foreign governments that cannot or will not put a 
stop to the production or smuggling of drugs,'' Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mexico, long a close friend and important neighbor, needs to  
extradite drug lords to the United States and make a concerted 
effort to reduce the flood of methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine and 
crack across the border.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She opposed any increases in U.S. military aid for Colombia  
until it reclaims a zone where Dole said the government has ceded 
control to ``narco-guerillas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said she would meet personally with all foreign leaders in  
an effort to foster counter-narcotic cooperation. But if all else 
fails, she pledged to cut aid to countries that ``do not vigorously 
combat the drugs that are destroying our communities and killing 
our young people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to break through with limited cash in a Republican  
nomination race dominated by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Dole 
presented her drug-fighting experience in a way that served to 
remind voters of her executive and public-service credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	During her tenure as secretary of Transportation, Dole said she  
instituted random drug testing of all rail workers after a deadly 
rail accident was blamed on operators found to be using marijuana 
and alcohol. She also made the department the first civilian agency 
to begin random drug testing of its 30,000 employees in critical 
safety and security positions, such as air-traffic controllers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday in Kentucky, in the heart of tobacco country, she  
criticized a Justice Department lawsuit against tobacco companies 
that seeks to recover billions of dollars that taxpayers have spent 
on smoking-related health care. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the government should instead focus on making sure that  
more than $240 billion cigarette-makers already have agreed to pay 
the states is spent on anti-smoking education for children. She 
also called for an all-out effort to prevent tobacco companies from 
selling cigarettes to young people.

<HEADLINE> Gore Rips Bush Environmental Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, author of a book on the  
environment, says Gov. George W. Bush's pollution-fighting 
credentials are unfit for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Accepting endorsements Thursday from several prominent  
environmentalists, Gore accused Bush of allowing Texas to become 
the most polluted state in the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to rankings from the 1999 U.S. Environmental  
Protection Agency Toxic Release Inventory Report, Gore said Texas 
ranks ``No. 1 for toxic releases into the air, into the water and 
into the soil. For the first time ever, Houston, Texas, is taking 
over the top spot as the city with the worst smog pollution in 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called it a ``Texas-sized tragedy.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Our children deserve better than to have their environment and  
their health given to a person who carries water -- dirty water -- 
for the special interests,'' Gore added. 
</P>
<P>
	A campaign spokesman for Bush, the front-runner in the  
Republican presidential field, responded to Gore's pointed attack 
with biting sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize Al Gore's long history of weird and extreme  
environmental ideas, so we all are anxiously awaiting his plan to 
reduce summertime temperatures in Houston, Texas,'' said Scott 
McClellan. ``After all, Gore invented the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McClellan defended Bush's environmental record, saying he was  
the first Texas governor to get manufacturing plants built before 
the Clean Air Act to significantly reduce air emissions. He also 
said Texas leads the nation in reducing the release and disposal of 
toxic substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, meanwhile, was endorsed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chief  
prosecutor for Riverkeeper, a group that fights pollution in the 
Hudson River; environmental lawyer Larry Rockefeller, a Republican 
who occasionally supports Democrats; and state League of 
Conservation Voters Chairman Paul Elston. Elston spoke as an 
individual; his organization does not usually endorse presidential 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we want to save the planet, we've got to elect Al Gore,''  
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The national League of Conservation Voters, however, does rate  
senators and congressional representatives for votes on 
environmental issues. Its scorecard for Gore's 15 years in the 
House and Senate was 64 percent, lower than the rating for Bill 
Bradley, who scored 84 percent for his 18 years representing New 
Jersey in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who is challenging Gore for the Democratic presidential  
nomination, recently was endorsed by Friends of the Earth, which 
said his record was ``far superior'' to Gore's. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennedy disagreed, saying ``this has been Al Gore's No. 1  
issue. He literally wrote the book on the environment. He 
understands these issues with a depth of sophistication that no 
other politician has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book Kennedy referred to was Gore's ``Earth in the  
Balance.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley To Offer $5.5B Farm Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill  
Bradley is putting together a $5.5 billion farm package designed to 
restore the rural ``safety net'' by calling for cash payments to 
farmers when commodity prices sag. 
</P>
<P>
	The package, which calls for $1.32 billion in new spending, also  
proposes sharply increasing the number of environmentally fragile 
acres taken out of production, increases in farm research programs 
and a ``rigorous review'' of concentration of ownership in the meat 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's staff huddled with Iowa State University economist  
Neil Harl late into the evening Wednesday, crafting the proposal, 
which Bradley will unveil Friday during a speech at a farm near Des 
Moines. Details were made available Thursday to The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, already  
has issued his own package of farm proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when commodity prices have fallen to historic lows and  
most traditional subsidy payments are being phased out, Bradley 
calls for an ``income stabilization program'' that would provide 
temporary payments to farmers when prices fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The payments would also be capped to ensure that the bulk of  
the benefits go to small, independent producers and their 
families,'' said background documents describing the package. It 
also would require that farmers actually work the land, avoiding 
big payments to absentee landlords. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's package has an overall pricetag of $5.5 billion, but  
he said all but $1.32 billion would come from redirecting other 
farm spending. He would use the budget surplus to fund the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed expanding the Conservation Reserve Program so that  
farmers take 42 million acres of environmentally sensitive land out 
of production, at a cost of $580 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet another piece of his proposal would implement ``conservation  
security contracts'' which call for payments to farmers to reward 
them for using environmentally friendly farming techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Bradley would spend $1.25 billion on conservation  
programs. That appeals to farmers because of extra farm spending, 
and environmentalists worried about increasing chemical use and 
soil erosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley proposed spending $7 million as part of his effort to  
shift oversight of the livestock industry from the Agriculture 
Department to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wants meatpackers to be forced to disclose the prices  
they pay for animals. Some critics argue that meatpackers cut 
special deals with giant producers to pay them better prices than 
smaller, family farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The package calls for spending $60 million on farm research and  
to put in place new rural economic development programs ``that help 
farmers develop their communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley does not mention ethanol in his farm package, and he's  
had difficulties with that issue in the past. Ethanol is very 
popular in Iowa because it's distilled from corn and blended with 
gasoline that backers say is more environmentally friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley opposed tax breaks for ethanol as a senator, but says  
he's changed his mind and now backs the breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spokesman Chris Lehane accused Bradley of flip-flopping on  
farm issues, saying Bradley voted against farmers while in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 18 years in the United States Senate, Bill Bradley voted  
against farmers,'' said Lehane, who called the package ``a blatant 
political attempt to walk away from his record.''

<HEADLINE>  Ali's Daughter Debuts Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERONA, N.Y. (AP) -- She's as tall as a tree and fit as can be;  
she plans to float like a butterfly and sting like Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	Laila Ali, the second-youngest of Muhammad Ali's nine children,  
will make her professional boxing debut at Turning Stone Casino on 
Friday night, and she promised to make the sweet science a sour 
time for her opponent, April Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to knock her out,'' Laila said Thursday, her  
infectious smile lighting up a room full of microphones and 
cameras. ``I'm coming to knock somebody out, not just to win. 
Tomorrow is going to be a very exciting day for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, despite the calm facade she displayed, a nerve-racking one.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a positive nervous energy,'' the 5-foot-10, 168-pounder.  
``If I wasn't nervous, I think something would be wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Fowler, who lost her first and only professional  
bout in March 1998, came dressed in black. If she was nervous, she 
easily hid any anxiety behind a pair of dark sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just a name to me,'' said the 5-foot-6 native of  
Michigan City, Ind., who weighed in at just under 164 pounds. 
``She's never been in the ring. I'm not getting in the ring with 
her father, I'm getting in the ring with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure's not on me. I've got nothing to prove. Been  
there, done that,'' Fowler said. ``I'm just here to do what I've 
got to do and what I've been trained to do, and when the bell rings 
we'll see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be held in a 2,600-seat auditorium, and 600  
tickets were still available late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Providing room for the media promised to be more of a challenge  
than attaining a sellout. Although the bout will not be televised 
or videotaped -- Laila's wish to relieve some of that pressure -- 
promoter Mike Acri said about 90 journalists from faraway places 
such as France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Holland, Brazil, and Japan 
will be there to record the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	The significance of the moment was not lost on the headliner of  
Friday's seven-bout card. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know you guys are not here for me,'' said Donovan ``Razor''  
Ruddock, who will fight journeyman Jose Ribalta in a 10-round bout 
as he continues his comeback. ``She's taking all my press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laila said her mother, Veronica, the third of Muhammad Ali's  
four wives, would be there, but she wasn't sure whether Ali would. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like my father to be here, but it goes two ways,''  
said Laila, who operates a nail salon in Los Angeles in her spare 
time. ``Even though he's my dad and he's around me and my boxing 
career, it makes me nervous because he is the greatest and I feel 
like I can't do things wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That both of her parents weren't thrilled with her decision to  
box was not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm totally fine with the fact that he doesn't really want me  
to box,'' said Laila, who will tower over Fowler in their 
four-round bout. ``He'd rather me just go to school like I was 
going to. He doesn't want me to get hurt, but he never once told me 
not to box. I think my confidence will increase when I win 
tomorrow. I'm as comfortable as I can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laila, 21, was too young to see her father fight in person, but  
she's watched tapes of his bouts and says her favorite is Ali's 
famed ``rope-a-dope'' knockout of George Foreman in Zaire in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd think he would be all beat up and he still came back and  
won in the end. It showed me it's all in here,'' she said, pointing 
at her tightly braided head. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about a comment made by her mother -- that she was  
taking up boxing to get closer to her father -- Laila paused for a 
split second before answering. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the way I feel,'' said Laila, who was only 7 when  
her parents divorced. ``If that's something that's going on deep 
within me, I don't know. I mean, maybe. It wouldn't hurt. We could 
all get closer.''

<HEADLINE> S. Hussein Sends Promise to Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has sent a  
message to President Clinton, promising major political reforms in 
Iraq and offering to stop threatening Israel, a leading Arabic 
newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based Al-Hayat newspaper said the message includes an  
offer for unconditional talks with the United States and assurances 
that Iraq will play an effective role in the Middle East peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	The message is being carried by Jordan's King Abdullah II, who  
is scheduled to meet with Clinton on Tuesday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving for London on Wednesday en route to Washington,  
Abdullah confirmed to Jordanian reporters that he was carrying a 
message from Saddam to Clinton. He refused to give details. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't comment on that, but I have a message to pass on,''  
Abdullah was quoted as saying by Jordanian newspapers today. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Al-Hayat report is correct, it would mark a major  
turnaround in Iraq's hard-line policies and show a willingness to 
mend fences with its main enemies, the United States and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Iraq wants Washington to drop its threats to put  
Saddam and his senior aides on trial as war criminals, Al-Hayat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq's change of heart could also be linked to its demand that  
the United States drop its opposition to the lifting of U.N. 
economic sanctions, imposed in 1990 after Saddam's forces invaded 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Hayat said the Iraqi leadership expressed readiness to start  
political reforms that would include a new constitution, adopting a 
multiparty system and respect for human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has been ruled by the Baath Party for the last 31 years, 20  
of them under Saddam, whose tight control on power and intolerance 
for dissent have driven most opponents out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In his message, Saddam also proposed providing guarantees that  
it will ``play an effective role in the (Middle East) peace process 
and stop its threats against the Jewish state and neighboring 
countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordanian newspapers quoted Abdullah as saying the message was  
handed over by Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz to Jordanian 
Prime Minister Abdur Ra'uf S. Rawabdeh last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah said he intends only to deliver the message and not  
speak on behalf of Iraq. Asked if he will defend Iraq before U.S. 
officials, he said: ``Absolutely not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordanian and Iraqi officials refused to elaborate on the  
contents of the message.

<HEADLINE> Minimum Wage Hike Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The minimum wage would rise $1 over three  
years and businesses would get $35 billion in tax cuts under 
bipartisan legislation circulating Thursday in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats acknowledge that an increase in the  
$5.15-an-hour wage is all but inevitable, but many are looking for 
a way to offset the estimated $16 billion cost to businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about two dollars of tax relief for every dollar it's  
costing,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who is part of a group 
drafting the measure. ``This approach provides relief to the 
businesses that are most likely to pay for the wage hike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio declined to provide details and cautioned that the bill  
was still in flux. But congressional sources familiar with the 
draft who spoke on condition of anonymity said it would increase 
the minimum wage by 33 cents the first year, 33 cents the second 
year and 34 cents in the final year. 
</P>
<P>
	A centerpiece of the five-year tax relief package would be a  
phased-in reduction in estate tax rates, a top priority for small 
business groups. It would be similar to the estate tax reductions 
in the 10-year, $792 billion GOP tax cut vetoed by President 
Clinton but would stop short of repeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the bill would also increase the deduction  
for business meals, boost a reforestation credit for timber 
companies, extend an expiring credit for businesses that hire from 
certain hard-to-employ groups, make health insurance 100 percent 
tax deductible for the self-employed and expand pensions and 
401(k)s, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the tax cuts would take effect in 2001, meaning sponsors  
would not have to find a way to pay for it in 2000. Lazio said any 
tax relief after 2000 would use part of the projected non-Social 
Security surplus, which could trigger a veto threat from President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't worry about that right now,'' he said. ``We're going  
to try to get a package that gets bipartisan support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, House Democrats began circulating a petition  
aimed at forcing a floor vote on a straight $1 minimum wage 
increase over two years. Democrats are also looking at a business 
tax relief package but would probably pay the costs by closing 
corporate tax shelters and other revenue offsets. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a House committee heard dueling testimony Thursday  
regarding how a minimum wage increase would affect the number of 
people on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	A $1 increase would force entry-level wages higher across the  
board, increase employer costs, reduce the number of jobs and lure 
badly needed workers away from nursing homes to better paying jobs 
elsewhere, said Deborah Rowe, director of staffing services for 
Genesis ElderCare. 
</P>
<P>
	An increase ``will reduce our already limited ability to hire  
and train new employees, and thus will have a negative impact on 
hiring of public assistance recipients,'' she told the House 
Education and the Workforce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	But Heidi Hartmann, a George Washington University research  
professor, said an expanding economy will make job losses unlikely. 
``In particular, the demographic groups often thought to be most 
severely affected by a minimum wage increase -- minorities, teens 
and welfare mothers -- have experienced strong employment growth and 
low unemployment despite the increases in the minimum wage in 1996 
and 1997,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Search for Clutch Hitting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At least the Texas Rangers scored a run. They  
just couldn't get a clutch hit. 
</P>
<P>
	After going 25 playoff innings without scoring, Texas broke  
through with one run Thursday night against the New York Yankees. 
It wasn't enough, and the Rangers lost their eighth straight 
postseason game -- all to New York -- 3-1, and fell behind two games 
to none in their best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Gonzalez, who terrorized the Yankees in the 1996 AL  
playoffs before going 1-for-12 last year, provided the Rangers' 
offense by lining a homer to left field in the fourth inning off 
Andy Pettitte. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, who has scored Texas' last three runs in the  
postseason, was greeted as he returned to the dugout by a 
celebration unusually large for a single run in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, there hasn't been much to celebrate for the Rangers,  
who hadn't scored in the playoffs since the fifth inning of Game 2 
last year and hadn't held a lead for 43 straight innings in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be the only run for Texas against Andy Pettitte and  
three relievers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers, who have averaged 5.8 runs a game while leading the  
majors in batting the last two regular seasons, have been held to 
two runs and a .144 average (22-for-153) in their last five playoff 
games against the Yankees, who swept them 3-0 in the first round 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas at least threatened this time, getting seven hits. But  
Pettitte, who pitches his toughest in the stickiest situations of 
the postseason, was equal to the task. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed no hits in five at-bats with runners in scoring  
position, leaving Texas 1-for-24 in those situations the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Palmeiro and Todd Zeile hit consecutive singles to open  
the second inning. Pettitte got Roberto Kelly to swing through a 
cut fastball for the first out. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly walked back to the dugout with his head down -- an act that  
would be repeated by Rangers hitters all night long. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas had a chance to break open a 1-0 game in the fifth, but  
once again couldn't get a clutch hit. 
</P>
<P>
	With no outs and runners on second and third, the infield in and  
action in the Yankees' bullpen, Pettitte fell behind Mark McLemore 
3-0 before throwing three straight strikes for the first out. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre then moved the infield back, conceding a run  
on a grounder up the middle. Royce Clayton, however, hit a 
two-hopper to Scott Brosius at third, who held the runner and threw 
to first for the second out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers still had one more chance. But Rusty Greer swung at  
a 3-2 curveball in the dirt, ending the inning with Gonzalez on 
deck instead of at the plate with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte pumped his fist twice. Greer merely walked back to  
dugout and neatly put away his batting helmet. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas still held the lead. That would change soon enough, but  
the Rangers' playoff fortunes wouldn't.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Move Higher / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages surged to 7.82 percent this week, the highest 
level in three weeks, in part responding to a signal by the Federal 
Reserve that it may raise short-term interest rates later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was up from 7.70 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been on an upward climb this year. The  
average rates on a 30-year mortgage have hit a low of 6.74 percent 
set at the end of January and a high of 8.15 percent set in mid 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.43 percent this week, also up from the average of 7.35 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 6.27 percent this week, up from 6.12 
percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mortgage rates climbed in the latest period in part due to the  
bias of the Federal Reserve to tighten credit,'' said Robert Van 
Order, Freddie Mac's chief economist. ``Despite that, the costs of 
a mortgage remains affordable enough to assure the housing industry 
another record-setting year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Fed policy-makers decided not to raise interest  
rates for now, but left open the possibility of a third increase 
this year when it switched its policy directive, or bias, intended 
to signal future rate moves, from neutral to one tilting toward 
raising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said  
that mortgage loan applications for the week ending Oct. 1, 
increased 10.2 percent from the previous week and were down 60.1 
percent compared to the same week last year.

<HEADLINE> Carter Urges Patty Hearst Pardon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Former President Carter is urging President  
Clinton to pardon Patty Hearst, the newspaper heiress kidnapped by 
radicals in 1974 and convicted of joining them in a San Francisco 
bank heist. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old had claimed she was brainwashed by her  
Symbionese Liberation Army captors and forced to participate in the 
armed robbery. Carter commuted her 7-year sentence after she had 
served 21 months. 
</P>
<P>
	After her release from prison, Ms. Hearst married her bodyguard,  
Bernard Shaw, had two daughters, appeared in movies, wrote novels 
and has done charitable work. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter spoke with the Bush administration about a pardon and has  
spoken with Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Attorney General 
Janet Reno as well, Carter spokeswoman Carrie Harmon said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He ``has been her refuge in a sea of misunderstanding,'' Ms.  
Hearst Shaw's attorney, George Martinez, said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Wednesday he knew  
of no contact between Carter and Clinton about a pardon. 
</P>
<P>
	A former attorney who prosecuted Hearst, David Bancroft, has  
written a letter to the Justice Department opposing it. ``Simply 
staying out of trouble doesn't get you very much,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter's call for a pardon also caught the attention of  
attorneys for former SLA fugitive Kathleen Ann Soliah. 
</P>
<P>
	During 23 years on the run, Ms. Soliah married, took the name  
Sara Jane Olson, raised a family and became a community activist in 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	She was arrested in June and is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 10  
on allegations she conspired in a failed 1975 attempt to blow up 
two police cars, allegedly to avenge two SLA deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like Patricia Hearst, Sara Jane Olson has lived the life of a  
model citizen for over two decades,'' lawyers Susan Jordan and 
Stuart Hanlon said in a prepared statement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both women ``were caught up in the social turmoil of the late  
60s and early 70s,'' the lawyers said. Ms. Olson ``deserves the 
same consideration as Patty Hearst.''

<HEADLINE> $4B Phen-Fen Drug Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Home Products has agreed to pay more  
than $4 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed by patients 
claiming health problems due to the company's once popular phen-fen 
diet drug, an attorney close to the talks said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Becnel, a Louisiana plaintiffs' attorney, said the  
settlement will include money to pay patients who say they were 
injured by the drugs and for future medical monitoring for those 
who are still healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home was expected to announce the deal early this  
afternoon, said Becnel and a spokeswoman for another law firm 
representing plaintiffs, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of American Home rose $2.81, or 6 percent, to $47.94 on  
talk that a settlement was about to be annouced. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,100 suits, involving 8,000 people who took the diet  
drugs, have been filed against American Home, making it one of the 
largest product liability cases ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Becnel said the settlement totals approximately what American  
Home had offered several weeks ago. About $2.8 billion would go to 
to settle claims by people who say they developed heart valve 
injuries from taking fen-phen. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition the company offered to set up a $1.2 billion fund to  
provide medical monitoring of people who took the drug combination, 
but have no signs of injury, say lawyers familiar with the talks 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional $410,000 would be paid to cover plaintiffs'  
attorneys legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	About six million people took the drug combination.  
</P>
<P>
	Any settlement would need a federal judge's approval.  
</P>
<P>
	American Home made fenfluramine, the ``fen'' in the fen-phen  
combination and gave the drug a brand name of Pondimin. It also 
made Pondimin's chemical cousin Redux and marketed both until 
September 1997. That was when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
pushed for their withdrawal after a Mayo Clinic study linked the 
drugs to potentially fatal heart valve damage.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Courts-Martial Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed an executive order  
today increasing penalties for hate crimes and making other changes 
in the military justice code. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules ``make a number of desirable changes to modernize  
the rules of evidence that apply to court-martial proceedings and 
to take into account recent court decisions,'' Clinton said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The order allows a sentencing authority to hear evidence that a  
violent crime was based on hate, motivated by matters such as the 
victim's race, color or sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	``As in the case of laws that apply in civilian courts, this  
rule sends a strong message that violence based on hatred will not 
be tolerated,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the order permits child abuse victims to testify  
away from their accuser, typically on closed-circuit television. It 
makes conversations between patients and psychotherapists 
privileged, unless the safety of military personnel is compromised 
and in other compelling cases. And it adds reckless endangerment to 
the list of crimes in the military code.

<HEADLINE> Provision Bars Suits Vs. Truckers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Transportation Department said Thursday a  
provision buried in spending bill passed by Congress would make it 
impossible to take federal legal action against truckers violating 
safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	But the author of the provision, Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., said it  
was a necessary jolt to a system that hasn't done enough to 
confront the problem of unsafe trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The $50 billion spending bill, which President Clinton is  
expected to sign into law, bars the Office of Motor Carriers and 
its parent agency, the Federal Highway Administration, from 
spending money on some safety activities. Wolf and other critics 
say the OMC has had too cozy a relationship with the trucking 
industry and its safety responsibilities should be moved elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation general counsel Nancy McFadden, in testimony  
before a House Transportation panel Thursday, said most OMC safety 
work, including rule issuance, compliance reviews and border 
inspections, will be shifted to other department offices and will 
not be interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said that under current law only the federal highway  
administrator can assess civil penalties for violations of truck 
safety regulations and that enforcement efforts ``would be severely 
hampered by this legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State civil actions would not be impeded and safety officials  
will still be able to take out of service a truck that poses an 
imminent hazard. But federal agents ``will not be able to pursue a 
violation by initiating a civil penalty action or seeking an 
injunction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., the ranking Democrat on the ground  
transportation subcommittee, said that ``under some misguided 
notion of trying to promote truck safety, the appropriations bill 
instead effectively guts the federal motor carrier safety 
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Wolf, chairman of the House Appropriations transportation  
subcommittee, said the bill moves the government ``another step 
closer to significantly improving motor carrier safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf said ``there are bound to be a few bumps in the road'' in  
restructuring the trucking safety system, but expressed confidence 
the Transportation Department could transfer the OMC's safety 
functions without major interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Commerce  
Committee, which oversees transportation policy, urged the 
president in floor speech Monday to veto the spending bill so it 
could be amended to take out the Wolf language. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very shortsighted and a serious jeopardy to public  
safety if Congress shuts off funds for motor carrier safety 
activities,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another solution would be for Congress to quickly enact  
legislation delegating new authority to the Transportation 
Department to enforce penalties against violators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an emergency, a serious problem, and we've got to deal  
with it,'' said Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House 
Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 5,300 people died in truck-related accidents last  
year, and the administration is committed to cutting that number in 
half. But Wolf has argued that the OMC is not the right agency to 
accomplish that because the main focus of the Federal Highway 
Administration is highway construction programs.

<HEADLINE> Mattingly Throws Out First Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Don Mattingly is finally ready to take his place  
with other great former New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattingly mostly has kept his distance from the Yankees since he  
retired following the 1995 season. Now the former first baseman is 
ready to be an active member of Yankees alumni. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattingly began by throwing out the first pitch Thursday night  
before New York's playoff game against the Texas Rangers. He threw 
the pitch to former teammate Jim Leyritz and received a thunderous 
ovation from the crowd as he walked off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great honor to be asked to do this,'' Mattingly said  
before taking the field. ``I've seen a lot of guys throw out the 
first pitch, from Mr. DiMaggio to Yogi Berra. It's a little 
uncomfortable being that guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While many fans adore Mattingly as much as Yogi Berra and the  
late Joe DiMaggio, he didn't win pennants like they did. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattingly began his career in 1982 -- just one year after the  
Yankees made the World Series -- and retired after a wild-card berth 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	In between New York didn't make the playoffs, its longest  
stretch of non-postseason years since their first AL pennant in 
1921. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Mattingly's retirement, the Yankees have won two World  
Series championships, also made the playoffs on 1997 and won the AL 
East this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The toughest year was '96,'' Mattingly said of the team's  
first championship after he retired. ``Your first year out and the 
team you played on and all the guys do it. It has gotten easier and 
easier. Now I have become more of a fan who admires what this team 
has done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mattingly was the most recent Yankees captain. There has been  
speculation that shortstop Derek Jeter could be the next. Unlike 
Mattingly, Jeter has only known the postseason, making the playoffs 
each of his first four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been there every year so I think it is hard to appreciate  
it,'' Mattingly said. ``The guys that had trouble getting there are 
the ones that realize how hard it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This appearance might be the first of many around the Yankees in  
the near future for Mattingly. He expressed an interest to become 
more involved and said he probably would go to spring training as 
an instructor. 
</P>
<P>
	He is even planning to attend Old Timers Day next summer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like it's about time for me,'' he said. ``In the past,  
I just haven't really wanted to come. The first year I wasn't 
playing, the second year didn't feel right. But this year I feel 
like it's kind of time for me.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Wants To Aid Working Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETERBOROUGH, N.H. (AP) -- Offering relief to parents juggling  
jobs and families, Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley 
today proposed a $26 billion program of education grants for 
parents and children and an expanded family and medical leave law. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a plan that looks ahead to our long-term interests in  
human terms not just economic ones,'' Bradley said today at New 
Hampshire's Contoocook Valley Regional High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Nostlagic for his boyhood family dinners at a reliable 6:30 p.m.  
sharp, Bradley painted a familiar modern-day American portrait -- 
Dad working late, Mom at a meeting, kids dashing to the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new global economy just doesn't care about the 6:30 dinner  
hour,'' Bradley said, adding a poke at the Clinton-Gore 
administration's boast of economic success. ``A prosperity that 
fails to bolster families is a hollow and unsustainable one,'' 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $26 billion, 10-year cost of new grants for early childhood  
education and parent-friendly community colleges would be paid for 
-- like his $65 billion-per-year universal health plan -- from the 
federal budget surplus that is projected to reach about $1 trillion 
over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included in the package is an older-person's version of  
President Clinton's ``Americorps.'' With a goal of enlisting 
500,000 volunteers over three years, Bradley would offer a tax-free 
stipend of up to $200 a month to senior citizens who give at least 
15 hours per week to approved nonprofit youth programs such as the 
YMCA, Boys and Girls Clubs, school tutoring, or faith-based 
mentoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all in this together,'' said the former senator from  
New Jersey. ``And what individual families cannot build on their 
own, we can all build together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing a proposal voiced by Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday,  
Bradley said he would expand to workers in firms at least 25 
employees the popular Family and Medical Leave Act. The 1993 law, 
which currently applies only to businesses with 50 or more workers, 
guarantees them 12 weeks' unpaid leave to tend to a new child, a 
seriously ill family member or their own personal illness. 
</P>
<P>
	He said workers also should be given an additional 24 hours each  
year to meet other family obligations, such as attending 
parent-teacher conferences, taking a child to the dentist or 
helping an elderly relative with medical appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley aides appeared caught off guard when told late Wednesday  
that Gore, Bradley's rival for the Democratic presidential 
nomination next year, had articulated the same proposed changes to 
the family-leave law at a New York fund-raiser a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	As Bradley spoke in a crowded high school gymnasium, aides  
whispered to reporters that a new statewide poll showed the former 
New Jersey senator moving ahead of Gore in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's plan would give $2 billion per year to state and local  
partnerships -- comprised of groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, 
Parent-Teacher Association, local child welfare agencies and 
churches -- to find new ways of tackling needs for child care, 
school readiness, parenting education and special services for 
children with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty percent of the new money would be reserved to bolster  
existing programs, such as Head Start, with the balance intended to 
pay for new services. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, Bradley said, ``operates under the simple  
understanding that we all have a shared responsibility for our 
children. Government, acting as a catalyst, can provide the kind of 
supporting infrastructure that families need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley would offer $2 billion over five years in competitive  
grants to community colleges that do a better job of matching high 
school graduates' needs with demands in the local job market, 
providing flexible class schedules and on-site child care for 
working parents and improving students' technological skills. 
</P>
<P>
	The programs' remaining costs involve the proposal for a senior  
volunteer corps. 
</P>
<P>
	``My proposal focuses on four areas that are of vital concern to  
all families and is premised on a simple idea: That if you have 
health care coverage, good child care, educational opportunity and 
supportive work environments, you can be a better parent,'' Bradley 
said.

<HEADLINE> Europe Bank Leaves Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank left its key  
interest rates unchanged following its regular meeting Thursday, 
despite speculation that an increase is coming. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank left its main refinancing rate at 2.5 percent, where it  
has been since a 0.5 percent cut in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank president Wim Duisenberg indicated then that the reduction  
would be the only change for the year. But after bank officials 
last week signaled they were starting to worry about the risk of 
inflation, many economists said chances were good the bank's 
governing council would raise rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuela Preuschl, an economist with Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt,  
said she believed an increase to 3 percent was possible later in 
October or November. 
</P>
<P>
	``A rate rise is really only a question of timing,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The bank also confirmed Thursday that its overnight deposit rate  
will remain at 1.5 percent and its marginal lending rate will 
continue to be 3.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates apply mainly to loans involving large financial  
institutions but changes in those rates can trigger changes in 
commercial and consumer lending rates.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers: Nazi Workers Offered $3.3B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The German government and industries offered  
$3.3 billion today to compensate for World War II use of forced 
labor by the Nazis. Lawyers for victims labeled the offer ``an 
enormous disappointment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the German delegation they have done more harm to the  
German government and German people than they can ever imagine,'' 
said Mel Weiss, an attorney for survivors in class-action suits in 
U.S. courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Otto Lambsdorff, chief German envoy to two days of compensation  
talks hosted by the State Department, called the $3.3 billion offer 
``a considerable amount given the budget constraints in Germany.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfgang Gibowski, a spokesman for German corporations in the  
talks, said in a statement that he felt the offer shows German 
industry ``standing up to its moral responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	German officials said the offer would include payment of about  
$5,500 to each slave laborer. It was unclear what would be paid to 
other categories of victims, including those classified as forced 
laborers. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks continued into the afternoon. Attorneys said the next  
round of negotiations would be sometime in mid-November in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss first told reporters of the offer in front of the State  
Department after hearing the proposal made to a meeting of 
international negotiators by Lambsdorff. 
</P>
<P>
	``The offer amounts to about $300 million or less in 1940  
terms,'' Weiss said, charging that German industry has grown vastly 
wealthy in the years since it paid nearly nothing for the labor of 
prisoners of the Nazi regime during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is disgusting,'' Weiss said, adding that one-third of the  
money is supposed to come from the German government. He said that 
means industry came up with about $2.1 billion of the total after 
building up enormous wealth ``on the backs of these victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the proposed amount would cover payments to survivors of  
Nazi slave-labor camps as well as some compensation relating to 
unpaid World War II insurance claims, bank accounts and some other 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them that we are not going to walk away from the table  
... despite the fact that there is such enormous disappointment,'' 
Weiss said. Earlier this week, Weiss declined to say how much 
survivors demanded, but he said it far exceeds the $20 billion that 
had been recently reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambsdorff and other German negotiators were still in the  
meeting and not immediately available for comment. He had said in 
an AP interview Wednesday that he thought the offer would be 
``justified and dignified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offer was the first formal money proposal put on the table  
after months of negotiations on how to compensate an estimated 1 
million to 2.5 million people forced into labor for World War II 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only say that what I'm going to present ... is the  
result of very tough efforts in the German Republic to put this 
huge amount of money together,'' Lambsdorff said in an interview 
Wednesday with The Associated Press. ``And I would not have come 
here if I would not feel in a position to defend it as a justified, 
dignified offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first day of a two-day session at the State Department,  
negotiators Wednesday made progress on such issues as how U.S. 
courts will handle any future lawsuits by forced laborers, 
Lambsdorff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of survivors, German companies that used forced  
labor and several governments have been meeting for months to 
negotiate a plan under which the German government and industry 
would set up two foundations to handle the compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks originally involved 16 German companies sued in U.S.  
courts, but about two dozen more are reported to be planning to 
contribute funds as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has said negotiations will get money to  
more people, and faster, than the lawsuits would. Part of the 
agreement would be some kind of U.S. government statement saying 
future claims should go through the foundations, discouraging the 
filing of further suits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been asked whether I have the authority to compromise.  
I have not,'' Lambsdorff said Wednesday. ``If we can make an offer, 
then the ball is in the court of the other side and they will, and 
have to, react.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he ``would be happy'' if agreement on all issues could  
be reached by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department says an estimated 12 million workers were  
forced to work in German industry and agriculture during World War 
II. Some produced materials for the war, and some took over jobs 
from German men, freeing them to fight.	   The largest number of surviving victims are Eastern European 
Christians from countries overrun early by Hitler's forces. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the United States and Germany, the other  
countries involved in the negotiations are Israel, Poland, Belarus, 
Ukraine, Russia and the Czech Republic, officials said.

<HEADLINE> House Rejects Modest HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House members today rejected the most modest  
of four competing patient-protection bills as they confronted the 
politically charged issue of HMOs and whether injured Americans 
should be allowed to sue them. 
</P>
<P>
	Managed care has dominated the health debate on Capitol Hill all  
year, as Congress responds to voters' frustration over cost cutting 
and fears they may be denied needed care. 
</P>
<P>
	Casting their first votes on the politically hot topic, the  
House defeated, 284-145, a bill sponsored by Rep. John Boehner, 
R-Ohio, which would have given patients no new rights to file 
lawsuits. Federal law now effectively bans such suits for millions 
of Americans, even if they are injured or die because of an HMO's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative Republicans and their allies in the business and  
insurance industries preferred this bill, but Democrats and many 
Republicans felt it didn't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not hold insurance companies accountable when they  
make medical decisions that harm people,'' said Rep. Sherrod Brown, 
D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, hoping to keep Democrats united, President Clinton  
today sent a letter to Capitol Hill restating his strong support 
for a broad bill that would give patients a host of new rights, 
including broad new rights to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leaders fear that concerns over how to pay for it may  
cost them votes, but Clinton sought to clarify that he still 
strongly supports the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I endorse this legislation without reservation,'' Clinton said  
in a letter to Minority leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. ``I cannot 
support a bill that is a patients' bill of rights in name only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the House approved, largely along party lines, a  
GOP-written package of tax breaks and other provisions meant to 
help people without insurance obtain coverage. Democrats balked, 
saying the bill would cost the Treasury $48 billion over 10 years 
but help only a fraction of the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was a prelude to the main event today, as the House  
took up four competing HMO bills. Each gives patients new power to 
demand care and take disputes to outside arbitrators, but there 
were major differences over details, notably whether patients 
should be given new rights to sue -- and, if so, whether to limit 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some Republicans argued that the threat of a  
lawsuit is needed to force insurance companies to provide promised 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tell welfare mothers, we tell deadbeat dads ... you have to  
be responsible for yourself,'' said Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., 
the leading Republican backer of the right to sue. Health 
insurance, he said, is ``the only industry in America where we say 
you are absolutely protected from being responsible for your 
actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For two years, Democrats have put the GOP on the defensive over  
the politically popular HMO issue. House Republican leaders, 
struggling with a slim majority and a fractured caucus, did not 
endorse any bill until debate opened on the issue this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But they were working hard Wednesday to rally opposition to a  
sweeping bill backed by Norwood and virtually all the Democrats, 
including Clinton. That bill gives patients new power to see 
specialists, get emergency room care and take denials of care to an 
outside panel of experts. 
</P>
<P>
	Most controversially, it allows patients to sue HMOs in federal  
or state court and to collect whatever damages a jury might award. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to stop this bill, GOP leaders were trying to build  
support for an alternative by Reps. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and John 
Shadegg, R-Ariz. It would allow lawsuits only in federal courts and 
limit damages for pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also planned to vote on a fourth choice, backed by  
Reps. Amo Houghton Jr., R-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. It was 
quite similar to the Coburn-Shadegg bill, but offered in hopes of 
attracting more Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders saw the Coburn-Shadegg bill as their best hope of  
stopping the more sweeping Democratic measure, and they were 
appealing to interest groups to go easy on Republicans who vote 
``yes'' on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would rather we not vocally oppose it. After all, we  
share the same objective,'' said Neil Trautwein, a lobbyist for the 
National Association of Manufacturers, which opposes all new 
federal health mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into this week's debate, Democrats appeared to have the  
votes they needed to pass their HMO bill. But they said Wednesday 
that they may lose the votes of some conservative Democrats because 
there was no way to pay for the HMO bill, estimated to cost the 
federal government some $7 billion in lost tax revenue over 10 
years. The bill, if it became law, likely would mean higher 
insurance premiums, which means businesses would be able to take 
higher tax deductions on their insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP strategy has been to focus attention on the uninsured,  
as Republicans argue that new rights will drive up the cost of 
insurance and force employers to drop coverage. Hammering the point 
Wednesday, Republicans pushed through a bill, 227-205, aimed at 
reducing the ranks of the uninsured, which now stand at 44 million.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Falls on Output Worries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Concern that OPEC member nations were not holding to their  
production quotas sent crude oil futures prices plummeting Thursday 
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, cattle and hog futures were higher, grain  
futures fell, and soybean futures prices were steady to 
fractionally higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Several analyst surveys concluded OPEC member nations were not  
complying with quotas set in March, indicating higher oil prices 
were encouraging some nations to increase production. 
</P>
<P>
	Various surveys estimated that September oil output ranged from  
26.17 million barrels a day to 26.41 million barrels a day, 
according to analyst Tim Evans of Pegasus Econometric Group. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC has a daily production target, excluding Iraq, of 22.97  
million barrels a day, Evans said. OPEC nations produced 23.5 
million barrels a day, with Iraq adding 2.7 million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an emotional disappointment to the market,'' Evans said.  
``I don't think it shifts things to the point where (market) 
fundamentals are bearish. They are just less bullish than they were 
a week ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There also was concern that OPEC might back away from its  
commitment to current production levels, set to end in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil ministers for Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia are  
scheduled to meet next month. Mexican oil Minister Luis Tellez on 
Thursday indicated he would like to maintain current production 
levels into next year. 
</P>
<P>
	He is basically looking for negotiation on a new production  
agreement sooner, rather than later, Evans said. The market reads 
any potential change to be bearish rather than bullish. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline futures prices also were sharply lower, reflecting  
continued concern about a recent American Petroleum Institute 
report of an increase in gasoline stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Light sweet crude for November delivery was 82 cents lower at  
$22.45 a barrel; November heating oil was 1.97 cents lower at 57.46 
cents a gallon; November unleaded gasoline was 2.53 cents lower at 
62.76 a gallon; November natural gas was 4.1 cents higher at $2.641 
per 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Grain futures prices fell and soybean futures prices were steady  
to fractionally higher in trading on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures were supported by higher than expected weekly  
export sales figures, released Thursday by the U.S. Agriculture 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean exports totaled 975,400, according to the USDA, beating  
the most optimistic analyst estimates by well over 100,000 metric 
tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Weighing on soybean futures was harvest weather in the Midwest,  
which continues to look good for producers. Positioning by traders 
ahead of Friday's USDA crop production report also affected the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices fell on expectation the USDA will raise the  
size of the 1999-2000 crop in its production report. Also 
pressuring corn futures was the rapid pace of the corn crop harvest 
and reports China's corn exports will increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were sharply lower on fears the government will  
report another increase in the size of wheat stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was 5 1/2 cents lower at $2.58 3/4 a  
bushel; December corn was 1 1/2 cents lower at $2.03 1/4 a bushel; 
December oats were 2 cents lower at $1.09 3/4 a bushel; November 
soybeans were unchanged at $3.89 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and hog futures prices rose in trading on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle futures rallied due to higher cash prices and the  
likelihood strong demand will continue to the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog futures were higher on expectation of increased demand and  
on the possibility U.S. farm aid to Russia will result increased 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork belly futures were sharply higher due to rising cash  
prices. Increasing demand for bacon by fast-food restaurants also 
was a boost to prices. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle were .80 cent higher at 70 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle were .65 cent higher at 83.02 cents a pound; 
December lean hogs were 1.05 cents higher at 45.75 cents a pound; 
February pork bellies were 3 cents higher at 64.22 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Senator Outraged by Ventura Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying he was ``outraged'' by his governor's  
remarks, Sen. Paul Wellstone said Thursday that Minnesota Gov. 
Jesse Ventura should recognize that suicide is a form of mental 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in the November issue of Playboy, Ventura said  
he didn't read books by Ernest Hemingway because the writer killed 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen too many people fight for their lives. I have no  
respect for anyone who would kill himself,'' Ventura said. ``If 
you're a feeble, weak-minded person to begin with, I don't have 
time for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on the Senate floor, Wellstone, D-Minn., said Ventura  
``and all Americans need to understand that suicide is directly 
linked to mental illness. The form of mental illness we are talking 
about is severe depression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the governor of Minnesota to understand that this  
mental illness is not a moral failing,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Families that have lost members to suicide need support, said  
Wellstone, who has family members afflicted by mental illness. 
``They do not need ridicule,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone made the remarks in offering an amendment, approved by  
the Senate, to increase federal block grants for mental health 
services by $48.8 million.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Expects 8.8 Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Increasing investment and private  
consumption will help South Korea's economy grow 8.8 percent this 
year, the Bank of Korea said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's forecast is up sharply from its previous  
forecast of 6.8 percent growth. The new figure compares to South 
Korea's economic contraction of 5.8 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation is expected to post a surplus on its current account,  
the broadest measure of foreign trade, of $21 billion this year, 
the bank said. This is slightly up from a previous forecast of a 
$20 billion surplus, but sharply down from a $40.6 billion surplus 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account measures trade in merchandise, services,  
tourism and investment. It is calculated by determining the 
difference between South Korea's income from foreign sources 
against payments on foreign obligations. It excludes net capital 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, South Korea's trade surplus is expected to reach  
$25.8 billion this year, down from a $41.6 billion surplus last 
year, while the consumer price index, a measure of inflation, is 
expected to rise only 0.8 percent this year, sharply down from 7.5 
percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank also said the nation's economy would grow by 6.4  
percent next year, slightly up from its previous forecast of a 
growth between 5 and 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Health-Care Tax Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House, preparing for a series of showdown  
votes on patient protections, confronted the politically charged 
issue of HMOs and whether injured Americans should be allowed to 
sue them. 
</P>
<P>
	Managed care has dominated the health debate on Capitol Hill all  
year, as Congress responds to voter frustration over cost cutting 
and fears they may be denied needed care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day I hear from my constituents who are enrolled in  
HMOs, crying out for help,'' Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said in a 
typical speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening the debate over health care Wednesday, the House  
approved, largely along party lines, a GOP-crafted package of tax

coverage on their own and for long-term care insurance. But it also 
includes a provision opposed by many Democrats that would allow 
more medical savings accounts, which let people opt out of the 
current health insurance market and buy high-deductible plans on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would give small businesses the option to  
buy health insurance under federal rather than state regulation -- 
exempting them from state mandates that bigger self-insured 
companies already avoid.

<HEADLINE> FCC OKs Ameritech-SBC Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fifteen years after the court-ordered breakup  
of the old Bell system, the pieces are coming back together. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger between SBC Communications and Ameritech Corp. to  
create the nation's largest local phone company -- a deal given 
clearance by federal regulators Wednesday -- leaves just four 
remaining regional Bells out of the seven created when American 
Telephone &AMP; Telegraph Co. was dismantled in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies like SBC and Ameritech assert that such consolidation  
is needed for them to compete and to provide packages of 
telecommunications services to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly going to increase competition,'' SBC's  
chairman, Edward Whitacre Jr., said of the $74 billion deal. The 
combined business, which will keep the SBC name, would control 57 
million, or one-third, of the nation's local phone lines spread 
across 13 states, primarily in the Southwest and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre pledged that consumers would soon see the benefits of  
the union with packages of services and accelerated rollout of 
high-speed Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also is poised to seek federal permission to provide  
long-distance service to its local phone customers, after getting a 
signal Wednesday from Texas regulators that it had met a list of 
statutory requirements to do so, Whitacre said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the new SBC eventually wins FCC permission to provide  
long-distance service to its local customers, MCI WorldCom, Sprint 
and AT&AMP;T could face a formidable rival. 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said the merger, which was approved  
with considerable conditions, could boost the likelihood that a new 
SBC would get into long-distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will speed the day when they can show their markets are  
open to competition in ways that allow them to compete in 
long-distance,'' Kennard said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger announced Tuesday between MCI WorldCom and Sprint is  
likely to make regulators more receptive to the new SBC's entering 
the long-distance market, said Rex Mitchell, a telecommunications 
analyst with Banc of America Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC adopted 30 conditions to ensure the SBC-Ameritech deal  
would serve the public interest. The new SBC must enter 30 new 
markets within 30 months to compete with established local phone 
companies. The company is required to provide deep discounts on key 
pieces of their networks to rivals who want to lease them. 
</P>
<P>
	The business also must establish a separate subsidiary to  
provide advanced telecommunications services such as high-speed 
Internet access. At least 10 percent of its upgraded services would 
go toward low-income regions. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions ``are unprecedented in their detail, their  
clarity and their enforceability and the vigor with which they 
inject competition in these monopoly markets,'' Kennard said. The 
conditions also are backed up with $2.2 billion in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't ever plan to pay a dollar,'' Whitacre said. ``I think  
we can certainly meet those standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But consumer groups say that the deal will not do enough to help  
local residential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission has simply abandoned the average guy who  
worries about his phone bill,'' said Mark Cooper of the Consumer 
Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI, which along with other major long-distance carriers had  
voiced opposition to the deal, expressed concern about enforcement 
of the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The new SBC won't be the last word in Bell mergers. The FCC is  
still reviewing Bell Atlantic's proposed deal with GTE. If allowed 
to combine, those two companies would trump SBC as the nation's 
largest local phone company.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Begins No Gun Ri Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The South Korean government began a  
field investigation today that will look into allegations that 
hundreds of Korean refugees were killed by U.S. soldiers in the 
early days of the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the first time government investigators had formal  
interviews with people who have long contended that retreating 
American soldiers kept South Korean refugees under a railroad 
bridge at the hamlet of No Gun Ri and killed hundreds of them in 
July 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigators also visited the bullet-scarred railroad  
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	``On behalf of the government, we offer a sincere apology for  
coming to this scene so late, nearly 50 years after the incident 
happened,'' said Park Chul-gon, leader of an eight-member 
investigation team. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, The Associated Press reported that American veterans  
confirmed the accounts by South Korean villagers who said they saw 
U.S. forces shoot civilians. South Korean survivors estimated 300 
civilians were shot to death and an additional 100 died in a 
preceding air attack. 
</P>
<P>
	After the AP report, the U.S. and South Korean governments  
promised thorough investigations. Until then, both Washington and 
Seoul had rejected the survivors' claims.

	``We still have a lot of work to be done,'' Bob McNair said  
Thursday while basking in congratulations from county officials and 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL owners approved McNair's $700 million bid for the league's  
32nd franchise Wednesday. As part of the deal, Houston will get to 
play host to a Super Bowl, most likely in 2004, an event officials 
estimated would pump $400 million into the Houston economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Topping McNair's agenda are construction of a planned $310  
million stadium next to the existing Astrodome, selecting a team 
name and hiring a general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Groundbreaking for the 70,000-seat stadium is set for March 8,  
with completion Aug. 1, 2002, coinciding with the team's first 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This facility, in our mind, is going to have an equal impact  
to the impact the Astrodome had in 1964,'' McNair said. ``It's the 
first open-air stadium with a retractable roof, natural grass 
playing field for football in the world, and we think it's just 
going to be gorgeous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Naming rights for the stadium will be sold to the highest  
corporate bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can say is, if we set a record on the price  
we paid for the franchise, I hope we set another record on the 
price for naming rights,'' McNair said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Patterson, vice president of McNair's Houston NFL  
Holdings, said the stadium will set the ``standard for the new 
millenium.'' Ticket prices, he promised, will not. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson said general admission prices will be consistent with  
other NFL teams, ranging from about $25 to $75. But about 
two-thirds of tickets will require the purchase of personal seat 
licenses. License costs have not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Pocketbook concerns didn't stop fans from trying to line up  
season tickets for 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson said the organization's Web site in its first hour  
Thursday received 200,000 hits. A toll-free phone number providing 
ticket sales information had a one-hour backlog. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody asks if people in Houston love football, all you  
have to do is look at those facts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair said a campaign to name the team will get under way  
quickly, emphasizing fan participation. Early registered nominees 
include ``Texans'' and ``Roustabouts.'' One name has been ruled 
out, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to be the `Roughnecks' because the press has  
already told me the first thing that'll happen is they'll 
abbreviate and start calling us the `Necks,' or `Rednecks,' or 
something,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson said the name should be announced before the March  
groundbreaking. Selection of team colors will require guidance and 
approval by the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiring a general manager might not take as long. McNair said he  
has already received inquiries and hopes to make a decision within 
three or four months. 
</P>
<P>
	One potential candidate who has spoken with McNair is former  
Washington Redskins general manager Charley Casserley, who was 
forced out by the Redskins' new owner two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's certainly a qualified person and a person we'd want to  
talk to,'' McNair said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair also hopes to put scouts in place quickly. Hiring a  
coaching staff will come later, he said.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Buildings Need More Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal buildings have become safer, but some  
shortcomings continue to plague the government's efforts to improve 
building security, an investigator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Service Administration's Public Building Service has  
made progress in installing security devices -- X-rays, metal 
detectors and surveillance equipment -- in public buildings 
nationwide, Eugene Waszily, a GSA assistant inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also has taken steps to use most of the $2 million in  
security equipment found in a Washington, D.C., warehouse, Waszily 
told members of the House Transportation Committee's oversight and 
investigations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the most expensive equipment items, such as X-rays and  
magnetometers, have either been put in service or had a designated 
use planned,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he noted that more than 200 cameras, monitors and VCRs  
remained in storage. ``We have encouraged the federal Protective 
Service to survey all of its other regions to determine whether 
they have any use for this equipment,'' Waszily said. 
</P>
<P>
	Less progress has been made in ensuring that officials have  
accurate and reliable information about its security measures, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Waszily said there were record-keeping discrepancies in 104 of  
207 buildings visited during a 15-month review. 
</P>
<P>
	``These inaccuracies render the national database unreliable for  
program management and decision-making purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton launched an effort to increase security at  
federal buildings across the nation after the April 1995 bombing of 
the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 
people.

<HEADLINE> Amusement Park Safety Bill Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seizing on a series of amusement park  
fatalities over the summer, lawmakers proposed Wednesday giving the 
government expanded authority to regulate all rides. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission now regulates rides that  
travel from site to site with carnivals and seasonal fairs. 
Regulation of roller coasters and other rides at amusement parks is 
left to the states, more than a dozen of which lack inspection 
programs, the commission said in a recent report on amusement park 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many states have simply failed to step in where the federal  
safety agency has been excluded,'' said Rep. Edward Markey, 
D-Mass., the lead sponsor of the bill introduced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``States are not equipped and not inclined to act as a national  
clearinghouse of safety problems associated with particular rides 
or with operator of patron errors. That is a federal function,'' 
Markey, the top Democrat on the House Commerce subcommittee with 
jurisdiction over the commission, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	With regulatory power over amusement parks, the commission could  
set standards for rides, perform inspections and investigations, 
recall unsafe equipment and impose civil penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission reported two weeks ago that emergency room  
injuries from amusement park rides have risen 87 percent over five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	John Graff, president of the International Association of  
Amusement Parks and Attractions, said that increase reflected a 
change in how injury data are collected and analyzed more than a 
true rise in injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the accidents at amusement parks this summer:  
</P>
<P>
	--A 12-year-old disabled boy was killed Aug. 22 after he slipped  
out of the harness and fell out of the Drop Zone Stunt Tower at 
Paramount's Great America in Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	--On Aug. 23, at Paramount's Kings Dominion in Doswell, Va., a  
man who had partially wiggled out of a shoulder harness died when 
he fell from the Shockwave, a stand-up roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
	--On Aug. 28, a mother and daughter died when they were ejected  
from a roller coaster car at Gillian's Wonderland Pier in Ocean 
City, N.J., after it suddenly slid backward and crashed into 
another car.

<HEADLINE> Market Quakes and Aftershocks / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It isn't so much that the stock market is built  
atop an earthquake fault line. No, it's just that certain players 
are standing on a quivering foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday this week the Dow Jones industrial average was  
enjoying a pleasant day, reflected by a Dow Jones average that was 
up more than 100 points, and rising. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reasons for the optimism. The dollar was  
strengthening against the Japanese yen, and investors were 
anticipating strong third-quarter earnings from the ubiquitous 
technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	And then it happened: Shortly after 2 p.m., the Federal Reserve  
said that while it wasn't raising interest rates immediately, it 
was leaning in that direction and might do so at some future date. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few minutes the Dow had given up all its gain, heading  
toward a decline of more than 232 points in little more than an 
hour, accelerating to the South like it meant to winter there. 
</P>
<P>
	And then it made an abrupt V-turn, almost as if to ask, ``what  
am I doing?'' Heading north again, it speeded up in the last 
half-hour of trading and ended the day less than a point below 
where it had ended the previous session.	   Such brief, violent shocks have vibrated the market all year 
long, scaring the wits out of the timid, making money for shrewd 
short-sellers, and telegraphing a message to those who will listen. 
</P>
<P>
	The message is an old one: Buy companies, not stocks. Or, stated  
another way, put your faith and money in shares of well-chosen 
companies and, lest you be driven mad, ignore the convulsions. 
</P>
<P>
	As offered by some institutional portfolio managers, the amazing  
explanation for this particular convulsion was that Alan Greenspan, 
the Fed chairman, had surprised them by suggesting interest rates 
might rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazing, because Greenspan had never hidden his bias toward  
raising rates at the merest indication of inflation. Not only had 
he already done so, he had all but proclaimed he'd do it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever, those who play the market rather than invest in good  
companies, and that includes many of the big mutual fund managers, 
reacted to the news rather than to long-term corporate prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players, as contrasted with investors, are part of a  
herd, and news good or bad spreads quickly through the herd. And if 
the news is seen as bad to a few they can panic the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	You may recall they did this back in October 1987, when the  
market plunged 20 percent in a day, but soon recovered and began 
its spectacular climb. A case of short-term fear vs. long-term 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who stayed the course made lots of dividends and capital  
gains; the in-out traders paid lots of commissions and taxes. And, 
because of this, they fell far short of obtaining maximum gains. 
</P>
<P>
	In short, the marketplace is a long-running play rather than a  
series of one-night stands, or a marathon rather than a dash, a 
view endorsed by Brad Perry, former chairman of David L. Babson &AMP; 
Co., investment counselors. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``The Babson Staff Letter,'' he writes that a focus on  
companies ``not only enables investors to make much better-reasoned 
decisions; it also helps them keep calm during market extremes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He continues: ``Being able to worry less can make investing fun  
rather than a headache. And staying off the emotional roller 
coaster of the stock market prevents rash, stupid decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perry is having fun. He's just written and published ``Winning  
the Investment Marathon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stop worrying and don't be impatient, he says.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Expects 8.8 Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Increasing investment and private  
consumption will help South Korea's economy grow 8.8 percent this 
year, the Bank of Korea said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's forecast is up sharply from its previous  
forecast of 6.8 percent growth. The new figure compares to South 
Korea's economic contraction of 5.8 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation is expected to post a surplus on its current account,  
the broadest measure of foreign trade, of $21 billion this year, 
the bank said. This is slightly up from a previous forecast of a 
$20 billion surplus, but sharply down from a $40.6 billion surplus 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account measures trade in merchandise, services,  
tourism and investment. It is calculated by determining the 
difference between South Korea's income from foreign sources 
against payments on foreign obligations. It excludes net capital 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, South Korea's trade surplus is expected to reach  
$25.8 billion this year, down from a $41.6 billion surplus last 
year, while the consumer price index, a measure of inflation, is 
expected to rise only 0.8 percent this year, sharply down from 7.5 
percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank also said the nation's economy would grow by 6.4  
percent next year, slightly up from its previous forecast of a 
growth between 5 and 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gore Rips Bush Environmental Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Accepting the endorsement of environmental  
activists, Vice President Al Gore accused George W. Bush on 
Thursday of allowing Texas to become the most polluted state in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a Texas-sized tragedy, and that kind of approach cannot  
be taken into the White House because our children deserve better 
than to have their environment and their health given to a person 
who carries water -- dirty water -- for the special interests,'' Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to rankings from the 1999 U.S. Environmental  
Protection Agency Toxic Release Inventory Report, the vice 
president said that Texas ranks ``No. 1 for toxic releases into the 
air, into the water and into the soil. For the first time ever, 
Houston, Texas, is taking over the top spot as the city with the 
worst smog pollution in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A campaign spokesman for Bush, the front-runner in the  
Republican presidential primary race, responded to Gore's pointed 
attack with biting sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize Al Gore's long history of weird and extreme  
environmental ideas, so we all are anxiously awaiting his plan to 
reduce summertime temperatures in Houston, Texas,'' said Scott 
McClellan, a Bush spokesman. ``After all, Gore invented the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McClellan defended Bush's environmental record, saying he was  
the first Texas governor to get manufacturing plants built before 
the Clean Air Act to significantly reduce air emissions. He also 
said that Texas leads the nation in reducing the release and 
disposal of toxic substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was endorsed at a luncheon for 150 activists by Robert F.  
Kennedy Jr., chief prosecutor for Riverkeeper, a group that fights 
pollution in the Hudson River; environmental lawyer Larry 
Rockefeller, a Republican who often crosses party lines to support 
Democrats for environmentalism; and state League of Conservation 
Voters Chairman Paul Elston. Elston spoke as an individual; his 
organization has not yet made an official endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	The national League of Conservation Voters does not usually  
endorse presidential candidates, but it does rate senators and 
congressional representatives for votes on environmental issues. 
Its scorecard for Gore during 15 years in the House and Senate was 
64 percent, lower than the rating for Bill Bradley, who scored 84 
percent for his 17 years as a New Jersey senator. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who is fighting Gore for the Democratic presidential  
nomination, was recently endorsed by another environmental group, 
Friends of the Earth, which called Bradley's record ``far 
superior'' to Gore's. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennedy disagreed. ``If we want to save the planet, we've  
got to elect Al Gore president,'' he said. He added that the main 
difference between Bradley and Gore on the environment is that 
``this has been Al Gore's No. 1 issue. He literally wrote the book 
on the environment. He understands these issues with a depth of 
sophistication that no other politician has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book Kennedy referred to was Gore's ``Earth in Balance.''  
</P>
<P>
	Gore took some heat in July on one incident related to the  
environment: A dam in New Hampshire was opened to release about 4 
billion gallons of water so the vice president wouldn't get stuck 
paddling a canoe on the Connecticut River for a photo opportunity. 
Gore's staff said they did not ask for the water to be released and 
contended that it actually had a positive impact on the 
environment.

<HEADLINE> Violence Turns Off Stars' Modano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas Stars center Mike Modano, who strained neck  
ligaments after being sent head first into the boards last week, 
said the NHL is growing increasingly violent and if it doesn't 
change, he'll retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano, who also broke his nose and had a mild concussion after  
Anaheim defenseman Ruslan Salei cross-checked him from behind in 
Saturday's game, admits he's nervous about playing again and taking 
another hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a scary incident,'' said Modano, who was knocked  
unconscious and remembers waking to find doctors and trainers 
hovering over and yelling at him to try to move his arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see it on replay ... and to see how close (the hit)  
could've been to hampering me or from keeping me from playing ever 
again ... it makes you wonder whether it's worth it to play in this 
game and in sports in general,'' said Modano, the bridge of his 
nose bruised and scraped. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with reporters after a light workout, the team's best  
offensive player said he still feels like he's ``in a bit of a 
fog.'' Recent neurological tests showed he was recovering well, but 
Modano said he's not sure when he'll play again. 
</P>
<P>
	If the career-ending or life-threatening violence doesn't stop,  
Modano said he will get off the ice for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``If things continue, I'm not going to play anymore,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've only got four or five years more (to play), then I'm  
done,'' Modano said. ``I still have the rest of my life to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Clean hard-hitting physical play'' will always be an  
acceptable part of hockey, he said. But in the past two or three 
years, incidents of intentional violence have increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started, you didn't hear much about concussions. Now  
it's evolved into an anything-to-win attitude, even if that means 
taking out a team's top players,'' said Modano, who led the Stanley 
Cup champions in regular-season scoring with 81 points and playoff 
scoring with 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Campbell, NHL's vice president of hockey operations,  
warned last year that the league would crack down on deliberate 
attempts to injure -- particularly hits to the head. The league was 
concerned about the growing number of concussions that sidelined 
such headliners as Paul Kariya, Eric Lindros and Pat LaFontaine in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week Campbell said, ``Our stance against hits to  
the head remains very much in place. Such behavior will not be 
tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Modano and teammate Darryl Sydor, who fractured his left  
eye socket in a fight with Anaheim's Jim McKenzie, felt the NHL 
missed an opportunity to slap longer suspensions on the Mighty 
Ducks players and send a message that gratuitous violence won't be 
tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we have to wait for someone to be paralyzed or killed  
before the league, teams and players come together and act?'' said 
Modano, whose doctors told him he was lucky he could walk, much 
less play again. 
</P>
<P>
	The league suspended Salei for 10 games for the hit and will  
forfeit $109,756 in salary. McKenzie was suspended for four games 
and will lose close to $13,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydor, who joined Modano on the ice at Dr. Pepper StarCenter,  
said he gets headaches and his vision is occasionally blurry but 
feels lucky he isn't blind in his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was talking to my wife about it and I wonder if it's all  
worth it,'' the defenseman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano urged the Stars not to seek revenge during Friday's  
contest against Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am calling on my teammates to set an example for all  
players. I am looking forward to getting back on the ice and 
playing as soon as possible, but not to getting even,'' Modano said 
in a statement. ``More importantly, I don't want anyone getting 
even on my behalf.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mixed Vs. Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar finished little changed against other  
leading currencies in New York trading Thursday after European 
central bankers decided against changing key lending rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0710, up  
from $1.0697 late Wednesday while the British pound fell to $1.6523 
from $1.6562. The dollar edged down to 107.49 Japanese yen from 
107.51 yen late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Central Bank held the line Thursday on short-term  
interest rates for the 11 nations that have adopted the euro. The 
Bank of England did the same for Britain, which is not part of the 
euro zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, told a  
news conference following Thursday's meeting that inflationary 
risks are increasing, but not enough to warrant raising interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	He did signal an end, however, to the ECB's easy monetary  
policy. That stance has ``served its purpose'' over the past year 
and ``contributed to a resumption of growth in the climate of price 
stability,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillermo Estebanez, a senior currency strategist at Bank of  
America in San Francisco, described the remarks as ``a fairly 
hawkish speech warning the markets that he is on the bias toward 
tightening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be some doubt on when it happens ... but there is  
some fear that they are closer to raising them than not,'' 
Estebanez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, he said the dollar held its ground.  
</P>
<P>
	He noted that policy-makers at the Federal Reserve had also  
indicated they were leaning toward boosting U.S. lending rates in 
the future even as they left short-term rates unchanged earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar has been holding onto the gains that it has had for  
a few days already,'' Estebanez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of England was not expected to adjust its rates  
Thursday after raising them unexpectedly a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4872 Swiss francs on Thursday,  
down from 1.4891 Wednesday, and 1.4714 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.4693. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8259  
German marks, down from 1.8282; 6.1239 French francs, down from 
6.1318; and 1,807.66 Italian lire, down from 1,809.94.

<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kristine Lilly scored two goals and Mia  
Hamm had three assists Thursday night, as the United States beat 
Finland 6-0 in the second leg of the U.S. Women's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of Lilly's goals came after the half as the defending World  
Cup champions improved to 2-0 in the three-game tournament. The 
United States, which outshot Finland 27-0 on Thursday, has 
outscored its opponents 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly's blast from inside the 6-yard box on an assist from  
Danielle Fotopolous made it 4-0 in the 54th minute, and she took a 
cross from Brandi Chastain at the top of the penalty area and drove 
it past goalkeeper Satu Kannas for a 5-0 lead in the 63rd minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 36,405 was the largest ever to see a soccer game in  
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm assisted on all three of the United States' first-half  
goals before sitting down at the start of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans scored in the 9th minute, when Tiffeny Milbrett  
put a left-footed shot past Kunnas from the edge of the area. Joy 
Fawcett made it 2-0 in the 14th minute when she took Hamm's pass 
and drove the ball into the top of the net from 10 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Whalen bounced a shot off a defender's leg in a crowded  
penalty area for a 3-0 lead in the 36th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States' final goal, in the 88th minute, was an own  
goal charged to Terhi Uui-Luomalahti. The ball went off her foot as 
she tried to beat Fotopolous to a pass from Shannon McMillan. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early game, Roseli and Raquel scored two goals each to  
lead Brazil to a 4-0 win over South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Roseli, who missed the World Cup with a knee injury as Brazil  
finished third, has four goals and one assist in two U.S. Women's 
Cup games. South Korea has been outscored 9-0 in its two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Roseli gave Brazil a 1-0 lead with a penalty kick in the 39th  
minute and made it 2-0 in the 53rd with a slow roller that went 
through the legs of goalkeeper Ho Jung Jung. Raquel's goals came in 
the 54th and 74th minutes.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Alliance Wins in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's  
22-party alliance won India's parliamentary elections, unofficial 
results showed today, providing a chance for a stable government 
that may sign a nuclear test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	With winners unofficially declared for 489 seats, Vajpayee's  
alliance had won 272 parliamentary seats while Congress and its 
allies trailed at 123. Results for all but six remaining 
constituencies were expected late today and the official results 
were to be declared Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee's alliance was projected to win more, as vote counting  
continued. 
</P>
<P>
	India's stock exchange, looking for stability after four  
governments in four years, reacted with confidence to television 
projections showing Vajpayee's alliance would win at least 294 
seats, a comfortable majority of the 543 elected seats in the lower 
house of parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	His alliance was collecting 40 percent of the vote compared to  
34 percent for the opposition Congress and its partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombay's Sensitive Index rose 3.9 percent and Moody's Investor  
Service upgraded India's rating from stable to positive, saying the 
new government is likely to pursue aggressive economic 
restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, supporters gathered at Vajpayee's house and threw  
garlands around his neck. He had emerged briefly Wednesday to flash 
a ``V'' for victory sign and to say he was expecting to form a 
government. He planned to meet with the leaders of his alliance 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The allies this time are much more reliable. I don't see any  
problems for a couple of years,'' said Sudhir Jalan, president of 
the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Congress Party, led by Italian-born Sonia Gandhi, was facing  
its worst showing. Projections from the ballot counting showed 
Congress, which governed India for 45 of its 52 years, winning 108 
seats, down from 140 in last year's election. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress spokesman Jairam Ramesh rejected suggestions that Mrs.  
Gandhi was to blame for the party's poor showing, saying errors in 
strategy and voters' concern with local issues were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``To extrapolate that this is a referendum on Mrs. Gandhi is  
just not true,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Within weeks, the new government must reach crucial decisions on  
whether to sign a global treaty banning nuclear tests and formulate 
its own nuclear doctrines for its developing atomic arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh told STAR television network the  
new government would quickly take up the issue of the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also faces the challenge of putting relations  
with Pakistan back on track after a fierce border confrontation 
this summer that cost more than 1,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting in five flood-ravaged constituencies was rescheduled for  
Oct. 28 and a court in the eastern state of Bihar ordered the 
Election Commission not to announce results for one seat after the 
two main parties charged each other with intimidating voters, 
ballot stuffing and other irregularities.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Sign Antitrust Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Japan signed an  
agreement Thursday to increase their cooperation in investigating 
corporate mergers and price-fixing that affect both countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Signing the agreement in her Justice Department conference room,  
Attorney General Janet Reno said it ``recognizes the increasing 
interrelations between ... the world's two largest national 
economies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission,  
who also signed, said the agreement ``emerges out of an astonishing 
increase in global trade and global competition. Almost 50 percent 
of the mergers we investigate thoroughly affect consumers in two or 
more countries, sometimes consumers in 10 or 12 countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japan enacted its anti-monopoly law in 1947 and is now  
participating in the 21st annual antitrust consultation with U.S. 
counterparts. But Hideaki Kobayashi, charge d'affairs ad interim of 
Japan, said officials ``felt an increasing need for an agreement on 
anti-competitive policies so we can cooperate further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Certain differences do exist in the legal framework of our  
countries, which rendered our joint work a challenge,'' said 
Kobayashi, who signed for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Yasuchika Negoro, chairman of Japan's Fair Trade Commission,  
said it was appropriate that this was Japan's first antitrust 
cooperation agreement because ``our deepest relations are with the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modeled on pacts the United States reached in 1991 with the  
European Union and in 1995 with Canada, the agreement provides that 
each country will notify the other of enforcement actions that 
might affect it, that they will consider coordinating enforcement 
actions and that each will consider acting against domestic 
behavior that harms the other country. 
</P>
<P>
	While it calls for the exchange of information, the pact does  
not permit the sharing of nonpublic information or evidence 
gathered in a law enforcement investigation. Thus, it falls short 
of the full antitrust mutual legal assistance agreement the United 
States signed with Australia earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein said he  
believed it would increase the exchange of information and 
assistance in obtaining witnesses. ``I look forward to a full 
agreement ... several years in the future,'' said Klein, who heads 
the Justice Department's antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also has antitrust cooperation agreements with  
Germany and Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Inside the sprawling brick church, Pastor Arthur  
Brazier approaches the pulpit. Some 3,500 parishioners pack the 
plush red pews in the regal amphitheater, swaying and singing. 
</P>
<P>
	Stragglers, late after scrambling for a spot in one of the  
church's four parking lots on a desolate commercial strip, squeeze 
into balcony seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here, we don't bring the Scripture down to our level,'' the  
78-year-old pastor declares. ``Here, we rise to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The congregation erupts with a chorus of amens and applause.  
</P>
<P>
	As Brazier scans the sea of faces, the reality is inescapable:  
the 100-member congregation he took over in 1960 is all grown up. 
The Apostolic Church of God now has more than 14,000 members and a 
multimillion-dollar budget. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago and around the country, the black megachurch has  
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Megachurches, defined as those that draw more than 2,000  
visitors each Sunday, first attracted national attention in the 
mid-1990s. Predominantly white churches were noticed first. But in 
1997, the last time attendance was compared, two black megachurches 
were the fastest-growing in the country, says John Vaughan of 
Church Growth Today, a research center in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, there are at least 60 black megachurches. The  
largest, in or near Chicago, Baltimore, New Orleans, Los Angeles 
and Atlanta, boast memberships between 8,000 and 24,000. With 
donations from their mostly middle-class members, many are building 
at record pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, they hold two to three Sunday services, and two of  
the largest have built sanctuaries that seat 8,000 and 10,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the explosive growth?  
</P>
<P>
	``African-Americans have moved into the middle class, and  
they're not finding Shangri-La,'' Brazier says. ``They are 
beginning to realize that material gain doesn't give you everything 
you need. There is something missing for a lot of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adds Raymond Laseter, an Apostolic member: ``People are catching  
hell outside the church. They're looking for something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In African-American history, black megachurches are not new;  
they flourished from the end of the 19th century through the 1930s. 
But experts say the current boom, which started in the 80s and took 
off in the 90s, is unique. 
</P>
<P>
	``The megachurch is more than a church with a huge attendance,''  
says Scott Thumma, a sociologist at the Hartford Seminary in 
Connecticut. ``Megachurches offer a unique way of being religious 
in modern society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks, as well as whites flocking to megachurches, have  
extended the concept of comparison shopping to the spiritual world. 
After shopping around, both groups are drawn to the lively 
services, inspirational pastors and the ``message of action and 
empowerment'' in the megachurches, Thumma says. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks diverge, though, on the social end. Many middle-class  
churchgoers, increasingly distant from black urban life, are 
looking for ways to connect with other blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Holly, a member of an Afrocentric megachurch in Chicago,  
sought out Trinity United Church of Christ after growing weary of 
living and working in places where he was one of the only black 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Many blacks are also seeking out churches that work to rebuild  
the neighborhoods that some members left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Churches are the ones that are going to bring about the  
changes,'' says Brenda Sampson, 50, an Apostolic member. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, her congregation will spend over $500,000 to  
encourage community development and feed the hungry in its 
distressed South Side neighborhood. Outside the church, Brazier 
founded two groups that develop housing and commerce near the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	When people like Sampson and Holly find the right mix of  
qualities, ``they don't ask if they're at grandma's Baptist 
church,'' says Robert Franklin Jr., president of the 
Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The traditional black Methodist and Baptist church, Brazier  
says, was a turnoff for many. 
</P>
<P>
	``The music is classical, folks are quiet and there are few  
hallelujahs and amens,'' Brazier says. ``They get bored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many blacks rejected those churches during the civil rights  
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many saw their old churches as highly moralistic places that  
had a guilt-inducing quality,'' Franklin says. ``They were insular 
and didn't talk much about transforming the world or serving the 
poor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their place, several megachurch styles have evolved. Some are  
Afrocentric. Others offer ``theological nationalism,'' which Dwight 
Hopkins of the University of Chicago Divinity School describes as 
``something positive about black folks coming together in their own 
style.'' A few, like Brazier's, take a more traditional approach 
toward Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	Most share several fundamentals. They tend to emphasize  
spirituality above all else and preach a conservative theology, 
though the majority take more liberal views on social and political 
issues, Thumma says. 
</P>
<P>
	Most black megachurch leaders also recognize that their members  
crave practical as well as spiritual guidance. The result is a 
seven-day-a-week church with programs covering everything from 
single parenting and Bible study to AIDS education. 
</P>
<P>
	On a typical Tuesday night at Apostolic, about 100 cars are  
parked in the lots. Inside, past signs advertising a health fair 
and a ``marriage night out,'' sounds of a choir practice fill the 
120,000-square-foot building. 
</P>
<P>
	Upstairs is the men's ministry. In an austere classroom, about  
25 men in their 20s and 30s, give their all to God. Equipped with 
dog-eared Bibles and T-shirts that read, ``Apostolic Man, Saved and 
Kept by God's Power,'' the group spends two hours reading 
Scripture. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need a 40-ouncer (malt liquor) and Jesus Christ,'' leader  
Ronald Smith cries out. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need some crack cocaine and Jesus Christ,'' he follows.  
</P>
<P>
	``But just give me Jesus Christ.''  
</P>
<P>
	With a roar, the men belt out a final call: ``Amen!''

<HEADLINE> $3.75B Phen-Fen Drug Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Home Products has agreed to pay $3.75  
billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people 
claiming health problems due to the company's once popular fen-phen 
diet drug combination, the company announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement will include money to pay patients who say they  
were injured by the drugs and for future medical monitoring for 
those who are still healthy. Pending a judge's approval, initial 
payments will begin later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home made fenfluramine, the ``fen'' in the fen-phen  
combination, and gave the drug a brand name of Pondimin. It also 
made Redux, a chemical cousin. In September 1997, the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration pushed for their withdrawal after a Mayo Clinic 
study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement is open to anyone who used fen-phen and Redux in  
the United States, whether or not they filed suit, American Home 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement provides fair and equitable terms for both  
diet drug claimants and American Home Products,'' and allows the 
company to ``move beyond the uncertainty and distractions of 
litigation,'' said chairman John R. Stafford in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis L. Hoynes, senior vice president and general counsel,  
reiterated the company's position that the drugs were safe for most 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The scientific studies conducted to date and clinical  
experience indicate that the health of the overwhelming majority of 
people who took Redux or Pondimin has not been adversely 
affected,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On news of the settlement, shares of American Home rose $3.12 1/2,  
or 7 percent, to $48.25. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,100 suits have been filed against American Home, making  
it one of the largest product liability cases ever. About six 
million people took the drug combination. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home said the maximum amount available to any  
individual in the settlement is about $1.5 million, depending on 
the seriousness of their health problems, how long they took the 
drugs, their age and other medical conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement is optional, allowing users to pursue lawsuits on  
their own. However, if American Home believes too many refuse to 
participate, it can terminate the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement terms call for payments to continue for about 16  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Payments to be made during the next two years are anticipated to  
total $1.85 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A toll-free telephone number (800-386-2070) has been established  
to provide information on the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement covers all claims except for patients who say  
they suffer from primary pulmonary hypertension, a rare but serious 
lung disorder. The company said it decided to deal with these cases 
separately because they are few in number. It also noted that 
fen-phen's label included a warning that the drug could cause the 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement includes a $2.55 billion fund to pay for  
injuries, $1 billion for medical monitoring and $200 million in 
plaintiffs attorney fees. The company has also agreed to pay $25 
million for heart disease research. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the settlement would cause it to record  
expenses of about $3.29 billion, after taxes and insurance 
coverage. American Home took in about $13 billion in revenue last 
year and earned $2.5 billion in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In the only verdict yet to be rendered in any fen-phen lawsuit,  
Debbie Lovett, 36, of Grand Saline, Texas was awarded $23.3 million 
in July by a jury for heart damage she suffered after taking 
fen-phen for more than three months. Last month the company said it 
settled the case for less than 10 percent of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
	A civil trial had been under way in New Jersey over whether the  
company should be liable for the cost of medical monitoring, but 
was suspended earlier this week as the settlement appeared near.

<HEADLINE> Martinez Healing, Future Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Take your time, Pedro. You may have the whole  
offseason to rest your injured back. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Martinez, hurt in Wednesday night's opening-game loss to  
the Indians, plans to throw again Saturday. But unless his brother 
Ramon starts Boston to a win that day, the best-of-5 division 
series -- and the Red Sox season -- will be over. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Pedro probably wouldn't pitch in Game 4, if there is one  
on Sunday. Boston would have to win then to force a fifth game in 
Cleveland on Monday night. If Pedro is healthy, he could pitch 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	His absence and the Game 1 loss may have affected Game 2 starter  
Bret Saberhagen in Thursday's 11-1 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation that we're in, down 1-0 coming into this game,  
Pedro's arm is bothering him -- didn't want to go home 0-2,'' 
Saberhagen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Physically, at least, baseball's best pitcher felt a little  
better Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is slight improvement today, but he does have persistent  
pain,'' said Dr. William Morgan, one of Boston's team physicians. 
``His condition status is day to day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox counted heavily on Martinez, the shoo-in for the AL  
Cy Young award, to win the opener. He led 2-0 when he left after 
being hurt in the fourth inning and Boston went on to lose 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never scheduled him or anticipated him to be available  
for Game 4, so it's not really an issue,'' general manager Dan 
Duquette said before Thursday's game. Manager Jimy Williams, 
though, didn't rule that out. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez was treated Thursday with ultrasound and  
anti-inflammatory medication. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to let it calm down a couple of days and possibly let  
him play catch on Saturday,'' pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said. 
``That's the doctor's advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan said Martinez will start stretching Friday and be  
re-evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have some improvement,'' Martinez said in a statement issued  
by the team. ``I feel better already. I really feel positive about 
it. Right now I feel looser. In a few hours after treatment, I'm 
hoping to even feel better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox hope he's right. Martinez was virtually unhittable  
late in the season and finished with a 23-4 record, a major league 
best 2.07 ERA and an AL-high 313 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't like to see one of your starters, premier starters,  
go down, but that is why you have a team,'' Williams said. ``You 
have other good pitchers. They have won games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not nearly as many as Martinez. Saberhagen was second on the  
team with wins and he had only 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez said he strained a muscle below his right shoulder  
blade on his strikeout pitch to Jim Thome, who led off the fourth. 
He retired the side in order, then told Kerrigan his back hurt. 
Williams brought in reliever Derek Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez ``doesn't like to come out of games,'' Williams said.  
``So when I hear that, you just make a decision on who's going to 
come in and pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Could the temperature, 49 degrees at game time, have contributed  
to the injury? 
</P>
<P>
	``We were concerned going into the series about the cold,''  
Duquette said. ``Pedro's from a warm-weather climate and he thrives 
in the warm weather, and that's always a concern when you get into 
October.''

<HEADLINE> Climber Leaves Storied Legacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) -- A notebook left behind at a Montana  
mountaineering shop is part of Alex Lowe's legacy, a symbol of the 
humility typical of the celebrity climber now forever buried in a 
Himalayan avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe, regarded by some as the world's best climber, put the  
three-ring binder at the shop in 1995 and suggested any ice 
climbers who stopped in write about their adventures. Most of the 
entries, including many by him, detail ascents to nearby Hyalite 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	For Lowe, swapping stories with locals about climbs 25 miles  
from home was no less worthwhile than telling magazine writers and 
distant audiences about his experiences on the world's great peaks, 
said Joel Lee, manager of the store. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basketball fans don't get to play basketball with Michael  
Jordan,'' Lee said. ``With Alex, it was different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe, 40, and David Bridges, 29, of Aspen, Colo., a  
high-altitude cameraman, were killed by the avalanche Tuesday as 
they scouted routes on the upper slopes of Tibet's 26,291-foot 
Shishapangma, the world's 14th-highest peak. 
</P>
<P>
	Bridges was part of the film crew recording the expedition for  
American Adventure Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	John Wilcox, president of the film company, said recovering  
bodies of the climbers would be too dangerous, and they will remain 
on the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably an appropriate place for him,'' said Gordon  
Wiltsie of Bozeman, a National Geographic photographer who climbed 
with Lowe in Antarctica and on Baffin Island in the arctic. ``I 
think that moments before this happened, he was probably immensely 
excited and happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside magazine described Lowe in its March cover story as the  
best mountain climber in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	He climbed on five continents during his 25-year career and  
twice reached the summit of Mount Everest. At the time of his 
death, he was under sponsorship of The North Face equipment 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedition members were at about 19,000 feet when they saw the  
slab of snow break free some 6,000 feet above them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They looked up and saw it coming, and basically David and Alex  
were consumed by it,'' Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew McLean, the expedition leader, estimated the avalanche  
was traveling at more than 100 mph when it struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe's death stunned the community of high-altitude climbers,  
some of whom had believed that Lowe -- known as the ``Lungs with 
Legs'' for his incredible strength and stamina -- was invincible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people go for the Seven Summits and all these chalk-it-up  
kind of climbs,'' said Gary Bocarde, a veteran guide on Mount 
McKinley in Alaska. ``He wasn't that kind of climber. He was more a 
climber's climber instead of a peak bagger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe was heroic in his efforts, too.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a year when six climbers died on Mount McKinley, Lowe  
was involved in several rescues, said J.D. Swed, chief 
mountaineering ranger for the National Park Service in Talkeetna, 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	``He literally, single-handedly saved several people. He picked  
one guy up who had frozen hands and feet and couldn't move and was 
literally inches from death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview with Outside, Lowe downplayed his heroics.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of those things you do because you have to do it,  
one of those Herculean things where you get a lot of adrenaline 
going and you just do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe was married to a Bozeman artist and fellow climber,  
Jennifer Leigh Lowe. They had three children -- Max, 10; Sam, 6; and 
Isaac, 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe reached the summit of the Grand Teton in Wyoming's Grand  
Teton National Park this summer with Max -- which he called one of 
his proudest accomplishments.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The most frequently mentioned role model was  
Ronald Reagan, not Jesus Christ. And the devil drew less attention 
than Jesse Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	There were exhibits for the National Rifle Association and for a  
committee raising money to re-elect the House Republican managers 
who prosecuted President Clinton, but none for Bible publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	Recorded martial music took the place of hymn-singing.  
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend's annual conference of Pat Robertson's Christian  
Coalition was unlike other Evangelical events, but American 
religion has produced few major groups that so openly play 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	These are turbulent times for the decade-old Religious Right  
organization. This year Robertson reasserted direct command and 
went to work on what he calls a ``housecleaning'' of the national 
staff. He then doubled full-time state directors to 30 and aims to 
have one in every state before those millions of voter guides go 
out next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fund-raising is not where it ought to be,'' Robertson  
acknowledges, though he refuses to reveal income data. He says 
coalition debt reached $3.5 million but has been whittled to a 
``manageable'' $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition had to split into two organizations, one tax  
exempt and one not, after losing a long struggle with the Internal 
Revenue Service and Barry Lynn's Americans United for Separation of 
Church and State. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson says the mailing list of contributors contains 2  
million names, but Lynn contends the core constituency is only 
425,000. Registration for this year's conference was 3,500, 
compared with 4,000 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Republicans still consider the coalition a  
strategic asset, and their top brass in Washington turned out: 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, and party chairman Jim 
Nicholson, who treated the coalition as an arm of the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can win the White House and the Congress and then go on the  
offense for a change,'' Nicholson preached. ``Working together, we 
can make history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, Robertson declaimed, ``If we aren't in the field next  
election, the Republicans will lose. We will be the margin of 
victory in the key states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats Bill Bradley and Al Gore declined invitations to this  
unfriendly venue, as did Republicans John McCain and Pat Buchanan, 
no Robertson favorites. But all other GOP candidates cleared their 
schedules to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	As each spoke to a ballroom packed with placard-waving  
enthusiasts, there were complex interweavings of faith and 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd welcomed Religious Right favorite Gary Bauer, even  
though rumors had forced him to profess fidelity to his wife. 
Robertson was unimpressed, citing in an interview biblical grounds 
why Bauer should have heeded now-departed advisors' warnings that 
spending too much time alone with a young female aide looked bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Proverbs 24:6, Robertson noted, says, ``... in multitude of  
counsellors there is safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, offering heartfelt Christian testimony along  
with her platform, drew less enthusiasm than Steve Forbes' 
hard-right pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
	The main event was George W. Bush's visitation. Except on  
abortion (``every child born and unborn must be protected by law 
and welcomed to life''), the Texas governor soft-pedaled the 
Religious Right agenda. He was repaid with lusty cheers anyway, 
thanks to his front-runner's glow and the blessings of Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Wead, a Texas-based Evangelical author and unpaid Bush  
adviser, puts the coalition in context: ``The media give the 
impression that the Christian Coalition is a monolithic 
organization that represents the rank and file of the Evangelical 
movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its visibility, he says, it is ``only one group among  
many ... (and) there are huge blocs that do not participate at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposing the Religious Right, while it may win applause inside  
the Beltway, will not help win the Republican nomination, Wead 
says. ``And in the general election there are simply too many 
born-again Christians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smart politicos go by the numbers, he observes, and a recent  
Gallup poll shows 48 percent of Americans call themselves 
``born-again or Evangelical.'' The number has risen steadily since 
1976 when candidate Jimmy Carter famously professed his faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Robertson, a Democratic senator's son, says disappointment  
with Carter's presidency propelled him into the Republican Party 
and political organizing. Besides that, ``I saw just a steamrolling 
liberal animus against the Christian values moving though the court 
system and into society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson-style activism has lately come under attack not only  
from the likes of Lynn but former Moral Majority leaders Ed Dobson 
and Cal Thomas. They assert in a recent book that fellow Christians 
should stick to evangelism. Robertson scoffs, ``The building is on 
fire, and to say Christians should not grab a hose is stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Reed, who built Christian Coalition into an effective  
organization before he became a political consultant, maintains 
that politics can be just as holy a vocation as preaching. ``Done 
properly, it elevates issues that are otherwise neglected,'' he 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Disputing Dobson and Thomas, Reed says the Religious Right has  
had an impact and will do more. It took a 55-year crusade, he 
notes, to end slavery and 70 years to win the vote for women. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people who engaged the political system the past two  
decades are not going to leave it,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Cornerback Buchanan Fined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- The NFL fined Atlanta Falcons cornerback Ray  
Buchanan $7,500 Thursday for losing his temper and slamming 
Baltimore receiver Patrick Johnson to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson taunted Buchanan after making a 52-yard touchdown catch  
in the third quarter of the Ravens' 19-13 overtime win Sunday. 
Buchanan grabbed Johnson, slammed him down and punched him in the 
back of the head. An official broke up the fight and ejected 
Buchanan from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who later apologized for his behavior, was fined for  
unnecessary roughness. Johnson also was fined $3,500 for taunting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something I regret. Before I could even think, I reacted  
in the wrong way,'' Buchanan said on Monday. ``It was very out of 
the ordinary for myself, very uncharacteristic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dan Reeves said the Falcons would not discipline Buchanan.  
</P>
<P>
	``We got hurt enough for it. Ray knows he was wrong and what he  
did,'' Reeves said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Using Concrete Bombs on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. warplanes have been dropping bombs  
filled with concrete and not explosives in raids on Iraqi 
installations in a move to minimize civilian casualties, a military 
official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,000- to 3,000-pound laser-guided bombs are still capable  
of causing damage, especially when dropped from high altitudes by a 
speeding jet, said Lt. Col. Michael Waters, a spokesman for 
Operation Northern Watch, the allied effort to patrol a no-fly zone 
over northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you drop it on a radio, it could break the radio without  
blowing up,'' Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bombs were introduced following Iraqi allegations that  
the constant bombings by U.S. jets in response to Iraqi 
anti-aircraft fire were causing civilian casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are extremely careful about collateral damage,'' Waters  
said. ``We have used those bombs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said  
Thursday in Norfolk, Va., that U.S. forces have been using concrete 
bombs for a long time. He declined to discuss how much or under 
what circumstances they were being used in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	He said, however, ``If we have a target, a specific target that  
we are very concerned about collateral damage, but it's very 
important that we hit that target, that is a technique that we have 
of going after it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Operation Northern Watch warplanes are based at Incirlik air  
base in southern Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British planes have been patrolling no-fly zones over  
northern and southern Iraq since the 1991 Persian Gulf War to 
protect Kurdish and Shiite minorities from the forces of Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	The concrete-filled bombs would also cut the cost of the  
operation. American and British pilots often drop bombs a few times 
a week, responding to Iraqi challenge. They use anything from 
$12,000 laser-guided bombs to $80,000 Maverick missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Since December, when Baghdad started challenging the allied  
planes, warplanes have dropped more than 1,400 bombs and missiles 
on targets in northern and southern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials say missiles have hit more than 375 military  
targets, including radar sites and anti-aircraft weapons. Iraq 
claims nonmilitary facilities are being hit and hundreds of 
civilians have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities say civilian damage has been minimal and most  
of what the Iraqis claimed as casualties were military casualties 
or false reports.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall on Profit-Taking / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices fell Friday morning on  
profit-taking following six consecutive sessions of gains. The 
dollar edged lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 148.95  
points, or 0.82 percent, to 17,987.60 at the end of the morning 
session. The average closed up 240.13 points, or 1.34 percent the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 107.43 yen at midday, down 0.49 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below 107.49 yen late Thursday 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, share prices opened lower on profit-taking and  
a report in the Nihon Keizai economic daily that the three-party 
ruling coalition had agreed to call on the Bank of Japan to ease 
monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too much pressure on the BOJ is not necessarily good,'' said  
Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, strategist at Daiwa Securities in regard to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, International Monetary Fund deputy managing director  
Stanley Fischer urged the BOJ late Thursday to aggressively expand 
monetary policy to ensure Japan's economic recovery is sustained. 
</P>
<P>
	``With interest rates at zero, there is a question of what more  
the central bank can do. One answer is to continue to expand the 
money stock by injecting even more liquidity into the system,'' 
Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The BOJ has come under intense pressure for a monetary easing as  
the yen has surged against the dollar in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese currency has strengthened largely on increased  
optimism that the economy is recovering from its worst slump in 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese authorities fear, however, that too strong a yen could  
hurt that recovery by making Japanese products more expensive 
overseas, thus damaging the earnings of exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Players expected the market to remain cautious ahead of a  
central bank policy board meeting next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down  
51.29, or 0.5 percent, at 10,537.05 on Thursday as investors took 
profits and awaited Friday's release of U.S. jobless figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 3.81 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,521.23. The 
TOPIX closed up 12.51 points, or 0.83 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was slightly lower against the  
yen as traders awaited the Bank of Japan policy meeting next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's decline followed comments by Japanese Prime  
Minister Keizo Obuchi and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa that an 
extra budget planned for later this fiscal year will likely exceed 
$92 billion, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government spending is expected to help support Japan's  
nascent economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro bought 115.08 yen at late morning,  
down from 115.38 yen late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7450 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.7350 percent. Its 
price fell 0.08 point to 99.61.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Sign Antitrust Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Japan signed an  
agreement Thursday to increase their cooperation in investigating 
corporate mergers and price-fixing that affect both countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Signing the agreement in her Justice Department conference room,  
Attorney General Janet Reno said it ``recognizes the increasing 
interrelations between ... the world's two largest national 
economies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission,  
who also signed, said the agreement ``emerges out of an astonishing 
increase in global trade and global competition. Almost 50 percent 
of the mergers we investigate thoroughly affect consumers in two or 
more countries, sometimes consumers in 10 or 12 countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japan enacted its anti-monopoly law in 1947 and is now  
participating in the 21st annual antitrust consultation with U.S. 
counterparts. But Hideaki Kobayashi, charge d'affairs ad interim of 
Japan, said officials ``felt an increasing need for an agreement on 
anti-competitive policies so we can cooperate further.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Certain differences do exist in the legal framework of our  
countries, which rendered our joint work a challenge,'' said 
Kobayashi, who signed for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Yasuchika Negoro, chairman of Japan's Fair Trade Commission,  
said it was appropriate that this was Japan's first antitrust 
cooperation agreement because ``our deepest relations are with the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modeled on pacts the United States reached in 1991 with the  
European Union and in 1995 with Canada, the agreement provides that 
each country will notify the other of enforcement actions that 
might affect it, that they will consider coordinating enforcement 
actions and that each will consider acting against domestic 
behavior that harms the other country. 
</P>
<P>
	While it calls for the exchange of information, the pact does  
not permit the sharing of nonpublic information or evidence 
gathered in a law enforcement investigation. Thus, it falls short 
of the full antitrust mutual legal assistance agreement the United 
States signed with Australia earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein said he  
believed it would increase the exchange of information and 
assistance in obtaining witnesses. ``I look forward to a full 
agreement ... several years in the future,'' said Klein, who heads 
the Justice Department's antitrust division. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States also has antitrust cooperation agreements with  
Germany and Israel.

<HEADLINE> AMA Journal To Name New Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The American Medical Association was set to name  
a new editor of its influential journal, and speculation Thursday 
centered on Dr. Catherine D. DeAngelis, a dean at the Johns Hopkins 
University School of Medicine in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sources speaking on condition of anonymity said they had  
been told DeAngelis would be named editor of the Journal of the 
American Medical Association, succeeding Dr. George Lundberg, whose 
firing in January provoked a controversy over the journal's 
editorial independence. One of the sources has close ties to the 
AMA; the other is a leading figure in medical journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA announced Thursday that JAMA's new editor would be  
introduced at a news conference Friday afternoon in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	DeAngelis is the editor of the Archives of Pediatrics and  
Adolescent Medicine, published by the AMA, as well as a member of 
JAMA's editorial board. Reached Thursday at her office at Johns 
Hopkins, where she is dean of academic affairs and faculty, she 
declined to confirm her selection. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't comment,'' she said. ``There is a news conference  
tomorrow in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	JAMA has been run by interim coeditors since Lundberg's firing.  
He was dismissed after publishing in JAMA a survey of college 
students' sexual attitudes that coincided with President Clinton's 
impeachment trial. AMA executive vice president Dr. E. Ratcliffe 
Anderson felt Lundberg inappropriately injected the organization 
into a political debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The journal has since created a board to serve as a buffer  
between the editor in chief and the organization's management.

<HEADLINE> Intuit Buys Online Mortgage Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Intuit Inc. will acquire Michigan-based  
Rock Financial Corp., a provider of online consumer mortgages, in a 
stock deal valued at about $370 million, the companies announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Rock Financial, which provides mortgages  
through RockLoans.com, would allow Intuit to offer home mortgages 
to consumers in all 50 states via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit leaders said combining RockLoans.com with Intuit's  
QuickenMortgage online mortgage service will combine the speed and 
efficiency of online lending with an experienced mortgage team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The acquisition of Rock Financial advances Intuit's Web  
strategy by giving us the mortgage expertise, technology and 
marketing resources to truly revolutionize the mortgage process,'' 
said Bill Campbell, chairman and acting CEO of Intuit. 
</P>
<P>
	David Schehr of GartnerGroup Financial Services in Durham, N.C.,  
described the deal as ``just another brick in the wall'' for the 
online mortgage industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Online banking, brokerages and loans are still relatively  
narrow product offerings,'' he said. ``Only 10 percent of 
households are doing online banking, fewer are doing brokerage. 
It's still not the preferred method for most people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schehr said online mortgage services are like online car  
dealers: Many people use the sites simply gain information and 
negotiate a better deal offline. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. announced it will offer home  
equity loans over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sources of similar online information include LendingTree,  
a North Carolina-based Internet venture that allows consumers to 
browse for the best deals on mortgages, auto loans and credit 
cards. Other players include E-Loan, GetSmart, Microsoft's 
HomeAdvisor and iOwn. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's deal would give Intuit new features, including  
real-time credit checks and 24-hour loan updates. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit, which has 11 million Quicken customers, launched its  
QuickenMortgage site in November 1997. RockLoans.com began in 
January. Together, the two companies have originated nearly $3.5 
billion in closed mortgage loans in the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit also agreed to spend $6 million to buy Title Source Inc.,  
which provides title insurance and escrow services.

<HEADLINE> Jesse Ventura Visits Harvard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- It was ``The Body'' and the minds.  
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura visited Harvard University on  
Wednesday, spending time with faculty members, dropping in on 
football practice and talking politics over pizza with about 70 
undergraduates. 
</P>
<P>
	He found himself defending comments made to Playboy magazine, an  
interview in which the former professional wrestler called religion 
a ``crutch for the weak-minded'' and said fat people are overweight 
because they ``can't push away from the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, who later signed copies of the magazine, told students  
he doesn't worry about being politically incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not afraid to speak my mind,'' he said. ``If I don't get  
re-elected that's fine. I'll go back to the private sector from 
whence I came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, who himself only briefly attended North Hennepin  
Community College, said he was flattered by the invitation to speak 
at Harvard by an student advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you had asked me at any point in my life if I'd be at  
Harvard talking politics I would have laughed at you,'' Ventura 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students said they found his openness refreshing.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was admirable that he could speak his mind freely  
without worrying what people think,'' said 18-year-old Brandon 
Fail. 
</P>
<P>
	While that candor has won Ventura fans, it has also ruffled  
feathers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura came under more fire Wednesday for telling Playboy that  
he didn't read books by Ernest Hemingway because the writer killed 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen too many people fight for their lives. I have no  
respect for anyone who would kill himself,'' he said. ``If you're a 
feeble, weak-minded person to begin with, I don't have time for 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota state Sen. Bob Lessard, whose daughter killed herself  
last month, said he was ``astounded and stunned'' and hoped Ventura 
would reconsider his remarks. ``I know my daughter wasn't 
weak-minded,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Harvard, Ventura said that he doesn't have sympathy for those  
who kill themselves and said ``if you're at the point of committing 
suicide it can only get better because you are the lowest you can 
possibly be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he offered a few words to Lessard: ``Losing a child is the  
hardest possible thing a family can endure,'' Ventura said. ``Terry 
(his wife) and I offer our deepest sympathies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura also dismissed results of a poll by the Star Tribune of  
Minneapolis following the Playboy interview showing that his 
approval rating has dropped from 73 percent in July to 54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I believed in polls I wouldn't be the governor of  
Minnesota,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura also participated in a live town meeting with CNBC's  
Chris Matthews, in which he defended the right to bear arms and 
supported the theory that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone in 
the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura was scheduled to head today to New York, where he will  
appear on CBS's ``Late Show with David Letterman'' and tape an 
interview with ABC's Barbara Walters.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Robbery Suspect Tracked to Md. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALISBURY, Md. (AP) -- A college food manager is the missing  
member of a gang that donned masks of former U.S. presidents to 
undertake one of the biggest bank robberies in Los Angeles history, 
the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents said Derrick Anderson, director of dining services at  
the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, was one of four people 
who took $228,241 from the Family Savings and Loan in Los Angeles 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, 47, allegedly wore a Richard Nixon mask. He was  
missing when FBI agents arrived on campus Tuesday to arrest him 
after getting a tip from someone who saw a wanted poster at a post 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are monitoring Anderson's bank account and home but said  
he could have changed his look, FBI Special Agent Rosemary Vicini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If (he) knew where to look and who to talk to, it wouldn't be  
difficult to change his identity,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson assumed his post at the school five years ago. He  
supervised a staff of five and was paid $70,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just so hard to believe, particularly for an individual  
who works so hard and has had such a positive effect on the entire 
campus,'' said Ronnie Holden, the university's vice president for 
administrative affairs who has known Stevens for nearly 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took us all by surprise. It's difficult to comprehend.''  
</P>
<P>
	One robber, Gregory Lewis, was convicted in 1985 of murder and  
sentenced to life in prison for shooting a man whose van was used 
as a getaway vehicle. Two other accomplices were sentenced to 15 
years in prison in 1984 for their roles in the heist.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Search for Clutch Hitting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At least the Texas Rangers scored a run. They  
just couldn't get a clutch hit. 
</P>
<P>
	After going 25 playoff innings without scoring, Texas broke  
through with one run Thursday night against the New York Yankees. 
It wasn't enough, and the Rangers lost their eighth straight 
postseason game -- all to New York -- 3-1, and fell behind two games 
to none in their best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Gonzalez, who terrorized the Yankees in the 1996 AL  
playoffs before going 1-for-12 last year, provided the Rangers' 
offense by lining a homer to left field in the fourth inning off 
Andy Pettitte. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, who has scored Texas' last three runs in the  
postseason, was greeted as he returned to the dugout by a 
celebration unusually large for a single run in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, there hasn't been much to celebrate for the Rangers,  
who hadn't scored in the playoffs since the fifth inning of Game 2 
last year and hadn't held a lead for 43 straight innings in the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	That would be the only run for Texas against Andy Pettitte and  
three relievers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers, who have averaged 5.8 runs a game while leading the  
majors in batting the last two regular seasons, have been held to 
two runs and a .144 average (22-for-153) in their last five playoff 
games against the Yankees, who swept them 3-0 in the first round 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas at least threatened this time, getting seven hits. But  
Pettitte, who pitches his toughest in the stickiest situations of 
the postseason, was equal to the task. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed no hits in five at-bats with runners in scoring  
position, leaving Texas 1-for-24 in those situations the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Palmeiro and Todd Zeile hit consecutive singles to open  
the second inning. Pettitte got Roberto Kelly to swing through a 
cut fastball for the first out. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly walked back to the dugout with his head down -- an act that  
would be repeated by Rangers hitters all night long. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas had a chance to break open a 1-0 game in the fifth, but  
once again couldn't get a clutch hit. 
</P>
<P>
	With no outs and runners on second and third, the infield in and  
action in the Yankees' bullpen, Pettitte fell behind Mark McLemore 
3-0 before throwing three straight strikes for the first out. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre then moved the infield back, conceding a run  
on a grounder up the middle. Royce Clayton, however, hit a 
two-hopper to Scott Brosius at third, who held the runner and threw 
to first for the second out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers still had one more chance. But Rusty Greer swung at  
a 3-2 curveball in the dirt, ending the inning with Gonzalez on 
deck instead of at the plate with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte pumped his fist twice. Greer merely walked back to  
dugout and neatly put away his batting helmet. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas still held the lead. That would change soon enough, but  
the Rangers' playoff fortunes wouldn't.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Borrowing Rises in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' borrowing raced ahead in August,  
posting the largest monthly increase in seven months, led by strong 
demand for loans for everything from autos and boats to education 
and vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers' credit outstanding, excluding mortgage debt, advanced  
at a 9.6 percent annual rate in August to a seasonally adjusted 
$1.367 trillion, the Federal Reserve said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, consumers borrowed $10.8 billion more in August than  
during the month before. That was the biggest monthly increase 
since January when it rose by $15.3 billion 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in the level of borrowing in August was much  
stronger than many analysts expected. They were forecasting a 
monthly gain of $6.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are turning to their credit cards more as home  
refinancings have slowed because of rising interest rates and 
higher gas prices have taken a bite out of budgets,'' said First 
Union Corp. economist Mark Vitner. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of increase for August was the highest since May when  
consumer borrowing rose at 9.7 percent rate, and follows a 7.9 
percent rate gain in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for non-revolving loans led the overall increase. Those  
loans rose at a 10.1 percent rate in August. That category includes 
loans for autos, mobile homes, boats, trailers, education and 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that car sales were strong in August so it's not a  
surprise to see a big jump in that category,'' Vitner said. In 
July, non-revolving credit grew at an annual rate of 4.7 percent, a 
tad less than the Fed previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, revolving credit -- primarily credit cards revolving  
loans, rose at an annual rate of 8.9 percent in August, the slowest 
pace since May when revolving credit grew by 4.4 percent. In July, 
revolving credit rose at a rate of 12.1 percent, the same as the 
Fed originally estimated.

<HEADLINE> Dole Promises Anti-Drug Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IMPERIAL BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Standing 30 feet from the border  
with Mexico, Republican presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole 
promised Thursday to reduce the flow of illegal drugs into the 
United States and pressure other countries to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said she would increase the number of U.S. Border Patrol  
agents from 8,000 to 20,000, and increase the use of high-tech, 
anti-smuggling devices at the border. 
</P>
<P>
	She also would cut off aid to nations that refuse to extradite  
suspected traffickers or that make no progress toward reducing 
their supply of drugs to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Elizabeth Dole will lead a crusade with the goal of  
a drug-free America,'' said Dole, making what her aides called her 
first major policy speech on the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
	The former cabinet secretary spoke to about 20 supporters and  
curious onlookers at Borderfield State Park, 15 miles south of San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole chose the park -- which sits at the southwestern edge of the  
United States with a view into the Mexican community of Playas de 
Tijuana -- to highlight the need for tighter controls along the 
border, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 Mexicans and a reporter from a Tijuana newspaper  
listened from the other side of the border fence as Dole spoke 
about increasing the U.S. Border Patrol. Though its primary mission 
is to control immigration, Dole said border agents also should be 
used in drug war. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about illegal immigration?'' Ben Seeley, executive  
director of the anti-illegal immigration Border Solution Task 
Force, yelled out during Dole's speech. He attended specifically to 
see where Dole stood on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole made no mention of illegal immigration controls, prompting  
Seeley to call the speech ``canned rhetoric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The get-tough on drugs address is Dole's third in a rollout of  
what aides say are the four cornerstones of her campaign: 
education, national defense, drugs and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	She hoped a focus on illegal drugs would earn her credit for  
leadership on an issue that many voters supposedly do not rank as a 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pundits and pollsters tell me that drug abuse is not an  
important issue. But I don't get my passion from polling,'' Dole 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	She noted studies that show a doubling of teen drug use since  
1992, the year Clinton was elected, undoing the ``gains of the 
1980s 'Just Say No' campaign ... during the Reagan and Bush 
presidencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The White House has not led a war on drugs,'' she said. ``It's  
not that they surrendered -- they just didn't show up,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration challenged her depiction of its  
anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the objectives she states are exactly what the  
administration is doing,'' said Bob Weiner, spokesman for Barry 
McCaffrey, director of the White House National Drug Policy Office. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has committed $17.8 billion to anti-drug  
efforts this year, ``the strongest anti-drug budget in history,'' 
said Weiner, who added that youth drug abuse declined 13 percent 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole added that she would not, ``under any circumstances,  
support the legalization of marijuana or any other drug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She opposed any increases in U.S. military aid for Colombia  
until it reclaimed a zone where Dole said the government has ceded 
control to ``narco-guerillas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said she would meet personally with all foreign leaders in  
an effort to foster counter-narcotic cooperation. She also pledged 
to cut aid to countries that ``do not vigorously combat the drugs 
that are destroying our communities and killing our young people.''

<HEADLINE> Edmundo Freed From Brazilian Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Soccer star Edmundo walked out of  
jail Thursday, a day after his surrender. He will remain free until 
an appeal of his 4 1/2-year sentence for manslaughter is heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Globo News said Edmundo would go straight to Vasco da Gama's  
headquarters to meet with team officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The Superior Tribunal of Justice in the capital of Brasilia  
granted a request for Edmundo's release pending his latest appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old forward's appeal of his March 3 conviction in a  
1995 vehicular homicide case was rejected Tuesday, setting off a 
city-wide, 24-hour search. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was freed until the appeal of his 4 1-2-year  
``semi-open'' prison sentence was heard. His lawyers have asked 
that the sentence be commuted to community service. 
</P>
<P>
	After eluding police for a day, Edmundo surrendered late  
Wednesday. He spent the night in a common cell with six other 
prisoners, since he did not qualify for a special cell because he 
is not a college graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest stunned Brazil, where the rich and famous rarely go  
to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``The group is sad,'' Vasco coach Antonio Lopes said when police  
arrived at training camp looking for Edmundo. ``Everyone was taken 
by surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it shouldn't have been so surprising, considering  
Edmundo's troubled history. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the remarkable talents that earned him a place on the  
Brazilian national team and numerous national titles, Edmundo is 
best known for insulting referees, cursing fans, and fighting with 
rivals and teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Roma fullback Antonio Carlos, a target of many run-ins when they  
played together on Palmeiras, summed up the problem: ``I was taught 
manners at home, and he wasn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, Edmundo was expelled from Palmeiras for his constant  
fights with teammates. Coach Wanderley Luxemburgo relented after he 
apologized to the group, and Palmeiras went on to win the first of 
two straight national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Edmundo kicked a TV cameraman after missing a penalty  
kick and losing a first-round Copa Libertadores match in Ecuador. 
He was detained for three days in Guayaquil, and the Brazilian 
foreign ministry stepped in to avert a diplomatic incident. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 2, 1995, Edmundo was driving at night when his pickup  
truck collided with a car and flipped over. The car smashed into a 
pole, killing three passengers. The truck's airbag saved Edmundo, 
who received 10 stitches in his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	At the trial, four witnesses testified that Edmundo was going at  
least 60 mph in a 40 mph zone. Witnesses at the nightclub where 
Edmundo had been prior to the accident said he had consumed a large 
amount of alcohol, although Edmundo claimed he only had two glasses 
of beer. 
</P>
<P>
	The court found him guilty of manslaughter and sentenced him to  
prison under a work release program, by which he would spend nights 
in prison but leave to work during the day. It wasn't clear whether 
he would be allowed to play night games or travel out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	Free pending trial, Edmundo led Vasco to the national  
championship in 1998 and set a single-season scoring record with 29 
goals. He was named to the Brazilian national team for the 1998 
World Cup, where teammates said he poisoned the atmosphere with 
constant complaining about not being among the starting 11. Brazil 
lost the final to France. 
</P>
<P>
	After a stormy season with Italy's Fiorentina, Edmundo returned  
to Vasco this year. The team is second in the standings and 
considered a favorite for the title.

<HEADLINE> Terrorism Threat for Racing Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- This is the time of year that Dale Jarrett  
would like to be able to focus on his bid for the Winston Cup 
title. Instead, he's also thinking about the threat of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Security has been beefed up at Lowe's Motor Speedway in response  
to recent bombings at stores owned by the company that bought the 
track's naming rights, Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouses Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of violence has prompted Jarrett, the series  
points leader, to change his routine as he prepares for Sunday's 
UAW-GM Quality 500 at the speedway. Jarrett had planned on spending 
the weekend in a motor home in the track's infield, but decided to 
instead commute about 70 minutes each way from his home in Hickory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned,'' Jarrett said Thursday. ``They've done a good  
job here of getting more security, but you just don't know, and 
it's unfortunate that it has to be that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are investigating the possibility that bombs found  
in three Lowe's stores were planted by someone who feels the 
company failed to do enough to help the victims of a May 1 crash at 
the speedway. Three spectators were killed and eight others injured 
when debris from a wreck flew into the stands during an Indy Racing 
League event. 
</P>
<P>
	A bomb threat was called into the speedway last week, and even  
though no explosives were found, it has prompted federal, state and 
local authorities to increase their presence at the track. About 
250,000 people are expected at the speedway for Sunday's race and 
the various activities leading up to the event. 
</P>
<P>
	The added security is most noticeable in the 1 1/2-mile  
superspeedway's sprawling infield, where all incoming vehicles are 
stopped at well-staffed checkpoints. Inside the garage area, there 
are plenty of police officers, some toting guns. Speedway officials 
said the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is using 
plainclothes agents to patrol the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most visible change, however, involves the drivers,  
who appear to be walking quickly to and from their cars during 
practice sessions, wasting little time to stop and chat or sign 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	It presents a stark contrast in a sport that has gained much of  
its popularity over the decades because of the drivers' willingness 
to mingle freely with fans.

<P>
	``It would be a shame if we completely lost that, and it could  
happen,'' said Kevin Triplett, NASCAR's operations director. ``And 
it goes back to what your grandmother told you and you learned in 
first grade -- that one bad apple spoils the barrel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Labonte, who won the pole for Sunday's race, said the  
drivers need to be aware of the possibility they could become 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go back to the Monica Seles stabbing,'' he said. ``That's  
scary. You just don't have any idea. You hope nothing like that 
ever happens. But with the sport growing like it is, you just never 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte said he and his team members attempt to control his  
exposure when he is out in public, especially when he's signing 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	``You try to make sure the crowd's in front of you and not  
behind you or surrounding you,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway usually hires a force of 400-450 people to provide  
security at races. That number has been increased this week, 
although track officials won't give exact numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The security guards hired by the track supplement the federal,  
state and local law enforcement officers who have been assigned to 
the speedway for the week. Triplett said NASCAR also has instituted 
special security measures in the garage area in response to the 
threat of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't be too much more specific other than saying we are  
doing some things here that we haven't done in recent weeks,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The speedway usually stages elaborate prerace shows, complete  
with plenty of pyrotechnics. But all explosions that had been 
planned for Sunday's event have been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Any threat of violence doesn't appear to have deterred fans. A  
race-day crowd in excess of 150,000 is expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad and unfortunate that things of this nature don't  
create shock anymore,'' Triplett said.

<HEADLINE> The Donald Eyes the White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From Trump Tower to the White House?  
</P>
<P>
	Real estate tycoon Donald Trump announced Thursday that he was  
forming an exploratory committee to help him determine if he could 
win a presidential race as a Reform Party candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his first choice for vice president would be Oprah  
Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that could interest me is if I could win. I'm  
not talking about the nomination, I'm talking about the whole 
megillah,'' he said in a telephone interview from New York, where 
he plans to build the world's tallest residential building and 
where he lives in a marbled penthouse in a Fifth Avenue tower 
bearing his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump had dinner Thursday night with Minnesota Gov. Jesse  
Ventura -- the Reform Party's leading elected official -- and actor 
Woody Harrelson. Ventura, a former wrestler elected governor in a 
1998 upset, is trying to find a candidate he can back in what is 
shaping up to be a fractious nomination fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Trump and I did a lot of discussing and we think Woody's  
going to be the next president,'' joked Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked earlier about Trump's announcement, Ventura said: ``Do I  
like him for the Reform Party? It depends if he likes the Reform 
Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was not ready to make an endorsement in the 2000  
presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, a billionaire, said that unlike traditional exploratory  
committees, his would not raise money. Instead, it will provide 
political advice. Trump refused to identify his advisers but said 
he will decide whether to pursue a race in several months. 
</P>
<P>
	During an interview taped for broadcast on CNN's ``Larry King  
Live,'' Trump said Ms. Winfrey, the talk-show host, would be his 
first choice for running mate, although they have not talked about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she'd do it, she'd be fantastic,'' Trump said. ``I mean,  
she's popular, she's brilliant, she's a wonderful woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump's announcement gives a fresh stir to an already  
topsy-turvy presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan, concerned about Republican front-runner George W.  
Bush's commitment to conservative ideals, is widely expected to 
bolt from the GOP late this month to seek the Reform nomination. 
His campaign refused to comment on Trump's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is backed by a wing of the Reform Party with ties to  
party founder Ross Perot, who ran under the Reform banner in 1996 
and has not ruled out another campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker is considering  
running for the nomination of the American Reform Party, a splinter 
group. Ventura himself could launch a campaign despite earlier 
denials, and there has been talk of a candidacy by actress Cybill 
Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
	The party's nominee will get $12.6 million in federal campaign  
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN-Time poll taken in July suggested Trump would be a  
long-shot for the presidency. He had 7 percent when matched against 
Bush and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump cited a different poll.  
</P>
<P>
	``The National Enquirer ... did a poll and said I'd win the  
election,'' he said in an interview on NBC's ``Today.'' The tabloid 
surveyed 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, 53, is a registered Republican who until now has shunned  
politics except for contributing handsomely to candidates. Instead, 
``The Donald'' has become a tabloid staple through his two divorces 
and affinity for escorting young, beautiful women. 
</P>
<P>
	A fastidious character, he says he has never smoked, had a glass  
of alcohol or even a cup of coffee. Trump disdains shaking hands, 
calling the custom ``barbaric'' and saying it is an easy 
transmitter of colds, flus and other ills. 
</P>
<P>
	He describes himself as socially liberal and fiscally  
conservative, supports major tax cuts, abortion rights and 
universal health care, but opposes gun control. He is the author of 
several books. He denies his campaign is a publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuart Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in  
Washington, said Trump's beliefs align well with the Reform 
Party's. Still, he was left shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a weekly TV show or a gazillion dollars, heck, you  
have a chance as a presidential candidate these days,'' Rothenberg 
said.

<HEADLINE> Trump Forms Exploratory Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York tycoon Donald Trump said today that  
he has formed an exploratory committee to help him determine 
whether he can win the White House as a Reform Party candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at the very strong possibility that we could win  
-- and not just the (third party) nomination,'' Trump said in a 
telephone interview from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In a further sign of Trump's seriousness, he is meeting tonight  
with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura -- the Reform Party's leading 
elected official. Ventura, a former wrestler who won the governor's 
office in a 1998 upset, is trying to find a candidate he can back 
in what is shaping to be a fractious nomination fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan is expected to  
bolt the Republican Party and seek a Reform Party nomination late 
this month. He is backed by another wing of the party, a loose 
alliance with ties to party founder Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot's top adviser and the current Reform Party chairman,  
Russell Verney, met with Buchanan this week in Texas to discuss the 
conservative's options. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said that unlike a traditional exploratory committee --  
which are established primarily to raise money for a budding 
candidate -- his panel will be formed primarily to provide political 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good thing about this is I don't need the money,'' Trump  
said, signaling that he may finance his campaign himself. 
</P>
<P>
	A Trump adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said  
the committee's efforts would be twofold: to determine Trump's 
presidential viability and to being organizing for the internal 
struggle over the Reform Party nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to look at it and look at it very seriously. The  
polls have come out incredibly well,'' Trump said. ``Based on this, 
and the support of Jesse and other people, we're going to give it 
very serious consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said he planned to decide whether to seek the nomination  
by January or February. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said he would not run just to be a spoiler.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that could interest me is if I could win. I'm  
not talking about he nomination, I'm talking about the whole 
magillah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said Wednesday in a ``Dateline NBC'' interview that he  
considers himself a ``great builder and conceptualizer'' and that 
those qualities would serve the country well if he were elected 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, a registered Republican who says he identifies with  
former President Reagan, said the country ``is essentially in huge 
debt'' -- which he knows a thing or two about, after rebounding from 
the brink of bankruptcy in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he's socially liberal and fiscally conservative,  
supports major tax cuts, abortion rights and health care for all, 
but opposes gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	He also handicapped his prospective competition, saying Texas  
Gov. George W. Bush was ``really untested,'' that Vice President Al 
Gore ``has more ability than is being shown,'' and that Bill 
Bradley quit the Senate in 1996 because he was ``a loser in New 
Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If elected, his first act would be to ``give the country  
spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing we have going and not insignificant ... is a  
good economy,'' Trump said. ``If that economy goes, we're going to 
be a very, very depressed place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The National Enquirer ... did a poll and said I'd win the  
election,'' Trump said in an interview on NBC's ``Today.'' Reminded 
that in a Newsweek poll, 2 percent said they were likely to vote 
for Trump and 73 percent said their were unlikely, he replied: ``If 
I had 2 percent how come they put me on their cover?''

<HEADLINE> Grupo Mexico Ups Offer for Asarco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Just as it appeared that Phelps Dodge Corp. had  
successfully negotiated a deal to combine three of the nation's 
biggest copper producers, Grupo Mexico has upped its offer for the 
smallest of the trio, Asarco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco agreed late Tuesday to be acquired by Phelps Dodge for  
about $1.1 billion in cash and stock, rejecting an earlier bid from 
Grupo Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge had previously struck a deal to buy Cyprus Amax  
Minerals Co. for $1.8 billion, making the three-way deal worth $2.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Asarco portion of the deal was threatened Thursday with  
another offer from Grupo Mexico, which has a 10 percent stake in 
New York-based Asarco. Grupo Mexico offered $29.50 per share in 
cash, or $1.17 billion, for Asarco, besting the Phelps Dodge offer 
by more than 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phelps Dodge bid values Asarco at $28.43 a share based on  
Phelps Dodge's closing price Thursday of $54.43 3/4, up $1.43 3/4, on the 
New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Asarco closed up $1.75 at 
$30.75, also on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our revised offer presents a compelling opportunity for Asarco  
and its shareholders to improve upon your existing transaction with 
Phelps Dodge,'' Grupo Mexico officials said in a letter to members 
of the Asarco board. 
</P>
<P>
	Clay Allen, a Phelps Dodge spokesman, said the company was  
unable to comment on the Grupo Mexico offer. Asarco officials did 
not immediately return a call placed after business hours Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The copper industry, which has recently been plagued by rock  
bottom prices, has announced numerous layoffs and the closure of 
several operations this year. The summer was marked by a series of 
merger deals and offers as the industry seeks to consolidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge officials have said the three-way merger with  
Asarco and Englewood, Colo.-based Cyprus Amax would save $200 
million a year.

</P>
<P>
	Bill approved by House, 275-151:  
</P>
<P>
	Lead sponsors: Reps. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., and John Dingell,  
D-Mich.; backed by White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits: Lifts federal ban on lawsuits against many health  
insurance companies. Allows patients to sue in state courts if a 
benefit is denied or delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent reviews: Allows patients to take complaints to  
panels outside the health plan whose decisions are binding on the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>

for routine care associated with clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	First alternative, rejected 284-145:  
</P>
<P>
	Lead sponsor: Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio; preferred by insurance  
and business groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawsuits: Does not allow any new rights to sue.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Germans Offers $3.3B to Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Germany offered on Thursday to pay $3.3  
billion to former slave laborers and other victims of the Nazi 
regime, calling the figure ``a considerable amount'' given the 
country's budget problems. Survivors said they'd fight for more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an insult,'' Rudy Kennedy of London, whose mother, sister  
and father were killed in the Holocaust, said outside the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world will judge the morality of this offer and ... will  
condemn it,'' said Mel Weiss, an attorney for some survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's offer came on the closing day of a multinational  
meeting aimed at working out compensation for an estimated 1 
million to 2.4 million people who worked in forced or slave labor 
camps to the benefit of Adolf Hitler's war machine -- as well as a 
number of other types of victims of the Nazi period. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first time in months of talks -- aimed partly at ending  
U.S. lawsuits -- that a compensation figure has been put on the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
	German envoy Otto Lambsdorff, who presented Germany's joint  
government and industry offer, said a foundation would be set up to 
administer the funds. About a third of the money is from government 
and two-thirds from German industry, negotiators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambsdorff said 20 companies beyond the 16 originally sued in  
the United States had agreed to contribute to the foundation. He 
said the foundation would receive claims not only against 
contributing companies, but against any wartime German company, 
even if it no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies that have been sued in the United States on forced  
labor and related claims include Bayer pharmaceuticals, carmakers 
DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor Co. and chemical conglomerate 
Hoechst AG. Names of all companies that have pledged contributions 
have not been publicly released. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambsdorff said the total figure of $3.3 billion ``is not enough  
to help all those who feel they suffered during that period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added: ``It is not easy to make the case to German  
citizens'' for such payments while they are suffering cutbacks in 
social services and other financial problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	German diplomats accompanying Lambsdorff also stressed that the  
new money comes on top of $55 billion in compensation that Germany 
already has paid for various Holocaust-related crimes since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the money in the new offer, about $2.3 billion,  
would go to slave and forced laborers, Lambsdorff said, with slave 
laborers getting $5,500 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Other portions would go to an education fund keeping the memory  
of the atrocities alive and various categories of victims such as 
children born while their parents were in camps, people who were 
used for medical experimentation and people who lost property or 
insurance payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Weiss said the proposal was ``disgusting'' and that  
German industry has grown vastly wealthy in the years since it paid 
nearly nothing for the labor of prisoners of the Nazi regime during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them that we are not going to walk away from the table  
... despite the fact that there is such enormous disappointment,'' 
Weiss told reporters during a break in Thursday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	He and other attorneys for survivors have declined to say how  
much survivors are asking for, but said earlier in the week the 
figure far exceeds $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of survivors, German companies that used forced  
labor and several governments have been meeting for months to 
negotiate a plan under which funds would be contributed. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department has promoted the negotiations as a way to  
get money to more people, and faster, than the U.S. lawsuits would. 
Part of the agreement would be some kind of U.S. government 
statement saying future claims should go through the foundation, 
discouraging the filing of further suits. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department says an estimated 12 million workers were  
forced to work in German industry and agriculture during World War 
II. Some produced materials for the war, and some took over jobs 
from German men, freeing them to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the surviving victims who might be eligible for such  
payments are Eastern European Christians from countries overrun 
early by Hitler's forces. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the United States and Germany, the other  
countries involved in the negotiations are Israel, Poland, Belarus, 
Ukraine, Russia and the Czech Republic.

<HEADLINE> Barnes &AMP; Noble Buys Babbage's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a bid to expand its computer software and  
video game offerings, Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. will buy Babbage's Etc. 
for $189 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition, announced Wednesday, fits Barnes &AMP; Noble's  
strategy of investing in complementary, fast-growing businesses as 
it looks to broaden its array of entertainment products sold in its 
stores and on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately held Babbage's is owned by Leonard Riggio, who is  
chairman and chief executive of New York-based Barnes &AMP; Noble. 
Barnes &AMP; Noble formed a special committee of independent directors 
to evaluate the feasibility and fairness of the deal, given 
Riggio's connection to both companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbage's, based in Grapevine, Texas, operates 495 stores under  
the Babbage's, Software Etc. and GameStop names. Most of the stores 
are in malls and offer popular video games and computer software 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbage's also operates an Internet site, gamestop.com.  
</P>
<P>
	The purchase gives Barnes &AMP; Noble, the nation's largest  
bookseller, a piece of the video game and software business, which 
continues to grow rapidly. Barnes &AMP; Noble currently sells some 
software in its stores and online. A very small selection of video 
games is available online but not at its stores. 
</P>
<P>
	According to The NPD Group, a Port Washington, N.Y., market  
research firm, video game and entertainment software sales are 
expected to grow from $8.4 billion in 1998 to $10 billion in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This acquisition is ... important to the positioning of our  
online affiliate, barnesandnoble.com, where the penetration of the 
fast-growing video-game market is not only complementary, but can 
be considered essential,'' said Alan Kahn, chief financial officer 
at Barnes &AMP; Noble. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Barnes &AMP; Noble will take responsibility for  
$26 million in Babbage's debt. The bookseller expects the 
acquisition to add 10 cents a share to earnings in its 
fourth-quarter ending in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The current version of Babbage's got its start as two separate  
retailers in the 1980s. Two former Harvard Business School 
classmates established Babbage's in 1983, while Riggio and Dutch 
retailer Vendex founded Software Etc. in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, the two companies merged, creating NeoStar Retail  
Group. But it ran into financial trouble almost immediately as 
mass-marketers and discount stores stole away business. 
</P>
<P>
	NeoStar filed for bankruptcy court protection in 1996. It was  
then bought by Riggio and renamed Babbage's Etc.

<HEADLINE> Play Showcases Unsatisfied Writers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A writer's lot is not a happy one.  
</P>
<P>
	So sighs Irish playwright Brian Friel in ``Give Me Your Answer,  
Do!'', his uneasy domestic drama that contrasts two artists, one 
full of integrity but debt-ridden and stymied by writers' block for 
the past 20 years; the other a prolific popular success but equally 
unsatisfied. They are friends and rivals, each wishing for a piece 
of the other's life. 
</P>
<P>
	Friel's play, which the Roundabout Theater Company opened  
Tuesday, may not be at the level of ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' or 
``Translations.'' It talks itself into corners. Yet the work has 
its haunting moments, particularly in this beautifully acted 
production directed with care by Kyle Donnelly. 
</P>
<P>
	Friel focuses on Tom Connolly, a struggling author who had a  
burst of glory in his 20s. Now, more than two decades later, he 
finds himself in growing financial difficulty and unable to write. 
Tom lives in increasing isolation in Ballybeg, County Donegal, in a 
crumbling structure remarkably similar to the old manse in 
``Aristocrats,'' another Friel family play. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom spends time visiting his autistic daughter, who has been  
committed to an institution. As the lost writer, John Glover 
perfectly captures the man's bitterness and sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Kate Burton underplays his alcoholic wife with great effect.  
Tom's helpmate is a sardonic woman who grudgingly helps her husband 
but resents everything that didn't happen to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom stands in forlorn contrast to Garret Fitzmaurice, a  
prosperous novelist portrayed with zest by Gawn Grainger. This 
robust man arrives with his equally jocular wife (Helen Carey) for 
a visit. Behind their gaiety, there is a desperate sniping not 
unlike the little wars being fought by Tom and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Friel's slight story spins on a question of money. An American  
university has offered Garret a sizable amount of cash for his 
collected papers. Now, it may do the same for Tom, depending on 
what an appraiser -- presented here as a nervous, insecure man (the 
wonderful Michael Emerson) -- thinks of the work. 
</P>
<P>
	Fluttering around the edges of this drama are Tom's in-laws: the  
wife, a retired doctor, whose crippling arthritis will soon doom 
her to a wheelchair, and the husband, a spright of a fellow given 
to bouts of kleptomania. Lois Smith invests the elderly woman with 
a commonsense that eludes most of the other characters, while Joel 
Grey exudes considerable charm as her hubby, who plays the piano in 
local hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Tom's considerable flaws, Friel clearly favors the man  
over Garret. Tom lives life on the edge, emotionally, financially, 
creatively. He may not be successful, but he is not any more 
unhappy than his seemingly satisfied counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
	Friel frames the play with Tom's visits to his mentally  
disturbed daughter, a haunting performance by Woodwyn Koons. These 
meetings are where Tom's imagination really soars -- making up 
fanciful stories for an offspring, who, perhaps, will never hear, 
much less understand, them. Then again, she might. Friel seems to 
be saying it is a chance every writer must take.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Hurts Southeast Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- For more than two decades, Paul Shirley  
and his son David have operated businesses side by side in this Tar 
River community, founded by freed slaves after the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	But the filthy water that swamped the area after Hurricane Floyd  
has put the future of the businesses in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Shirley's S&AMP;J Grocery was swamped by 16 feet of murky,  
contaminated water. Dozens of cars at David Shirley's S&AMP;J Auto were 
ruined. Both face huge obstacles before they can reopen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard there's a possibility the federal government might  
buy out some businesses and homes in flooded areas and demolish 
them,'' Paul Shirley said. ``I'm hoping for that. I'm 80 years old, 
and I don't want to start over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Commerce Secretary Rick Carlisle estimated Wednesday that  
more than 1,000 North Carolina businesses sustained damage severe 
enough to warrant Small Business Administration claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the worst ever in terms of business  
disruptions,'' he said. ``(Hurricane) Fran caused some problems, 
but businesses were able to get back in business once the trees 
were cleared and power was restored for the most part. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time it's taking much longer for them to get back on  
their feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, which came ashore near Wilmington on Sept. 16, drove more  
than 10,000 people into shelters, destroyed 3,680 homes and damaged 
more than 12,000 others. Floyd is blamed for at least 48 deaths and 
causing severe damage in at least 27 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jim Hunt is seeking $5.3 billion in federal aid for the  
flooded region. Including insurance claims and money local 
governments will spend on recovery, the disaster will likely exceed 
Hurricane Fran's record $6 billion in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd flooded the downtown areas of 30 eastern North Carolina  
towns, including Princeville, dashing the dreams of many business 
owners and damaging economic development efforts in places like 
Edgecombe County. 
</P>
<P>
	Here, it was ``a blow after a real turnaround for a county that  
went from double-digit unemployment to around 7 percent,'' Carlisle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Waite of the SBA said owners now are trying to clean up  
and reopen for business and the anticipated flood of loan 
applications hasn't begun yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has a handle right now on what they think the damage  
might be to businesses, both the physical damage and the economic 
loss,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Shirley, who has run his grocery since 1963, is also  
worried about his customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ran an old-style grocery store with charge accounts and  
delivery service,'' he said. ``I've had hundreds of customers tell 
me, `Mr. Paul, we don't know what we would do without you.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	They will have to learn to make do without him because the  
floods transformed the interior of his once-tidy store near the 
railroad tracks into a mess of decaying meat and cheese and 
stinking debris. 
</P>
<P>
	His son's used-car and car-rental business also sustained  
massive damage. More than 50 vehicles were flooded along with the 
business office, putting 20 people out of work. 
</P>
<P>
	David Shirley, 50, opened the business after finishing college  
in 1972. He said he has applied for assistance from FEMA and the 
SBA, but isn't waiting for help. He's using some of the insurance 
money from his flooded vehicles to try to resurrect the car-rental 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to depend on myself and not the government,'' he said.  
``I appreciate any help we can get, but we're not sitting back and 
waiting for them.''

<HEADLINE> Europe Bank Leaves Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank left its key  
interest rates unchanged following its regular meeting Thursday, 
despite speculation that an increase is coming. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank left its main refinancing rate at 2.5 percent, where it  
has been since a 0.5 percent cut in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank president Wim Duisenberg indicated then that the reduction  
would be the only change for the year. But after bank officials 
last week signaled they were starting to worry about the risk of 
inflation, many economists said chances were good the bank's 
governing council would raise rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuela Preuschl, an economist with Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt,  
said she believed an increase to 3 percent was possible later in 
October or November. 
</P>
<P>
	``A rate rise is really only a question of timing,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The bank also confirmed Thursday that its overnight deposit rate  
will remain at 1.5 percent and its marginal lending rate will 
continue to be 3.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates apply mainly to loans involving large financial  
institutions but changes in those rates can trigger changes in 
commercial and consumer lending rates.

<HEADLINE> Hope Dwindles for Missing Colo. Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RUSTIC, Colo. (AP) -- Barring new leads in the search for a  
3-year-old boy missing for six days in the mountains, authorities 
said Thursday they may call off rescuers and use only a team of 
trackers and dogs to look for the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaryd Atadero was with a group of hikers Saturday when he  
disappeared in rugged Poudre Canyon about 80 miles northwest of 
Denver. Rescue teams have found few signs of the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point our field commanders feel they have searched the  
entire area and covered every inch,'' said sheriff's Sgt. Justin 
Smith. ``This realistically has turned into a recovery mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The effort was dramatically scaled back from Wednesday, when 69  
searchers were retracing the trail that winds along a fork of the 
Poudre River on a steep, rugged mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
	Six members of a search and rescue team were still in the  
mountains Thursday afternoon, rechecking a camp site near where 
Jaryd was last seen while hiking with a church group. Tracking dogs 
caught a whiff of a mountain lion at the camp, and investigators 
have considered the possibility the boy was attacked by a wild 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no indicators to rule anything in or rule anything  
out,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Smith played down one scenario -- abduction. Jaryd  
disappeared when he ran ahead of one bunch of hikers and failed to 
catch up with a second group. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow fell intermittently Thursday, and nighttime temperatures  
have been near or below freezing since Jaryd's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said calling off searchers would not mean they have given  
up completely. Officials plan to send a dog team up a ridge above 
the trailhead Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how hard they look, there's nothing,'' said the  
boy's father, Allyn Atadero, of Littleton. ``It's not their fault 
he's lost. They made the best effort to find him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had let the boy go on the hike with members of a group called  
the Christian Singles Network. They were staying at a resort down 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Atadero questioned why the Denver-area group took his son to a  
hazardous area. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trail gets steep. It's narrow. It drops off in places.  
There are million places every mile that Jaryd could be,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Computer Warfare Used in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The U.S. military acknowledged for the first  
time Thursday that it used a form of computer warfare against 
Yugoslavia as part of NATO's air war last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  
Staff, made the remark during an interview in which he discussed 
the Pentagon's decision to assign U.S. Space Command the 
responsibility of coordinating both the defense of military 
computer networks and attacks on enemy networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked broadly if U.S. information ``weapons'' were used against  
Yugoslavia during the Kosovo campaign, Shelton replied, ``You can 
assume that we in fact employed some of our systems, yes.'' He said 
the ``systems'' were offensive in nature, but he would not be more 
specific about how they were used. 
</P>
<P>
	A defense official said later that Shelton was referring to a  
broad range of ``information operations'' involving computers that 
may have included cyber-attacks on Yugoslavia's air defense 
network. Shelton would not specify the target of the U.S. computer 
attacks and did not discuss the results. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather not be specific about how we used it, to be  
frank,'' he said. ``I don't want to divulge too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton spoke to reporters traveling with him and Defense  
Secretary William Cohen aboard an Air Force jet from Norfolk, where 
they attended a ceremony to mark the renaming of U.S. Atlantic 
Command to U.S. Joint Forces Command. The change is part of a 
broader revision of the Unified Command Plan that includes the 
assigning of computer network defensive and attacks 
responsibilities to Space Command. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference after the ceremony, Shelton said the  
Pentagon is concerned about the vulnerability of military computers 
to intrusions not only by private hackers but also by enemies in 
times of war. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any question, as we look to the future,  
that our information systems throughout America and specifically 
within the Defense Department will be more and more subject to 
attack,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Space Command, headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base in  
Colorado Springs, Colo., was given the responsibility to develop 
defenses against attacks on military computer networks as of Oct. 
1. One year later, it will take on the added task of coordinating 
the development of offensive ``weapons'' for cyber-warfare, several 
defense officials said. The individual services are doing that work 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Space Command's main mission is to provide missile warning and  
space surveillance as part of the air and space defense of the 
United States and Canada. It also plans for strategic ballistic 
missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Norfolk ceremony, Cohen said that the newly named Joint  
Forces Command, commanded by Navy Adm. Harold Gehman Jr., has been 
given the added responsibility of coordinating U.S. military 
support to civilian agencies in the event of an attack on American 
territory with nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen stressed that the Joint Forces Command would be in a  
support role in such an event, leaving a civilian agency such as 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Justice Department 
to take the lead. Even so, some civil liberties groups contend that 
involving the military is a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are supposed to believe that turning our military into a  
national police force will somehow strengthen our democracy?'' 
American Civil Liberties Union official Gregory T. Nojeim asked 
rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
	Gehman said the military should be used to help respond to major  
disasters, as it does now in the case of hurricanes, floods and 
other natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should think the taxpayers would be upset if they thought  
that we weren't preparing to help out the citizens in the case of a 
catastrophic event,'' Gehman said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Police Arrest Muslim Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Police have arrested a Muslim leader who is  
accused of storming a government building in the southern region of 
Dagestan more than a year ago, Russia's prime minister said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nadir Khachilayev was arrested late Wednesday, Prime Minister  
Vladimir Putin said in comments picked up by the Interfax news 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Khachilayev has been wanted since 1998, when several hundred  
supporters held policemen and officials hostage at the government 
building in Dagestan's capital, Makhachkala. He and his brother 
were accused of organizing the raid, during which three policemen 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The brother, Magomed Khachilayev, leads an organization  
representing an ethnic minority in Dagestan, the Laks. He was 
arrested in Dagestan's capital, Makhachkala, several months after 
the raid, but Nadir Khachilayev escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin did not say where Khachilayev had been found. Interfax  
said that as recently as August he had been in the Dagestani 
village of Karamakhi, the site of fighting between government 
troops and Islamic militants in late August and September.

<HEADLINE> Coelho Wall Free of Donors' Names </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's campaign chairman,  
Tony Coelho, has yet to keep his promise that contributors to a 
Portuguese-American memorial wall in Lisbon would have their names 
engraved on the monument. 
</P>
<P>
	The only names now on the 8-foot-by-60-foot sculpture, ``The  
Wave,'' are those of the artists, according to a check by The 
Associated Press in Lisbon. 
</P>
<P>
	While commissioner general for the U.S. pavilion at Expo 98 in  
Lisbon, Coelho took out a $300,000 personal loan to get the 
sculpture built, and formed the Luso-American Wave Foundation to 
help repay the costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The pavilion books carried the costs of the sculpture as a  
liability, and a State Department inspector general's report said 
taxpayers could be responsible for any unpaid bills. The report 
also cited mismanagement of the pavilion by Coelho and his staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Coelho's attorney, Stanley Brand, said Thursday that the names  
would be engraved on the wall, but he did not know when. He said 
Coelho this week repaid the outstanding balance of more than 
$119,000 on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand said he did not have precise figures on how much of the  
loan was raised from donors other than Coelho, but estimated the 
figure was $150,000 to $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The sculpture, in the shape of a wave, commemorates the  
contributions of Portuguese who emigrated to the United States. 
Coelho is a Portuguese-American. 
</P>
<P>
	The Expo's Internet site said, ``Contribute to The Wave and have  
your name engraved on the monument.'' The notice also said a family 
name could be included. 
</P>
<P>
	The Luso-American Wave Foundation's certificate to operate and  
its articles of incorporation were revoked Sept. 7 by the District 
of Columbia government ``for having failed and/or refused to file 
reports and pay all fees due and owing on or before April 15, 1999, 
and 1998.''

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Wants Money From Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is  
asking a judge to force his estranged wife to turn over money he 
says she is hoarding. 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Evans, Gingrich's attorney, filed a motion Wednesday in  
Cobb County Superior Court asking that Marianne Gingrich be forced 
to transfer the money to a joint account within 14 days. It 
threatens a contempt action if she refuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple agreed last month to set up the joint account and  
transfer assets into it until their divorce is final. Evans said he 
believes Mrs. Gingrich still owes the account tens of thousands of 
dollars. Gingrich has turned over about $35,000, while Mrs. 
Gingrich has turned over only several thousand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, has denied the  
allegations. Harvey Cohen, the accountant hired to manage the joint 
account, said he was not aware of any improprieties by either 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's motion was one of a series filed by Gingrich this  
week in an effort to take the offensive against his wife, who has 
sought to force him to face formal questioning about his personal 
and financial affairs. Mrs. Gingrich also wants to question 
Callista Bisek, a congressional aide to whom Gingrich has been 
romantically linked. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich separated from his wife of 18 years in May and filed  
for divorce in July.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Spread Across Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- A day after repelling a militia ambush,  
international peacekeepers spread out across rocky terrain today to 
prevent militiamen from entering East Timor to launch further 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been persistent reports that the militiamen have been  
massing just over the border in West Timor, where they fled after 
rampaging through East Timor in the wake of the territory's Aug. 30 
vote for independence from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of further violence rose after suspected militiamen  
attacked a group of peacekeepers late Wednesday about nine miles 
from the frontier. Two Australian soldiers were slightly injured 
and two militiamen were killed in the first clash since the 
international peacekeepers arrived Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, the Australian head of the  
multinational mission, said that although the peacekeepers had set 
up bases near the border, they had not completely blocked access 
from the Indonesian-controlled West Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say our forces are present in strength, but it's a  
long border and nobody is pretending that it is absolutely 
impermeable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove dismissed criticism that the peacekeepers were not  
spreading out fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our peacekeepers are moving extremely quickly ... in this  
harsh terrain to establish security for the people to come out of 
the hills,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeeping mission was bolstered today by the arrival of  
the USS Belleau Wood, an amphibious assault ship. The ship arrived 
off the East Timor capital, Dili, carrying 900 Marines and 900 
sailors for logistical support, Marines spokesman Maj. Rick Long 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not including the forces on the ship, several dozen American  
troops are in East Timor. Another 300 are providing logistics, 
intelligence and other support from Darwin, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The force's deputy force commander, Maj. Gen. Songkitti  
Chakkabatr of Thailand, also arrived today with the vanguard of 
about 1,500 troops expected to arrive within a week. Those forces 
would bring the mission close to its authorized strength of 7,500 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The international force took control of East Timor after the  
pro-Indonesian militias, backed by elements of the Indonesian 
military, carried out a wave of violence, looting and arson 
following the independence vote. That vote still needs to be 
endorsed by the Indonesian parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Indonesians fear East Timor's breakaway will encourage  
separatists in other parts of the nation. An Indonesian general 
said today that the armed forces' top priority is keeping the 
country together. 
</P>
<P>
	The military is determined not to let Indonesia ``follow the  
same pattern of reform as the Soviet Union or Yugoslavia,'' 
Indonesian Lt. Gen. Agus Widjojo said at a seminar in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's official Antara news agency blamed the foreign  
peacekeepers for Wednesday's clash. It quoted one man as claiming 
they opened fired on a group of refugees returning to their homes 
to pick up goods and food. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeepers angrily denied that, but Cosgrove has described  
some of the militiamen who were detained briefly and sent back to 
West Timor as ``poor folk who actually are scrounging for food.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's violence started after Australian troops shot out  
the tires of a truck full of militiamen that ran a roadblock in 
Suai, a militia stronghold about 70 miles southwest of Dili. Four 
passengers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of militia members were disarmed and taken to the West  
Timor border. 
</P>
<P>
	As the peacekeepers drove back to Suai, they were ambushed,  
Cosgrove said. They returned fire, killing two men and forcing the 
rest to retreat. Two Australians were injured -- one shot at the 
base of his neck and the other shot in the leg and wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees from villages near Suai said the fighting militiamen  
had committed atrocities and forced residents into West Timor at 
gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of shooting. They came in trucks. We all  
ran,'' said Aniceto Xavier, a 31-year-old resident of Hatohudo. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty International said militiamen and Indonesian troops  
continued to target East Timorese refugees in West Timor. 
Kidnappings have been reported, and conditions in the refugee camps 
are deteriorating, with militias preventing aid workers from 
delivering food and medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The two wounded soldiers were flown to an Australian hospital  
for treatment today, defense sources said.

<HEADLINE> Dog's Birthday Party Gets Busted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Every dog has its day -- except for Byron, a  
3-year-old Labrador mix whose birthday party ended with a ticket 
from a parks enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Byron's owner, Brian Thibeault, 31, was issued a summons for the  
Aug. 18 party in a Manhattan park by the officer who told him he 
had to issue an unlawful assembly ticket because there were more 
than 20 guests (not counting the dogs.) 
</P>
<P>
	The party included balloons, goody bags with doggy treats, and a  
cake from a dog bakery called Wow Bow. Byron, who got a 
glow-in-the-dark ball and other gifts, even wore his dandiest duds 
-- a tuxedo made by a neighbor.

	Thibeault said he told the officer he didn't think he needed a  
permit for the event.

Thibeault said. ``There was no barking. There was no music, no

dropped Tuesday after the newspaper called the city Parks 
Department.

	Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said the rule that a permit is  
needed for park gatherings is generally used to target very large, 
organized events like concerts and theatrical performances.

<HEADLINE> Arnsparger Joins Redskins Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- The Redskins turned to an old nemesis to  
help meet an immediate need: improving the league's worst defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Arnsparger, one of the NFL's defensive masterminds of  
recent decades, is joining the Redskins' staff as a defensive 
coach. He will report on Monday, coach Norv Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the team named Stephen Baldacci as president of  
Washington Redskins Entertainment, Inc. He will be responsible for 
the Redskins' marketing and sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnsparger, a 23-year NFL coaching veteran, was the architect of  
Miami's ``No Name Defense'' of the early 1970s. That defense was 
instrumental in the Dolphins' 17-0 season in 1972 that ended with a 
14-7 victory over the Redskins in Super Bowl VII. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnsparger will work with defensive coordinator Mike Nolan to  
help revamp a defense that has allowed league highs of 29 1/2 points 
and 433 1/2 yards per game. Turner was unclear on Arnsparger's exact 
role for the 3-1 Redskins, who have a bye week, then play at 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill's going to be able to give us a quick evaluation of the  
things he sees,'' Turner said. ``He's going to see some of the same 
things we do, like inconsistencies, and help with eliminating big 
plays. He'll be in all the game plan meetings, working with Mike 
and other coaches. He's another set of eyes, another experienced 
coach, and a guy who, through the next 12 weeks, will be able to 
give us some good input.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring didn't signify a lack of confidence in Nolan, nor did  
it make Nolan uncomfortable, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, if we were concerned about that, we wouldn't have  
done it,'' Turner said. ``Mike is excited about it, and I'm excited 
to get Coach Arnsparger in here, because he brings a wealth of 
knowledge and experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan concurred about his comfort with the move.  
</P>
<P>
	``Norv and I talked about a lot of different things, from  
personnel changes to coaches,'' Nolan said. ``This was one thing we 
thought would be a good move to help us improve and get better as a 
defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arnsparger has been away from coaching for four seasons. Most  
recently, he was San Diego's defensive coordinator from 1992-94. In 
1992, the Chargers had the AFC's No. 2 defense. 
</P>
<P>
	In nine of Arnsparger's 11 seasons in Miami, the Dolphins  
defense finished first or second in the NFL. He helped craft 
Miami's stingy ``Killer Bs'' defense of the early 1980s, when the 
Dolphins lost in two Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	In Baldacci's most recent role, he worked for almost 10 years in  
senior sales, marketing and strategy positions at Snyder 
Communications, the marketing and communications firm of the 
Redskins' new owner, Dan Snyder. The Redskins' last team president 
was John Kent Cooke, who left the organization after he failed in a 
bid to buy the team from his late father's estate.

<HEADLINE> Study Alerts Women to Risk of STDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An estimated 17 million American women are at  
risk of a sexually transmitted disease because they or their 
partners have had sex with someone else recently, according to a 
study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 3.5 million women are not aware of the risk because they  
believe they are in a mutually monogamous relationship, the study 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But contrary to popular perceptions, the proportion of sexually  
active Americans who have had only one sex partner in a given year 
-- at least three-quarters -- has not changed significantly in a 
decade, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	The more sexual partners a person has, the more likely he or she  
is to encounter someone infected with the AIDS virus or other 
sexually transmitted disease. Even someone who has had only one 
sexual partner can be placed at risk if that partner has ever had 
sex with someone else -- one reason health experts recommend using 
condoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Guttmacher researcher Lawrence Finer combed three federal  
behavior surveys to estimate how many women are at risk.

<HEADLINE> Bagwell, Biggio and Bell Start Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Killer B's have led the Houston Astros to  
three straight NL Central titles. 
</P>
<P>
	In the playoffs, Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Derek Bell seem  
to leave their bats at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Their career postseason averages make them look like a bunch of  
weak-hitting shortstops -- Biggio is the leader, so to speak, at 
.125, followed by Bagwell at .121 and Bell at .069. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, they've done nothing to change those minuscule numbers  
in the opening round of the playoffs, although the Astros managed a 
split of the first two games in Atlanta. Bagwell is 1-for-11, 
Biggio 1-for-7 and Bell, who slumped late in the year, hasn't even 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell is scheduled to start Game 3 at the Astrodome on Friday,  
reuniting the Killer B's. But is that good news for the Astros? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the probability is that if they play in enough  
playoffs, they are going to have a great series, and one of them 
will be an MVP of a series at some point,'' manager Larry Dierker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry Bonds hasn't done well in the post-season and for me  
over the last decade he has been the best hitter in the league. So, 
you can only do what the pitcher will allow you to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bagwell is a three-time All-Star and career .304 hitter. This  
season, he hit 42 homers and stole 30 bases, joining Bonds as the 
only two major leaguers to accomplish that feat twice. Biggio is a 
career .292 hitter and only the sixth player in major-league 
history to have back-to-back seasons with at least 50 doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell has averaged .281 in his career, though he slumped to .236  
with only 12 homers during an injury plagued season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Bell has been angry when benched. Not now.  
</P>
<P>
	``I agree with everything they've done,'' he said. ``I am the  
player and they are the management. Derek Bell is ready to help 
this team however they want. If they want me to be a cheerleader, 
I'll cheer. If they want me to take one on the elbow just so we can 
score a run, I'll do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting coach Tom McCraw is sticking with the B's.  
</P>
<P>
	``Most of your playoff games are going to be close,'' he said.  
``Forget about those fourth and fifth starters. In the playoffs you 
go against the cream of the crop. That's all this is. We forget it 
and get ready for another war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After beating the Braves 6-1 in the first game, the Astros  
managed only one hit against Kevin Millwood on Wednesday. Now, they 
have to face Tom Glavine, who hasn't lost to Houston in more than 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, after Millwood's dominating performance, the Astros  
seem relieved to face anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Glavine has the ability to one-hit you, too,'' Bagwell said.  
``At least with him, you know what you're getting. We haven't seen 
Millwood as much as the rest of their pitchers. I should be an 
expert on Glavine. I've seen enough of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine went 0-8 in his first 10 career starts against the  
Astros, but he's gone 8-0 with a 1.53 ERA in his last 10 
regular-season appearances and beat them in Game 2 of the '97 
division series. His last loss to Houston came on June 25, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin just pitched a great game and there was nothing we could  
do about it,'' Bagwell said. ``We just have to go out and get our 
batting practice and not look back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros definitely don't want to look back.  
</P>
<P>
	They are 0-4 in their previous postseason appearances, losing  
the last two years in the division series. The Braves swept Houston 
in 1997, while an Astros club that won a franchise-record 102 games 
fell short again last year, losing in four games to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us are going to dwell on that game Wednesday,'' Bill  
Spiers insisted. ``We just ran into a guy that didn't give us 
anything to hit.''

<HEADLINE> World Stars Roster Selected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The five leading scorers from the 1999 Women's  
World Cup were selected for the World Stars roster that will play 
the champion Americans in the Victory Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, announced Thursday, will face all but one of the U.S.  
women who captured the World Cup in July. The only American who 
won't participate is Lorrie Fair, who is attending North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour kicks off on Oct. 22, in Pittsburgh, and will conclude  
Dec. 15 in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the World Stars will be FIFA World All-Star Game MVP  
Charmaine Hooper of Canada, who has scored four goals in her last 
two games against the Americans. She will be joined by Japan's 
all-time leading scorer Homare Sawa; Ulrika Karlsson of Sweden, one 
of the world's top goalkeepers; three-time collegiate All-American 
Laurie Hill of Mexico; and Australia captain Julie Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's Ann Kristin Aarones, the top scorer of the 1995 World  
Cup, and teammate Hege Riise, the MVP of the '95 tournament, scored 
four and three goals, respectively, in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Other potent scorers on the World Stars are Brazil's forward  
tandem of Pretinha and Roseli, one of the world's top forwards who 
was injured for the World Cup; Patience Avre of Nigeria; China's 
sensational Sun Wen and Brazil's Sissi, who tied for the World Cup 
goals lead with seven. Sun and Siss are planning to join the tour 
team in mid-tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``This World Stars team will give fans a taste of what they saw  
during the World Cup,'' said U.S. co-captain Julie Foudy. ``We know 
from experience that great players, no matter how long they've 
played together as a team, can beat you, and these guys are as 
competitive as they come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Victory Tour, sponsored by Toys 'R Us, is a series of indoor  
soccer exhibitions that will also make stops in Detroit (Oct. 24), 
Cleveland (Oct. 29), Chicago (Oct. 31), Philadelphia (Nov. 13), 
East Rutherford, N.J. (Nov. 14), Washington (Nov. 20), Raleigh, 
N.C. (Nov. 21), Anaheim, Calif. (Dec. 9), San Jose, Calif. (Dec. 
11), and Tacoma, Wash. (Dec. 12).

<HEADLINE> Senate Maneuvers for Soc. Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans want voters to know that  
they would rather cut federal programs across the board than tap 
Social Security's surpluses to pay for more spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to spend it for anything, other than paying down  
the national debt,'' Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., 
said Wednesday. ``Period. We're drawing the line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nickles' remarks came as the Senate approved a nonbinding GOP  
resolution by 54-46 advocating unspecified, across-the-board cuts 
in all 13 annual spending bills for the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the Senate rejected, 54-46, a Democratic alternative.  
That nonbinding measure said that instead of across-the-board cuts, 
Congress should close tax loopholes and find other unspecified 
savings to pay for spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Both votes were mostly along party lines.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither vote advanced Congress' overdue spending bills for  
fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1. Rather, a battle for political 
positioning was under way, with Republicans casting themselves as 
champions of Social Security and Democrats accusing the GOP of 
seeking dangerous cuts in popular programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., answered Nickles by asking, ``Do  
my colleagues really want to go on record cutting education,'' 
anti-crime, health research and other programs no politician wants 
to be seen as slashing? 
</P>
<P>
	Amid some internal grumbling, congressional Republicans --  
especially in the House -- are considering across-the-board 
reductions to keep from eating into Social Security funds. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans have been considering a 2.7 percent cut to  
achieve that. The White House budget office said that would really 
require a 9 percent reduction, and produced a five-page memo 
asserting that such cuts would have a ``severe impact'' on defense, 
education and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, President Clinton has signed only four of the 13 bills  
for fiscal 2000, vetoed one and threatened to veto five others. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, House-Senate bargainers working on one of the most  
contentious spending bills were ready to roll back some 
House-approved cuts in the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration and housing -- if Clinton administration officials 
could provide savings to pay for them, said congressional 
participants who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget chief Jack Lew was talking to lawmakers about  
finding the savings. But the two sides had not yet agreed on dollar 
amounts to be restored or how the extra spending would be paid for, 
an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional officials said if an agreement on savings was  
reached, lawmakers would provide 50,000 new rental housing vouchers 
for low-income families that Clinton has requested, the $13.6 
billion he sought for the space program and restore the national 
service AmeriCorps program. 
</P>
<P>
	The House had approved none of the housing vouchers, voted to  
kill AmeriCorps, and pared $900 million from Clinton's NASA 
request. White House officials have cited those cuts in threatening 
a veto of a $97 billion measure financing housing, veterans, 
environment and space programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were other disputes surrounding the bill that leave  
its fate uncertain. House-Senate negotiators were hoping to meet 
formally today. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action, Congress sent Clinton its sixth spending bill  
as the Senate voted 51-49 to approve a $12.6 billion foreign aid 
measure. Clinton has threatened to veto it because it provides $1.9 
billion less than he wants, including none of the $500 million he 
requested for Israel and the Palestinians to implement the Wye 
River peace pact.

</P>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Stewart Haas, an award-winning  
journalist and retired professor, died Wednesday after a brief 
illness. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Haas retired in December from his position as associate  
professor of mass communication at Winthrop University in Rock 
Hill, a position he had held since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent most of his professional career working at newspapers  
in Iowa. After graduating from Kansas State University, Haas was 
hired in 1957 as a city reporter for The Courier in Waterloo, Iowa. 
He later worked for The Courier as farm editor, assistant state 
editor, state editor and associate editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Haas served as editor of the Cedar Falls (Iowa) Record in the  
late 1960s after it was purchased by The Courier. He then returned 
to The Courier in 1975 as managing editor, becoming editor in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	At Winthrop, Haas was selected for an American Press Institute  
fellowship at The Seattle Times and conducted journalism workshops 
in Botswana and Zimbabwe. He often spent his summers as a writing 
coach for members of the South Carolina Press Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, Haas worked on the editorial staff of the  
International Herald Tribune in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Haas is survived by his wife, Sally Willson Haas; two daughters;  
his sister; four stepchildren; and four grandchildren.

	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Andrew John Hope Jr., a prominent tribal  
leader in Alaska, died in a car crash Wednesday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Hope served as director of community development with the state  
Department of Community and Regional Affairs, president of the 
Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indians of Alaska, and Grand 
Camp president of the Alaska Native Brotherhood in 1962 and 1963.

	WILLINGBORO, N.J. (AP) -- Robert ``Gorilla Monsoon'' Marella, a  
rotund professional wrestler who became a television announcer and 
later president of the World Wrestling Federation, died Wednesday 
of complications from a recent heart attack. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6, 400-pounder's wrestling career began in the 1960s  
and ran until the early 1980s. Marella once shared a world tag-team 
title with ``Killer'' Kowalski. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially a villain who feuded with pro wrestling legend Bruno  
Samartino, Marella later became beloved among fans of the 
ever-growing entertainment genre. 
</P>
<P>
	As a ringside analyst on WWF telecasts, Marella was known for  
his on-air banter with fellow announcer Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura. 
A former professional wrestler himself, Ventura now is governor of 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Marella served as WWF president in the mid-1990s.

	JACKSON, Wyo. (AP) -- Paul Petzoldt, a mountaineer who founded  
the National Outdoor Leadership School that has trained thousands 
worldwide in outdoor safety and ethics, died Wednesday of prostate 
cancer. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Petzoldt, who climbed ranges around the world, is credited with  
establishing many guiding and climbing protocols in North America. 
For example, some signals that climbers shout to one another as 
they ascend cliffs were developed by him. 
</P>
<P>
	A sturdy figure with bushy, trademark eyebrows, Petzoldt made an  
early ascent of the 13,772-foot-high Grand Teton in 1924 when he 
was only 16. He made his last ascent of the Grand Teton 60 years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1965 he established the National Outdoor Leadership School in  
Lander, about 120 miles southeast of Jackson. It has branch 
campuses in Alaska and eight other locations around the world. 
Nearly 50,000 students have attended the school in 35 years.

Funeral Service'' during his years as executive director of the 
National Funeral Directors Association, died Wednesday. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Raether frequently appeared on radio and television in the 1960s  
to defend the industry from criticism leveled by British author 
Jessica Mitford in the 1963 book ``The American Way of Death,'' 
which portrayed funeral directors as using questionable practices 
and taking unfair advantage of grieving survivors. 
</P>

the early 1980s when the Federal Trade Commission developed rules 
governing price disclosures of funeral goods and services.

of the daily Maariv, died Wednesday at his desk in the newspaper 
office after finishing an article. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnitzer was among a group of journalists who started Maariv,  
an afternoon newspaper, in 1948. He served as the paper's editor 
from 1980-82 and was known for his sharply worded editorials and 
commentaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The article he finished just before his death was meant for  
Friday's weekend edition. The paper printed it Thursday instead. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Schnitzer argued against allowing the  
publication of the memoirs of Adolf Eichmann, who, as Hitler's 
deputy directed the murder of six million Jews during World War II. 
Eichmann, who wrote the document while in an Israeli prison, was 
executed after being convicted of war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Eichmann's survivors have demanded that Israel turn over the  
memoirs, held under lock and key by Israeli officials. Schnitzer 
argued that if they are made public, the memoirs could be used by 
neo-Nazis to justify or excuse the Holocaust.

	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Dimitri Tsafendas, who  
assassinated South African Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd in 1966, 
died Thursday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Tsafendas was a parliamentary messenger when he stabbed Verwoerd  
to death in parliament in Cape Town on Sept. 6, 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	The assassin claimed that a giant ``tapeworm'' in his stomach  
had forced him to kill Verwoerd, who was widely considered the 
architect of apartheid. Ruled insane, Tsafendas was imprisoned and 
later sent to a mental institution. 
</P>
<P>
	It was never clearly established if Tsafendas, the son of a  
Greek father and Mozambican mother, targeted Verwoerd for 
institutionalizing the system of white rule in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	During the decades that Tsafendas was incarcerated, apartheid  
was strengthened, with the country's white rulers crushing attempts 
by the African National Congress and other groups to overthrow it. 
The system finally collapsed with the nation's first all-race 
elections in 1994.

	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Dave Whitsell, a defensive back on the  
Chicago Bears' 1963 NFL championship team, died Thursday after 
battling prostate cancer. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitsell played collegiately at Indiana. He was with the Bears  
from 1961-66 and was a member of the 1963 team that beat the New 
York Giants 14-10 for the title. He later played with the New 
Orleans Saints from 1967-69.

</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tomoki Hitomi, a Japanese painter who learned his  
trade while on the run from police, died of liver cancer Tuesday. 
He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	He was imprisoned for his involvement in a series of art thefts  
in 1972. Hitomi, whose real name was Yasuo Hitomi, fled to Hong 
Kong in 1973 after police began searching for him in connection 
with the robberies. He later went to Greece, where he learned to 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
	He surrendered to police in 1986 at the Japanese Embassy in  
Athens and was sent to prison in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	After his release four years later, he opened a studio in  
central Japan and held private exhibitions of his artwork both at 
home and abroad.

</P>
<P>
	BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) -- Alex Lowe, regarded by some as the world's  
best mountain climber, was killed by an avalanche Tuesday as he 
scouted routes on the upper slopes of Tibet's 26,291-foot 
Shishapangma, the world's 14th-highest peak. He was 40. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bridges, 29, of Aspen, Colo., a high-altitude cameraman,  
was also killed. Bridges was part of the film crew recording the 
expedition for American Adventure Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe climbed on five continents during his 25-year career and  
twice reached the summit of Mount Everest. At the time of his 
death, he was under sponsorship of The North Face equipment 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Expedition members were at about 19,000 feet when they saw the  
slab of snow break free some 6,000 feet above them. Andrew McLean, 
the expedition leader, estimated the avalanche was traveling at 
more than 100 mph when it struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe's death stunned the community of high-altitude climbers,  
some of whom had believed that Lowe -- known as the ``Lungs with 
Legs'' for his incredible strength and stamina -- was invincible. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a year when six climbers died on Mount McKinley, Lowe  
was involved in several rescues. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe reached the summit of the Grand Teton in Wyoming's Grand  
Teton National Park this summer with Max -- which he called one of 
his proudest accomplishments.

	WILLINGBORO, N.J. (AP) -- Robert ``Gorilla Monsoon'' Marella, the  
rotund professional wrestler who became a television announcer and 
later president of the World Wrestling Federation, died Wednesday 
of complications from a recent heart attack. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6, 400-pounder's wrestling career began in the 1960s  
and ran until the early 1980s. Marella once shared a world tag-team 
title with ``Killer'' Kowalski. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially a villain who feuded with pro wrestling legend Bruno  
Samartino, Marella later became beloved among fans of the 
ever-growing entertainment genre. 
</P>
<P>
	As a ringside analyst on WWF telecasts, Marella was known for  
his on-air banter with fellow announcer Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura. 
A former professional wrestler himself, Ventura now is governor of 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Marella served as WWF president in the mid-1990s.

<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A.L. ``Doodle'' Owens, who wrote dozens  
of country music hits for stars like Charley Pride, George Jones 
and Moe Bandy, died Monday from a heart attack. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens' hits include ``Wine Colored Roses'' for Jones, ``Johnny  
One Time'' for Brenda Lee and ``Hank and Lefty Raised My Country 
Soul'' for Stoney Edwards. Owens got the nickname ``Doodle'' as a 
child because he crawled backwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens, a native of Waco, Texas, moved to Nashville in 1965,  
after being encouraged by singer Ray Price. With Frazier, he 
co-wrote two No. 1 hits for Pride in 1969, ``(I'm So) Afraid of 
Losing You Again'' and ``All I Have to Offer You (Is Me).''

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Retired state Supreme Court Justice Frank  
Richardson, a conservative dissenting voice on the liberal court of 
the 1970s and early 1980s, died Tuesday at age 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson was appointed to the court in 1974 by Gov. Ronald  
Reagan, who had named him to a state appellate court in Sacramento 
three years earlier. He retired in 1983 and spent the next two 
years as chief lawyer for the U.S. Interior Department, then headed 
by William Clark, a former state Supreme Court colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Clark, also a Reagan appointee, regularly dissented from  
rulings by the court under Chief Justices Donald Wright and Rose 
Bird that increased protections for criminal defendants, expanded 
consumer rights and strengthened environmental restrictions against 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote the majority rulings that upheld Proposition 13, the  
1978 tax-cut initiative, and Proposition 8, a prosecution-sponsored 
1982 initiative that restricted some criminal defenses.

<P>
	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Amalia Rodrigues, the Portuguese singer  
whose passionate performances of the country's brooding ``fado'' 
music took her from Lisbon taverns to worldwide fame, died 
Wednesday at her home. She was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodrigues' personal secretary, Leonel Henriques, told the news  
agency Lusa that she was found dead in her bed, adding she had felt 
unwell in previous days. The singer had suffered two heart attacks, 
in 1979 and 1980, and increasing health problems caused her to 
retreat from public life in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Antonio Guterres announced three days of national  
mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	Amalia da Piedade Rebordao Rodrigues, known popularly as Amalia,  
became known at home as the ``Ambassador of Fado'' for taking 
Portugal's sad and haunting traditional music out of Lisbon taverns 
and placing it on a world stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Her interpretations of ``fado'' -- which means ``fate'' or  
``destiny'' -- gave the world a glimpse into the depths of the 
Portuguese character. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fado'' lyrics are sentimental and melancholic, centering on  
longing, sadness and fatalism, while the guitar accompaniment 
combines the influences of Arab, African and Portuguese cultures.

<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Dr. Sydney Salmon, a nationally recognized  
cancer scientist, clinician and founding director of the Arizona 
Cancer Center, died Wednesday of complications from pancreatic 
cancer. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	He was considered one of the most nation's most influential  
cancer researchers. His successor, Dr. Daniel Von Hoff, called him 
``a remarkable cancer visionary and great leader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon made a number of early influential findings, including  
the first reproducible human tumor cloning and the use of 
chemotherapy following tumor removal, said Dr. David Alberts, 
associate dean for research at the cancer center and a protege of 
Salmon's. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, he was named to the National Cancer Advisory Board.

<HEADLINE> Holdout McCarty Signs With Red Wings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Holdout Darren McCarty has signed a contract to  
remain with the Detroit Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Wings spokeswoman Sue Gjerset confirmed the signing, saying  
details would be released later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Booth Newspapers and radio station WWJ-AM said McCarty and the  
team agreed on a $5.4 million, three-year contract. McCarty 
originally had asked for $6 million over three years and the Red 
Wings had offered $5 million, the station said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit television station WDIV and the Detroit Free Press  
reported McCarty signed the deal late Wednesday night and was on 
his way to join the team in Atlanta. The Red Wings play the 
expansion Thrashers tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left today with McCarty's agent, Patrick Morris, was  
not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1, 215-pound power forward, who missed 13 of the last  
16 games with a groin injury, scored 14 goals and added 26 assists 
last season for the Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty, 27, has been a part of two Stanley Cup-winning Red  
Wings teams, scoring the game-winning goal against Philadelphia in 
the final game of the 1997 championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	Both McCarty and the team had reasons to break the deadlock  
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Since players start being paid with the beginning of the regular  
season, McCarty potentially lost income with each game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings only had 12 healthy forwards since right wing Kirk  
Maltby, who had taken McCarty's spot, irritated a lower-abdominal 
hernia in Tuesday's 3-2 loss to the Dallas Stars. He could be 
sidelined as long as a month, Booth reported. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty has stayed in shape by working out with the junior  
Windsor Spitfires of the Ontario Hockey League.

<HEADLINE> German Outfit Plans Magnetic Rail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Despite strong signals that the government will  
pull the plug on a magnetic high-speed rail link, a consortium 
backing the project moved forward with plans today to build a 
single line between Hamburg and Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after meeting with industry and rail officials, Transport  
Minister Reinhard Klimmt said a decision on the project would be 
made by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional talks were needed to determine whether a single-track  
alternative is technically feasible and whether companies would be 
able to finish the project without long-term subsidies, he told ZDF 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	A consortium of firms, however, said it would continue working  
on plans for a cheaper, single-track model, and present full data 
on the alternative before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has made clear it will spend only the $3.3  
billion pledged by the previous conservative government, and the 
project's backers are proposing the single-rail version as a way to 
stay within budget. 
</P>
<P>
	An environmentalist group criticized the alternative, saying it  
would run above the price tag. Environmentalists also contend that 
the line's electromagnetic field would be a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	The gliding train, driven by electrically generated magnetic  
forces on a cushion of air, would cut travel time between Berlin 
and Hamburg by two-thirds, covering the 185 miles in just under an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The first intercity link of its kind, it would carry as many as  
6 million passengers a year on the single rail version, or 8.5 
million on a double rail.

<HEADLINE> Charges Identify Rapist Only by DNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- With time running out to file charges against  
an unknown rapist, prosecutors have taken the unusual step of using 
the man's DNA code to identify him in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	One unknown person is blamed for three rapes in 1993 in  
Milwaukee. The statute of limitations had expired in two cases by 
the time an arrest warrant for kidnapping and sexual assault was 
filed in early September. 
</P>
<P>
	The warrant identifies the assailant as ``John Doe, unknown  
male,'' with matching DNA at ``genetic locations D1S7, D2S44, 
D5S110, D10S28 and D17S79.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors believe that stops the clock from ticking down on  
the statute of limitations, which would have expired on the third 
attack Nov. 8, so the assailant can be prosecuted if he is arrested 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be litigated someday, no doubt,'' Milwaukee County  
assistant district attorney Norman Gahn said after filing the 
warrant. ``This way, it's been put into the system so we will 
preserve jurisdiction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The step is not unprecedented. Ty Kaufman, the prosecutor in  
McPherson County, Kan., said he used a DNA profile on a 1991 arrest 
warrant to identify a suspect in several rapes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can identify a perpetrator by the use of some device  
that will give you a positive identity, then why not use that?'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases remain open. ``We haven't found him yet,'' Kaufman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An individual's DNA -- shorthand for the genetic material  
deoxyribonucleic acid -- is similar to a fingerprint in proving 
one's identity. DNA testing can be done on blood and sperm. 
</P>
<P>
	Using it to identify otherwise unknown suspects is an  
extraordinary maneuver, said Daniel D. Blinka, an associate 
professor at the Marquette University Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it indicates is that DNA evidence has come of age in the  
courtroom,'' Blinka said. ``It's another step toward eventually 
saying: `This is the perpetrator. This is his genetic 
fingerprint.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen states currently participate in a national DNA indexing  
system by inputting DNA samples from known criminals and unsolved 
crimes. Wisconsin is among the states that have a DNA database. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Ray Dall'Osto, chairman of the Wisconsin Bar  
Association's criminal law section, called it ``an attempt to 
stretch the envelope but I think there is a question about whether 
one can extend the statute by filing a legal charge without naming 
the defendant.''

<HEADLINE> Petition Viled To Remove Ventura </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- An unsuccessful write-in candidate for  
governor filed a recall petition Thursday seeking to remove Gov. 
Jesse Ventura from office for malfeasance, alleging he used his 
position for personal gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura spokesman John Wodele said Leslie Davis, who has sought  
unsuccessfully to bring conflict of interest charges against 
Ventura, is becoming a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won't be successful. It's a waste of the taxpayers'  
money,'' Wodele said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, an environmental activist, alleges that Ventura used his  
position to make money from his autobiography and from his August 
return to the professional wrestling ring as a referee. Those 
ventures could bring Ventura as much as $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	If the 25 signatures Davis gathered so far can be verified, the  
state Supreme Court could order a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court decides there is enough evidence supporting the  
allegations, then the secretary of state issues a full recall 
petition. That petition would require 500,000 signatures to trigger 
a special recall election.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Poll Shows McCain Behind Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain has moved into  
sole possession of second place behind George W. Bush in a new poll 
of likely voters in New Hampshire's Republican presidential 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls suggested that Democrats Bill Bradley and Al Gore remained  
in a tight battle in the state with the nation's first presidential 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, the former New Jersey senator, had a slight lead over  
the vice president in one poll out Thursday, and the two were 
locked in a statistical dead heat in another. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was favored by 42 percent of likely Democratic primary  
voters, while Gore was picked by 35 percent in the poll done by 
Franklin Pierce College for WNDS-TV. Because the error margin was 
plus or minus 6 percentage points, Bradley appeared to have a 
slight lead, his first in a New Hampshire poll. Bradley and Gore 
were in a statistical dead heat in a poll done for the Boston 
Herald and WCVB-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley led Bush among New Hampshire voters by 51 percent to 36  
percent in the Franklin Pierce poll, while Gore and Bush were in a 
statistical dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key to Bradley's success is attracting independents to the  
Democratic primary'' and the Democratic ticket, said Franklin 
Pierce pollster Robin Marra. ``In the head-to-head with Bush, 
independents favor Bradley by a 55 to 30 percent margin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among likely voters in the Republican primary, Bush had 43  
percent and McCain 23 percent, according to the Pierce poll. Former 
American Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole had 8 percent, and 
magazine publisher Steve Forbes had 6 percent. No one else had more 
than 4 percent, while 10 percent of likely Republican voters were 
undecided in the Pierce poll. The Herald-WCVB poll only looked at 
Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pierce poll taken a month ago showed Bradley slightly behind  
Gore and in a dead heat with Bush. It also showed Bush leading the 
Republican field with 48 percent of the Republican vote, and 
McCain, Dole and Forbes with 10 percent each. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pierce survey of 564 registered New Hampshire voters was  
conducted Sunday through Wednesday, with 258 saying they would vote 
in the Democratic primary and 252 planning to vote in the 
Republican primary. Independents can vote in either primary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Herald-WCVB poll, also released Thursday, found  
Bradley and Gore in a statistical tie, a finding that has been 
reflected in several recent polls. Four months ago, that poll gave 
Gore a 12-point lead over Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	But R. Kelly Myers of RKM Research and Communications said his  
poll for the Herald and WCVB also found Bradley's support was 
unsettled. Nearly two-thirds of those who said they would vote for 
him also said they might change their minds before the February 
primary. Only 45 percent of Gore supporters said they might switch, 
while more than half were firmly committed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Herald-WCVB telephone survey of 403 likely voters was  
conducted Tuesday and Wednesday and had a margin of error of 5 
percentage points. The WNDS poll of 564 registered voters had an 
error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points for the entire 
sample, larger for subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Close Race is 'Liberating' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, trying to put  
his best spin on his tight Democratic presidential primary race 
with Bill Bradley, says the contest is ``liberating'' him for a 
personal and political campaign makeover. 
</P>
<P>
	After cutting the ceremonial ribbon Wednesday for his new  
national campaign headquarters in Nashville, Gore acknowledged 
there was truth to the perception that he becomes wooden and stiff 
whenever TV cameras begin rolling. 
</P>
<P>
	He tried for years to change a style learned from his father,  
the late Albert Gore Sr., but decided to have another go at it 
after Bradley's campaign began to surge. 
</P>
<P>
	``The closeness of the battle for the nomination has been an  
opportunity for me to let 'er rip, and I think that's been healthy 
and liberating,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	'' ... You know, Janis Joplin sang 'freedom's just another word  
for nothing left to lose.''' 
</P>
<P>
	As poll numbers and fund-raising totals began increasing for  
Bradley, a former U.S. senator from New Jersey, Gore tossed the 
prepared speeches and began trying to better connect with his 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, he abruptly announced he was moving his campaign out  
of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	At the ribbon-cutting, he wore cowboy boots, khakis and a  
blue-knit sports, and shunned the stage to walk among some 200 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very powerful moment in this campaign,'' Gore said.  
``Powerful because of what home means. ... Home is where we start 
from. Home is where we learn our values. It's where we return to 
remember ourselves in the best sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though born and raised in Washington, Gore considers Tennessee  
his home. As a boy, he spent summers working on the family farm in 
Carthage, about 50 miles east of Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	As a young man, he studied at Vanderbilt University and was a  
reporter at The Tennessean in Nashville before being elected to the 
U.S. House in 1976. He was re-elected three times, and won the 
first of two U.S. Senate races in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers say Gore's decision to relocate to Tennessee is not  
only an effort to revitalize a stagnant campaign, but to help 
distance him from President Clinton, lose the Beltway insider image 
and trim a staff viewed as top heavy. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gore announced a new campaign manager Wednesday,  
Donna Brazile, who brings a reputation as one of the Democrats' 
best grassroots organizers. The appointment of Brazile, a black 
woman, also helps diversify a Gore inner circle that has been 
criticized for being dominated by white males.

<HEADLINE> Schools Miss Logging Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOODFORDS, Calif. (AP) -- Tiny, mountainous and remote,  
California's least populated county is waging a fierce campaign to 
replenish its lifeblood -- fast-dwindling money for schools and 
roads that come from logging national forests. 
</P>
<P>
	The people of Alpine County -- all 1,200 of them -- are scattered  
across the Sierra Nevada in a region of cliffs, chasms and peaks 
that resembles Switzerland more than the Wild West. It is snowbound 
half the year -- one of the school buses is a Chevrolet Suburban 
with studded snow tires -- and it has some of the steepest stretches 
of public highway in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The county seat is Markleeville, population 165.  
</P>
<P>
	This very small community is at the center of a very large  
national debate over the so-called ``timber receipts'' law, which 
has been on the federal books since 1908. It provides that 25 
percent of the proceeds from U.S. Forest Service timber sales and 
grazing fees be divided among counties that have national forests 
within their borders. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alpine County, more than nine of every 10 acres are owned by  
the government. There are parts of three national forests here. 
</P>
<P>
	But as timber harvesting has declined throughout the Sierra, the  
receipts have dropped dramatically. Now, schools and other public 
agencies that depend on that money are looking to the federal 
government for a more reliable source of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, the 39 California counties entitled to receive timber  
receipts got about $53 million, according to the Forest Service. 
Last year, they got just $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Alpine County's share plunged from $835,000 to about $330,000,  
and much of that went to keep up the roads. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three or four years ago, it dropped from about $500,000 to  
$120,000 for schools, and I watched a quarter of my budget 
disappear,'' said James Parsons, superintendent of the Alpine 
County Unified School District, which has a $2 million annual 
budget. ``It was catastrophic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The entire county, which is about 40 miles south of Reno, Nev.,  
has about 200 school-age children. There is no high school, so most 
of the high school-age students go to Nevada for class, and a few 
attend school in nearby Calaveras County. The rest are educated at 
small elementary schools in Alpine County, including two one-room 
schoolhouses. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the district is so small that some officials wonder  
whether it is too tiny to be functional. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll go to these meetings, and people will ask me, `Why do you  
exist, anyway?' Well, we exist because this is where the kids are. 
That's why we're here,'' Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the district's size, any fluctuations in timber  
receipts have a disproportionate impact. The district recently laid 
off its classroom aides and two of 15 teachers. Other salaries were 
frozen, and two of the three bus drivers were let go. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials have heard the county's complaints. But they  
say there is little they can do. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public has told us in very clear terms that they would  
like to see more emphasis placed on recreation and fish and 
wildlife and less emphasis on intensive timber production,'' Forest 
Service spokesman Matt Mathes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Logging has changed from clear-cutting to simply thinning out,  
he said -- meaning less timber is coming off each acre and receipts 
are smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is that in the old days the driving force was  
the production of boards,'' Mathes said. ``Now, it is the 
restoration of the ecosystem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To help counties dependent on logging, the Clinton  
administration has proposed replacing the timber receipts with a 
stream of federal tax dollars. Other proposals before Congress 
would retain a link to timber, but assure a minimum level of 
federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Some within the logging industry believe that severing the tie  
to timber could erode timber harvests, loosening the industry's 
leverage over local communities and disturbing rural culture. 
</P>
<P>
	```Decoupling' these county payments is bad for taxpayers, and  
it rips the socioeconomic fabric holding these rural communities 
together,'' said Chris Nance of the California Forestry 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Alpine County, where schools are community centers and  
roads bind residents together, people are weary of the fight for 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just not much money here anyway, and it affects  
everything,'' said Bob Rudden, owner of the Markleeville General 
Store. ``It affects everybody with children or grandchildren.''

<HEADLINE> Mars Lander Avoids Metric Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A spacecraft hurtling toward Mars for a Dec.  
3 landing is not afflicted by the same metric conversion problem 
that caused a sibling probe to vanish as it arrived at the Red 
Planet last month, mission controllers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Reviews of the Mars Polar Lander's position also indicate it is  
on course for its 90-day mission to search for evidence of water, 
Richard Cook, the spacecraft's operations manager at NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Climate Orbiter was lost Sept. 23 just as it was  
starting to circle the planet. It likely burned up or broke apart 
in the Martian atmosphere that it was supposed to study, 
controllers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said last week that a failure to convert  
navigation data from English units used by one group of technicians 
to the metric system used by a different team most likely caused 
the failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, mission navigators are scrambling to reprogram  
command sequences for the lander's arrival. The lost orbiter was 
supposed to serve as a communications relay between Mars and Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The lander's antenna will be used for a direct link between the  
two planets. And the Mars Global Surveyor, which has been orbiting 
the planet since 1997, also can be reprogrammed to act as a relay 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook insists that no data from the lander will be lost because  
of the Climate Orbiter's absence. The information, however, will 
dribble back to Earth at a slower rate than had the probe arrived 
safely.

<HEADLINE> McCain, Forbes Deny Dole Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEDFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain on Thursday denied fueling  
rumors that Elizabeth Dole, a rival for the Republican presidential 
nomination, is quitting the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole's former spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said in Thursday  
editions of The Boston Globe that campaign workers for the Arizona 
senator and magazine publisher Steve Forbes have been telling 
people that Dole's campaign is falling apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``McCain's people have been very overt,'' Fleischer said. ``I  
think some of these male candidates are frustrated to be losing to 
a woman like Elizabeth Dole. So they engage in the art of 
discrediting their opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he had nothing to do with the rumors and would fire  
anyone on his staff who had. He said he considers both Dole and her 
husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, ``dear friends'' and has respect and 
affection for both of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed to hear her spokesperson say that,''  
McCain said. ``Both she and her husband know I would never do such 
a thing, nor would anyone who works for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes called the accusation ``utterly preposterous.''  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first I hear of this rumor,'' he said in a  
telephone interview. ``Mine is a campaign of ideas and issues, not 
rumor or innuendo. Period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole denied there was any truth to the rumors.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think there have been rumors which have been pushed. I think  
something's going on out there ... but I'm in this to win and I'm 
running hard,'' she told reporters Thursday before attending a 
fund-raising reception in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, McCain urged members of the state chapter of the  
American Lung Association to contact their congressmen and pressure 
them to support his campaign finance bill, which comes up for a 
vote in the Senate next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would ban large, unlimited and unregulated  
contributions to the political parties from unions and 
corporations. Currently, corporations cannot donate to individual 
candidates, but they can give unlimited amounts of ``soft money'' 
to the parties, which can spend it on a broad range of activities 
to support their candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's really see who's for this system that has corrupted  
American politics and who's against it,'' McCain said.

<HEADLINE> Rogers Falters in Postseason Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Once again Kenny Rogers fell short in the  
postseason. Only this time, his teammates couldn't bail him out. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, who had three bad starts in the 1996 playoffs for the  
New York Yankees, was knocked out after giving up four runs in 4 
1-3 innings in the New York Mets 7-1 loss to the Arizona 
Diamondbacks on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the stuff I had, pretty much from the first inning I knew  
I'd have to battle,'' Rogers said. ``I never really felt 
comfortable out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series heads back to New York tied at one game apiece.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogers allowed 11 runs in seven innings in his only three  
previous playoff starts. But each time, the Yankees rallied to win 
after Rogers was knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets couldn't do the same against Todd Stottlemyre and the  
Diamondbacks, who went into the game with the best record (32-16) 
in the majors against left-handed starters. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Mets took a 1-0 lead in the top of the third, Rogers  
ran into trouble in the bottom half. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Bell singled, Luis Gonzalez was hit by a pitch and Matt  
Williams bounced one just in front of the plate for an infield 
single to load the bases with two outs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, who excels at getting batters to hit grounders to  
baseball's best infield, didn't give his fielders a chance to get 
out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, who walked two batters with the bases loaded in a recent  
start against the Phillies, walked Greg Colburnn on a 3-1 pitch to 
tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Finley followed with a two-run single to make it 3-1.  
</P>
<P>
	``We had two strikes on Gonzalez and a curveball backed up and  
hit him, and Williams got an infield hit, and a two-strike ground 
ball to right (Finley's),'' Valentine said. ``He could have left 
with two runs in five innings. That's not so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finley added a two-run double in the fifth off Pat Mahomes, who  
relieved Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers allowed five hits, two walks and hit a batter during his  
stint, and said he was mildly surprised to be relieved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't second-guess any of it, because I wasn't  
dazzling,'' said Rogers, who threw 83 pitches, including 33 balls. 
``But I wasn't unhappy with what I was doing. I thought if I could 
get through six or seven innings with two or three runs, I'd be 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers didn't get much support other than from Rickey Henderson,  
who was 2-for-3, scored the Mets' only run and stole second three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	That tied the major league record for a game, set by Cleveland's  
Kenny Lofton on Oct. 4, 1995, and gave Hendrson five stolen bases 
in two games, an NL record for a division series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody does his job,'' Henderson said. ``I don't want to  
focus on it. They got the breaks and won it, and it's even-even.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there wasn't much else. Edgardo Alfonzo, who hit two homers  
and drove in five runs in the opener, went 0-for-4, John Olerud, 
who also homered in Game 1, went 0-for-3, and Mike Piazza didn't 
get a hit until he singled in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was the first for the Mets in October. They had to win  
their last three games to qualify for a one-game playoff with 
Cincinnati, beat the Reds 5-0, and then won the opener against the 
Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really enjoyed that winning streak, and hopefully we can  
start a new one,'' Alfonzo said.

<HEADLINE> ValuJet Settles Crash Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- More than three years after ValuJet Flight  
592 crashed into the Everglades, the airline and its former 
maintenance contractor have settled lawsuits blaming each other for 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline, now renamed AirTran, and the now-defunct SabreTech  
announced Wednesday that they have reached a confidential 
out-of-court settlement of two lawsuits: one in which AirTran 
wanted SabreTech to be held responsible, and another in which 
SabreTech wanted AirTran found at fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``These were really just actions between the two companies and  
their insurers,'' SabreTech attorney Kenneth Quinn said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither company admitted any fault or liability in the May 1996  
accident. The plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Miami 
International Airport en route to Atlanta. All 110 passengers and 
crew on board were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say mislabeled and improperly capped oxygen  
canisters delivered by SabreTech employees had been loaded on 
board. Investigators concluded the canisters led to an explosion 
and fire before the plane went down. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, AirTran received a cash payment. No other  
details, including the amount of the settlement, were made public.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Opens Gun Safety Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to avoid the political fire that comes  
with virtually any gun control debate, Victoria Reggie Kennedy has 
started a new campaign stressing gun safety at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kennedy, wife of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and her  
supporters are not advocating further restrictions on guns and 
won't be doing any lobbying on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, ``we hope to make unloading, locking and storing guns  
properly as automatic as buckling a safety belt,'' Mrs. Kennedy, 
co-founder of the nonprofit Common Sense About Kids and Guns, said 
at a news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The group hopes to draw widespread support by adopting a  
noncontroversial position: Adults need not give up their firearms 
but should help reduce children's accidental, gun-related deaths 
and injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, which is privately funded, plans to run public  
service advertisements in print and on radio and television, some 
starting in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We applaud the approach they're taking,'' said Kathy Cassidy,  
manager of the National Rifle Association's ``Eddie Eagle'' gun 
safety program for elementary school children. She said the group's 
message is similar to that offered by the NRA's children's campaign 
and its gun safety guide for parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kennedy, the mother of two teen-agers, said she did not  
approach the NRA for support. Other organizations, including gun 
and ammunition manufacturers, mayors, children's advocates and 
pediatricians, have signed on. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it just saves one life, that's a life worth saving,'' said  
actress Michael Learned, a campaign spokeswoman who portrayed 
mother Olivia Walton on the TV series ``The Waltons'' in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Learned recalled that her own son, as a boy of 10 or 11,  
could have been hurt or killed at a friend' house after the friend 
found a loaded gun, cocked it and pointed it at him. 
</P>
<P>
	An average of five children were killed every day in gun-related  
accidents and suicides committed with a firearm from 1990-1997, 
according to the group, citing statistics from the federal Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to, as an adult, be responsible,'' said Ann Marie  
Crowell of Saugus, Mass., whose youngest child, 12-year-old Brian, 
was shot and killed on Dec. 24, 1997, while at a friend's house. An 
unlocked, loaded revolver went off after the friend pulled it out 
of his mother's dresser drawer.

<HEADLINE> Harbaugh Expected To Face Lions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Chargers quarterback Jim Harbaugh,  
nursing two cracked ribs and a bruised throwing elbow, practiced 
Thursday and is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel probably better than I expected,'' said Harbaugh, who  
didn't practice on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some other Chargers aren't feeling so well.  
</P>
<P>
	Left tackle John Jackson isn't expected to play because of a  
back injury and wide receiver Mikhael Ricks, the team's emergency 
quarterback, and cornerback Terrance Shaw were downgraded from 
questionable to doubtful. Ricks hurt his neck while running a 
reverse in Sunday's 21-14 win over Kansas City and Shaw missed the 
game with a sprained ankle sustained the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other injuries the team has to monitor prior to  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're on the edge with quite a few people here and we're going  
to have to make some last-minute decisions on who plays,'' coach 
Mike Riley said. ``So we'll probably take most everybody with us 
and figure out the last few healthy ones while we're there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Natrone Means, still hobbled by knee and ankle  
injuries sustained in the opener, didn't practice, but is expected 
to play. Means had 14 carries Sunday for 26 yards and is averaging 
just 2.7 yards per carry after three games. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley was encouraged with Harbaugh's workout. Harbaugh was held  
out of Wednesday's practice, although he threw some passes on the 
side. He was hurt in the first quarter last Sunday, and Erik Kramer 
came in and threw two touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was great to see Jim work today,'' Riley said. ``I don't  
think he was 100 percent, but he actually got quite a few reps. We 
obviously need both of those guys ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, I would say everything is status quo with Jim  
as our starter,'' said Riley, who added he won't make a final 
decision until Friday or Saturday, after talking with Harbaugh and 
the trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Raleigh Roundtree is expected to start in place of Jackson, who  
had made 51 straight starts. Roundtree started the first three 
games at right guard, then moved to left tackle after Jackson got 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Depth is a big concern on the offensive line for a team that has  
allowed nine sacks.

<HEADLINE> Poll: N.Y. Senate Race Tightens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Rudolph Giuliani has been hurt by his battle  
with the Brooklyn Museum of Art, narrowing the gap between him and 
potential Senate rival Hillary Rodham Clinton, according to a poll 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the New York City mayor's standing improved among the  
state's largest voting group, white Catholics, in the wake of the 
museum showdown, according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll from Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion  
found the mayor favored by 46 percent of the state's voters while 
42 percent backed Mrs. Clinton, a statistical dead heat based on 
the poll's margin of error of 4 percentage points. Other polls have 
also shown them about even. 
</P>
<P>
	A Marist poll last month had Giuliani, a Republican, leading the  
Democratic first lady, 49 percent to 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Mrs. Clinton's aides said she had filed a  
``statement of candidacy'' with the Federal Election Commission, 
another signal she intends to run for the seat being vacated by 
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for her political committee, said  
the filing was not a formal declaration of candidacy, but simply a 
technical change allowing her to raise $2,000 from individual 
donors instead of the maximum $1,000 she has been raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani has been operating under an FEC statement of candidacy  
since April, Wolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new poll found the mayor's unfavorable rating among New York  
voters had climbed to 39 percent, the same level as the first 
lady's. In last month's poll, the mayor's unfavorable rating was at 
30 percent while Mrs. Clinton's was at 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty percent of those polled this time around said their  
opinion of Giuliani has gotten worse since the flap over the 
Brooklyn museum's exhibit ``Sensation'' began. Twenty-one percent 
said their opinion of the mayor had improved because of the way he 
handled the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The show includes a black Virgin Mary surrounded by naked body  
parts and dried elephant dung. The mayor has said he wants to cut 
off city funding for the museum because of the exhibit, which he 
called ``sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has said that while she disapproves of the exhibit,  
she would not strip the museum's funding. 
</P>
<P>
	White Catholics traditionally make up 40 percent to 45 percent  
of the vote in statewide elections, and Giuliani -- himself a white 
Catholic -- saw his standing among that group improve. 
</P>
<P>
	In last month's poll, white Catholics favored Giuliani over Mrs.  
Clinton, 57 percent to 34 percent. In the latest poll, Giuliani 
topped Mrs. Clinton, 60 percent to 29 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton continued to have the edge among women, 46 percent  
to 41 percent, while Giuliani was tops among men, 52 percent to 37 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 702 registered voters was conducted Sunday  
and Monday.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Wants To Aid Working Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETERBOROUGH, N.H. (AP) -- Offering relief to parents juggling  
jobs and families, Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley 
today proposed a $26 billion program of education grants for 
parents and children and an expanded family and medical leave law. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a plan that looks ahead to our long-term interests in  
human terms not just economic ones,'' Bradley said in remarks 
prepared for a campaign speech today at New Hampshire's Contoocook 
Valley Regional High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Nostlagic for his boyhood family dinners at a reliable 6:30 p.m.  
sharp, Bradley painted a familiar modern-day American portrait -- 
Dad working late, Mom at a meeting, kids dashing to the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new global economy just doesn't care about the 6:30 dinner  
hour,'' Bradley said, adding a poke at the Clinton-Gore 
administration's boast of economic success. ``A prosperity that 
fails to bolster families is a hollow and unsustainable one,'' 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $26 billion, 10-year cost of new grants for early childhood  
education and parent-friendly community colleges would be paid for 
-- like his $65 billion-per-year universal health plan -- from the 
federal budget surplus that is projected to reach about $1 trillion 
over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included in the package is an older-person's version of  
President Clinton's ``Americorps.'' With a goal of enlisting 
500,000 volunteers over three years, Bradley would offer a tax-free 
stipend of up to $200 a month to senior citizens who give at least 
15 hours per week to approved nonprofit youth programs such as the 
YMCA, Boys and Girls Clubs, school tutoring, or faith-based 
mentoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all in this together,'' said the former senator from  
New Jersey. ``And what individual families cannot build on their 
own, we can all build together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing a proposal voiced by Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday,  
Bradley said he would expand to workers in firms at least 25 
employees the popular Family and Medical Leave Act. The 1993 law, 
which currently applies only to businesses with 50 or more workers, 
guarantees them 12 weeks' unpaid leave to tend to a new child, a 
seriously ill family member or their own personal illness. 
</P>
<P>
	He said workers also should be given an additional 24 hours each  
year to meet other family obligations, such as attending 
parent-teacher conferences, taking a child to the dentist or 
helping an elderly relative with medical appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley aides appeared caught off guard when told late Wednesday  
that Gore, Bradley's rival for the Democratic presidential 
nomination next year, had articulated the same proposed changes to 
the family-leave law at a New York fund-raiser a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's plan would give $2 billion per year to state and local  
partnerships -- comprised of groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, 
Parent-Teacher Association, local child welfare agencies and 
churches -- to find new ways of tackling needs for child care, 
school readiness, parenting education and special services for 
children with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty percent of the new money would be reserved to bolster  
existing programs, such as Head Start, with the balance intended to 
pay for new services. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, Bradley said, ``operates under the simple  
understanding that we all have a shared responsibility for our 
children. Government, acting as a catalyst, can provide the kind of 
supporting infrastructure that families need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley would offer $2 billion over five years in competitive  
grants to community colleges that do a better job of matching high 
school graduates' needs with demands in the local job market, 
providing flexible class schedules and on-site child care for 
working parents and improving students' technological skills. 
</P>
<P>
	The programs' remaining costs involve the proposal for a senior  
volunteer corps. 
</P>
<P>
	``My proposal focuses on four areas that are of vital concern to  
all families and is premised on a simple idea: That if you have 
health care coverage, good child care, educational opportunity and 
supportive work environments, you can be a better parent,'' Bradley 
said.

<HEADLINE> Black Parents Appeal Busing Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Two black parents filed notice Thursday  
that they will appeal a judge's decision ending the 
Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district's policy of busing students 
to achieve racial balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Belk and Dwayne Collins' filing in the U.S. Circuit Court  
of Appeals in Richmond, Va., came a day after the school board 
voted to appeal the ruling as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte was one of the first large urban school districts to  
bus students to achieve racial balance. A Supreme Court ruling in 
the case prompted other school districts to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice was dismantled in Charlotte last month by U.S.  
District Judge Robert Potter, who ruled in favor of seven white 
parents who had challenged the 30-year-old policy. Potter said the 
Charlotte school system, which is 40 percent black, fixed its 
segregation problems ``quite some time ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some black parents worry that the decision will result in  
predominantly black schools that receive fewer resources than 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are appealing Judge Potter's ruling because we know it is  
unfair to black kids and poor kids,'' Belk said. ``We will not go 
back to where we were 30 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The parents' attorney, James Ferguson II, said the judge had  
ignored evidence, misinterpreted the law and exceeded his 
authority. Ferguson will seek a stay of Potter's ruling until the 
appeal is heard.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Expects 8.8 Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Increasing investment and private  
consumption will help South Korea's economy grow 8.8 percent this 
year, the Bank of Korea said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's forecast is up sharply from its previous  
forecast of 6.8 percent growth. The new figure compares to South 
Korea's economic contraction of 5.8 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation is expected to post a surplus on its current account,  
the broadest measure of foreign trade, of $21 billion this year, 
the bank said. This is slightly up from a previous forecast of a 
$20 billion surplus, but sharply down from a $40.6 billion surplus 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account measures trade in merchandise, services,  
tourism and investment. It is calculated by determining the 
difference between South Korea's income from foreign sources 
against payments on foreign obligations. It excludes net capital 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, South Korea's trade surplus is expected to reach  
$25.8 billion this year, down from a $41.6 billion surplus last 
year, while the consumer price index, a measure of inflation, is 
expected to rise only 0.8 percent this year, sharply down from 7.5 
percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank also said the nation's economy would grow by 6.4  
percent next year, slightly up from its previous forecast of a 
growth between 5 and 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wins Dunhill Golf Opener  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) -- The top-seeded Americans, playing  
for the first time in Europe since their controversial Ryder Cup 
victory, got a muted but polite reception today, then beat New 
Zealand in the opening round of the Dunhill Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia and Scotland also won their first-round matches 2-1.  
Sweden wiped out Italy 3-0. In late matches today, it was South 
Africa vs. China, England vs. India, Spain vs. France and Ireland 
vs. Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
	American Mark O'Meara defeated Greg Turner 73-74 when Turner  
bogeyed the final hole. Tom Lehman won over Michael Campbell 71-74, 
and Michael Long defeated Payne Stewart 76-72. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the Americans were criticized for their  
celebrative actions after beating the European team in Brookline, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were great, not one negative thing,'' said Lehman, one of  
the most widely criticized American players in the Ryder Cup. 
``They were very appreciative of good golf and very warm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've made my apologies sincerely, they're not hollow and now  
you go on. It's up to somebody else to accept the apology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lehman did stumble once. He overslept and missed the opening  
ceremony, which didn't create an international incident on a 
perfect fall day on the Old Course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea there was one,'' Lehman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Scotland's Sam Torrance, who called the behavior of American  
fans and players ``disgraceful'' serving as Europe's assistant 
captain at the Ryder Cup, said that chapter was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans were subdued, quite quiet,'' he said. ``Let them do  
what they do best, which is appreciate good golf. It (Ryder Cup) is 
well over and done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans shared that sentiment.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different kind of golf fan you've got here,'' said  
Chris Bell, applauding as Lehman rolled a long approach putt on No. 
3 at the Old Course to within inches. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate our golf here, and we'll never forgive the  
supporters. The American fans were out of order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All three Americans were mobbed for autographs Thursday at  
putting green, mostly but excited teen-age boys. Only their accents 
belied they were Scottish. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they cheated, but I wanted a memento,'' said Paul  
Jensen, 14, showing off autographs from Lehman and O'Meara. ``We 
got no problems with Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish Tiger was playing, he's brilliant,'' added his friend  
Stuart Adamson, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Craig Parry kept his side from being upset when he  
holed a 58-yard wedge on 18 for an eagle-2, shooting 3-under 69 to 
beat Japan's Tsuyoshi Yoneyama by one shot and give Australia a 2-1 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never done that sort of thing before,'' Parry said. ``In  
'98 in the Presidents Cup I chipped in on 18 against Tiger Woods. 
That got a bigger roar but this was really special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Leaney also shot 69 to win Australia's other match,  
beating Japan's Katsuyoshi Tomori who had a 70. Japan's lone winner 
was Isao Aoki, who beat Peter O'Malley 72-74. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Dunhill Cup format, the 16 nations play in four,  
four-team groups with the top team in each going to the semifinals 
on Sunday. Stroke-play rules are used with each match counting one 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotland defeated Paraguay despite a 7-under 65 for Carlos  
Franco of Paraguay, who swamped Gary Orr with a 73. Torrance, 
called in as a late replacement for Colin Montgomerie -- he has a 
dental problem -- defeated Raul Fretes 75-77, and British Open 
champion Paul Lawrie defeated Angel Franco 71-73. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden swept by Italy as Gabriel Hjertstedt defeated Costantino  
Rocca 71-75, Jarmo Sandelin beat Massimo Scarpa 79-72, and Patrick 
Sjoland won over Emanuele Canonica 68-74.

<HEADLINE> Heisman Hopeful Warrick Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Warrick went from Heisman hopeful  
to felony suspect Thursday when he and a Florida State teammate 
were charged with getting such a deep discount at a department 
store that authorities considered it a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was indefinitely suspended and another wide receiver,  
Laveranues Coles, was kicked off the team after both were charged 
with grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Tallahassee police accused them of paying only $21.40 for  
clothing worth $412.38 -- a whopping 95 percent off -- at a Dillard's 
department store. 
</P>
<P>
	A store clerk, 19-year-old Rachel Myrtil, also is facing the  
same charge for underpricing the clothing by about $391. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, an All-American from Bradenton, has 36 catches for 508  
yards and four touchdowns for the top-ranked Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who is from Jacksonville, had 12 catches for 179 yards  
and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bobby Bowden and the top-ranked Seminoles were stunned  
when they heard the news that the pair were under investigation 
Monday and then again when they were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been tough. It's like getting hit between the eyes,''  
Bowden said. ```I was shocked when I found out what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said he threw Coles off the team because he already was  
on probation for past legal and academic problems, but Warrick was 
described by athletics director Dave Hart as a ``good citizen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said Warrick's only hope of returning may be to get the  
charge reduced to a misdemeanor because school rules prohibit an 
athlete charged with a felony with playing until the case is 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	An off-duty police officer saw and taped two purchases, one  
right after another, on video surveillance equipment. Police said 
each player walked out carrying a bag of clothing but neither 
contained enough merchandise -- $300 -- to make the alleged crime a 
felony. However, assistant state attorney Warren Goodman said the 
purchases were considered a single transaction so the amounts were 
totaled. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said he was ``terribly disappointed,'' and noted Warrick  
is on schedule to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came back for his senior season instead of going pro and he  
has been such a hard worker and good leader,'' Bowden said. ``It 
makes this all the more disappointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick will be allowed to practice with the team but was not  
there Thursday. Quarterback Chris Weinke said he and the other 
players remained focused on their game Saturday against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``My focus has been on the game, will be on the game and will  
continue to be on the game for the next few days,'' Weinke said. 
``That stuff is out of our hands. We can't control it. We can 
control what we do on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators met with the two players at Coles' apartment and  
they turned over the clothing, which included a hat, shirts and 
jeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, 21, and Warrick, 22, surrendered at the Leon County Jail  
and were freed without bond, Goodwin said. Arrangements were being 
made for Myrtil to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	Each could face up to five years in prison if convicted, but  
they would probably get probation, Goodwin said. A first court 
appearance for the sole purpose of determining if they have legal 
representation was set for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart said Bowden spoke privately with Warrick.  
</P>
<P>
	``He is very remorseful,'' Hart said. ``He expressed at great  
length his personal disappointment with affecting so many people 
with his poor decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myrtil told investigators she knew Coles and Warrick from seeing  
them at parties and on campus. She admitted she voided out the true 
prices when she sold them the clothing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick told police Myrtil had done the same thing for him one  
or two times before and acknowledged he knew it was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody would know that,'' he told an investigator, according  
to police records. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick was charged in 1998 with disorderly conduct and  
resisting arrest, both misdemeanors, for a confrontation in the 
parking lot of a Tampa fast-food restaurant. The charges were 
eventually dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles was charged last year with hitting his stepmother outside  
her home. He was suspended for last year's opener against Texas A&AMP;M 
and later served 150 hours of community service for the misdemeanor 
battery charge. He also was suspended for this year's opener for 
academic reasons.

<HEADLINE> House Rejects Modest HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House members today rejected the most modest  
of four competing patient-protection bills as they confronted the 
politically charged issue of HMOs and whether injured Americans 
should be allowed to sue them. 
</P>
<P>
	Managed care has dominated the health debate on Capitol Hill all  
year, as Congress responds to voters' frustration over cost cutting 
and fears they may be denied needed care. 
</P>
<P>
	Casting their first votes on the politically hot topic, the  
House defeated, 284-145, a bill sponsored by Rep. John Boehner, 
R-Ohio, which would have given patients no new rights to file 
lawsuits. Federal law now effectively bans such suits for millions 
of Americans, even if they are injured or die because of an HMO's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative Republicans and their allies in the business and  
insurance industries preferred this bill, but Democrats and many 
Republicans felt it didn't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not hold insurance companies accountable when they  
make medical decisions that harm people,'' said Rep. Sherrod Brown, 
D-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, hoping to keep Democrats united, President Clinton  
today sent a letter to Capitol Hill restating his strong support 
for a broad bill that would give patients a host of new rights, 
including broad new rights to sue. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leaders fear that concerns over how to pay for it may  
cost them votes, but Clinton sought to clarify that he still 
strongly supports the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I endorse this legislation without reservation,'' Clinton said  
in a letter to Minority leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. ``I cannot 
support a bill that is a patients' bill of rights in name only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the House approved, largely along party lines, a  
GOP-written package of tax breaks and other provisions meant to 
help people without insurance obtain coverage. Democrats balked, 
saying the bill would cost the Treasury $48 billion over 10 years 
but help only a fraction of the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was a prelude to the main event today, as the House  
took up four competing HMO bills. Each gives patients new power to 
demand care and take disputes to outside arbitrators, but there 
were major differences over details, notably whether patients 
should be given new rights to sue -- and, if so, whether to limit 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some Republicans argued that the threat of a  
lawsuit is needed to force insurance companies to provide promised 
care. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tell welfare mothers, we tell deadbeat dads ... you have to  
be responsible for yourself,'' said Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., 
the leading Republican backer of the right to sue. Health 
insurance, he said, is ``the only industry in America where we say 
you are absolutely protected from being responsible for your 
actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For two years, Democrats have put the GOP on the defensive over  
the politically popular HMO issue. House Republican leaders, 
struggling with a slim majority and a fractured caucus, did not 
endorse any bill until debate opened on the issue this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But they were working hard Wednesday to rally opposition to a  
sweeping bill backed by Norwood and virtually all the Democrats, 
including Clinton. That bill gives patients new power to see 
specialists, get emergency room care and take denials of care to an 
outside panel of experts. 
</P>
<P>
	Most controversially, it allows patients to sue HMOs in federal  
or state court and to collect whatever damages a jury might award. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to stop this bill, GOP leaders were trying to build  
support for an alternative by Reps. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and John 
Shadegg, R-Ariz. It would allow lawsuits only in federal courts and 
limit damages for pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also planned to vote on a fourth choice, backed by  
Reps. Amo Houghton Jr., R-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. It was 
quite similar to the Coburn-Shadegg bill, but offered in hopes of 
attracting more Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders saw the Coburn-Shadegg bill as their best hope of  
stopping the more sweeping Democratic measure, and they were 
appealing to interest groups to go easy on Republicans who vote 
``yes'' on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would rather we not vocally oppose it. After all, we  
share the same objective,'' said Neil Trautwein, a lobbyist for the 
National Association of Manufacturers, which opposes all new 
federal health mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into this week's debate, Democrats appeared to have the  
votes they needed to pass their HMO bill. But they said Wednesday 
that they may lose the votes of some conservative Democrats because 
there was no way to pay for the HMO bill, estimated to cost the 
federal government some $7 billion in lost tax revenue over 10 
years. The bill, if it became law, likely would mean higher 
insurance premiums, which means businesses would be able to take 
higher tax deductions on their insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP strategy has been to focus attention on the uninsured,  
as Republicans argue that new rights will drive up the cost of 
insurance and force employers to drop coverage. Hammering the point 
Wednesday, Republicans pushed through a bill, 227-205, aimed at 
reducing the ranks of the uninsured, which now stand at 44 million.

<HEADLINE> Europe Bank Leaves Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Central Bank left its key  
interest rates unchanged following its regular meeting Thursday, 
despite speculation that an increase is coming. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank left its main refinancing rate at 2.5 percent, where it  
has been since a 0.5 percent cut in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank president Wim Duisenberg indicated then that the reduction  
would be the only change for the year. But after bank officials 
last week signaled they were starting to worry about the risk of 
inflation, many economists said chances were good the bank's 
governing council would raise rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuela Preuschl, an economist with Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt,  
said she believed an increase to 3 percent was possible later in 
October or November. 
</P>
<P>
	``A rate rise is really only a question of timing,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The bank also confirmed Thursday that its overnight deposit rate  
will remain at 1.5 percent and its marginal lending rate will 
continue to be 3.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates apply mainly to loans involving large financial  
institutions but changes in those rates can trigger changes in 
commercial and consumer lending rates.

<HEADLINE> Jesse Ventura Visits Harvard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- It was ``The Body'' and the minds.  
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura visited Harvard University on  
Wednesday, spending time with faculty members, dropping in on 
football practice and talking politics over pizza with about 70 
undergraduates. 
</P>
<P>
	He found himself defending comments made to Playboy magazine, an  
interview in which the former professional wrestler called religion 
a ``crutch for the weak-minded'' and said fat people are overweight 
because they ``can't push away from the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, who later signed copies of the magazine, told students  
he doesn't worry about being politically incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not afraid to speak my mind,'' he said. ``If I don't get  
re-elected that's fine. I'll go back to the private sector from 
whence I came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, who himself only briefly attended North Hennepin  
Community College, said he was flattered by the invitation to speak 
at Harvard by an student advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you had asked me at any point in my life if I'd be at  
Harvard talking politics I would have laughed at you,'' Ventura 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students said they found his openness refreshing.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was admirable that he could speak his mind freely  
without worrying what people think,'' said 18-year-old Brandon 
Fail. 
</P>
<P>
	While that candor has won Ventura fans, it has also ruffled  
feathers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura came under more fire Wednesday for telling Playboy that  
he didn't read books by Ernest Hemingway because the writer killed 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen too many people fight for their lives. I have no  
respect for anyone who would kill himself,'' he said. ``If you're a 
feeble, weak-minded person to begin with, I don't have time for 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota state Sen. Bob Lessard, whose daughter killed herself  
last month, said he was ``astounded and stunned'' and hoped Ventura 
would reconsider his remarks. ``I know my daughter wasn't 
weak-minded,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Harvard, Ventura said that he doesn't have sympathy for those  
who kill themselves and said ``if you're at the point of committing 
suicide it can only get better because you are the lowest you can 
possibly be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he offered a few words to Lessard: ``Losing a child is the  
hardest possible thing a family can endure,'' Ventura said. ``Terry 
(his wife) and I offer our deepest sympathies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura also dismissed results of a poll by the Star Tribune of  
Minneapolis following the Playboy interview showing that his 
approval rating has dropped from 73 percent in July to 54 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I believed in polls I wouldn't be the governor of  
Minnesota,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura also participated in a live town meeting with CNBC's  
Chris Matthews, in which he defended the right to bear arms and 
supported the theory that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone in 
the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura was scheduled to head today to New York, where he will  
appear on CBS's ``Late Show with David Letterman'' and tape an 
interview with ABC's Barbara Walters.

<HEADLINE> DuPont To Acquire CombiChem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Chemical maker DuPont Co. is paying $95 million  
in cash to acquire CombiChem, which creates computer models 
designed to predict whether an experimental drug will work. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont will add the company to its pharmaceutical division,  
keeping the smaller firm's main operations in San Diego and its 
software programmers in Palo Alto, Vince Anido, the chief executive 
of CombiChem, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be some layoffs as a result of the acquisition among  
the 93 employees of CombiChem, which was founded in 1994 in San 
Diego, but Anido did not specify how many. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller firm had been exploring merger possibility with  
several companies. 
</P>
<P>
	CombiChem uses a process it calls computational drug discovery  
to help lab researchers predict the outcome of chemical reactions, 
which can save time and money in the pharmaceutical development 
process.

<HEADLINE> Dow Industrials Close Down 51.29 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mostly lower today as investors  
took some profits from Wednesday's hefty jump in prices and looked 
nervously toward the government's employment report tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading, Dow Jones industrial average was down  
51.29 at 10,537.05. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index falling and the Nasdaq composite index closing modestly 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was off 7.76 at 1,317.64, and the  
Nasdaq composite index rose 3.52 to 2,860.73. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of about 3 to  
2 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,714 down, 1,244 up and 574 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 801.69 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
888.83 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.64 to 4281.12  
</P>
<P>
	``Taking profits is part of the story today after a big runup on  
Wednesday and the other part is waiting for tomorrow to see what 
September's employment numbers look like,'' said Hugh Johnson, 
chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow climbed 187.75 to 10,588.34 on Wednesday as investors  
temporarily set aside worries about rising interest rates and 
focused on corporate earnings. But with the market's volatile 
performance over the month amid nervousness over interest rates, 
many investors decided to take a prudent approach today and collect 
profits before the September employment report from the Labor 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The market -- and the Federal Reserve -- will be scrutinizing the  
report to see if there are signs of inflation that could prompt the 
Fed to push rates higher at its next policy meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if the jobs creation and wage figures contained in the  
report signal that inflation is indeed under control, analysts 
expect a continuation of the volatility that Wall Street has seen 
over the past few weeks. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more 
than 1,100 points from an all-time closing high of 11,326.04 on 
Aug. 25 before recovering ground in recent sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wachtel, a market analyst for Prudential Securities, said  
upcoming third-quarter earnings reports, which traders have been 
optimistically awaiting, will help some stock sectors, but not the 
overall market. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of the averages, you're not going to get a clear-cut  
bull market going,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the technology-dominated Nasdaq index gave up early  
gains, some high-profile Internet stocks were higher, most notably 
Yahoo!, which soared after the Internet search company reported 
quarterly earnings results late Wednesday that were stronger than 
analysts expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Internet stocks have turned a corner,'' Johnson said.  
``But I've said that before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, reflecting more nerves about interest rates,  
were mostly lower, including Chase Manhattan and Bank of America.

<HEADLINE> Grupo Mexico Ups Offer for Asarco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Just as it appeared that Phelps Dodge Corp. had  
successfully negotiated a deal to combine three of the nation's 
biggest copper producers, Grupo Mexico has upped its offer for the 
smallest of the trio, Asarco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Asarco agreed late Tuesday to be acquired by Phelps Dodge for  
about $1.1 billion in cash and stock, rejecting an earlier bid from 
Grupo Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge had previously struck a deal to buy Cyprus Amax  
Minerals Co. for $1.8 billion, making the three-way deal worth $2.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Asarco portion of the deal was threatened Thursday with  
another offer from Grupo Mexico, which has a 10 percent stake in 
New York-based Asarco. Grupo Mexico offered $29.50 per share in 
cash, or $1.17 billion, for Asarco, besting the Phelps Dodge offer 
by more than 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phelps Dodge bid values Asarco at $28.43 a share based on  
Phelps Dodge's closing price Thursday of $54.43 3/4, up $1.43 3/4, on the 
New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Asarco closed up $1.75 at 
$30.75, also on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our revised offer presents a compelling opportunity for Asarco  
and its shareholders to improve upon your existing transaction with 
Phelps Dodge,'' Grupo Mexico officials said in a letter to members 
of the Asarco board. 
</P>
<P>
	Clay Allen, a Phelps Dodge spokesman, said the company was  
unable to comment on the Grupo Mexico offer. Asarco officials did 
not immediately return a call placed after business hours Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The copper industry, which has recently been plagued by rock  
bottom prices, has announced numerous layoffs and the closure of 
several operations this year. The summer was marked by a series of 
merger deals and offers as the industry seeks to consolidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Phelps Dodge officials have said the three-way merger with  
Asarco and Englewood, Colo.-based Cyprus Amax would save $200 
million a year.

<HEADLINE> Accused Killer Mom 911 Tapes Heard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- A woman accused of suffocating her three  
young children asked if she could kiss them goodbye before she was 
taken from their home to a hospital, a paramedic testified during a 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Lemak's request was denied, Naperville Fire Department  
paramedic Phillip DeMik said Wednesday at an evidence hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers want Lemak's statements, made to police less  
than an hour after she arrived at the hospital, barred on grounds 
the drugged, injured woman was in no state to give a voluntary or 
intelligent waiver of her rights to remain silent or consult an 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question here is the reliability of the statements she  
gave,'' defense lawyer Jack Donahue argued. ``These statements were 
the product of a delusional thought process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have charged Lemak with first-degree murder, saying  
she admitted killing her children. They have not decided whether to 
seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	They played Lemak's 911 call and presented the paramedic's  
testimony Wednesday to bolster their claims Lemak was upset but 
mentally competent immediately after the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence will show the defendant wanted to confess,''  
prosecutor Joseph Birkett said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 911 call, Lemak sobs intermittently as she tells the  
dispatcher: ``My three kids are dead and I want to be dead too, and 
it didn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the dispatcher asks her why it happened, Lemak responds:  
``My husband didn't want us anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David and Marilyn Lemak were in the midst of a divorce, and he  
had recently moved out of the family's home in the southwest 
Chicago suburb of Naperville. 
</P>
<P>
	DeMik described finding Lemak, 42, still on the telephone with a  
911 dispatcher when rescuers arrived on the scene March 5. She was 
sprawled on her bedroom floor in her underwear, dried blood on her 
forearm from apparently self-inflicted slash wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of 6-year-old Emily was found in Lemak's bed; the  
bodies of 7-year-old Nicholas and 3-year-old Thomas were in their 
own bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Detective Michael Cross said Lemak blurted, ``I did it,''  
right after he introduced himself at the hospital. She went on to 
calmly describe how she drugged the children with a tranquilizer 
and suffocated them as they slept, then took drugs and slashed her 
own arm, Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing is to continue Oct. 26.

<HEADLINE> $4.83B Fen-Phen Drug Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- American Home Products Corp.'s $4.83 billion  
settlement to resolve claims that its half of the fen-phen diet 
drug combination caused heart problems relieved investors who 
feared it would be worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people on Wall Street were throwing around $10 billion or  
$15 billion as recently as a month ago,'' said Alex Zisson, an 
analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. 
</P>
<P>
	But the success of the settlement of one of the largest product  
liability cases in history hinges on the agreement of a substantial 
number of the roughly 6 million people who used the diet drugs. 
American Home can opt out of the settlement if enough people refuse 
to participate, and there were already some dissenters on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a bunch of garbage,'' said Kip Petroff, a Dallas  
lawyer who won a $23.3 million award in a fen-phen case earlier 
this year and advised 150 of his other clients not to settle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's way too little money. The people under that settlement  
would get just a small fraction of what they could get in court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another plaintiff's attorney said money was not the issue. ``We  
wanted to seek a solution to a health problem,'' Philadelphia 
attorney Gene Locks said. 
</P>
<P>
	If a judge approves the deal, people with heart valve problems  
blamed on fen-phen will get as much as $1.5 million each. Healthy 
former users will be able to get such benefits as $30 prescription 
refunds and free checkups. The settlement covers all people who 
took the drug, whether they sued or not. 
</P>
<P>
	Payments will begin this year and continue for about 16 years.  
With interest earned, the total amount paid could rise to $4.83 
billion, easily surpassing such other large product-liability 
settlements as Dow Corning's $3.2 billion payment to women with 
silicone breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
	Juanita Spear, who took the diet pills for five months in 1997  
and suffered heart valve damage, said the settlement will be easier 
than going to court herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still feel as if they should never have put the drug out  
there,'' said Spear, 50, of Anchorage, Alaska. ``No matter what the 
amount is, it doesn't change the fact that I don't have the energy 
that I once did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Home, based in Madison, N.J., made fenfluramine, the  
``fen'' in the fen-phen combination, and gave the drug a brand name 
of Pondimin. It also made Redux, a chemical cousin which is covered 
in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors began prescribing fenfluramine in the mid-1990s for  
weight loss along with phentermine, which was never associated with 
health problems and is still sold. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  
successfully pushed American Home to withdraw Redux and Pondimin 
from the market after a Mayo Clinic study linked fen-phen to 
potentially fatal heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement ``offers peace of mind to those who used the  
drugs and permits the company to move beyond the uncertainty and 
distractions of litigation,'' said John R. Stafford, American 
Home's chairman, chief executive and president. 
</P>
<P>
	Stafford reiterated the company's position that the drugs were  
safe for most people and said the company broke no laws and acted 
responsibly. The FBI is reportedly probing whether the company 
revealed all it knew about dangers of the Redux prior to its 
government approval in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The fen-phen controversy, which has spurred 6,500 lawsuits, has  
sent American Home stock plunging 40 percent since April. 
</P>
<P>
	The national settlement covers all illness claims except for  
patients who say they suffer from primary pulmonary hypertension, a 
rare but serious lung disorder. The company said it decided to deal 
with these cases separately because they are few in number. It also 
noted that fen-phen's label included a warning that the drug could 
cause the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement includes about $2.32 billion to pay for injuries,  
$1 billion for medical monitoring and drug refunds, and $429 
million in plaintiffs' attorney fees. The company has also agreed 
to pay $25 million for heart disease research. 
</P>
<P>
	Payments to be made during the next two years are anticipated to  
total $1.85 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the settlement would cause it to record  
expenses of about $3.29 billion, after taxes and insurance 
coverage. American Home took in about $13 billion in revenue last 
year and earned $2.5 billion in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The only fen-phen case to yield a jury verdict was that of  
Debbie Lovett, 36, of Grand Saline, Texas, who won a $23.3 million 
award against American Home in July. She later settled the case for 
less than 10 percent of that amount, the company has said. 
</P>
<P>
	A civil trial had been under way in New Jersey over whether the  
company should pay to medically monitor 94,000 state residents who 
were still healthy. A judge dismissed the jury in the case earlier 
this week as the settlement appeared near. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Eds: American Home has set up a toll-free telephone number  
(800-386-2070) to provide information on the settlement.

<HEADLINE> Season Unravels Quickly for Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The preseason predictions about the Boston Red  
Sox are coming true in the postseason: They're not going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	At least, it seems, not back to Cleveland.  
</P>
<P>
	That's where a fifth game of the best-of-5 division series with  
the Indians would take place Monday night. First, a Boston team 
down 2-0 has to reverse the momentum at Fenway Park on Saturday and 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure everybody in this room is pretty frustrated with the  
way we played,'' Boston reliever Tim Wakefield said after 
Thursday's 11-1 loss to the Indians. ``We have to play each game 
like it's our last, which it could be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In less than 24 hours, the team few picked to reach the playoffs  
but made it with a 94-68 record is one game from elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Blame it on weak hitting, poor fielding and wild pitching as  
well as powerful batting by a Cleveland team that is one of seven 
in major league history to score 1,000 runs in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a pretty good team across the hall there,'' Boston  
first baseman Mike Stanley said from his corner locker. ``We knew 
what we faced coming in here. They've obviously met the 
expectations of what they've done all year. We start ours on 
Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Boston turns to Martinez to save the season -- Ramon, not his  
brother Pedro. Ramon Martinez, who started just four games this 
year, is scheduled to pitch Saturday's third game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd take my chances any day of the week with Ramon,'' said  
Bret Saberhagen, whose uncharacteristic wildness began Boston's 
downfall Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon Martinez as savior is an unlikely role. On Sept. 2, he  
made his first start in nearly 15 months. He finished the season 
with only four appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	His central role is just the latest twist to Boston's strange  
season that has defied expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of Mo Vaughn to free agency and a lack of stars beyond  
Pedro Martinez and Nomar Garciaparra convinced many that Boston was 
a longshot, at best, for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Red Sox won a wild-card berth, Garciaparra led the AL  
with a .357 batting average, Pedro Martinez was baseball's best 
pitcher and Saberhagen walked 11 batters in 119 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Garciaparra went 0-for-3 without getting a ball out  
of the infield, while Saberhagen walked three batters in the third 
inning alone -- when Cleveland scored six runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Martinez, the ace the Red Sox needed to come through, left  
Wednesday night's opening 3-2 loss after four innings with a 
sprained muscle below his right shoulder blade. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a tremendous blow for our ballclub because we kind of  
feed off him,'' outfielder Darren Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	After he left, third baseman John Valentin's throwing error with  
two outs in the sixth preceded Jim Thome's homer. On Thursday, Jose 
Offerman's high throw on a potential double-play relay was a major 
factor in the Cleveland third. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing not the way we did to win 94 games,'' Boston  
reliever Derek Lowe said. ``Any time you give this team even one 
extra out, if it's a defensive play or an extra walk, it 
snowballs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston scored just three runs in the two games. Cleveland had  
more than that in each of the third and fourth innings Thursday 
when the Red Sox issued nine walks, an AL division series record. 
They led the majors with fewest walks per game, 2.9. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Stanley said, ``we're not going to sit here and think  
negatively about how we've played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing has gone according to form.  
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox entered the series at 1-16 in postseason games  
starting with Game 6 of the 1986 World Series when Bill Buckner 
made his infamous error against the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	That's 1-18 now.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to win a World Series, you're going to have  
adversity along the way,'' Lowe said, ``and this is our big 
mountain to climb.''

<HEADLINE> Computer Warfare Used in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The U.S. military conducted a form of  
computer warfare against Yugoslavia as part of NATO's air war last 
spring, the military's top officer acknowledged for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  
Staff, made the remark during an interview Thursday in which he 
discussed the Pentagon's decision to assign U.S. Space Command the 
responsibility of coordinating both the defense of military 
computer networks and attacks on enemy networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked broadly if U.S. information ``weapons'' were used against  
Yugoslavia during the Kosovo campaign, Shelton replied, ``You can 
assume that we in fact employed some of our systems, yes.'' He said 
the ``systems'' were offensive in nature, but he would not be more 
specific about how they were used. 
</P>
<P>
	A defense official said later that Shelton was referring to a  
broad range of ``information operations'' involving computers that 
may have included cyber-attacks on Yugoslavia's air defense 
network. Shelton would not specify the target of the U.S. computer 
attacks and did not discuss the results. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would rather not be specific about how we used it, to be  
frank,'' he said. ``I don't want to divulge too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has been pursuing research on offensive uses of  
computer viruses and other means of cyber-warfare for at least 
several years. Shelton said Space Command would coordinate the 
development of such techniques, starting next year, in addition to 
working on U.S. defenses against such attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton spoke to reporters traveling with him and Defense  
Secretary William Cohen aboard an Air Force jet from Norfolk, where 
they attended a ceremony to mark the renaming of U.S. Atlantic 
Command to U.S. Joint Forces Command. The change is part of a 
broader revision of the Unified Command Plan that includes the 
assigning of computer network defensive and attacks 
responsibilities to Space Command. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference after the ceremony, Shelton said the  
Pentagon is concerned about the vulnerability of military computers 
to intrusions not only by private hackers but also by enemies in 
times of war. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any question, as we look to the future,  
that our information systems throughout America and specifically 
within the Defense Department will be more and more subject to 
attack,'' Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Space Command, headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base in  
Colorado Springs, Colo., was given the responsibility to develop 
defenses against attacks on military computer networks as of Oct. 
1. One year later, it will take on the added task of coordinating 
the development of offensive ``weapons'' for cyber-warfare, several 
defense officials said. The individual services are doing that work 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Space Command's main mission is to provide missile warning and  
space surveillance as part of the air and space defense of the 
United States and Canada. It also plans for strategic ballistic 
missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Norfolk ceremony, Cohen said that the newly named Joint  
Forces Command, commanded by Navy Adm. Harold Gehman Jr., has been 
given the added responsibility of coordinating U.S. military 
support to civilian agencies in the event of an attack on American 
territory with nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen stressed that the Joint Forces Command would be in a  
support role in such an event, leaving a civilian agency such as 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Justice Department 
to take the lead. Even so, some civil liberties groups contend that 
involving the military is a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are supposed to believe that turning our military into a  
national police force will somehow strengthen our democracy?'' 
American Civil Liberties Union official Gregory T. Nojeim asked 
rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
	Gehman said the military should be used to help respond to major  
disasters, as it does now in the case of hurricanes, floods and 
other natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should think the taxpayers would be upset if they thought  
that we weren't preparing to help out the citizens in the case of a 
catastrophic event,'' Gehman said.

<HEADLINE> It's Put Up or Shut Up for Rams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sunday can be payback time a decade removed for San Francisco,  
even if Steve Young and Jerry Rice are the only 49ers who remember 
what the payback is for. 
</P>
<P>
	The Niners, with Young a maybe because of his latest concussion,  
arrive in St. Louis with a 17-game winning streak over the Rams, 
who last beat them 28-17 on Nov. 25, 1990. That was the first loss 
after 10 wins for San Francisco that season. 
</P>
<P>
	So this year the Niners can not only run their winning streak  
over the Rams to 18, but end St. Louis' unbeaten run, albeit a 
modest 3-0 against three of the NFL's lesser teams: the Ravens, 
Falcons and Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no line on this game because of Young's injury. He was  
cleared to practice by his neurologist earlier this week, although 
Steve Mariucci may not decide until gametime whether Young or Jeff 
Garcia starts. Garcia, a former Canadian Leaguer making his first 
start, was the quarterback as San Francisco beat Tennessee 24-22 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	But the line might be less important than three videotapes of  
the games in which former Arena Leaguer Kurt Warner has thrown nine 
touchdown passes and run up an outlandish 125 rating. Most 
defensive coaches believe that once they have three tapes on a 
young quarterback, they can find his weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
	There's another ``three'' that comes into play: average teams  
that start 3-0 rarely win the fourth.

<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Raptors gave general manager Glen  
Grunwald a four-year contract extension Thursday that will run 
through the 2003-04 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago lawyer has orchestrated the Raptors' rise from a  
lowly expansion team to aspiring playoff contender.

	Both Grunwald and coach Butch Carter were entering the final  
year of their contracts. The Raptors are expected to announce a 
contract extension for Carter shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunwald has been with the team since 1994, a year before the  
team played its first NBA game. He was brought into the 
organization by Isiah Thomas, the Raptors' former GM and part 
owner. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pneumonia, Flu Shots Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Too few adults get flu shots or a vital  
vaccination against bacterial pneumonia, say health officials who 
warn that both diseases kill tens of thousands of Americans 
annually -- a growing but preventable menace if only people were 
immunized. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't wait for your doctor to recommend vaccination -- be  
proactive and ask for the shots,'' Dr. Walter Orenstein, vaccine 
chief for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, advised 
Thursday. ``It's your health and your life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vaccines against both flu and pneumonia are free for Medicare  
patients -- those most at risk -- yet one-third of such patients 
don't get regular flu shots, and 55 percent have never had a 
pneumonia vaccine, concluded a government study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the shots also are vital for certain younger people, said  
Dr. Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic, recalling how he had to 
amputate the hands and legs of a young mother to save her from a 
pneumococcal infection that had spread into her blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``An epidemic of apathy and ignorance'' about the need for  
vaccination ``fuels an epidemic of disease and death,'' Poland 
said. ``This is a public health emergency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the diseases seem to be a growing menace.  
</P>
<P>
	Influenza in an average year kills 20,000 Americans. The  
government has not yet finished analyzing last winter's cases, but 
preliminary data suggest the flu killed many more people last year, 
said CDC's Dr. Keiji Fukuda. 
</P>
<P>
	Of additional concern, influenza has started causing unusual  
outbreaks during the summer, he said. Up to 40,000 people, mostly 
tourists, from 47 countries were sickened by a flu outbreak in 
Alaska in summer 1998, and a similar outbreak occurred this year. 
The CDC also spotted summer outbreaks in Louisiana, Florida, 
Oklahoma and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, flu is always worse in the winter. People need a flu shot  
annually because different influenza virus strains circle the globe 
each year. The optimal vaccination time is between now and 
mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way to predict'' how bad flu will be this winter,  
Fukuda stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials estimate that one in 10 Americans could suffer  
needlessly if vaccination rates don't improve. 
</P>
<P>
	A flu shot isn't the only protection: Too many patients, and  
even doctors, do not know that a vaccine against pneumococcal 
infection is vital, too, said Surgeon General David Satcher. Unlike 
flu shots, most Americans need just one dose of pneumococcal 
vaccine for lifetime protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Pneumococcal bacteria cause half a million cases of pneumonia  
each year, plus infections in the brain, ear and other organs. Some 
40,000 Americans a year die. 
</P>
<P>
	If those numbers aren't convincing, Poland says another reason  
for vaccination is that pneumococci are rapidly evolving to defy 
antibiotic treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to popular belief, younger people often need the  
vaccine, Poland said, describing that young mother whose limbs he 
had to amputate after her respiratory infection spread into her 
bloodstream and caused gangrene. 
</P>
<P>
	She should have been vaccinated, because her spleen had been  
removed several years earlier because of an accident -- and removing 
the spleen weakens the immune system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flu and pneumococcal vaccination is highly recommended for:  
</P>
<P>
	--Everyone over 64. (One physician group recommends flu vaccine  
starting at age 50, something the CDC is investigating.) 
</P>
<P>
	--Younger people who have chronic heart or lung disorders,  
including asthma, or who have diabetes, kidney disease or a 
weakened immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	--Anyone in close contact with those high-risk patients,  
including family members and health care workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Flu vaccine also is recommended for women who will be in the  
second or third trimester of pregnancy during flu season. 
</P>
<P>
	Even healthy young people without those risks can benefit: One  
recent study found people who got a flu shot lost 43 percent fewer 
days of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Why don't people get vaccinated? The new Medicare study found 57  
percent of the unvaccinated said they didn't know they needed the 
pneumonia shot and 19 percent didn't know they needed the flu shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Too often, doctors don't recommend the vaccinations, public  
health officials complained -- and doctors often refuse to give flu 
shots after mid-November. Later shots can still be helpful, Fukuda 
said.

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The leading presidential candidates have  
agreed to participate in a series of debates sponsored by The Des 
Moines Register in the weeks before the Iowa caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats Bill Bradley and Al Gore will debate Jan. 8, their  
aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	With the exception of Pat Buchanan, the Republican contenders  
have agreed to participate in a Jan. 15 debate. They include 
front-runner George W. Bush, Gary Bauer, Elizabeth Dole, Steve 
Forbes, Orrin Hatch, Alan Keyes and John McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who is considering leaving the GOP for the Reform  
Party, was invited to participate but has not yet responded, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both debates will be held at 1 p.m. at Iowa Public Television  
studios. IPTV will air the events statewide. C-SPAN will televise 
the debates nationally.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Campaign for Working Families, the  
political action committee run by Gary Bauer before he left to seek 
the Republican presidential nomination, has agreed to pay $12,000 
to the Federal Election Commission for violating election laws in 
connection with two 1998 congressional primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer was the head of the organization at the time. The FEC  
announced the penalty Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Campaign for Working Families spent tens of thousands of  
dollars on direct mail and radio commercials in support of two 
Republican congressional candidates, Peter Roskam in Illinois and 
Perry Atkinson in Oregon, but failed to disclose its spending 
within 24 hours, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Roskam and Atkinson lost their respective primaries.  
</P>
<P>
	``The mistakes were ones of timely filing but there was no  
intent to hide our participation,'' said Bauer's campaign manager, 
Frank Cannon, who was treasurer of the Campaign for Working 
Families when the violations occurred. ``In fact, from the moment 
we entered the races, we were talking about our participation in 
the press. It was a technical violation in terms of timing.''

	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Gov. Jeanne Shaheen and legislative leaders  
said Thursday they would back Secretary of State Bill Gardner's 
decision to hold the state's first-in-the-nation presidential 
primaries Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa officials, who had already set their caucuses for Jan. 31,  
have brought considerable pressure on New Hampshire officials to 
move the date back to Feb. 8 and maintain the traditional eight-day 
window between the nation's first caucuses and firm primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaheen, key lawmakers and officials from both major parties met  
behind closed doors Wednesday to talk about passing a law to 
override Gardner's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	However, on Thursday they said they did not have enough support  
from rank-and-file legislators for such a move. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be working together with Iowa, as we have in the  
past, to protect the status and relevance of the 
first-in-the-nation caucus and the first-in-the-nation primary,'' 
Shaheen said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, under New Hampshire law, Secretary Gardner has the  
authority to set the date of the primary. Secretary Gardner's 
decision will stand, and we must now focus our efforts on 
protecting our primary,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service has settled a federal  
lawsuit filed by a woman who said her boss tried to get her two 
daughters to become his mistresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Latone filed suit against Sandy Springs-based UPS, two  
subsidiaries and former UPS Logistics president and CEO Ray 
Thurston last year, claiming he made sexually offensive, 
intimidating and hostile comments about Latone's two daughters, 
both of whom were in their 20s. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit said he proposed that the women be his ``mistress'' in  
exchange for gifts, cash payments and the use of Thurston's jet, 
and that he invited them to live in one of his condominiums at his 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the settlement are confidential, Ms. Latone's lawyer,  
Stephen Land, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS spokesman Norman Black confirmed that the case had been  
settled but had no comment. When Latone filed a complaint last year 
before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, UPS denied 
Latone's complaints.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rejecting Treaty Vote Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton pressed his case for a  
nuclear test-ban treaty today, invoking a ``moral responsibility 
for future generations'' even as supporters conceded there seemed 
little chance to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton asserted the treaty ``gives us tools to strengthen our  
security'' and ``to throw away these tools will ensure more testing 
and more development of more sophisticated and more dangerous 
nuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke before leaving for New York City for a  
fund-raising event for Democratic Senate candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a moral responsibility for future generations,'' he  
said. ``Future generations won't forgive us if we fail that 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told the Senate  
Armed Services Committee rejection of the 154-nation Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty ``would announce that the United States refuses to 
lead on this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration appeared to be making little headway in  
picking up support for the treaty, now scheduled for a vote in the 
Senate on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though leaders of both parties continued to seek means of  
postponing the vote, a group of conservatives led by Sen. Jesse 
Helms, R-N.C., kept up pressure for proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has rejected their demand that Clinton put in  
writing any request to delay a vote on an international nuclear 
test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's disappointing when our political leaders in a  
transparent way put partisanship ahead of what is clearly in our 
national security interest,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservatives also want Clinton to promise -- in writing --  
not to seek to revive the treaty during the 2000 presidential 
election year, a condition the White House has also rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., served notice on  
Senate leaders that he planned to block any effort to postpone a 
vote, whether Clinton seeks it in writing or not. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has made the treaty a top priority ``and  
should live with the consequences,'' Inhofe said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his testimony to the Armed Services Committee, Richardson  
said testing is not needed to make sure the weapons will work. 
</P>
<P>
	The nuclear stockpile is ``safe, secure and reliable,'' the  
energy secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Democrats acknowledged there seemed to be little way  
either to win ratification of the treaty or persuade Republican 
leaders to postpone the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to kill it, I guess they can do it,'' Sen. Joseph  
Biden of Delaware, senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, told a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	With virtually no Republican support, the treaty appeared headed  
to defeat in the Senate. Its ratification requires 67 votes in the 
GOP-led chamber if all 100 senators vote. 
</P>
<P>
	That would represent a humiliating defeat for the  
administration, which has led an international campaign for the 
treaty -- and which had criticized Helms for bottling up the treaty 
for two years in his Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty would extend the present international ban on nuclear  
tests in the atmosphere to underground testing as well, resulting 
in a total ban on all nuclear explosions, no matter how small. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 154 nations have signed the treaty, although it has been  
ratified by only 48. Of the major nuclear powers, only Britain and 
France have ratified the pact. 
</P>
<P>
	Many prominent Republicans -- including GOP presidential hopeful  
George W. Bush and the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, 
Sen. John Warner of Virginia -- say the treaty is not verifiable and 
would not stop the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran. 
Further, they argue it would harm efforts to maintain the safety 
and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only were Democrats pressing for a delay in the face of a  
probable defeat, but many influential Senate Republicans were also 
suggesting the showdown be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of both parties expressed fear that an outright  
rejection of the treaty would draw international scorn on the 
United States and increase pressure for a resumption of nuclear 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms' objection to a delay is significant, because under Senate  
rules the only way that next week's vote can be called off is 
through unanimous consent of all senators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to vote,'' Helms said, predicting that the treaty  
would be soundly rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats balked at Helms' terms -- particularly on his demand  
not to press for action on the treaty next year -- but Helms 
countered that Democrats ``are trying to dictate the terms of their 
own surrender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans joined Helms in demanding Clinton seek the  
delay in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He must share with the Senate leadership the burden of not  
going forward,'' said Warner. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said he still hoped  
a deal could be brokered with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., to avoid a floor showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that there is a desire on the part of many not to have  
a vote,'' Daschle told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the absence of a deal, both sides were preparing to begin  
the debate Friday.

<HEADLINE> Intuit Buys Online Mortgage Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Intuit Inc. will acquire Michigan-based  
Rock Financial Corp., a provider of online consumer mortgages, in a 
stock deal valued at about $370 million, the companies announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Rock Financial, which provides mortgages  
through RockLoans.com, would allow Intuit to offer home mortgages 
to consumers in all 50 states via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit leaders said combining RockLoans.com with Intuit's  
QuickenMortgage online mortgage service will combine the speed and 
efficiency of online lending with an experienced mortgage team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The acquisition of Rock Financial advances Intuit's Web  
strategy by giving us the mortgage expertise, technology and 
marketing resources to truly revolutionize the mortgage process,'' 
said Bill Campbell, chairman and acting CEO of Intuit. 
</P>
<P>
	David Schehr of GartnerGroup Financial Services in Durham, N.C.,  
described the deal as ``just another brick in the wall'' for the 
online mortgage industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Online banking, brokerages and loans are still relatively  
narrow product offerings,'' he said. ``Only 10 percent of 
households are doing online banking, fewer are doing brokerage. 
It's still not the preferred method for most people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schehr said online mortgage services are like online car  
dealers: Many people use the sites simply gain information and 
negotiate a better deal offline. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. announced it will offer home  
equity loans over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sources of similar online information include LendingTree,  
a North Carolina-based Internet venture that allows consumers to 
browse for the best deals on mortgages, auto loans and credit 
cards. Other players include E-Loan, GetSmart, Microsoft's 
HomeAdvisor and iOwn. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's deal would give Intuit new features, including  
real-time credit checks and 24-hour loan updates. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit, which has 11 million Quicken customers, launched its  
QuickenMortgage site in November 1997. RockLoans.com began in 
January. Together, the two companies have originated nearly $3.5 
billion in closed mortgage loans in the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Intuit also agreed to spend $6 million to buy Title Source Inc.,  
which provides title insurance and escrow services.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Curbs Cellular Phone Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- BP Amoco is warning customers not to use  
cellular phones near gasoline pumps, out of concern that electronic 
impulses could start a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the risk is slight, the company doesn't want to take  
any chances, BP Amoco spokeswoman Linda McCray said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other oil companies have plans for similar warnings, and  
London-based BP Amoco has already put warning signs on gas pumps in 
the United Kingdom and Australia. The signs will be placed at BP 
and Amoco stations in the United States by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a ban -- this is a precautionary warning,'' Ms.  
McCray said. She said the warning does not apply to customers who 
are in their cars or in convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The signs have a picture of a cell phone enclosed in a red  
circle with a slash through it, resembling signs warning against 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Cell phone manufacturers have included warnings against such use  
in owner's manuals for years because they say that under certain 
conditions, cell phones could help generate sparks. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tom Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications  
Industry Association, said the warnings at gas stations are 
groundless. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence whatsoever that a wireless phone has ever  
caused ignition or explosion at a gas station anywhere in the 
world,'' Wheeler said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Kelley, a spokesman for the National Petroleum Institute,  
said that while the institute has heard reports of fires sparked by 
cell phones, none have been verified. ``But prudence is probably 
the best policy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman said Chevron will place warning decals on gas pumps  
later this year. Exxon recently started placing similar stickers on 
its pumps. 
</P>
<P>
	And the city of Cicero, Ill., outside Chicago, recently passed a  
law believed to be the first in the nation banning cell phone use 
at gas stations.

<HEADLINE> Judge Blocks a Type of Timber Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTON, Ill. (AP) -- In a decision that could affect logging  
nationwide, a federal judge has ordered the federal government to 
stop certain timber sales that were exempted from environmental 
impact reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second key courtroom ruling since August involving  
logging on the nation's forests. It was also a blow against the 
timber industry, which has seen logging on federal lands steadily 
drop over the past decade as steps to protect fish and wildlife 
habitat increase. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge J. Phil Gilbert's injunction, filed Sept. 28  
in a lawsuit brought by an environmental group called Heartwood and 
two of its Illinois members, affects timber sales under what is 
known as a ``categorical exclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exclusion is used frequently by the U.S. Forest Service to  
allow timber companies to log up to 250,000 board-feet of live 
timber or up to 1 million board-feet of dead timber without the 
agency first completing various environmental impact assessments. 
</P>
<P>
	The exclusion was designed to allow the Forest Service to skip  
costly assessments for projects that were not expected to have 
significant effects, such as removing debris from trails. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the agency -- over the objection of its own advisory  
task force -- changed the exclusion and increased the size of the 
allowable timber sales by up to a factor of 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists say the agency changed the exemption in an  
effort to avoid costly and time-consuming environmental studies and 
after losing numerous lawsuits over various forms of logging. 
</P>
<P>
	Judi Brawer, an attorney with American Wildlands in Bozeman,  
Mont., said the Forest Service has allowed timber sales under the 
rule in grizzly bear habitat and areas inhabited by endangered fish 
and birds, as well as in particularly fragile ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have found a number of egregious timber sales under this  
program,'' added Kim Davitt, also of American Wildlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Forest Service spokesman Pete Pierce said Wednesday that the  
agency has not tried to circumvent environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the agency Forest Service not decided how it will  
respond to the injunction but has stopped work in affected areas. 
He did not immediately know how many timber sales are affected by 
the injunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Gilbert said the Forest Service failed to explain its  
reasoning for the 1992 change. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing continued use of the exemption could pose ``possibly  
irreparable'' harm to the environment if further review shows sales 
should be much more limited, Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Donham, one of two Illinois environmentalists who filed the  
lawsuit, said the ruling could force the Forest Service to perform 
potentially lengthy environmental reviews on all land exempted 
under its policy since Sept. 16, 1998, the date the suit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
	In August, U.S. District Judge William Dwyer ruled in Seattle  
that the Forest Service had violated the Clinton administration's 
Northwest Forest Plan by failing to carry out plant and wildlife 
surveys prior to putting timber up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	After the ruling, the Forest Service put more than 400 million  
board feet of proposed sales on hold. An earlier injunction blocked 
sales totaling 100 million board feet -- enough to build 7,000 homes 
-- in national forests in Washington, Oregon and Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The landmark plan was adopted in 1994 to balance demand for  
timber from public lands against the need for habitat for dwindling 
populations of fish and wildlife. It reduced logging by 80 percent 
from levels during the 1980s, resulting in the loss of more than 
10,000 jobs in Oregon and Washington.

<HEADLINE> Inside Fund-Raising Microsoft Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- When your company puts on a United Way auction,  
the big-ticket items might be a round of golf with the boss, dinner 
for two prepared by the best in-house chef and tickets to a 
road-company performance of the latest Broadway hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Things are different at Microsoft.  
</P>
<P>
	For this year's Microsoft Giving Campaign, chairman Bill Gates --  
the world's richest man, worth about $90 billion at last count -- is 
again offering to serve as guide for a tour of his $53.4 million 
mansion on the shores of Lake Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's tour sold for $42,525. The bidding this year had  
gone over $15,000 by early this week, but there were still nearly 
four weeks to go. 
</P>
<P>
	The computerized silent auction -- employees only, sorry -- ends  
Oct. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	There are alternatives for those not moved by tours of  
40,000-square-foot megamansions. 
</P>
<P>
	How about ``the ultimate child's birthday party''? Certainly the  
ultimate high-tech child's birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
	Location: Microsoft's ``hardware room,'' where kids could check  
out cutting-edge hardware and games -- some not yet on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Extras: Decorations in the theme chosen by the bidder, plus  
food, drinks and cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	No kids?  
</P>
<P>
	There are numerous options in the adventure category -- a ride in  
a stunt plane, a tandem skydive, a ride in a hot-air balloon, 
whale-watching and whitewater rafting on the Olympic Peninsula's 
Skokomish River. 
</P>
<P>
	Other getaways are on the block, too -- a romantic weekend in a  
downtown hotel, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	For the not-so-romantic -- or perhaps for those trying to reach a  
man's heart by way of his stomach -- one group is offering a 
``weekend of barbecue and beer in Kansas City,'' complete with 
airfare, hotel room and rental car. 
</P>
<P>
	For the musically inclined, there's a Stratocaster guitar signed  
by all of the B-52s and an autographed boxed set of Dave Brubeck 
CDs. Art buffs can bid on a day with Microsoft's in-house art 
curator. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sales office in Charlotte, N.C., is offering a ride  
in a two-seat stock car driven by an instructor at the Richard 
Petty Driving School, with the winning bidder promised a 
``simulated Winston Cup qualifying run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly a free car wash, though Microsoft's chief legal  
counsel, Bill Neukom, was offering those to employees last week -- 
his way of supporting the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are some down-to-earth items listed on the in-house  
Web site -- a good bottle of wine, Sonics tickets, a round of golf 
with an executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's goal this year is $15 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The average corporate donation is $12,352, said United Way  
spokeswoman Christy Hicks in suburban Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's 1998 campaign raised $12.2 million, which -- combined  
with an impressive record of employee volunteerism and a policy of 
matching individual employee's donations up to $12,000 a year -- won 
it the United Way Spirit of America Award.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Spent $13M on Microsoft Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In its first public accounting of the money  
the government has spent prosecuting the Microsoft Corp., the 
Justice Department said its landmark antitrust trial and earlier 
legal actions against the software giant cost it $13.3 million over 
the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure includes about $7 million investigating and suing  
Microsoft in the trial pending before U.S. District Judge Thomas 
Penfield Jackson, described as among the most significant business 
lawsuits in decades. The first phase of a two-part verdict could 
come as early as this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts described the $7 million as paltry compared with the  
expense of other major antitrust cases, where costs easily can run 
$750,000 each month. Justice opened its current case in June 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's really rather modest for a case that has been as hard  
fought as this one has, with the caliber of lawyers and economists 
they've put on,'' said Tyler Baker, a Dallas antitrust lawyer who 
has been following the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc., for example, spent $20  
million over 10 months unsuccessfully fighting antitrust enforcers 
to allow its merger in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department last year asked the judge to force  
Microsoft to reimburse its legal costs, but the agency typically 
doesn't ask for attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they succeed on the merits ... it wouldn't be uncommon for  
the judge to order Microsoft to reimburse the costs,'' said Joe 
Sims, an antitrust lawyer in Washington and former senior Justice 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also acknowledged it's paid economists and other  
experts outside the government for advice on how to punish 
Microsoft if the company were to lose the case, but refused to 
identify them or their pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also revealed it has spent $194,140 for public  
relations, including $147,381 for publishing court documents and 
other information about the case on its Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's disclosures came in response to a written  
demand from U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton, a Republican from Microsoft's 
home state of Washington. The figures did not include amounts paid 
by the 19 states suing the company along with Justice; attorneys 
general in those states have denied requests for such information. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton has been a close ally of Microsoft in its current legal  
fight and earlier this year predicted the company might lose 
because he said Jackson is a ``second- or third-rate judge.'' The 
senator said he regretted the remark after his comments were 
published in newspapers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, the world's largest software company with $19.7  
billion in sales this year, hasn't disclosed its own legal fees and 
declined comment. But the company's financial records showed 
``general and administrative expenses,'' which include its lawyers' 
fees, were $689 million this year, up 59 percent from last year's 
costs of $433 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even imagine what Microsoft is spending,'' said George  
Cary, an antitrust lawyer in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also is involved in high-profile litigation against  
Sun Microsystems Inc. in California and against Caldera Inc. in 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	In its federal antitrust case, Microsoft is using both in-house  
lawyers and attorneys from New York-based Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell. In 
financial papers, Microsoft blamed its increases in administrative 
expenses partly on ``higher legal fees, litigation costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fees paid to Justice attorneys are significantly less. Lead  
lawyer David Boies, hired from private practice, initially agreed 
to half his $250 hourly rate, then agreed to a $104,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure (the government's bill) is a small fraction of what  
Microsoft paid its lawyers in that period,'' said Kevin Arquit, a 
New York antitrust lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're defending the antitrust equivalent of a capital  
murder case, you're not likely to be pinching pennies,'' Sims 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Zuck, director of the Association for Competitive  
Technology, a trade group that includes Microsoft, said the 
government's spending bodes ill for the nation's high-tech 
industry: ``If ... it's this cheap to do it, we could be awash in 
lawsuits and really grind the industry to a halt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government opposed Microsoft's merger with Intuit Inc. early  
in the 1990s and negotiated a consent decree with the software 
giant in a related antitrust lawsuit in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Fire Manager Ray Miller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles got rid of their fourth  
manager in six years, firing Ray Miller on Thursday as part of a 
shakeup that also cost general manager Frank Wren his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller took over the team in November 1997 after owner Peter  
Angelos forced the resignation of Davey Johnson, who twice took the 
Orioles to the AL championship series but lost both times. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Miller, the team's former pitching coach, the Orioles went  
79-83 in 1998, then slumped to 78-84 this year despite a $78.5 
million opening-day payroll, third-highest in baseball behind the 
New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	After firing Miller in mid-afternoon, the Orioles dumped Wren in  
the evening, citing several incidents in which he rubbed Angelos' 
management team the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles said Wren ordered the team flight to Anaheim to  
leave on time last month after Cal Ripken called to say he would 
arrive late. Ripken had to make his own arrangements, which began 
with a flight out of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Orioles management cannot and will not abide having a  
general manager operate in such an unreasonable, authoritarian 
manner and treat anyone in this way, especially someone such as Cal 
who has done so much for the Orioles and for baseball,'' said vice 
chairman and chief operating officer Joe Foss. 
</P>
<P>
	Wren declined comment, saying he was negotiating a settlement of  
his three-year contract. He replaced Pat Gillick last October. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 54, did not return phone calls Thursday. But during the  
final weekend of the regular season he cited poor pitching for the 
team's lack of success and said he was confident he made the 
correct moves in all but a half-dozen games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were six games that I slept very poorly on, and in three  
of those six I probably did the right thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos fired Johnny Oates after the 1994 season and hired  
former pitching coach Phil Regan, who lasted one year. Then came 
Johnson and finally Miller, whom Angelos thought would be the 
perfect fit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray Miller is a gentleman and a fine baseball man and I  
appreciate his efforts and the contributions he has made over the 
years to the Orioles organization,'' Angelos said in a statement. 
``My best wishes go out to him in his future endeavors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Miller, Angelos lauded Miller's contributions to  
the 1997 team. 
</P>
<P>
	But 1998 and 1999 were another story. The Orioles never  
recovered from a 4-14 start start and were 36-51 record at the 
All-Star break. A 13-game winning streak in September only served 
to help them finish fourth, ahead of last-place Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad for Ray,'' Orioles shortstop Mike Bordick said.  
``He obviously wasn't the one throwing the ball or hitting the 
ball. But we just didn't have the success we wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Milwaukee Brewers manager Phil Garner is considered to be  
the leading candidate to replace Miller. Garner was in the midst of 
his seventh straight losing season when he was fired by the Brewers 
in August, but he didn't have much talent to work with at the 
low-budget Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Trebelhorn, the Orioles' director of player development and  
former manager of the Brewers and Chicago Cubs, also is a 
possibility. So is former Oriole Don Baylor, who managed the 
Colorado Rockies from 1993-98 and Jim Riggleman, fired by the 
Chicago Cubs on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be interesting to see who they bring in,''  
Bordick said. ``Sometimes a change is good, and sometimes the grass 
isn't always greener on the other side of the fence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time that Miller failed to field a winner as  
a major league manager. He went 50-50 with the Minnesota Twins in 
the second half of the 1985 season and was fired in September 1986, 
with the team struggling at 59-70. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota, which was in the midst of a rebuilding program, then  
flourished under Tom Kelly and a staff comprised primarily of 
Miller's assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same thing will happen here if I get gone, because this  
club has tremendous direction right now,'' Miller said last 
weekend. ``Right now, for the first time, there's a little light 
shining through the door. You're very close to having something 
happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles had a club-record .279 batting average and set a  
franchise record with 1,572 hits, but Baltimore lost a 24 games 
when it scored six runs or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a good year, and things happen after you don't  
produce the way you're expected to,'' infielder Jeff Reboulet said. 
``It's tough to blame one person for everything going on, but the 
finger usually ends up pointing at the manager. It's part of the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's career record as a manager is 266-297. He has said he  
will not pursue another position in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of his contract, Miller will receive $100,000  
from the Orioles because they did not exercise the option to retain 
him.

<HEADLINE> Va. Lab Has Blast Tenderizing Meat / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENA VISTA, Va. (AP) -- Coming soon to your supermarket meat  
counter: a dynamite new way to tenderize cube steaks, pot roasts 
and brisket. 
</P>
<P>
	Hydrodyne Inc., a Puerto Rico-based research company, has  
discovered a way to immerse packaged, leathery cuts of meat into 
water, send a shock wave through it by detonating a small explosive 
charge and -- voila! -- melt-in-your-mouth meat. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the company is on the verge of signing a deal with a major  
meat processor that will bring this technology to market. 
</P>
<P>
	``This method will essentially make lower grade meats more  
valuable than they were before,'' Hydrodyne president Stanford 
Klapper said. ``The consumer will be able to pay a lower price for 
meat, but still get higher grade quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Klapper said, a low-quality steak that may cost  
$1.99 per pound in a supermarket today may cost $2.49 after it's 
been through the Hydrodyne process. But that cut of meat will be as 
tasty and tender as a $5.99 per pound strip steak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hydrodyne method -- tested in a Buena Vista lab -- works by  
lowering a metal basket filled with about 400 pounds of 
vacuum-packed meat into a sealed, water-filled vat anchored in 
concrete. Then, an explosive charge the size of an orange is 
detonated from above, sending supersonic shockwaves rebounding back 
and forth through the meat. The shockwaves tear certain fibers that 
bind muscle tissue, thus tenderizing the meat without changing its 
appearance or flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hydrodyne process requires no government approval because it  
does not penetrate the meat packaging or introduce any foreign 
substances into the meat, Klapper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new method will shave days, perhaps months off the time it  
takes to tenderize meat. 
</P>
<P>
	Hydrodyne's staff occasionally tests meat after it's blasted. A  
bottle of steak sauce sits in the fridge as an aid to the testers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good. I definitely can tell the difference,'' said staff  
member Ron Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Surplus meat is donated to the Natural Bridge Zoo for tiger  
food. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hydrodyne process was invented by John Long, 79, a retired  
nuclear weapons designer who holds several patents besides the one 
for Hydrodyne. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg Brown &AMP; Root, a subsidiary of Dallas-based Halliburton  
Co., has exclusive rights to design, build, operate and maintain 
Hydrodyne equipment in meat processing plants worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Long came up with the idea for using explosives to tenderize  
meat in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Morse Solomon, research leader of the USDA's meat science lab in  
Beltsville, Md., said the Hydrodyne process has the potential to 
revolutionize the meat industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maryland lab has a small prototype of the Hydrodyne system  
and has conducted its own tests through a research and development 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Hydrodyne officials say the process also works on pork chops,  
chicken and lamb. 
</P>
<P>
	But some people in the meat trade still need some convincing.  
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds exciting, but I'd have to see it to believe it,''  
said William O'Brien, whose family owns O'Brien Meats in Salem. ``I 
guess it's possible in this new age we're in now. My father was 
leery about cooking meat on an electric stove back in his day. I 
wonder what he'd think about microwaves and now this?''

<HEADLINE> Pittsburgh Welcomes 4-Team Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Steelers president Dan Rooney has  
long wanted the NFL to return to the days when only four teams 
played in a division. 
</P>
<P>
	With Houston coming back to the NFL as the league's 32nd team,  
Rooney is about to get his wish: eight divisions of four teams 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney has been assured by the NFL that the rival Cleveland  
Browns will remain in the Steelers' division, which probably will 
retain the name of AFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely needed to expand to 32 teams so we could get a  
better schedule,'' Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFC Central currently is the only division with six teams:  
Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Jacksonville, Baltimore and 
Tennessee. For years, the AFC Central was comprised of Pittsburgh, 
Cleveland, Houston and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the only division with six; everyone else has five,''  
Rooney said. ``That's incongruous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The owners still have not decided which teams will go into which  
divisions. Because Houston will play in the AFC, as the Oilers did 
before moving to Tennessee, one AFC team must move to the NFC. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney prefers that Cincinnati and Baltimore join the Steelers  
and Browns in the realigned AFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
	All have rivalries with each other; the Browns and Bengals have  
been in the Steelers' division since 1970, except for 1996-98, when 
Cleveland didn't have a team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens, as the former Browns, of course have a natural  
rivalry with Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney prefers each team to play six games in its division, four  
in its conference, four from one division in the other conference 
and, as a switch, two wild-card games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those two wild-card games can be an excellent thing,'' he  
said. ``You could have strong vs. strong games. It could be great 
TV matchups. We can do things that are different than what we 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rooney is glad Houston will remain in the AFC. In the late  
1970s, the Steelers and Oilers were rivals who met in the AFC 
championship game in consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have great fans,'' said Steelers offensive coordinator  
Kevin Gilbride, who once had the same job in Houston. ``The times I 
was there we sold out all the time. That old Astrodome used to 
rock. It was a great place to be. They love football. It very much 
reminds me of Pittsburgh.''

<HEADLINE> 'N Sync Mobbed at 'Secret' TV Shoot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Members of the boy band 'N Sync were  
mobbed while on a supposedly secret shoot for the TV show ``Touched 
by an Angel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Word wasn't supposed to get out that the band was making a quick  
cameo in Salt Lake City to tape an episode to air in November. But 
CBS executive Chris Ender said two disc jockeys at radio station 
KZHT told listeners the group was in town signing autographs and 
announced the set location. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a major inconvenience and definite cause for concern  
when more than 200 people show up unexpectedly on the set of a 
television show,'' Ender said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Sly, marketing manager at KZHT, denied the DJs revealed the  
location. 
</P>
<P>
	Band members did sign autographs for a while before leaving.

	House Approves HMO Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House today approved a sweeping bill  
backed by President Clinton that aims to give patients a stronger 
hand in dealing with their health insurance companies. ``It is time 
we asked the insurance industry to be responsible for its 
actions,'' said Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., one of the 29 
Republicans who crossed party lines. Federal law now effectively 
bans lawsuits against HMOs, even if a patient is injured or dies 
because of the insurer's decision. The House bill allows patients 
to sue in federal or state court and collect damages assigned by a 
jury. But the bill must be reconciled with a Senate health-care 
plan that offers no new rights to sue.

	TEZIUTLAN, Mexico -- With dozens of people believed buried alive  
in mudslides, rescue workers struggled to reach remote towns in 
southern and central Mexico, where flooding has killed at least 131 
people. Government officials said the death toll was certain to 
rise as reports come in from towns now cut off from the outside 
world. More than 157,000 people have been forced from their homes. 
Some parts of southeastern Mexico had received 2 1/2 feet of rainfall 
in two days -- a total greater than the average annual rainfall for 
the Mexico City area.

his first choice for vice president would be Oprah Winfrey. Trump 
planned a dinner tonight night with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura --

	Ex-Financier Indicted on 36 Counts

	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A federal grand jury has indicted rogue  
financier Martin R. Frankel on 36 counts of fraud and 
money-laundering, the U.S. attorney's office said. Frankel, under 
arrest in Germany, is accused of absconding with more than $200 
million in insurance company assets he was supposed to be 
investing. If convicted of all charges, he faces a maximum of 410 
years in prison. Frankel disappeared in early May, shortly before 
firefighters found smoldering documents in a safe in his 
Connecticut mansion.

	Cincinnati Gun Lawsuit Dismissed  
</P>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A judge's dismissal of Cincinnati's lawsuit  
against the firearms industry will be used to try and defeat 
similar lawsuits across the country, according to a lawyer for the 
gun makers. In the first dismissal of such a case, Hamilton County 
Common Pleas Judge Robert Ruehlman said the city's claims were 
vague and unsupported by legal precedent. Cincinnati's suit 
demanded reimbursement for the costs of providing police, 
emergency, court and prison services in connection with shootings 
in the city, whether those shootings were homicidal, suicidal or 
accidental. Cincinnati intends to appeal the decision within a few 
days.

	Israel Delays Prisoner Release

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A group of 151 Palestinian prisoners who were  
supposed to be freed Friday will remain locked up for now after a 
dispute between Israel and the Palestinians over which people to 
release. Internal Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said Thursday 
that the decision about which prisoners to release is Israel's 
alone, though the Palestinians should be consulted. Under the terms 
of an interim peace agreement signed last month, Israel was to 
release the prisoners on Oct. 8, which the Palestinians observe as 
an annual day in solidarity with the prisoners.

billion to settle claims that its fen-phen diet drug combination 
caused dangerous heart valve problems. The settlement covers

	House Rejects GOP-Backed HMO Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House today rejected a GOP-backed patient  
protection bill and set the stage for a showdown vote on a White 
House-endorsed plan giving Americans broad new rights to file 
lawsuits against their health insurance plans. Republican leaders 
had worked fiercely in recent days to rally support for their 
version, which offered patients a limited right to file lawsuits, 
with restrictions on jurisdiction and awards. Democrats and some 
Republicans argued that the threat of a lawsuit is needed to force 
insurance companies to provide promised care. The GOP measure was

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The offer by German government and industries

lawyers for the victims. ``The offer amounts to about $300 million 
or less in 1940 terms,'' said Mel Weiss, an attorney for survivors 
in class-action suits in U.S. courts. He charged that German 
industry has grown vastly wealthy in the years since it paid nearly

<HEADLINE> Clinton Courts Labor in NYC Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton's third trip to New York in as  
many weeks Thursday was an exercise in Democratic fence-tending, if 
not fence-mending, with carefully planned overtures to organized 
labor and politically active gays. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats traditionally fare well with both constituencies. But  
Clinton, whose 1992 election marked the end of a 12-year Democratic 
drought in the White House, has periodically disappointed each 
camp. Both constituencies could greatly help, or hurt, the 
candidacies of Clinton's chosen successor, Vice President Al Gore, 
and of his wife, the presumed Democratic candidate for Senate in 
New York next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said union endorsement of Gore barely came up during a  
private meeting with Jim Hoffa, head of the powerful Teamsters 
union and a frequent critic of Clinton-Gore policies, especially on 
trade matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said they discussed Teamster trade and economic concerns  
during the 25-minute meeting, as well as other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a good talk about golf,'' Clinton told reporters  
afterward. ``We didn't talk too much about other politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also appeared at the 24th annual Labor Research  
Association dinner, which honored Hoffa in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gore, campaigning in Louisville, Ky., made his  
position on unions clear Thursday night. Gore told a union hall 
full of Teamsters members that Clinton has vetoed every anti-union 
bill that has crossed his desk and that he would follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
	In a third labor-related event, Clinton combined an appearance  
with a prominent New York labor leader with an evening reception 
intended to raise $500,000 to elect Democrats to the Senate. First 
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton may be among the beneficiaries, but she 
is traveling overseas and did not attend the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton mentioned both Gore and Mrs. Clinton at the labor think  
tank dinner, where he studded his standard fund-raising speech with 
references to union concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so sick and tired of more than a decade of people trying  
to make unions the whipping boy of whatever it was that was wrong 
in America that they wanted to make right,'' Clinton said of the 
time before he took office. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Clinton addressed a gathering of gay activists called  
the Empire State Pride Agenda Dinner, his second speech to gays 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a reason the president of the United States is here,  
besides my heart,'' he told the crowd of about 1,800. ``It is the 
right thing to do, and you have been heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many gays still resent Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell''  
policy on homosexuals in the military. He promised much broader 
protection against discrimination when he ran in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also signed legislation in 1996 that took a stand  
against same-sex marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	During his campaign for the union presidency, Hoffa backers  
accused the Clinton administration of meddling in union politics in 
1996 to support incumbent Ron Carey. But Clinton said Thursday's 
visit was not a peace mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not mending any fences,'' Clinton said. ``I have actually  
enjoyed a fairly constructive relationship with the Teamsters for 
the last 6 1/2 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa has argued against early support for Gore, who also was in  
New York on Thursday to seek backing from union members, and 
Democrats generally, in this crucial early primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	Some union leaders have flirted with Democratic challenger Bill  
Bradley, and Gore is eager to line up as many labor leaders as he 
can. Gore appears likely to capture the coveted AFL-CIO endorsement 
despite differences with unions over the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and other Clinton administration policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton-Hoffa meeting was several months in the making and  
recognizes Hoffa's efforts to rid the Teamsters of corruption, 
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said. Presidents have 
avoided the Teamsters in recent years because of its history.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' RB Loville Sidelined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos running back Derek Loville did not  
practice Thursday because of a sore left hamstring and was listed 
as questionable for Sunday's game in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Loville, named the starter when Terrell Davis suffered a  
season-ending knee injury in last week's 21-13 loss to the New York 
Jets, tweaked his hamstring while running a pass route in practice 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``His hamstring was tight,'' coach Mike Shanahan said. ``It's a  
little bit more than a charley horse. He'll test it out (Friday). 
He feels like he could go. I'd say it's 50-50 right now. It will 
probably be a game-time decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Loville can't play, the Broncos (0-4) would turn to rookie  
Olandis Gary. John Avery, acquired in a trade with Miami on Sept. 
21, would be the backup. Avery has been practicing at both wide 
receiver and running back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Olandis is doing an excellent job learning the system,''  
Shanahan said. ``It's always difficult for a rookie to come in and 
play, but I've got a lot of confidence in him. 
</P>
<P>
	``John has a pretty good feel for our offense, being here a  
couple of weeks. He doesn't have the whole offense down, but he's 
very sharp and he's picked things up very quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan also said quarterback Bubby Brister, who lost his  
starting job to Brian Griese in the preseason but was restored as 
the starter Wednesday, ``had a good day of practice.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 50.97 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today as investors took some profits  
from Wednesday's hefty jump in prices and looked nervously toward 
the government's employment report on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 50.97 at 10,537.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 8.52 at 1,316.88, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
off 4.62 at 2,852.59. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taking profits is part of the story today after a big runup on  
Wednesday and the other part is waiting for tomorrow to see what 
September's employment numbers look like,'' said Hugh Johnson, 
chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow climbed 187.75 to 10,588.34 on Wednesday as investors  
temporarily set aside worries about rising interest rates and 
focused on corporate earnings. But with the market's volatile 
performance over the month amid nervousness over interest rates, 
many investors decided to take a prudent approach today and collect 
profits before Friday's employment report from the Labor 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The market -- and the Federal Reserve -- will be scrutinizing the  
report to see if there are signs of inflation that could prompt the 
Fed to push rates higher at its next policy meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if the jobs creation and wage figures contained in the  
report signal that inflation is under control, analysts expect a 
continuation of the volatility that Wall Street has seen over the 
past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wachtel, a market analyst for Prudential Securities, said  
upcoming third-quarter earnings reports, which traders have been 
optimistically awaiting, will help some stock sectors, but not the 
overall market. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of the averages, you're not going to get a clear-cut  
bull market going,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the technology-dominated Nasdaq index gave up early  
gains, some high-profile Internet stocks were higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! soared 12 1/4 to 188 after the Internet search company  
reported quarterly earnings results late Wednesday that were 
stronger than analysts expected. EToys rose 2 3/8 to 81 3/8; Amazon.com 
was up 4 5/16 at 86 3/4 and Priceline.com rose 1 3/16 to 73 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Internet stocks have turned a corner,'' Johnson said.  
``But I've said that before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, reflecting more nerves about interest rates,  
were mostly lower. Chase Manhattan fell 1 7/8 to 74 1/16, and Bank of 
America was off 1 15/16 at 56 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 643.76 million 
shares, down from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index was down 2.54 at 427.22

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Congress Back Pension Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and lawmakers from both  
parties joined forces Thursday to push legislation that would give 
millions of workers the right to more information when employers 
change pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement, Clinton said the trend among companies  
to convert traditional pensions to ``cash balance'' plans has 
raised concern that workers frequently are unaware they may get 
lower benefits, particularly if they are older. 
</P>
<P>
	``This legislation would ensure that all Americans have the  
necessary information to plan for retirement,'' the president said. 
``It would shine sunlight on changes in retirement benefits. And it 
would do this without unduly burdening employers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, to be jointly introduced in the House and Senate by  
Democrats and Republicans, would require basic notice of pension 
changes at least 45 days before they take effect. For pension plans 
with 100 or more participants, the notice would have to detail the 
new benefit formulas and illustrate how benefit accrual rates might 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, participants in the larger plans could obtain an  
individual benefit statement describing in plain language the 
changes affecting that person. These statements could be requested 
90 days after the change's effective date and would have to be 
provided within a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers now must provide notice when they make pension changes  
that would reduce the rate at which employees earn future benefits. 
But such notices do not have to be ``clear and complete,'' as the 
legislation would require. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employees have a right to know and understand the personal  
impact of any changes to their personal pension,'' said Rep. Jerry 
Weller, R-Ill., one of the prime House co-sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 companies have converted to cash-balance pension  
plans in recent years. Such plans are popular among younger workers 
because they often can be shifted from job to job and frequently 
permit lump-sum payouts. 
</P>
<P>
	But because the accrual rate of benefits is changed, older  
employees often find that their peak earning years no longer 
translate into higher retirement payments -- and sometimes into cuts 
of 20 percent to 50 percent from what they had expected. This has 
led to claims of age discrimination and investigations by the 
Internal Revenue Service, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
and Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Several groups of employees that have opposed pension changes at  
their companies, including IBM and Bell Atlantic, said the 
disclosure bill does not go far enough. They want employees given a 
choice between the new and old plans and some redress for lost 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, employees across the country should have a right to  
meaningful disclosure, but they must also be given the right to 
choose which pension plan works best for them,'' said Janet Krueger 
of the IBM Employee Benefits Action Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers also were less than thrilled with the bill. Jim Klein,  
president of the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, 
said requiring detailed individual disclosure statements would be 
``complex and cumbersome'' and might persuade more and more 
employers to drop pension plans altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we want companies to stay within the defined benefit  
system, we cannot make it more onerous for them to do so,'' Klein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders said they hoped to get the bill to Clinton  
before the year is out, although that may prove difficult with time 
running short.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales Up in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's biggest retailers reported today  
that sales rose modestly in September as the robust U.S. economy 
continued to encourage shoppers to spend despite volatility in the 
stock market, stormy weather and rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd, which battered the East Coast in the middle of  
last month, boosted sales at discounters and home improvement 
stores -- which benefited from shoppers stockpiling everything from 
flashlights to food. 
</P>
<P>
	Many department stores, however, were hurt by the storm, which  
caused extensive flooding that closed malls and roadways. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are still anxious to spend. That hasn't changed a  
bit,'' said Kurt Barnard, president of the newsletter Barnard's 
Retail Trend Report in Upper Montclair, N.J. ``The only factor 
playing into last month was the hurricane, which gave many stores 
in the East a whipping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers continue to enjoy one of their strongest years in  
recent history. They have benefited greatly from the resilient U.S. 
economy with low unemployment and tame inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Many merchants, however, have worried in recent months that  
borrowing and spending would slow after the Federal Reserve raised 
interest rates twice this summer to try to keep the economy from 
overheating and to head off a resurgence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Fed's rate hikes have unsettled investors and shaken  
the stock market, consumers so far haven't slowed their spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``On balance, retailers are doing well and nothing points yet to  
a significant slowdown,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst at 
Lehman Brothers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners in September were the discount chains, such as  
Wal-Mart and Target, which continue to draw consumers with their 
wide selection and affordable prices. Kmart, however, reported 
disappointing sales due to aggressive price-cutting by competitors 
on back-to-school merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Specialty stores, such as the Limited, also reported healthy  
sales, luring shoppers with their trendy fashions, such as stretchy 
pants and vests. Cooler weather moving into parts of the country 
also lifted clothing sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprising analysts was Sears, which reported  
better-than-expected sales after months of disappointments. Strong 
demand for appliances, consumer electronics and women's apparel 
boosted sales last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, rose 
5.6 percent in September. It rose 4.6 percent in July and August. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a jump on its competitors, Wal-Mart reported Tuesday  
that its sales from stores open at least a year rose 7.2 percent in 
September compared with a year ago, while total sales rose 26.4 
percent from year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store  
sales, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Selected figures on September's sales at leading retail chains:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears, same-store sales rose 4.1 percent, total sales were flat  
with a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart, same-store sales up 2.5 percent, total sales up 4.5  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney, same-store department store sales down 0.1  
percent; same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores up 10.1 percent; 
total sales up 8.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson, same-store sales up 6.9 percent, total sales up  
11.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated, same-store sales up 3.7 percent, total sales up 15.7  
percent. Federated's total sales include revenues from the Internet 
and catalog seller Fingerhut, which was acquired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores, same-store sales up 1.7 percent, total  
sales up 6.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited, same-store sales up 8 percent, total sales fell about  
1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap, same-store sales up 7 percent, total sales up 28 percent.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Sign McCarty for $5.4M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Darren McCarty rejoined the Detroit Red Wings on  
Thursday after signing a three-year, $5.4 million contract, his 
agent said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty, a 6-foot-1, 215-pound forward, signed Wednesday night  
and took the first available flight Thursday to Atlanta, where the 
Red Wings were to play the expansion Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	``To know that we've got Darren tied for three years is a good  
feeling,'' general manager Ken Holland said during a 
teleconference, calling McCarty ``a leader on the ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, the deal we came to, the numbers where we came out  
probably is right in the middle for players of Darren's age, 
importance and years of NHL experience,'' Holland added. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty's agent, Pat Morris, said the deal calls for $1.65  
million in its first year, then $1.8 million and $1.95 million the 
next two years ``with significant bonuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said the deal was ``within shouting distance'' of what  
McCarty sought. The agent refused to confirm reports his client 
pressed for $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, the 27-year-old McCarty scored 14 goals and added  
26 assists for Detroit. With the Red Wings, he has been a part of 
two Stanley Cup-winning teams this decade, scoring the game-winning 
goal against Philadelphia in the final game of the 1997 
championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	With a new contract under his belt, Morris said, McCarty is  
``feeling very positive with the season and the opportunity he's 
going to have to contribute.''

<HEADLINE> Networks' Studios Clog NYC Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Overcome with excitement, Claudia Debro screamed  
at the top of her lungs on a Times Square sidewalk, waving a sign 
addressed to her favorite MTV veejay, trying desperately to get the 
attention of a television camera. She has waited for this moment 
for -- well, weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind her, a man was simply trying to get by. He stepped to the  
left. Unwittingly, she stepped into his path. Back to the right. 
Same thing. Finally, he lifted the 14-year-old by the shoulders and 
moved her aside. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crossroads of the World has never been particularly easy to  
maneuver, but some New Yorkers are objecting to what they say is 
the transformation of Times Square and other areas of midtown into 
de facto sound stages for TV networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks have discovered that turning the camera back at the  
viewer during some of its programs yields high ratings -- and crowds 
of people trying to get into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent trend started in 1994 with NBC's ``Today Show'' at  
its Rockefeller Center studios. MTV and ABC's ``Good Morning 
America'' have since followed with their own glass-walled studios 
in Times Square, and the Fox News Channel has also broadcast 
programs out of its ground-floor facility in Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS plans to unveil its own $30 million storefront studio in the  
General Motors building across from Central Park on Nov. 1 for the 
debut of its new morning program, the ``Early Show.'' Bryant Gumbel 
will be the host. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the owners of a swank hotel up Fifth Avenue have gone  
to court to stop CBS. Also, some Times Square-area merchants and 
residents are peeved at ABC for allegedly filming on the sidewalk 
outside its studio on 44th Street and Broadway, causing more than 
the normal congestion. Others unhappy about the trend simply mutter 
and shove -- a traditional New York way of dealing with crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look, this area is crowded anyway, but when MTV goes live and  
these irritating screaming kids come in, the sidewalk is 
impassible,'' growled 66-year-old Manhattan resident Gina Reynolds 
as she pushed through a passel of teen-agers blocking a sidewalk 
outside the music channel's studio at Broadway and 45th Street 
earlier this week. ``Makes me miss the old Times Square. It was 
quieter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The networks, which have invested millions in the studios, say  
they are doing their best to avoid disruptions. Police use 
barricades to keep fans from spilling into the streets, and some of 
the networks also employ their own security personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers filed earlier this month, the owners of the  
Sherry-Netherland Hotel objected to CBS's indoor-outdoor studio 25 
blocks north in the General Motors building across the street from 
Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The network, the hotel says, plans to use the building's plaza  
and ground-floor studio ``as a `tourist destination' where crowds 
(will be) able to gawk through glass at the goings on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People will be waving and shouting and creating that fake  
Beatlemania-like sensation,'' and ``CBS will be able to stage 
everything from concerts to cooking demonstrations,'' according to 
the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the programs or networks that now broadcast from a  
glass-walled studio has seen its ratings swell, including ``Good 
Morning America,'' where viewership has gone from 3.8 million to 
4.5 million since the debut of its studio in September. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting this week with midtown residents, ABC officials  
promised to try to avoid inconveniencing the public while using its 
``Good Morning America'' studio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their studio is fabulous, wonderful,'' said Lola Finkelstein,  
head of the local community board. ``But they've got to know that 
they shouldn't block the sidewalk.''

<HEADLINE> Herenton Re-Elected Memphis Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Willie Herenton, the city's first elected  
black mayor, has won a third term and defeated a member of Memphis' 
most politically powerful black family in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Herenton drew 74,896 votes, or 46 percent, Thursday while his  
chief rival, City Council Chairman Joe Ford, gathered 41,161 votes, 
or 25 percent. Coming in third in the 15-candidate race was pro 
wrestler Jerry ``The King'' Lawler, with 19,092 votes, or 12 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While not mentioning any challenger by name, 59-year-old  
Herenton said he hoped the race, which included verbal spats 
between himself and the Ford family, would not cause lasting hard 
feelings among the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that during the campaign we probably took some jabs at  
each other, but that's all over now ... and I offer this apology to 
the Memphis public for the divisiveness in the campaign,'' Herenton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In conceding defeat, Ford said he looked forward to working with  
the mayor for the rest of his time on the City Council. He did not 
seek re-election to that post, and one of Ford's brothers, Edmund, 
was elected to succeed him when the current council term expires 
Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to congratulate Mayor Herenton on this win tonight. The  
voters of this city have spoken and they want the same leadership, 
and I will continue to work as the chairman of the Memphis City 
Council with the mayor and his administration,'' Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	Herenton charged that the family of former Rep. Harold Ford was  
attempting a power grab by running Ford, a brother of the former 
congressman and an uncle of current Rep. Harold Ford Jr., D-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Fords serve on the City Council, County Commission and in the  
state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe Ford's name is on the ballot, but Harold Ford Sr. is  
running. That's no secret,'' Herenton said during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Ford accused Herenton of selling out to special interests by  
spending money downtown while ignoring the city's poorest 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Herenton campaigned on the strong local economy, the  
revitalization of downtown Memphis and a falling crime rate. The 
term lasts for four years, and there is no chance for a runoff -- 
whoever gets the most votes wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Memphis, with 650,000 residents, is 55 percent black.  
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates in the nonpartisan election included Lawler,  
who in 1982 slapped comedian Andy Kaufman on ``Late Night With 
David Letterman,'' and Pepper Rodgers, the former college football 
coach who led Memphis' failed attempt to get an NFL team.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Wants To Aid Working Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETERBOROUGH, N.H. (AP) -- Painting an American portrait of  
stressed-out parents and deserted kitchen tables, Bill Bradley 
proposed on Thursday $2.6 billion in annual help to families -- 
everything from preschool and child care, to community colleges and 
a new army of senior-citizen volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	``What individual families cannot build on their own, we can all  
build together,'' the Democratic presidential candidate said, as a 
new poll showed him breaking ahead of Vice President Al Gore for 
the first time in this first-in-the-nation primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	In a policy address aimed at suburban swing voters, Bradley also  
echoed a proposal made earlier by Senate Democrats and Gore, 
Bradley's rival for the Democratic nomination, to expand the 
popular 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act to workers in smaller 
businesses than are currently covered. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley contrasted his ``Norman Rockwell'' boyhood, when he and  
his parents sat down to dinner at 6:30 p.m. sharp, to the 
modern-day frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dinner in most American homes these days looks like a  
miniature Grand Central station with people dashing in and out ... 
. Either that, or the kitchen is deserted,'' Bradley said to 
knowing nods. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new global economy just doesn't care about the 6:30 dinner  
hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore campaign criticized Bradley's proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	``When it comes to the most important issues facing America's  
working families, like after-school care, the marriage penalty, 
quality child care and real help with college, he falls short, and 
even flat,'' said Kiki Moore, Gore's campaign spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley slipped into a crowded high school gymnasium here  
without a band or any of the other flashy accompaniments typical of 
campaign stops. A wave of clapping began once students near the 
door recognized the tall candidate making his way toward the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	As he spoke, aides buzzed to reporters about a WNDS-Franklin  
Pierce College poll released Thursday that showed Bradley with a 
narrow lead over Gore in New Hampshire. A second poll had the two 
Democrats in a statistical deadheat. 
</P>
<P>
	A national CBS News poll out Thursday showed Gore had the  
support of almost half and Bradley of a third of likely voters in 
Democratic primaries. Bradley has gained strength in polls in 
recent months, but has had the support of almost a third in several 
recent polls while Gore's support has ranged from about 50 percent 
to the mid 60s. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley played down the numbers: ``This is a long campaign. Very  
obviously, I'd rather be ahead than behind. Nationally, I'm still 
15 points behind (Gore), so we've got a lot of work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To his crowd of several hundred students and local residents,  
Bradley said he would fill in the gaps in America's 
``catch-as-catch-can hodgepodge'' of child care systems by creating 
and funding community boards -- comprised of groups such as the 
Chamber of Commerce, Parent-Teacher Association, local child 
welfare agencies and churches -- to find new ways of delivering 
preschool services. 
</P>
<P>
	Modeled after North Carolina's ``Smart Start,'' Bradley would  
spend $2 billion each year on this project, in addition to the 
$10.5 billion that the government already spends each year on Head 
Start, the dependent care tax credit, and child care subsidies for 
low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed new grants to community colleges that do a  
better job of matching high school graduates' needs with demands in 
the local job market, providing flexible class schedules and 
on-site child care for working parents and improving students' 
technological skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, he called for an older-person's version of President  
Clinton's ``Americorps'' that would offer tax-free stipends of $200 
a month to senior citizens who volunteer at least 15 hours per week 
at approved nonprofit youth programs such as the YMCA, Boys and 
Girls Clubs, school tutoring, or faith-based mentoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley put a $2.6 billion annual price tag on his package and  
said that it would -- like his $65 billion-per-year universal health 
plan -- be paid for out of the federal budget surplus, which is 
projected to reach about $1 trillion over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``This proposal is not about big government but it's about big  
ideas and the courage to commit ourselves to finding a commonsense 
balance between family and work,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Music to some undecided voters.  
</P>
<P>
	Mike O'Leary, father of two teen-aged sons, credited Bradley  
with ``speaking to a lot of working families feeling the pinch.'' 
Whether or not his prescriptions are workable, ``at least it's a 
try, at least he's talking about it,'' O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathie Runyon, who works for an educational-training company in  
Peterborough, said Bradley ``started out a little folksy, but then 
made the good point that our lives are spinning out of control and 
it's time to get back to family time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Bradley and Gore want to guarantee 12 weeks' unpaid, family  
and medical leave to workers in firms with 25 or more employees. 
Current law applies only to businesses with 50 or more workers. 
Bradley also endorsed a Clinton proposal to give workers an 
additional 24 hours' leave each year to meet other family 
obligations, such as parent-teacher conferences.

<HEADLINE> Enzyme May Treat Some Disorders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have built a compound that mimics a  
human enzyme important for mopping up destructive molecules inside 
the body. They hope this synthetic enzyme might one day treat 
disorders ranging from inflammation to stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	When oxygen breaks down, it produces molecules highly damaging  
to cells. These molecules particularly build up in many 
inflammatory conditions and cause much of the destruction of brain 
cells that occurs after a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	The cells of animals and people produce an enzyme called  
superoxide dismutase, or SOD, that can mop up the damaging 
molecules. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors for years have thought that giving people additional SOD  
enzymes could help treat varous illnesses. But when they 
genetically engineered copies of SOD, the experimental therapy 
triggered immune reactions in some patients and the body broke down 
the SOD copies too rapidly for them to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at MetaPhore Pharmaceuticals in St. Louis report  
Friday in the journal Science that they created a possible 
alternative: a synthetic compound, based on the metal manganese, 
that mimics natural SOD. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead researcher Daniela Salvemini injected the compound,  
codenamed M40403, into rats whose paws had been purposefully 
swollen. The ``synzyme'' lowered swelling and inhibited damaging 
molecules that are the main causes of inflammation. In a second 
experiment, the SOD mimic helped rats live a little longer after 
undergoing a traumatic blood-flow stoppage in the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
	The testing is preliminary and it will take at least a year  
before scientists know if such compounds are safe enough to be 
tested in people. But Salvemini wrote that the synzyme also 
promises to help scientists understand just how inflammatory 
diseases do their damage.

<HEADLINE> Rave Raids Net 1,219 Arrests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Statewide raids on all-night dance  
parties known as raves resulted in 1,219 arrests and the seizure of 
nearly $9.4 million in drugs, cash, weapons and vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The raids, dubbed ``Operation Heat Rave,'' were in response to  
six rave-related drug deaths around the state, including two this 
summer, state drug czar Jim McDonough said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had this been a roller coaster ride and we had six dead ...  
there would have been a major outcry to close down the theme park 
until we could do something about that roller coaster ride,'' 
McDonough said. ``When you do drugs of every sort it is a roller 
coaster ride, a very deadly one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough said he hoped the raids would alert parents and young  
people to the dangers of drug use associated with raves. 
</P>
<P>
	Although 95 percent of those arrested were adults, most were in  
their late teens and early 20s, he said. Most of the arrests were 
for drug possession, sales and trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	State and local law officers moved against 57 businesses in 21  
counties from Sept. 29 through Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers seized 15 kilograms of cocaine, more than 500 pounds of  
marijuana and smaller quantities of heroin and methamphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
	They also seized designer drugs like Ketamine, Ecstasy, GHB and  
Rohypnol. The last two are so-called ``date-rape'' drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the raids drew protests of harassment, overkill and  
scare tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	In Panama City, customers at a club that caters to homosexuals  
said rubber-gloved deputies made them file outside to have their 
pictures taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Bay County sheriff's Capt. Jerry Girvin said the photos will be  
used to identify people who may have sold drugs to undercover 
agents.

<HEADLINE> Grains Down; Soybeans Mostly.Up / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures prices were lower and soybean  
futures prices were mostly higher in early trading today on the 
Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Large stocks of wheat continue to weigh down wheat prices, which  
opened lower. In addition, the market is anticipating the U.S. 
Agriculture Department's crop estimate to be released Friday will 
show another increase in wheat stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn future prices were lower as traders positioned themselves  
ahead of tomorrow's crop production and supply and demand reports, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures prices were steady to mostly higher in reaction  
to better than expected weekly export sales figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA reports soybean exports for the week ending Sept. 30  
totaled 975,000 metric tons. Gains were limited as harvest weather 
in the Midwest continues to benefit farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was 1 3/4 cents lower at $2.62 1/2 a  
bushel; December corn was 1 1/2 cents higher at $2.03 1/4 a bushel; 
December oats were 3/4 cent lower at $1.11 a bushel; November 
soybeans were 1 1/4 cents lower at $4.88 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and hog futures prices were higher in early trading on  
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle futures were boosted by higher cash prices stemming from  
strong consumer demand. The strength of cattle lifted hog futures 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork belly futures were higher as demand for bacon continues to  
strengthen, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle were .37 cent higher at 69.45 cents a  
pound; November feeder cattle were .33 cent higher at 82.70 cents a 
pound; December lean hogs were .70 cent higher at 45.40 cents a 
pound; February pork bellies were 1.58 cents higher at 62.80 cents 
a pound.

<HEADLINE> Gillette Loses Case Against Norelco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A federal judge has ruled against Gillette Co.,  
which had sued shaving rival Norelco over commercials depicting 
traditional razors as animated ferocious creatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette took issue with the ads -- which had titles such as  
``Twin Blade Serpent'' -- for Norelco's electric Reflex Action 
Razor, and filed suit in 1996 claiming the spots were false and 
disparaging. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the advertisements never mentioned Gillette by name,  
Gillette alleged the commercials maligned the entire category of 
wet, or non-electric, razors. The ads stopped airing two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Gillette) has not established how consumers interpreted the  
commercials and therefore the court is unable to determine whether 
the commercials as understood by consumers are false or 
misleading,'' U.S. District Judge Reginald Lindsay wrote in his 
43-page ruling, which was released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased for obvious reasons,'' said Rich Sorota, senior  
vice president of marketing for Norelco Consumer Products. ``We're 
pleased (the judge) found we were absolutely truthful. ... Our 
product did produce less irritation than blades (with regard to) 
nicks and cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Boston-based Gillette said they are considering  
appealing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to believe Norelco used exaggerated visuals and  
claims that were unfair and untruthful,'' said spokesman Eric 
Kraus. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette had sought a permanent injunction against Norelco that  
would have barred the company from ever producing ads that cast 
aspersions on wet shaving. To be granted injunctive relief, 
plaintiffs generally must prove they've suffered irreparable harm, 
loss or damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Norelco, based in Stamford, Conn., is a division of Philips  
Electronics N.V. of the Netherlands. Gillette controls 70 percent 
of the men's shaving products market and 50 percent of the women's 
market.

<HEADLINE> Pneumonia, Flu Shots Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The flu appears to have killed more Americans  
than usual last winter, and there is also a growing threat from 
bacterial pneumonia -- underscoring doctors' pleas Thursday for 
Americans to get both a flu vaccination this month and a protective 
shot against pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Although both shots are free for Medicare patients -- those most  
at risk -- one-third of such patients don't get regular flu shots, 
and 55 percent have never had a pneumonia vaccine, said a study 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the shots also are vital for certain younger people, said  
Dr. Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic, recalling how he had to 
amputate the hands and legs of a young mother to save her from a 
pneumococcal infection that had spread into her blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``An epidemic of apathy and ignorance'' about the need for  
vaccination ``fuels an epidemic of disease and death,'' Poland 
said. ``This is a public health emergency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Influenza in an average year kills 20,000 Americans. The  
government has not yet finished analyzing last winter's cases, but 
preliminary data suggest many more people died, said Dr. Keiji 
Fukuda of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Of additional concern, influenza has started causing unusual  
outbreaks during the summer, he said. Up to 40,000 people, mostly 
tourists, from 47 countries were sickened by a flu outbreak in 
Alaska in summer 1998, and a similar outbreak occurred this year. 
The CDC also spotted summer outbreaks in Louisiana, Florida, 
Oklahoma and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, flu is always worse in the winter. People need a flu shot  
annually because different influenza virus strains circle the globe 
each year. The optimal time for vaccination is between now and 
mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way to predict'' how bad flu will be this winter,  
Fukuda stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials estimate that one in 10 Americans could suffer  
needlessly if vaccination rates don't improve. 
</P>
<P>
	A flu shot isn't the only protection: Too many patients, and  
even doctors, do not know that a vaccine against pneumococcal 
infection is vital, too, said Surgeon General David Satcher. Unlike 
flu shots, most Americans need just one dose of pneumococcal 
vaccine for lifetime protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Pneumococcal bacteria cause half a million cases of pneumonia  
each year, plus infections in the brain, ear and other organs. Some 
40,000 Americans a year die. 
</P>
<P>
	If those numbers aren't convincing, Poland says another reason  
for vaccination is that pneumococci are rapidly evolving to defy 
antibiotic treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to popular belief, younger people often need the  
vaccine, he said, describing the young mother whose respiratory 
infection spread into her bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman felt flulike symptoms for a few days before  
deteriorating rapidly. ``To our horror, she began developing masses 
of splotchy, jet-black gangrene,'' Poland recalled, saying he had 
to amputate both her hands and legs to save her life. 
</P>
<P>
	She should have been vaccinated, because her spleen had been  
removed several years earlier because of an accident -- and removing 
the spleen weakens the immune system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flu and pneumococcal vaccination is highly recommended for:  
</P>
<P>
	--Everyone over 64. (One physician group recommends flu vaccine  
starting at age 50, something the CDC is investigating.) 
</P>
<P>
	--Younger people who have chronic heart or lung disorders,  
including asthma, or who have diabetes, kidney disease or a 
weakened immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	--Anyone in close contact with those high-risk patients,  
including family members and health care workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Flu vaccine also is recommended for women who will be in the  
second or third trimester of pregnancy during flu season. 
</P>
<P>
	Even healthy young people without those risks can benefit: One  
recent study found people who got a flu shot lost 43 percent fewer 
days of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Why don't people get vaccinated? The new Medicare study found 57  
percent of the unvaccinated said they didn't know they needed the 
pneumonia shot and 19 percent didn't know they needed the flu shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Too often, doctors don't recommend the vaccinations, public  
health officials complained -- and too often, doctors refuse to give 
flu shots after mid-November. Later shots can still be helpful, 
Fukuda said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't wait for your doctor to recommend vaccination -- be  
proactive and ask for the shots,'' CDC vaccine chief Dr. Walter 
Orenstein advised. ``It's your health and your life.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Lower; Dow Down 49.07 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned lower today as investors took  
profit from yesterday's hefty jump in prices and worried about a 
spike in unemployment claims. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 49.07 at 10,587.71. Broader stock 
indicators also dropped. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 
4.03 at 1321.37, and the Nasdaq composite index was off 1.93 at 
2,855.28. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that the number of Americans  
filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week to the 
highest level in more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists fear a tight job market will push employers to offer  
higher wages and benefits to attract qualified workers. Those costs 
could drive up prices and spark inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve opted against raising interest  
rates for a third time this year. But the central bank, expressing 
concerns that a tight labor market could lead to inflation down the 
road, held open the door to another bump up in rates before year's 
end. Higher interest rates hurt stocks because they can hurt 
corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists believe Fed policymakers may raise rates at  
their next meeting on Nov. 16 . 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Yahoo! rose 8 to 184, after the Internet portal  
reported quarterly earnings results late Thursday that proved much 
stronger than analysts expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, General Electric, slipped 3/8 to 123 1/2 after the Dow  
component posted third-quarter profits that beat Wall Street 
forecasts by a penny. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow on Wednesday climbed 187.75 to 10,588.34. The Dow has  
rebounded nearly 375 points, or 3.7 percent, since last Wednesday, 
when it reached 10,213.48, its lowest point since April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 113.6 million shares, 
down from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index was down 1.45 at 428.31  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.3 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.2 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.8 percent, and France's AC-40 was up 
0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Try To Find Rhythm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Good thing Phil Jackson is patient,  
because the Los Angeles Lakers haven't yet found a rhythm in the 
new triangle offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than a brief half-court scrimmage Wednesday night, the  
Lakers haven't really played any basketball three days into 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to play, but we're not ready to let them play yet,''  
Jackson said after Thursday morning's practice. ``They're not up to 
that speed, they'll just form bad habits by playing right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So instead they drill while Jackson looks for signs that the  
players know what they're doing. He said the guards and wing 
players are showing flickers of recognition about where they should 
be on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trying to recognize and trying to anticipate and having five  
guys in sync is real important for us,'' he said. ``It was a hard 
practice and a long practice. They got fatigued out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team took Thursday night off and will resume two-a-days  
Friday. Their first public scrimmage is Sunday night on the UC 
Santa Barbara campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably could've gone into a scrimmage situation, but with  
our focus being on the small things and the details of the game, we 
probably would've taken a step backward instead of continuing to 
stay on course,'' guard Derek Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson singled out Fisher as one of the most vocal in practice.  
</P>
<P>
	``Right now everybody's kind of tense because we don't really  
know what to expect,'' Fisher said. ``I'm feeling comfortable out 
there and having fun and sometimes just trying to get guys to 
loosen up and just enjoy being here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson has made no secret of his preference for bigger guards,  
which would seemingly make the 6-foot-1 Fisher and 6-foot Tyronn 
Lue nervous. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be able to provide better defensive pressure as far as  
full court is concerned than some of the other guys we have playing 
guard positions,'' Fisher said of himself and Lue. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than Kobe Bryant, Glen Rice and Shaquille O'Neal playing  
at least 30 minutes a game, Fisher doesn't think Jackson has 
decided who's going to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``There'll be times where I'll play 30-plus minutes, there'll be  
times where I might play 18 minutes,'' he said. ``It'll kind of be 
a game-to-game situation depending on matchups and how guys are 
playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher believes he's going to enjoy the new offense because the  
guards won't be relegated to only bringing the ball up the court 
and passing off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of opens up more opportunities for me to shoot the  
basketball and create some other plays,'' he said. ``This offense 
is one where everybody is going to be handling the basketball, 
making passes, having open shots. It breeds a real team concept out 
on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's the offense, maybe it's Jackson's presence, but  
already Fisher sees better chemistry among his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it was that guys on our team didn't want to  
commit to being on the same page, but I don't think we ever really 
had a page to follow,'' he said. ``Our coaching staff has presented 
something for us to follow and everybody's following it right 
now.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Test Ban Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *BARRY SCHWEID   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the Senate poised to reject a treaty  
banning nuclear weapons tests, the Clinton administration appealed 
Thursday for a delay in the vote so it can try to muster support 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made the pitch to the  
Senate Foreign Relations Committee with the argument the treaty was 
too important to be considered in the compressed time frame 
arranged by Republican leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel's chairman and a leading critic of the test ban,  
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said President Clinton must withdraw the 
treaty from consideration until after next year's presidential 
election if he wants next Tuesday's scheduled vote called off. 
</P>
<P>
	And Senate Republican leader Trent Lott of Mississippi proceeded  
with plans to begin debate on the Senate floor on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of the treaty, which has been signed by 154 nations but  
ratified by only two major powers, Britain and France, privately 
acknowledged they could not amass the 67 votes needed for U.S. 
ratification. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright told the foreign relations committee at day's end that  
``the leadership ought to find a way to give the treaty the careful 
consideration it deserves at a later date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the senators who now oppose the CTBT (comprehensive  
test ban treaty) or who are undecided will think very carefully 
about what the consequences would be if the treaty were not 
approved,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because it would be a national security tragedy if the world's  
greatest deliberative body killed a treaty that our nation has 
sought for 40 years by failing properly to deliberate on and 
appreciate its merits,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the hearing room, she told reporters she would not  
propose a ``time frame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But her spokesman, James P. Rubin, apparently rejecting chairman  
Helms' proposal, said ``we do not believe we should put our nuclear 
nonproliferation efforts on hold for two years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, President Clinton urged the Senate to ``do what's right  
for America'' and ratify the treaty. He also signaled hope for 
postponement of a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives the people who made early commitments, I think  
wrongly, but they did it, the chance to move to doing the Senate's 
business the way the Senate should do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Senate votes on and doesn't get the required two-thirds  
majority for ratification, it would be the first time in modern 
history an arms control pact has been voted down on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, trying to reverse the tide, invoked a ``moral  
responsibility for future generations'' even as supporters conceded 
there seemed little chance to muster the two-thirds vote needed for 
Senate approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said the treaty ``gives us tools to strengthen our  
security'' and ``to throw away these tools will ensure more testing 
and more development of more sophisticated and more dangerous 
nuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before a political fund-raising trip to New York,  
Clinton said ``future generations won't forgive us if we fail that 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was not trying to ``beat up'' Republican  
opponents but was asking that ``we do what is in the national 
interest. Let's just do what's right for America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is bigger than party politics,'' he said. ``This is  
bigger than personal politics. This is about America's future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., told the committee there was precedent  
for delaying the vote, citing the treaty to ban chemical weapons. 
Levin said a delay would give senators more time to propose changes 
in the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the senior Democrat on  
the committee, said he was ready to vote now. ``The single-most 
important thing this committee can do is to attend to this 
treaty,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposing the treaty, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said the  
approval of 30 nations would be required to carry out an on-site 
inspection, thereby permitting opponents of the United States to 
block monitoring of suspicious activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., said he opposes ratification because he  
has little confidence the verification and enforcement provisions 
will dissuade other nations from nuclear testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Furthermore, I am concerned about our country's ability to  
maintain the integrity and safety of our own nuclear arsenal under 
conditions of the treaty,'' Lugar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, meanwhile, told the Senate  
Armed Services Committee that rejection of the 154-nation 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ``would announce that the United 
States refuses to lead on this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testing is not needed to make sure U.S. nuclear weapons would  
work, Richardson said. The nuclear stockpile is ``safe, secure and 
reliable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Republican and Democratic leaders sought ways to postpone  
a vote, a group of conservatives led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., 
kept up pressure for proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has rejected their demand that Clinton put in  
writing any request to delay a vote on an international nuclear 
test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservatives also want Clinton to promise -- in writing --  
not to seek to revive the treaty during the 2000 presidential 
election year, a condition the White House has also rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., served notice on  
Senate leaders that he planned to block any effort to postpone a 
vote, whether Clinton seeks it in writing or not. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has made the treaty a top priority ``and  
should live with the consequences,'' Inhofe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats acknowledged there seemed to be little way either to  
win ratification or persuade Republican leaders to postpone the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to kill it, I guess they can do it,'' Biden told  
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty has virtually no Republican support.

<HEADLINE> Mets Get Much Needed Day Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On the seventh day, the New York Mets rested.  
</P>
<P>
	After a grueling stretch of pressure baseball that began a week  
ago, when they were two games out of the NL wild-card berth with 
just three games to play, the Mets finally got a day off Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	They needed it.  
</P>
<P>
	The Mets returned home after splitting the first two games of  
their best-of-5 series against Arizona and gave their adrenaline a 
day off. The Diamondbacks, meanwhile, discovered the wonders of 
Manhattan gridlock as they meandered to Shea Stadium for evening 
news conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm as curious as the fans about what's going to happen,''  
manager Buck Showalter said. ``If I get here, we'll find out. We 
almost didn't make it today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks landed at Kennedy Airport and bused into the  
city. The return trip to Shea took them 1 1/2 hours, with gridlock 
partly caused by the visit of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Reed will start for the Mets in Game 3 Friday night, with  
Omar Daal pitching for Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``A week like this, you can use a day off,'' Mets manager Bobby  
Valentine said. ``I was dragging, but I feel good now. We've had 
some travel. Late in the year, everybody's dragging anyway. The 
travel is strenuous to say the least.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a week of big games, Valentine said the Game 3 will be no  
different. 
</P>
<P>
	``No doubt in my mind, this is the most important game of the  
season, because it's the one we're playing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets' itinerary -- New York, Cincinnati, Phoenix -- with games  
every day in each city and no margin for error, took its toll. It 
was a mentally draining stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``More mental than physical,'' said John Franco, experiencing  
his first playoff action in a career that began in 1984. ``Every 
game, every pitch we needed to be on top of our game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks noticed the Mets' problems.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were surprised at that bad stretch they had, but I don't  
think anybody counted them out,'' Luis Gonzalez said. ``You get a 
team that wins that many games with that many good players, they're 
going to bounce back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter, familiar with the pressure of New York from his days  
managing the Yankees, said he understood what the Mets had 
experienced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you go through it, you don't realize what a challenge it  
is to finish off a season,'' he said. ``It's frustrating for 
players. You've got to be strong to get through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets swept three straight from Pittsburgh and got some help  
when Cincinnati lost two games to Milwaukee. That created the 
wild-card tie. 
</P>
<P>
	New York traveled to Cincinnati to win a playoff game for the  
berth last Monday, then traveled to Phoenix and beat Randy Johnson 
in the playoff opener Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	They seemed a little flat as the Diamondbacks tied the series  
Wednesday night before an overnight flight back to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``After it was over, the game in Cincinnati, then flying,  
getting in late and winning in Phoenix in the division opener, I 
don't think it sunk in until yesterday,'' reliever Turk Wendell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were tired a little more, maybe. It all kind of sunk in and  
caught up. Today was a good day to relax, clear your head and have 
a little rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catcher Mike Piazza, working every game, was particularly banged  
up, nursing a bruised thumb, sore shoulder and banged-up knees. 
X-rays on the thumb Thursday were negative. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mike absolutely needed a day off,'' Valentine said. ``At this  
time, there are no days off. The way the season is scheduled, if 
you get into the playoffs, you get a day off. As it turned out, we 
needed to play on the day off, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks got that day off. The Central Division  
champions were waiting for the Mets and Reds to settle the wild 
card, with their ace, Johnson, set to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We liked our chances going in,'' Gonzalez said. ``But we knew  
they'd be tough. We respect those guys. When you get to the 
playoffs, you've got all winter to heal and rest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets beat Johnson, but Todd Stottlemyre got Arizona even.  
Showalter said he would use Brian Anderson in Game 4 on Saturday 
against Al Leiter, whose two-hitter clinched the wild card last 
Monday night, right in the middle of the Mets' marathon week.

<HEADLINE> Arrested Warrick Out of Miami Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Heisman Trophy hopeful Peter Warrick  
won't play when top-ranked Florida State attempts to extend a 
44-game home unbeaten streak Saturday against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick has been indefinitely suspended and fellow wide receiver  
Laveranues Coles was kicked off the team after they were arrested 
Thursday on charges they were allowed to underpay for clothes at a 
department store. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bobby Bowden tried to put the situation to rest, knowing  
how difficult Miami has been for his Seminoles at times in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the kids no matter what distractions are out there, we  
want our full concentration on the University of Miami,'' he said. 
``It's probably as distracting to me and some of the coaches more 
than everybody else because we're faced with decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're sitting there looking at film, and all that time  
something inside of you tells you that you don't feel good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles (5-0) have not lost at home since Miami's 17-16  
victory in 1991. Miami also derailed Florida State's title hopes in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1991 game wasn't decided until Florida State's Gerry Thomas  
missed a 34-yard field goal by inches with only 25 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's 1991 come-from-behind win was the third time in five  
years the Hurricanes ruined Florida State's national championship 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miami has beaten us when everything was riding on it,'' Bowden  
said. ``They won the national championship when we could have won 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami (2-2) hasn't beaten the Seminoles since 1994, when Warren  
Sapp terrorized Danny Kanell in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden thinks Miami coach Butch Davis has returned the  
Hurricanes to their old form. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're back,'' Bowden said. ``To me, Miami is a 4-0 club.  
They are so close to being undefeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami opened the season with victories over Ohio State and  
Florida A&AMP;M before losing to No. 2 Penn State 27-23 and by the same 
score to East Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fun to play a wounded team,'' said Bowden, noting  
Miami also has had an extra week to prepare for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives them two weeks to study us and be more familiar with  
what we're doing and an extra week to practice for us. Our kids 
will have to ... overcome that. We're expecting a very tough 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State won last year's game 26-14 at Miami, the closest  
of the last four games during a span in which the Seminoles have 
averaged 37 points to the Hurricanes' 11.7. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last two games at Tallahassee, the Seminoles won 47-0 and  
41-17. 
</P>
<P>
	``People expect us to lose this game, so we have nothing to  
lose,'' Miami defensive tackle Matt Sweeney said. ``People aren't 
giving us a chance, but that gives us extra motivation.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Syphilis Rate at Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The syphilis rate in the United States dropped 19  
percent last year to an all-time low, the government reported 
Thursday as it launched a push to stamp out the sexually 
transmitted disease altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the rate of  
new cases in 1998 was 2.6 per 100,000 people, down from 3.2 a year 
earlier. Half of the 6,993 cases reported came from 28 counties, or 
less than 1 percent of all U.S. counties. Most of the 28 counties 
were urban. About 80 percent of all counties reported no new cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly we have wrestled syphilis to the ground, and now we  
have to put it in lockhold from which it won't escape,'' said Dr. 
Judith Wasserheit, director of the CDC's sexually transmitted 
disease prevention division. ``We have an unprecedented window of 
opportunity to eliminate syphilis in the United States because 
rates are at an all-time low and because the disease now is 
extremely concentrated geographically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drop has been attributed, in part, to increased funding for  
treatment and safe-sex practices prompted by the outbreak of AIDS, 
such as using condoms and having fewer partners. 
</P>
<P>
	The South had the highest rate at 5.1 per 100,000 and accounted  
for 19 of the 28 counties that had the highest number of cases. The 
rate was higher among blacks -- 17.1 per 100,000 compared with 0.5 
among whites. But the disparity has narrowed since the beginning of 
this decade, when rates among blacks were 64 times those of whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Syphilis, like many other health problems, tends to persist in  
communities that are plagued by a number of social problems 
including poverty, lack of access to health care and racism,'' 
Wasserheit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The syphilis rate has been declining in the United States since  
1990, when it peaked at 50,578 cases, or 20.3 cases per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Syphilis is a bacterial infection that starts with painless  
sores and then a rash and can attack the heart and brain and cause 
dementia and death. It can be cured if treated early with 
antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon General David Satcher and CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan  
were to join other national and local public health officials in 
Nashville, Tenn., on Thursday to announce the CDC's new initiative 
to eliminate syphilis. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, aimed at areas with a heavy burden of syphilis cases  
or a potential for re-emergence, calls for closer monitoring, more 
community involvement, quicker response to outbreaks and greater 
access to health care for those infected or exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is hoping to reduce syphilis cases to a rate of  
0.4 per 100,000 by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville, Indianapolis and Raleigh, N.C., are the three initial  
sites where the plan will be put into effect.

<HEADLINE> Cincinnati Gun Lawsuit Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A judge's dismissal of Cincinnati's lawsuit  
against the firearms industry will be used to try and defeat 
similar lawsuits across the country, a lawyer for gun makers said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first dismissal of such a case, Hamilton County Common  
Pleas Judge Robert Ruehlman said the city's claims were vague and 
unsupported by legal precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It very clearly points out the weaknesses in the other cities'  
suits,'' said Jim Dorr, a Chicago lawyer for gun makers Sturm, 
Ruger &AMP; Co. Inc., of Southport, Conn., and Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., of 
Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorr said Cincinnati's claims are similar to those advanced in  
17 other lawsuits representing 27 city or county governments. 
``These lawsuits filed by the cities have been, in our opinion, 
nothing but smoke and mirrors with no legal foundation to them,'' 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati intends to appeal the decision within a few days,  
said Stanley M. Chesley, the city's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruehlman threw out the lawsuit without even allowing the city to  
see documents it wants to obtain from those who manufacture, 
distribute and advertise guns, Chesley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My view is simple: What does the industry have to hide?''  
Chesley said. ``Let's see the documents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's suit -- against gun manufacturers, a distributor and  
three trade associations -- demanded reimbursement for the costs of 
providing police, emergency, court and prison services in 
connection with shootings in the city, whether those shootings were 
homicidal, suicidal or accidental. The suit did not request a 
specific amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The city also sought to force changes in the design,  
distribution and advertising of guns nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruehlman said he ruled on the basis of written filings and  
lawyers' arguments he heard on Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said only the Legislature, not the courts, has the  
authority to regulate product design and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	He also rejected Cincinnati's allegations of design defects and  
failure to warn users of possible risks from use of guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be liability for failure to warn only if the risk is  
not open and obvious or a matter of common knowledge,'' Ruehlman 
wrote in his five-page ruling. He said that ``the risks associated 
with the use of a firearm are open and obvious and matters of 
common knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city's claim of liability for defective firearm designs  
failed to meet a requirement under Ohio law of identifying specific 
products or specific injuries and their causes, the judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association praised the judge's decision.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major victory for those who believe, as NRA members  
believe, that we must hold criminals accountable for their 
crimes,'' said James Baker, executive director of the NRA's 
Institute for Legislative Action. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants in Cincinnati's lawsuit are Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co.; Smith  
&AMP; Wesson; Beretta U.S.A. Corp.; Bryco Arms Inc.; Colt's 
Manufacturing Co. Inc.; H &AMP; R 1871 Inc.; Hi-Point Firearms; Lorcin 
Engineering Co. Inc.; North Americans Arms Inc.; Phoenix Arms;

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Leaves Rate Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Bank of England decided Thursday against  
changing its official lending rate, currently 5.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, announced following a monthly monetary committee  
meeting, had been anticipated by the markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Chambers of Commerce called the bank's decision  
``good news for British business,'' which has been hampered in 
export markets by the relatively strong pound. An additional 
increase in rates would likely cause the pound to strengthen 
further, making British goods costlier than products priced in 
other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank surprised many last month when it raised its base  
lending rate by 0.25 percentage point in an effort to dampen 
inflation. Its base lending rate is what it charges for loans to 
financial institutions and the rate is often used as a benchmark 
for changes in commercial and consumer lending rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry and labor unions warned that another rise could imperil  
thousands of manufacturing jobs.

<HEADLINE> Trump Forms Exploratory Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New York tycoon Donald Trump said today that  
he has formed an exploratory committee to help him determine 
whether he can win the White House as a Reform Party candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at the very strong possibility that we could win  
-- and not just the (third party) nomination,'' Trump told The 
Associated Press in a telephone interview from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In a further sign of Trump's seriousness, he is meeting tonight  
with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura -- the Reform Party's leading 
elected official. Ventura, a former wrestler who won the governor's 
office in a 1998 upset, is trying to find a candidate he can back 
in what is shaping to be a fractious nomination fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan is expected to bolt the Republican Party and seek a  
Reform Party nomination later this month. He is backed by another 
wing of the party, a loose alliance with ties to party founder Ross 
Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot's top adviser and the current Reform Party chairman,  
Russell Verney, met with Buchanan this week in Texas to discuss the 
conservative's options. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot, himself, has not ruled out a possible Reform Party run.  
Former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker has indicated an interest in 
seeking the nomination of a splinter group, the American Reform 
Party, which could affect the dynamic of a third party campaign. 
There is even the potential that Ventura, himself, could run, 
despite earlier denials. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he supports Trump for president, Ventura told  
reporters in New York, ``Ask me that question in the year 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura acknowledged that he was having dinner tonight with  
Trump. ``Do I like him for the Reform Party?'' he asked. ``It 
depends if he likes the Reform Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the topsy-turvy world of Reform Party politics Trump -- with  
his vast personal wealth -- would stand as good a chance as anybody 
of seizing the third party nomination. A CNN-Time poll taken in 
July suggested he would be a long-shot for the presidency. He had 7 
percent when matched against George W. Bush, governor of Texas, and 
Vice President Al Gore, the party front-runners in national polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said that unlike traditional exploratory committees --  
which are established primarily to raise money for a budding 
candidate -- his panel will be formed primarily to provide political 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good thing about this is I don't need the money,'' Trump  
said, signaling that he may finance his campaign himself. 
</P>
<P>
	A Trump adviser said the committee's efforts would be twofold:  
to determine Trump's presidential viability and to begin organizing 
for the internal struggle over the Reform Party nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to look at it and look at it very seriously. The  
polls have come out incredibly well,'' Trump said. ``Based on this, 
and the support of Jesse and other people, we're going to give it 
very serious consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said he planned to decide whether to seek the nomination  
by January or February. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said he would not run just to be a spoiler.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that could interest me is if I could win. I'm  
not talking about the nomination, I'm talking about the whole 
megillah.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said Wednesday in a ``Dateline NBC'' interview that he  
considers himself a ``great builder and conceptualizer'' and that 
those qualities would serve the country well if he were elected 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, a registered Republican who says he identifies with  
former President Reagan, said the country ``is essentially in huge 
debt'' -- which he knows a thing or two about, after rebounding from 
the brink of bankruptcy in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he's socially liberal and fiscally conservative,  
supports major tax cuts, abortion rights and health care for all, 
but opposes gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	He also handicapped his prospective competition, saying Texas  
Gov. George W. Bush was ``really untested,'' that Vice President Al 
Gore ``has more ability than is being shown,'' and that Bill 
Bradley quit the Senate in 1996 because he was ``a loser in New 
Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If elected, his first act would be to ``give the country  
spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing we have going and not insignificant ... is a  
good economy,'' Trump said. ``If that economy goes, we're going to 
be a very, very depressed place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The National Enquirer ... did a poll and said I'd win the  
election,'' Trump said in an interview on NBC's ``Today.'' Reminded 
that in a Newsweek poll, 2 percent said they were likely to vote 
for Trump and 73 percent said they were unlikely, he replied: ``If 
I had 2 percent how come they put me on their cover?''

	House Approves HMO Lawsuit Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved bipartisan legislation  
today granting new rights to patients, including a broad ability to 
sue their health insurance companies for denying care. The 275-151 
vote marked a striking triumph for congressional Democrats and the 
White House, overcoming efforts by GOP leaders to water down the 
right-to-sue provisions. Under the approved version, there would be 
no limit on the amount of damages that could be recovered so long 
as the patient adhered to the decision made by the outside appeals 
panel. However, the House bill now must be reconciled with a more 
limited Senate plan.

<P>
	TEZIUTLAN, Mexico -- Rescue workers struggled to reach remote  
towns in southern and central Mexico, where flooding brought on by 
more than a week of rain has killed at least 131 people and dozens 
are believed buried alive in mudslides. More than 157,000 people 
have been forced from their homes. Aid groups appealed for help, 
urging people to bring medicine, water, food, clothing and blankets 
to collection centers in Mexico City. Health officials said they 
have begun to see cases of dengue, a mosquito-borne illness, as 
well as skin and respiratory infections in the flooded areas.

	Ex-Financier Indicted on 36 Counts

<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Rogue financier Martin R. Frankel was  
charged with fraud and money-laundering in a 36-count federal 
indictment, the U.S. attorney's office announced. He is accused of 
absconding with more than $200 million in insurance company assets 
he was supposed to be investing. Frankel, under arrest in Germany, 
faces a maximum of 410 years in prison if convicted of all charges. 
Hugh Keefe, the financier's former lawyer, said the indictment will 
make it easier to extradite Frankel.

	UPS Ending Some Gun Deliveries  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service plans to stop shipping  
handguns via its ground service, instead forcing customers to use 
the more expensive air service -- a cost dealers and manufacturers 
say will be passed on to consumers. UPS, the world's top package 
delivery company, says handguns are attractive to thieves and easy 
targets in the company's fleet of brown trucks. The new rule goes 
into effect Monday. The company will continue to ship long guns, 
rifles and shotguns by ground because those guns are more difficult 
to steal.

	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The U.S. military acknowledged for the first  
time today that it used a form of computer warfare against 
Yugoslavia as part of NATO's air war last spring. Army Gen. Henry 
H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made the remark 
as he discussed the Pentagon's decision to assign U.S. Space 
Command the responsibility of coordinating both the defense of 
military computer networks and attacks on enemy networks. Shelton 
would not specify the target of the U.S. computer attacks and did 
not discuss the results.

ensuring that they are readable only as long as the sender wants 
them to be. The system encrypts each message with an electronic

anywhere from a few seconds to years. After that, the key 
self-destructs and the message becomes unreadable.

<HEADLINE> Group Supports Aviation Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A successful lobbying effort to restore  
funding for aviation safety research managed to anger one of its 
main beneficiaries -- the airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign included TV ads showing harrowing pictures of plane  
crashes -- not the kind of image the airlines like to project. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ads may have helped sway House and Senate negotiators  
working on next year's budget for the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration; they agreed Thursday night to restore $900 
million that the House had proposed cutting from the NASA's budget. 
Overall, the bargainers boosted the agency's budget to $13.7 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The lobbying effort was mounted out of fear that any cuts would  
come would come from the aeronautics part of NASA, which conducts 
research into such areas as strengthening airplanes, coping with 
turbulence and developing new technologies to allow planes to land 
in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The efforts were led by business leaders in Hampton, Va., who  
were concerned about jobs at the NASA Langley Research Center, 
which spends 70 percent of its budget on aviation research. But 
they didn't talk about employment but about possible dangers to the 
airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Congress doesn't support NASA today, you won't want to fly  
tomorrow,'' one advertisement proclaimed. Over scenes of airline 
crashes, a TV ad began, ``Air accidents will increase as air travel 
is expected to triple in the next two decades'' and ended with the 
narrator intoning, ``Tell Washington to stop risking your future 
safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think those are scare tactics,'' said David Fuscus, a  
spokesman for the airlines' trade group, the Air Transport 
Association, which supported full funding for NASA but didn't lobby 
against the cuts. ``They're not accurate and they're in very poor 
taste. No matter what the cause that someone is working on, to 
scare people needlessly is really unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic consultant Jennifer Laszlo, who produced the ads,  
said they were accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	``American lives are at stake,'' she said. ``I'm not in the  
business of making pretty, feel-good advertising to sell seats on 
airplanes. I'm trying to defend the idea that somebody who buys a 
seat on one of those planes lands safely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between $500,000 and $1 million was raised from businesses,  
residents and local governments for the lobbying campaign, which 
included bringing in Laszlo and Republican Frank Luntz to do 
polling and hiring a Washington lobbyist, Paul Hirsch. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirsch is a 20-year veteran of government and a former base  
closing commission staff member who later was hired to help the 
Hampton region keep one of its bases from being shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Herbert Bateman, R-Va., plastered the group's poll numbers  
-- 93 percent of respondents support air safety funding, 71 percent 
agree that the funding should continue even if it exceeds budget 
caps -- in big black type across the tops of letters he regularly 
sent to his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to the nation's interest,'' Bateman said.  
``Our airlines will not be able to grow as they are expected to 
grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bateman also buttonholed Rep. James Walsh, the chairman of the  
House Appropriations subcommittee that handles NASA funding, as 
often as possible, even stopping by a fund-raising event for the 
New York Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	From the sidelines, officials at NASA Langley, applauded the  
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ads are reasonably accurate,'' spokesman Gary Price said.  
``They know in a lab like this, we do work in advanced technology 
that could help many of these problems.''

<HEADLINE> Isiah Thomas Completes CBA Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Isiah Thomas officially became the owner of the  
Continental Basketball Association on Thursday after league owners 
approved the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Detroit Pistons star had signed a letter of intent in  
August to purchase majority ownership of the nine-team league for 
about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like the CBA to maintain its reputation of instilling  
quality basketball education and training,'' Thomas said. ``At the 
same time, it is now our goal to offer high-energy entertainment to 
the underserved sports communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CBA is the National Basketball Association's official  
developmental league. A record 63 players were called up by NBA 
teams last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``His intelligence, enthusiasm and business skills will take  
this league to an unprecedented level,'' said league commissioner 
Gary Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas' involvement in the CBA began when he inquired about  
putting a team in Detroit, where he led the Pistons to consecutive 
NBA championships in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas plans to reorganize the CBA from an association with 40  
owners into a single entity league. 
</P>
<P>
	He has already made a few changes, on and off the court.  
</P>
<P>
	``By instituting a dress code for our players, we want to move  
toward a more professional environment,'' Thomas said. 
``Additionally, we strongly believe we can offer a more up-tempo, 
exciting style of play by eliminating the strategy of the 
double-team defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas is also negotiating to buy the nine-team International  
Basketball Association, which has teams in Canada and six states.

<HEADLINE> State Farm Shuns Aftermarket Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- State Farm customers can stop asking  
their agents, adjustors and body shops whether the parts about to 
go on their crash-damaged cars fit automaker specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest insurer decided Thursday to temporarily  
stop using controversial aftermarket parts. The decision came three 
days after a jury awarded $456 million to policyholders in a 
class-action lawsuit over the parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just a lot of confusion, and we thought to try to  
dispel some of this confusion or concern, it would be best to 
temporarily suspend use of aftermarket crash parts,'' State Farm 
spokesman Dave Hurst said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say such parts -- which are modeled on manufacturers'  
parts but made without access to factory specifications -- are of 
lower quality than original equipment parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means that, effective immediately, all customers  
who bring their cars in for repair will get original equipment or 
recycled parts, Hurst said. Currently, about 10 percent of parts 
installed in State Farm repairs come from aftermarket 
manufacturers, State Farm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will not pay extra for the non-aftermarket parts, as  
would normally be required under State Farm's policy, nor will 
premiums be increased, Hurst said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a jury awarded 4.7 million current and former  
policyholders $456 million after finding State Farm's use of 
aftermarket parts constituted a breach of contract to restore 
customers' automobiles to their pre-accident condition. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm's decision Thursday was not related to the impending  
ruling by Williamson County Circuit Judge John Speroni on the 
second count of the lawsuit, Hurst said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speroni is expected to rule today on whether State Farm  
committed fraud by failing to properly notify consumers about the 
parts it requires body shops to use in repairs. The plaintiffs have 
asked for nearly $4 billion in actual and punitive damages and an 
injunction requiring additional disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
	Some insurance groups expected other companies would follow the  
lead of State Farm -- the nation's largest auto insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really traumatic when the industry leader makes a  
decision such as this, and I'm sure that other companies are going 
to take note,'' said Kirk Hansen, a spokesman for the Alliance of 
American Insurers, a trade group representing about 300 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Johnson, an analyst who tracks the aftermarket parts  
industry for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said it was too 
early to say what impact the decision could have on the industry -- 
which accounts for about 10 percent of the $10 billion crash-repair 
parts business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly not good news,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Littleton, one of the attorneys involved in the lawsuit  
against State Farm, claimed the decision as a victory for 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we've done good,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Braves Bounce Back Against Astros  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Top that, Tom Glavine.  
</P>
<P>
	After one of the best-pitched games in postseason history, the  
Atlanta Braves arrived at the Astrodome on Thursday very much alive 
against Houston in the best-of-5 opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Glavine, the starter in Game 3 against Astros ace Mike  
Hampton, faces the unenviable task of following up Kevin Millwood's 
series-tying one-hitter in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even going to try'' to duplicate that performance,  
Glavine said after a light, 1 1/2-hour workout. ``I just want the same 
result, a win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros will have their best pitcher on the mound. Hampton  
was an NL-leading 22-4 during the regular season, putting him among 
the favorites to win his first Cy Young award. 
</P>
<P>
	But one gets the feeling he would gladly trade his chance at the  
Cy Young for a victory that would put his team in a commanding 
position to win a postseason series for the first time. Game 4 is 
Saturday, also at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	If a fifth game is needed, it would be Sunday at Turner Field.  
</P>
<P>
	``In this game, all the awards and accolades don't mean a lot,''  
Hampton said. ``What means something is for the guys around you to 
have confidence that you can do the job. It's been a great year for 
me, but I've got a lot of confidence in them, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Killer B's -- Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Derek Bell --  
will be reunited for the Astros in Game 3, although a more 
appropriate nickname might be the Killer Z's the way they've 
snoozed through the postseason. Biggio has a career average of 
.125, Bagwell .121 and Bell .069. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Bell had a disappointing, injury-plagued season,  
forcing him to the bench for most of the last month and the first 
two games of the division series. 
</P>
<P>
	But manager Larry Dierker plans to insert Bell in right field --  
the third different player to start at that position against the 
Braves -- and also put Matt Mieske in left. They provide two more 
right-handed bats against the left-handed Glavine, who had won his 
last eight decisions against the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good feeling to be back in there,'' said Bell, who hit  
only .236 with 12 homers in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves swept the Astros in the opening round of the playoffs  
two years ago, finishing off the series in Houston. This time, the 
Astros seized the home-field advantage by winning Game 1 in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to be 1-1 instead of 0-2,'' Bell said. ``We can  
relax and have fun. The pressure is on them. We've got the next two 
games at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine will surely give up more hits than Millwood, but the  
Braves have the right pitcher on the mound under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	After losing his first eight career decisions to the Astros,  
Glavine hasn't lost in his last 10 trips to the mound, going 8-0 
with a 1.30 ERA. His last loss against Houston came on June 25, 
1991, by a score of 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a comfort zone here,'' Glavine said, gazing around the  
spacious Astrodome. ``Also, their lineup hasn't changed a whole lot 
over the course of the last few years. I know these guys and I know 
what I'm trying to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, career records are much like mutual funds -- past  
performance is no guarantee of future success. The Astros proved 
that in Game 1 by beating Greg Maddux, who had a 19-9 career record 
against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at Maddux's numbers,'' Bell said. ``But we won the first  
game. In the playoffs, you can throw all that out the window. It 
comes down to who's ahead in the ninth inning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Killer B's are trying to break their 3-year-old  
playoff slump, Atlanta's MVP candidate, Chipper Jones, would like 
to see a few good pitchers after carrying his team offensively in 
the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was 1-for-5 in the first two games, walking three times  
and twice making outs while swinging anxiously at 3-0 pitches.

	``Normally, I would swing the bat on 3-0,'' he said. ``But in  
these kind of situations, where every at-bat is under the 
microscope, it's hard to be patient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones will try to break out against his offseason hunting buddy,  
having forged a relationship with Hampton when both were high 
school stars in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two or three years, they have met in south Georgia  
for a deer-hunting trip, ``just two rednecks who are never too far 
from their roots,'' Jones said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a real mutual respect for each other,'' he said. ``But  
I'm sure at about 3 or 4 o'clock tomorrow, that friendship will be 
put on hold for a few hours.''

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Still Not at Knicks Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell remained AWOL Thursday,  
and neither he nor his representatives contacted the New York 
Knicks with an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the bottom line is, barring a family emergency, he  
should be here,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``And if he had a 
family emergency, he should have called to let us know what's going 
on. He hasn't, and when he gets here we'll talk and go from 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks went through two more practices Thursday, making it  
six missed practices for Sprewell during his puzzling 
disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
	The team expected him to surface at their training camp site at  
College of Charleston as early as Monday night, and his agent, 
Robert Gist, told them Wednesday that he'd arrive from his home in 
Milwaukee by Thursday morning at the latest. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Scott Layden and trainer Mike Saunders tried  
various methods of telephoning Sprewell, all to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've reached out to him, yeah,'' Layden said. ``We haven't  
heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy and Layden both want to hear what Sprewell was doing  
before they decide whether this merits a fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never had guys miss practice,'' Van Gundy said. ``I  
don't think I've ever had a guy not be at practice who was supposed 
to be. I don't want to jump to conclusions about the particulars, 
because I don't know any of them. When he gets here, we'll sit down 
and talk and decide what to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates are also reserving judgment, but wonder whether  
Sprewell is handling this the right way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely would like to talk to Spree and see what he had  
to do, but, hey, I'm not in that situation,'' Larry Johnson said. 
``I'm not in Spree's shoes, so I don't know exactly what's going 
on, but we definitely would love to have our teammate here. 
</P>
<P>
	If Sprewell doesn't have a good excuse, Johnson said he would  
also address the matter as a tri-captain, friend and teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said the organization has been very supportive of  
Sprewell, but he has been frustrated by the lack of communication. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should be here. It's a team commitment to get here.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles Deciding Miller's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- If the Baltimore Orioles don't want Ray Miller  
back as manager, they aren't telling anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract that Miller signed on Nov. 11, 1997, contained a  
provision that stated the team would end its association with him 
if it did not pick up the option to retain him as manager within 72 
hours of the conclusion of the Orioles' 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, coming off his second straight losing season, met with  
owner Peter Angelos on Tuesday for a 90-minute talk. After that 
session, Miller said he granted an extension of the 72-hour window 
at the request of Angelos, who needed more time to reach a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him to take your time and do what you think is best,''  
Miller said. ``He doesn't have to worry about the 72-hour thing. 
Whenever he wants, I don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But The Washington Post, quoting team sources, reported in  
today's editions that Miller's tenure effectively ended when the 
Orioles failed to exercise the option within the 72-hour window. 
The paper said the team was expected to begin the search for a new 
manager today. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no announcement of Miller's dismissal. General manager  
Frank Wren refused to come to the phone late Wednesday night, and 
an Orioles spokesman denied any knowledge of Miller being fired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles didn't part company with Miller's predecessor in the  
traditional fashion, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Davey Johnson sent a fax to Angelos saying he would resign if he  
didn't get an extension or a buyout of his final year. Angelos 
waved goodbye to Johnson and hired Miller to guide a team coming 
off two straight appearances in the AL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	What followed were two straight losing seasons, including this  
year's 78-84 disaster, for a team that carried a $78.5 million 
payroll on opening day. The Orioles' payroll is the third-highest 
in the game behind the New York Yankees and Johnson's new team, the 
Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Miller's fate is sealed, Wren can't make a move to  
interview possible candidates for the job. Possible successors 
include former Milwaukee Brewers manager Phil Garner, Orioles 
director of player personnel Tom Trebelhorn and former Orioles 
player Don Baylor, now the Atlanta Braves' hitting coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Riggleman, fired by the Chicago Cubs on Monday, also is a  
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner and Riggleman would be available immediately. Baylor  
would need the Braves' permission to interview.

<HEADLINE> Metabolife Maker Targets ABC News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The maker of the popular dietary supplement  
Metabolife is taking the unusual step of attacking a television 
report on its product before it has even been aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Metabolife International Inc. is posting on the Internet a  
videotape of an interview that its chief executive, Michael Ellis, 
conducted with ABC News and is spending at least $1.5 million in 
advertising to call attention to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis said he is worried that a ``20/20'' story in the works on  
Metabolife may be negative and he accused ABC of ordering the story 
in retaliation for a lawsuit the company filed against an ABC 
affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	An ABC spokeswoman said the charge was ``utterly false'' and  
promised ABC's report would be fair and balanced. An air date 
hasn't been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``They clearly think this is as important an issue as we do, or  
else they wouldn't have been devoting all these resources to 
rebutting a piece that they haven't seen yet,'' ABC's Eileen Murphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A full-page ad directing people to a Web site with the interview  
ran in Wednesday editions of The New York Times. The company is 
planning ads nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I'm concerned about is that the whole story won't be out  
there,'' Ellis said. ```20/20' may, and I'm not saying they will, 
have a different agenda on how they want this story to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego-based Metabolife says it will approach nearly $1  
billion in sales this year. The supplement is popular among people 
who want to burn calories, but some medical authorities warn about 
side effects such as increased blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis said a ``20/20'' representative called to talk to  
Metabolife 10 days after the company filed a defamation lawsuit 
against WCVB-TV, an ABC affiliate in Boston, for a story it ran 
about potential harmful side effects from its products. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fear that this may be in retaliation,'' Ellis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said WCVB's story was one of the reports that persuaded  
ABC to take its own look into Metabolife. She denied any 
retribution was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Metabolife's ad says it is concerned ABC may ``selectively  
report'' comments from a medical expert. Ellis complained ABC would 
not speak to the medical authorities the company offered as 
interview subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	Metabolife has hired the same lawyers and public relations firm  
that worked for Food Lion, the North Carolina-based supermarket 
that successfully sued ABC News after a 1992 ``PrimeTime Live'' 
report that aired surreptitious video about allegedly spoiled food.

<HEADLINE> Snoozing Mets Fans Miss Highlights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Students, teachers and even New York Yankees  
were exhausted after watching -- or snoring through -- Game 1 of the 
Mets-Arizona series that concluded at 2:05 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	And that wasn't even as bad as Game 2, which ended 20 minutes  
later this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball's decision to televise as many games as  
possible meant that New Yorkers were up well past their bedtime to 
catch the first two games of the Mets series at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so tired, I couldn't hold my eyes open,'' Yankees  
pitcher Andy Pettitte said Wednesday. ``As soon as he (Edgardo 
Alfonzo) hit the home run, I turned the TV off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte got home just in time for the ninth inning Wednesday  
night after the Yankees-Rangers game ended at 11:49 p.m. EDT. The 
two games overlapped for 38 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was as fortunate as Pettitte to last until the  
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made it until the fifth inning and then nature took over,  
but I missed the ninth inning,'' said 17-year-old Mets fan Jeffrey 
Sable, a senior at Forest Hills High School in Queens. ``I just 
fell asleep and I couldn't help it. Today, I was taking a test and 
my eyes were closing. I think I did pretty bad because I couldn't 
stay awake. It's just not fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final out was recorded 2 hours, 53 minutes after it began.  
Many viewers fell asleep well before New York's Alfonzo provided 
the ninth inning dramatics with a grand slam to give the Mets an 
8-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad. It's wrong. Awful,'' said ESPN's Chris Berman, who  
worked the first two games of the Mets' NL playoff series at 
Arizona. ``Kids deserve a chance to see the teams. I'm disappointed 
as a fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely a detriment for kids,'' said Grover Cleveland  
High School assistant principal Ira Pernick. ``It hurts their 
studies. But there was no drop in attendance here and the students 
seemed to be alert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diamondbacks managing general partner Jerry Colangelo said major  
league baseball asked him which of the three starting times he 
favored. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have preferred our usual time (6:30 p.m. local time),  
but that wasn't one of the choices. It was 1, 4 or 8. I said 8 
because of our workers and the parking downtown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 2,500 workers at Bank One Ballpark also have day  
jobs or go to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it wasn't my call,'' he said. ``It was the networks'  
decision. They just asked for my preference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it was baseball's decision and had nothing to do with  
the networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to show all four games whenever possible,'' major  
league baseball spokesman Rich Levin said. ``The fact that Arizona 
is a western team doesn't leave us with many options. We'd rather 
it not be this way, but we try to get all the games on and this is 
what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN would have preferred a starting time in which the entire  
country would be able to watch. However, it wasn't the first time 
the cable network televised a late, late game on the East coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 3 of the NL playoff series between Houston and San Diego  
last year was televised at 11 p.m. EDT and posted a 3.0 rating, not 
far off from the 3.3 playoff average at ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets-Diamondbacks game had a 2.7 rating. Combined with the  
3.7 for an afternoon playoff between Atlanta and Houston, it gave 
ESPN a 3.2 average for its first-day coverage, up 15 percent from 
the network's 2.8 for the first two games last year.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Spread Across Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- A day after repelling a militia ambush,  
international peacekeepers spread out across rocky terrain today to 
prevent militiamen from entering East Timor to launch further 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been persistent reports that the militiamen have been  
massing just over the border in West Timor, where they fled after 
rampaging through East Timor in the wake of the territory's Aug. 30 
vote for independence from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of further violence rose after suspected militiamen  
attacked a group of peacekeepers late Wednesday about nine miles 
from the frontier. Two Australian soldiers were slightly injured 
and two militiamen were killed in the first clash since the 
international peacekeepers arrived Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, the Australian head of the  
multinational mission, said that although the peacekeepers had set 
up bases near the border, they had not completely blocked access 
from the Indonesian-controlled West Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say our forces are present in strength, but it's a  
long border and nobody is pretending that it is absolutely 
impermeable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrove dismissed criticism that the peacekeepers were not  
spreading out fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our peacekeepers are moving extremely quickly ... in this  
harsh terrain to establish security for the people to come out of 
the hills,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeeping mission was bolstered today by the arrival of  
the USS Belleau Wood, an amphibious assault ship. The ship arrived 
off the East Timor capital, Dili, carrying 900 Marines and 900 
sailors for logistical support, Marines spokesman Maj. Rick Long 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not including the forces on the ship, several dozen American  
troops are in East Timor. Another 300 are providing logistics, 
intelligence and other support from Darwin, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The force's deputy force commander, Maj. Gen. Songkitti  
Chakkabatr of Thailand, also arrived today with the vanguard of 
about 1,500 troops expected to arrive within a week. Those forces 
would bring the mission close to its authorized strength of 7,500 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The international force took control of East Timor after the  
pro-Indonesian militias, backed by elements of the Indonesian 
military, carried out a wave of violence, looting and arson 
following the independence vote. That vote still needs to be 
endorsed by the Indonesian parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Indonesians fear East Timor's breakaway will encourage  
separatists in other parts of the nation. An Indonesian general 
said today that the armed forces' top priority is keeping the 
country together. 
</P>
<P>
	The military is determined not to let Indonesia ``follow the  
same pattern of reform as the Soviet Union or Yugoslavia,'' 
Indonesian Lt. Gen. Agus Widjojo said at a seminar in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's official Antara news agency blamed the foreign  
peacekeepers for Wednesday's clash. It quoted one man as claiming 
they opened fired on a group of refugees returning to their homes 
to pick up goods and food. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeepers angrily denied that, but Cosgrove has described  
some of the militiamen who were detained briefly and sent back to 
West Timor as ``poor folk who actually are scrounging for food.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's violence started after Australian troops shot out  
the tires of a truck full of militiamen that ran a roadblock in 
Suai, a militia stronghold about 70 miles southwest of Dili. Four 
passengers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of militia members were disarmed and taken to the West  
Timor border. 
</P>
<P>
	As the peacekeepers drove back to Suai, they were ambushed,  
Cosgrove said. They returned fire, killing two men and forcing the 
rest to retreat. Two Australians were injured -- one shot at the 
base of his neck and the other shot in the leg and wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees from villages near Suai said the fighting militiamen  
had committed atrocities and forced residents into West Timor at 
gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of shooting. They came in trucks. We all  
ran,'' said Aniceto Xavier, a 31-year-old resident of Hatohudo. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty International said militiamen and Indonesian troops  
continued to target East Timorese refugees in West Timor. 
Kidnappings have been reported, and conditions in the refugee camps 
are deteriorating, with militias preventing aid workers from 
delivering food and medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The two wounded soldiers were flown to an Australian hospital  
for treatment today, defense sources said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Jackson St. Coach Carson Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Former Jackson State football coach James  
Carson, who was reassigned in May to the athletic department staff, 
died today at his home. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials confirmed the death, but did not have any  
details. A spokesman at Westhaven Funeral Home said funeral 
arrangements are incomplete. There was no immediate word on 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Carson asked to be relieved as coach duties after  
undergoing intestinal surgery a month earlier. Carson had missed 
all of spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Jackson State officials had declined to discuss his  
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Carson said he needed to have time to gain his strength back.  
</P>
<P>
	Carson's assistant head coach Robert Hughes was put in charge of  
the Tigers for this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Carson had a 54-25-1 career record at Jackson State, including  
Southwestern Athletic Conference championships in 1995-96. His 
teams made three trips to the NCAA Division I-AA playoffs. His best 
season was 1996 when the Tigers finished with a 10-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Carson had been a member of the Tiger coaching staff since 1977.  
</P>
<P>
	He was a 1963 graduate of Jackson State.

<HEADLINE> Some New England Foliage Thrives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Despite the summer drought that turned leaves brown, much of New  
England is awash in ambers, yellows and magentas -- and raking in 
the tourist dollars. But some are grumbling that the hues are 
duller than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy rains in September helped salvage the leaf-peeping  
season, when tourists trek to New England to ogle the fall foliage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The foliage is doing wonderful,'' raved Ally Lutz of the Maine  
Office of Tourism. ``The views are phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From Rhode Island to Maine, leaf watchers report that the color  
change is largely on schedule. Prime time for color change is 
typically the last two weeks in September and the first two in 
October, with activity starting in the north and working southward. 
</P>
<P>
	Back in August, there was fear that the drought wound ruin the  
autumn leaf show. Leaves on many trees turned brown and fell off, 
prompting fears there would be nothing left to change. 
</P>
<P>
	But after September's rains, including Tropical Storm Floyd, the  
remaining leaves started to turn their traditional reds, yellows 
and golds, said Ralph Scarpino of the Connecticut Forestry 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Art Steniford, owner of the Greenwood Motel in  
Greenville, Maine, said this year's foliage is ``bright but not 
like other years.'' And Kevin Adrien, manager of Leisure Life 
Family Resort in Greenville, complained that the leaves are ``kind 
of dull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A bunch of baloney,'' countered Dick Hamilton, president of  
the White Mountains Attractions Association, a promotional 
organization in North Woodstock, N.H. ``I look out my window right 
now and see some vibrant reds and oranges. If that's dull, I'll eat 
my hat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inns and tour groups throughout the region reported capacity  
crowds, though many visitors had booked well in advance, before the 
leaf controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaves are big business in New England. New Hampshire officials  
say foliage sightseers contribute about $850 million to the state's 
$3.1 billion tourism industry. In Vermont, the foliage draws about 
4 million people -- more than a quarter of all yearly visitors -- in 
a roughly two-month period, spending about $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	During normal years, trees' production of chlorophyll -- the  
pigment that makes leaves green -- slows and then stops as nights 
get longer and temperatures drop. With their green ``mask'' gone, 
the leaves' other pigments are revealed. The process can be 
affected by any kind of stress, including dehydration.

<HEADLINE> Report: UPS Ends Some Gun Deliveries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- United Parcel Service has decided to stop  
delivering handguns through its ground service, sending gunmakers 
scrambling to find alternatives to the world's largest package 
distribution company, The Morning Call reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based UPS -- which handles the vast majority of firearms  
shipments -- is changing its policy beginning Monday to reduce the 
risk of guns being stolen en route. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to protect ourselves from employees stealing and  
criminals stealing,'' UPS spokesman Bob Godlewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Handgun shipments have been stolen in the past, Godlewski said,  
although he would not say how many. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will continue to ship handguns by overnight air  
service, since such deliveries involve less risk than ground 
shipments that can take up to six days, Godlewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Overnight delivery, however, costs about $25 more per gun -- or  
about four times as much for a complete shipment, said Jim 
Chambers, executive director of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition 
Manufacturers' Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we're trying to come to grips with. We're looking  
for alternative methods,'' Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS will continue to ship long guns, rifles and shotguns by  
ground. Godlewski said handguns are more of a target for criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Each business day, Atlanta-based UPS delivers 12 million  
packages via its trademark brown trucks and brown-uniformed 
employees. UPS handles up to 75 percent of guns sent from 
manufacturers to distributors and nearly all firearms shipped from 
distributors to dealers, Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Postal Service also will not send handguns by ground  
shipment, said an employee at the service's nationwide Postal 
Answer Line. 
</P>
<P>
	A small gun dealer in Walnutport, Pa., said the UPS policy  
change would hurt his business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to kill me,'' said Paul Keifer, owner of Keifer's  
Gun Shop. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Koehler, owner of Eagle Arms Sport Shop near Breinigsville,  
said he supported the change if it helps keep guns off the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it costs a little more,'' Koehler said. ``I think it's a  
non-issue. It's their policy. Maybe one day they'll say they won't 
ship any guns.''

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European shares closed higher Thursday, after the  
European Central Bank decided to leave its key interest rates 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank President Wim Duisenberg said more evidence of inflation is  
needed to justify an interest rate rise. The bank left its main 
refinancing rate at 2.5 percent, where it has been since a 0.5 
percent cut in April. It also confirmed Thursday that its overnight 
deposit rate will remain at 1.5 percent and its marginal lending 
rate will continue to be 3.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 614 European companies rose 2.64  
points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 311.57. The best performing 
sector was telecommunications, up 2.3 percent, with MCI WorldCom's 
bid for Sprint earlier this week fueling talk about consolidation 
across Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, telecom shares were the best performers in the FTSE  
100 index of blue-chip shares, which closed with a gain of 1.7 
percent, at 6,200.4. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange led, closing up 88 pence at 1,312 pence; Energis rose 112  
pence to 1,771 pence; Telewest Communications rose 14.25 pence to 
236 pence; and Colt Telecom rose 98 pence to 1,668 pence. 
</P>
<P>
	London shares were also buoyed by the Bank of England's decision  
to leave its main lending rate unchanged at 5.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 310 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed up 2.46 points at 
327.78. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index rose 32.45 points to 3785.24,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed up 36.22 points at 3738.93. 
</P>
<P>
	In domestic markets, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 1.2  
percent to 5,419.31, the Paris CAC-40 index rose 1.1 percent to 
4,742.26, Amsterdam's AEX index rose 0.2 percent to 555.77 and 
Milan's MIBtel index rose 0.2 percent to 34,089.00.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Decry Altered Food Hype </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal agencies responsible for approving  
genetically engineered crops and biotech foods insist they can 
prevent products from getting to market that could be dangerous to 
consumers or the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very confident about the assurances that are put  
forward,'' said James Maryanski, biotechnology coordinator for the 
Food and Drug Administration's food safety office. 
</P>
<P>
	FDA is one of three agencies responsible for regulating  
genetically modified products, with the Environmental Protection 
Agency and the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Anderson, an EPA official, told the Senate Agriculture  
Committee on Thursday that the government's regulatory system ``is 
based on the most rigorous scientific information available, is 
credible, is defensible and will serve to protect the environment 
and public health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although genetic engineering has met relatively little  
resistance in the United States, concern about the technology has 
grown since a laboratory study at Cornell University found evidence 
that pollen from a genetically modified corn can kill larvae of the 
monarch butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA scientists knew that the pollen could kill insects but do  
not believe the butterflies, which feed on milkweed, not corn, 
would be exposed to the toxin outside the laboratory, said 
Anderson, director of EPA's biopesticides and pollution prevention 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	EPA is monitoring field tests of the corn and could impose  
restrictions on its use, if necessary, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the technology say the agencies depend too heavily on  
companies to conduct research and report problems, and that the 
science is not advanced enough to guarantee the safety of the food. 
Environmental and consumer groups are pushing the Clinton 
administration to require the labeling of foods that contain 
biotech ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what the products will prove to be in the long  
run. To say we know is an expression of faith, not of knowledge,'' 
said Mark Silbergeld, a representative of Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of genetic engineering insist it is not fundamentally  
different from traditional breeding, in which one plant might be 
cross-pollinated with a wild cousin to produce a hardier variety. 
Genetic engineering involves splicing a single gene from one 
organism to another. 
</P>
<P>
	A major concern of scientists is making sure transplanted genes  
do not cause allergic reactions. Biotech ingredients, primarily 
from soybeans and corn, already are in wide use in supermarkets and 
fast-food restaurants, in everything from tortilla chips to soda 
and baby formula. 
</P>
<P>
	When consumers realize that, they will demand such foods be  
labeled, Silbergeld said. ``They want to make the choice for 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The food industry fears such labeling would stigmatize  
genetically modified ingredients. The FDA does not consider biotech 
ingredients fundamentally different from conventional ones and says 
there is no need for the labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the soybeans that U.S. farmers are growing this year were  
engineered to withstand a popular weedkiller, and a third of the 
corn crop is biotech, having been altered to produce its own 
pesticide. There also are genetically modified tomatoes, melons and 
potatoes. Crops are in development that would be nutritionally 
enhanced or engineered to deliver vaccines or medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	American scientists and farmers have been surprised by the  
growing public resistance to genetic engineering in Europe. In 
Britain, where biotech products are derided as ``Frankenfoods,'' 
supermarkets have started advertising their goods as free of 
genetically modified ingredients.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Borrowing Rises in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' borrowing raced ahead in August,  
posting the largest monthly increase in seven months, led by strong 
demand for loans for everything from autos and boats to education 
and vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers' credit outstanding, excluding mortgage debt, advanced  
at a 9.6 percent annual rate in August to a seasonally adjusted 
$1.367 trillion, the Federal Reserve said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, consumers borrowed $10.8 billion more in August than  
during the month before. That was the biggest monthly increase 
since January when it rose by $15.3 billion 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in the level of borrowing in August was much  
stronger than many analysts expected. They were forecasting a 
monthly gain of $6.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are turning to their credit cards more as home  
refinancings have slowed because of rising interest rates and 
higher gas prices have taken a bite out of budgets,'' said First 
Union Corp. economist Mark Vitner. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of increase for August was the highest since May when  
consumer borrowing rose at 9.7 percent rate, and follows a 7.9 
percent rate gain in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for non-revolving loans led the overall increase. Those  
loans rose at a 10.1 percent rate in August. That category includes 
loans for autos, mobile homes, boats, trailers, education and 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that car sales were strong in August so it's not a  
surprise to see a big jump in that category,'' Vitner said. In 
July, non-revolving credit grew at an annual rate of 4.7 percent, a 
tad less than the Fed previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, revolving credit -- primarily credit cards revolving  
loans, rose at an annual rate of 8.9 percent in August, the slowest 
pace since May when revolving credit grew by 4.4 percent. In July, 
revolving credit rose at a rate of 12.1 percent, the same as the 
Fed originally estimated.

<HEADLINE> Indictments Soon in China Trade Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has decided to charge a  
U.S. aerospace company and a Chinese company with violating U.S. 
export controls after some machine tools were diverted for possible 
use on Chinese missiles, The Associated Press learned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Justice officials have approved offering the companies a  
plea bargain of reduced charges in return for guilty pleas. If a 
deal is not reached, the Justice Department will seek an 
indictment, it was learned. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are McDonnell Douglas, now a subsidiary of the  
Boeing Co., and the China National Aero-Technology Import Export 
Corp., a state-owned Chinese aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involved McDonnell Douglas' sale in 1994 of surplus  
machine tools to the Chinese company for $5 million. The U.S 
government had licensed the tools to the Chinese company only for 
use on commercial aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	However, McDonnell Douglas learned shortly thereafter that the  
tools had been diverted to a facility that produces Chinese 
Silkworm missiles, and informed the U.S. government of the 
diversion. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors believe that the companies knew or should have known  
that the tools would be diverted before the diversion was reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials, however, have argued that the case against the  
Chinese company is stronger than the one against McDonnell Douglas 
because the U.S. company reported the diversions to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Time magazine, which first reported the story on its Website,  
said the deadline given the companies was Oct. 21, but the exact 
date could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry McCracken, a spokesman for Boeing, told Time, ``We  
continue to believe that McDonnell Douglas acted properly in this 
matter. We've maintained that this is how the system was supposed 
to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Financier Indicted on 36 Counts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- As financier Martin R. Frankel sits in a  
prison cell in Hamburg, Germany, the charges against him back home 
in the United States are mounting. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel was indicted Thursday on 20 counts of wire fraud, 13  
counts of money laundering and one count each of securities fraud, 
racketeering and conspiracy by a federal grand jury in Bridgeport. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, 44, who was arrested in Germany Sept. 4, is accused of  
absconding with more than $200 million in insurance company assets 
he was supposed to have invested. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of all charges, Frankel faces a maximum of 410  
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel disappeared from his fortress-like Greenwich mansions in  
early May. Days later, firefighters responding to an automatic 
alarm found the homes littered with smoldering documents and a 
``to-do'' list upon which item No. 1 was ``Launder money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel, a native of Toledo, Ohio, had been barred from  
securities trading years earlier by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. He worked from Greenwich, a bedroom community of New 
York City, in a two-home compound equipped with numerous television 
sets, computers and the high-tech tools of international finance. 
</P>
<P>
	When it appeared his financial dealings were about to be  
exposed, investigators say, Frankel fled to Europe with a wad of 
cash and a cache of diamonds, living first in Italy and later in 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel is accused of running a ``racketeering enterprise''  
which bought up insurance companies. The indictment says Frankel 
then siphoned the insurers' cash reserves and used them to purchase 
mansions, cars, diamonds and gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel is awaiting extradition to the United States. Frankel  
has said he plans to fight extradition, although both American and 
German lawyers have recently quit the case after the U.S. 
government froze his assets and left Frankel struggling to pay his 
legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
	A public defender has been appointed in Hartford. He did not  
return a message seeking comment. Frankel's new lawyer in Germany 
also did not return a phone call seeking comment, which was left 
after business hours there. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators say Frankel's unlicensed brokerage siphoned at least  
$218 million from insurers in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Oklahoma and Tennessee. A lawsuit filed by some of the companies 
puts the loss at $915 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Mississippi have said they plan to ask a grand  
jury for indictments against Frankel and his associates for 
allegedly stealing more than $200 million from insurance companies 
in that state. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi Insurance Commissioner George Dale said he welcomes  
the Connecticut indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping this could lead to us being able to recover some of  
the millions of dollars we think belong to our re-insurance 
companies,'' Dale said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tennessee, authorities last month charged Frankel and  
unidentified associates with stealing more than $18 million from 
the Franklin American Life Insurance Co. District Attorney General 
Ron Davis said he was pleased by the Connecticut federal 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It couldn't happen to a nicer guy,'' Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Delays Humana Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A judge scolded a lawyer for  
``trying to poison the well'' of potential jurors in his client's 
trial against an insurance company and ordered them to stop making 
public statements. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial to determine whether Humana Inc. should pay Mark Chipps  
for cutting back the treatment for his daughter, who has cerebral 
palsy, was to begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge already found Humana liable for breach of contract,  
fraud and bad faith after the company failed to respond to repeated 
court orders to turn over documents in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Chipps, and his lawyer, Ted Leopold, staged a news conference  
Wednesday -- with Chipps' wife and now 8-year-old daughter, Caitlyn 
-- to discuss the case and make allegations of widespread misconduct 
against Humana. 
</P>
<P>
	Such public statements violate state rules of conduct concerning  
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana immediately filed a motion for a change of venue and  
asked a judge to sanction Leopold and Chipps. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Circuit Judge James T. Carlisle accused the  
attorney of ``trying to poison the well,'' Humana said in a 
release. The judge refused to change the location of the trial but 
granted Humana a delay of no less than 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased with the court's rulings resulting from Mr.  
Leopold's inappropriate conduct,'' said spokeswoman Pam Gadinsky. 
``When all the facts of this case are presented to the court we 
believe we will prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chipps claim Humana made promises of covering care for  
Caitlyn to lure them to a Humana policy, then renegged on those 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
	Leopold did not immediately return a call for comment, and  
Chipps' home telephone number was not listed.

<HEADLINE> Virus Claims 6th Victim in NY Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) -- A sixth person in the New York City  
metropolitan region has died from the West Nile-like virus, health 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 76-year-old woman, who lived in Nassau County just east of  
the city, died several days ago, said county Health Department 
spokeswoman Cynthia Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	The mosquito-borne virus so far has infected 54 people in the  
metropolitan area, according to the state Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, meanwhile, doctors were examining an encephalitis  
patient to see if he was suffering from the same strain that killed 
the six victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point there is no evidence that this case here is  
linked to that outbreak,'' said Dr. Elliot Frank of Jersey Shore 
Medical Center, where the man was in critical condition. ``The only 
thing unusual is that we happen to be a state next to a state 
that's having an outbreak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no confirmed cases of West Nile-like virus in  
New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus -- never before recorded in the Western Hemisphere -- is  
believed to have entered the United States in infected birds. 
Hundreds of dead birds have been found in recent weeks from 
Connecticut south to New Jersey and Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	In rare cases, the virus can cause neurological disorders and  
death. The elderly, young and those with weakened immune systems 
are most vulnerable.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Iraq Sign Oil Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Iraq has signed contracts with Russian companies  
to supply oil production equipment worth $57 million, a top Russian 
official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals were signed during a recent visit by a Russian  
delegation to Baghdad, Fuel and Energy Minister Viktor Kalyuzhny 
was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. He didn't name 
the Russian companies or provide any other details on the 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has also asked Russia to prepare a contract for pumping  
water to the Qurna oil field, the report said. The sides also 
prepared a deal on the joint drilling of 100 wells in the Northern 
Rumeila oil field. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has provided food and equipment for oil production worth  
hundreds of millions of dollars to Iraq under a food-for-oil 
program, the only exception to U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 
1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been the leading buyer of Iraqi oil even though it is  
itself one of the world's largest oil producers. Russia hopes that 
its efforts will be rewarded when sanctions are lifted against 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq owes billions of dollars to Moscow, mostly for weapons  
purchased in the 1980s, and Russia would like to get at least some 
of that money back through contracts to rebuild Iraq's oil 
industry.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Faces Zimbabwe at Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With the volatile John McEnroe in charge and  
Andre Agassi back on the team, the Americans will be heavy 
favorites will they face Zimbabwe in the first round of the Davis 
Cup on Feb. 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough travel trip, but I like our chances,'' McEnroe  
said at a news conference in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States was drawn Thursday to play at Harare,  
Zimbabwe, in a potentially tricky first-round World Group match. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zimbabwe, which upset Australia away from home two years  
ago, has a strong veteran team led by brothers Byron and Wayne 
Black. And the Americans will have to cope with a long trip to an 
unfamiliar country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a very tricky first match for John,'' said Boris  
Becker, the former three-time Wimbledon champion who manages 
Germany's Davis Cup team. ``They will have to travel to Africa 
after the Australian Open. That will be hard on the players, and 
the Black brothers perform well under pressure. America has to play 
with its best team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe said he recently talked to Pete Sampras about playing.  
</P>
<P>
	Then he dropped to his knees with his hands clasped as in  
prayer, saying, ``Here's the nature of my talk with Pete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he realizes it's the right thing to do.'' McEnroe  
said. ``I think his priorities have shifted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe also noted that Todd Martin has indicated a desire to  
play and said he would like Jim Courier to consider playing 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think things are turning around in a positive way,'' McEnroe  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimbabwe's top tennis official described the pairing with the  
United States as a ``dream draw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be the biggest sporting event ever in Zimbabwe,''  
tennis federation president Paul Chingoka said. ``It can't get any 
bigger than this. Just think. A small nation like ours hosting a 
giant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The result of the match doesn't matter so much. Having  
McEnroe, Agassi and hopefully Sampras coming to town will have a 
huge impact on the development of tennis in Zimbabwe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The matches will be played on an indoor hard court at the  
5,000-seat City Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's already sold out,'' Chingoka said. ``The atmosphere will  
be electric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Davis Cup crowds in some countries can be rowdy and  
unruly, Chingoka said the Americans will have nothing to fear in 
Harare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zimbabwe is a sporting country,'' he said. ``The fans will  
applaud the Americans. They will never be hostile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Americans beat Zimbabwe, they will next face either  
Britain or the Czech Republic in the second round. That throws up a 
possible repeat of this year's thrilling first-round match at 
Birmingham, England, where the Americans, with Martin and Courier 
playing singles, beat Britain's Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The other leading countries in America's top half of the draw  
are Spain, which entertains Italy, and Russia, which plays at home 
against Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia, which beat the United States in this year's  
quarterfinals, plays France in the final at Nice on Dec. 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australians will open next year's competition in  
Switzerland, Germany will be at home against the Netherlands, 
France will play in Brazil, and Slovakia entertains Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe was appointed U.S. captain last month, capping a long

Gullikson, who captained the team for six years but bore the blame 
for the U.S. defeat to Australia in suburban Boston.

<P>
	McEnroe is one of America's most successful Davis Cup players,  
compiling an overall record of 59-10 and playing on five 
championship winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the draw, McEnroe got a boost when Agassi  
announced he would play in the first round. Agassi, who is back at 
No. 1 in the world rankings after winning the French Open and U.S. 
Open this year, had vowed earlier this year never to play Davis Cup 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, who has had a history of run-ins with the U.S. Tennis  
Association, changed his mind when McEnroe was appointed, 
announcing at the U.S. Open that he would play Davis Cup next year.

<P>
	``I think he's going to be the best captain ever so far,''  
Agassi said. ``He'll bring a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of energy, a 
lot of experience. It's an advantage to have someone on your team 
with his kind of fighting spirit.''

<P>
	Sampras has been sidelined with a herniated disc in his back, an  
injury that forced him to pull out of the U.S. Open.

<HEADLINE> Labor Unions Warm to Clinton-Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Vice President Al Gore appearing likely  
to win the AFL-CIO endorsement he long has coveted, his boss 
planned to reach out to Teamster leader Jim Hoffa, a vocal critic 
who has argued against early support for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton tonight was attending the 24th annual Labor  
Research Associates dinner, which was honoring Hoffa in New York. A 
separate meeting with Hoffa also was planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents have steered clear of the Teamsters in recent years  
due to the union's legacy of corruption and Teamsters officials 
cast the visit as recognition of Hoffa's reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	But administration and Teamsters officials said the thrust of  
Clinton's meeting with Hoffa would be union opposition to opening 
the border to Mexican truck drivers under the North American Free 
Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted that he has already discussed the endorsement with  
the AFL-CIO executive council and indicated that wouldn't be a 
major focus of his chat with Hoffa. ``That is not the purpose of my 
going there,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa's campaign for the union presidency publicly accused  
Clinton administration officials of meddling in union politics in 
1996 to support incumbent Ron Carey, but Clinton dismissed any 
characterization of the meeting as a fence-mending mission. Hoffa 
finally took office earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not mending any fences,'' Clinton said. ``I have actually  
enjoyed a fairly constructive relationship with the Teamsters for 
the last 6 1/2 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the meeting had  
been in the planning for months, and the fact that Clinton was 
attending a fund-raiser a few blocks away from the dinner made it 
convenient for Clinton to stop by. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's dinner invitation came from Dennis Rivera, head of the  
health care workers union 1199 and a powerful player in New York 
politics. Rivera is a strong supporter of first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's senatorial aspirations and a key player in the state's 
presidential sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Lockhart said ``politics may come up,'' other  
administration officials would not say whether Clinton would raise 
Hoffa's opposition to an early AFL-CIO endorsement of Gore. ``I'll 
let you know if he does,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many labor leaders, particularly those from the large industrial  
unions most affected by the NAFTA, have complained at times that 
Clinton has shown little gratitude for labor's support. 
</P>
<P>
	But they also recognize he signed the Family and Medical Leave  
Act and opposed Republican attempts to turn back labor laws 
governing wages and cut funding for safety programs. The 
administration also has worked with labor to push education funding 
and health care issues to the center of the political debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we may have some differences on trade, there's not a  
single other issue of importance to union members and working 
families that Al Gore and Bill Clinton haven't been there with 
us,'' said Communications Workers of America President Morton Bahr, 
whose union endorsed Gore in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Federation of Teachers endorsed Gore on Tuesday, a  
nice prelude to next week's AFL-CIO convention in Los Angeles where 
more than a dozen labor and political officials said they expect 
Gore to win the federation's endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and his Democratic presidential challenger, Bill Bradley,  
have fought hard to influence that vote. Bradley's campaign has 
been surging and preventing Gore from winning the support of a 
major Democratic constituency would be a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The painters union has been vocal in its support of Bradley, and  
staff-level operatives in other unions have warmed to his appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore has enough votes to win the support of the federation's  
executive council, and the real question in union leaders' minds is 
whether they could be endorsing too early. The Teamsters have 
indicated they will wait out the primary season. 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO President John Sweeney won't settle for a technical  
endorsement that could reflect divisions within the federation. But 
several union presidents who were officially on the fence have told 
Sweeney they would support him if he sought a Gore endorsement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumers Keep Buying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans maintained their shopping spree at the  
nation's stores and malls in September, hardly slowed by volatility 
in the stock market, stormy weather and rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	While sales reports Thursday were generally strong, some  
merchants lost business because of Hurricane Floyd, which battered 
the East Coast last month. The storm also boosted the number of 
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits to the 
highest level in more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hurricane did hurt some in September, but overall, sales  
were good and all indications are that this will continue through 
the end of the year and into the Christmas season,'' said Steve 
Paspal, senior retail analyst at Sovereign Asset Management, a 
subsidiary of John Hancock Funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers continue to enjoy one of their strongest years in  
recent history. They have benefited greatly from the resilient U.S. 
economy with low unemployment and tame inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately on Thursday, the Labor Department reported new claims  
for jobless benefits rose by 10,000 to reach 312,000 last week, the 
highest level since July 17. While the increase was bigger than 
many analysts expected, the total remains very low. 
</P>
<P>
	Many merchants have worried in recent months that borrowing and  
spending would slow after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 
twice this summer to try to keep the economy from overheating and 
to head off a resurgence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Fed's rate hikes have unsettled investors and shaken  
the stock market, consumers so far haven't slowed their spending or 
borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve reported Thursday that Americans' borrowing  
advanced at a 9.6 percent annual rate in August to a seasonally 
adjusted $1.367 trillion. That was the biggest monthly growth since 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we still have a really strong consumer environment and  
that doesn't seem to be changing,'' said Jay Farmer, a partner in 
the retailing group at Andersen Consulting. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners in September were the discount chains, such as  
Wal-Mart and Target, which continue to draw consumers with their 
wide selection and affordable prices. Kmart, however, reported 
disappointing sales due to aggressive price-cutting by competitors 
on back-to-school merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many other merchants, the discount chains benefited from  
Hurricane Floyd, with shoppers flocking to their stores to 
stockpile everything from flashlights to food. 
</P>
<P>
	Many department stores and specialty chains, however, were hurt  
by the storm, which caused extensive flooding that closed malls and 
roadways. 
</P>
<P>
	Specialty stores, such as the Limited, also reported healthy  
sales, luring shoppers with their trendy fashions, such as stretchy 
pants and vests. Cooler weather moving into parts of the country 
also lifted clothing sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprising analysts was Sears, which reported  
better-than-expected sales after months of disappointments. Strong 
demand for appliances, consumer electronics and women's apparel 
boosted sales last month. 
</P>
<P>
	With decent sales in August and September, analysts are  
expecting many merchants to report healthy earnings growth for the 
third-quarter, which ends for most retailers in late October or 
early November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inventories are in great shape. Margins are good,'' said Wayne  
Hood, retail analyst at Prudential Securities in Atlanta. ``And 
there is no reason to believe that things will slow down in the 
month of October.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Merrill Lynch retail index, the investment firm's barometer  
of sales performance at department stores and discount chains, rose 
5.6 percent in September. It rose 4.6 percent in July and August. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting a jump on its competitors, Wal-Mart reported Tuesday  
that its sales from stores open at least a year rose 7.2 percent in 
September compared with a year ago, while total sales rose 26.4 
percent from year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store  
sales, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Selected figures on September's sales at leading retail chains:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears, same-store sales rose 4.1 percent, total sales were flat  
with a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart, same-store sales up 2.5 percent, total sales up 4.5  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney, same-store department store sales down 0.1  
percent; same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores up 10.1 percent; 
total sales up 8.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson, same-store sales up 6.9 percent, total sales up  
11.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated, same-store sales up 3.7 percent, total sales up 15.7  
percent. Federated's total sales include revenues from the Internet 
and catalog seller Fingerhut, which was acquired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores, same-store sales up 1.7 percent, total  
sales up 6.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited, same-store sales up 8 percent, total sales fell about  
1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap, same-store sales up 7 percent, total sales up 28 percent.

<HEADLINE> Saberhagen's Timing, Location Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The location of Bret Saberhagen's pitches  
wasn't the only thing that was off. So was his timing. 
</P>
<P>
	He picked a terrible time to lose his control -- in the second  
game of the best-of-5 first-round series against Cleveland -- and 
the Indians took advantage Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen had walked just 11 batters in 119 innings this  
season. But he walked three in the third inning, when the Indians 
scored six runs in an 11-1 win over the Boston Red Sox that gave 
them a 2-0 lead in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked very hard to take pride in games like this,''  
Saberhagen said. ``I think I was trying maybe too hard, maybe too 
much adrenaline going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen, who has a tender right shoulder, had three stints on  
the disabled list this season. Still, he was 10-6 with a 2.95 ERA 
and walked more than one batter in just two of his 22 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt very good today and I think maybe the one thing that I  
didn't do enough was make my pitches,'' he said. ``I just didn't do 
it when I had to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't missing by much,'' Boston catcher Jason Varitek  
said. ``They made him get the ball over the plate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen lasted just 2 2-3 innings, striking out two, walking  
three and allowing six runs and five hits. The biggest blow was 
Harold Baines' three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had hoped to come here and do a lot better than what we've  
done,'' Saberhagen said. ``At times, we played very well against 
them. So I think we've got to remind ourselves of that.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Syphilis Rate at Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- As the syphilis rate in the United States hits a  
record low, federal health officials are hoping to take advantage 
of the opportunity to wipe out the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 2.6 cases of syphilis for every 100,000 people in  
1998, a 19 percent decline from the rate of 3.2 a year earlier, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an unprecedented window of opportunity to eliminate  
syphilis in the United States because rates are at an all-time low 
and because the disease now is extremely concentrated 
geographically,'' said Dr. Judith Wasserheit, director of the CDC's 
sexually transmitted disease prevention division. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the 6,993 cases reported in 1998 came from 28 counties,  
or less than 1 percent of all U.S. counties. About 80 percent of 
all counties reported no new cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeon General David Satcher and CDC Director Jeffrey Koplan,  
joined Thursday night by other national and local public health 
officials in Nashville, Tenn., announced the CDC's new initiative 
to eliminate the sexually transmitted disease. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2005, the federal government hopes to reduce syphilis cases  
to a rate of 0.4 per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Syphilis is an entirely preventable disease and it is very  
easy to diagnosis and to treat,'' Wasserheit said. ``No American 
should have to face this disease in the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, aimed at areas with a heavy burden of syphilis cases  
or a potential for re-emergence, calls for closer monitoring, more 
community involvement, quicker response to outbreaks and greater 
access to health care for those infected or exposed. Nashville, 
Indianapolis and Raleigh, N.C., are the three initial sites where 
the plan will be put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Syphilis is a bacterial infection that starts with painless  
sores and then a rash and can attack the heart and brain and cause 
dementia and death. It can be cured if treated early with 
antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest rate reported last year was 5.1 per 100,000 in the  
South, which accounted for 19 of the 28 counties that had the 
highest number of cases. The rate was higher among blacks -- 17.1 
per 100,000 compared with 0.5 among whites. But the disparity has 
narrowed since the beginning of this decade, when rates among 
blacks were 64 times those of whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Syphilis, like many other health problems, tends to persist in  
communities that are plagued by a number of social problems 
including poverty, lack of access to health care and racism,'' 
Wasserheit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The syphilis rate has been declining in the United States since  
1990, when it peaked at 50,578 cases, or 20.3 cases per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop has been attributed, in part, to increased funding for  
treatment and safe-sex practices prompted by the outbreak of AIDS, 
such as using condoms and having fewer partners.

<HEADLINE> Cards' Tackle Ready for Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals sure could use some  
good news, and they finally got some. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Swann, the Arizona Cardinals' two-time Pro Bowl defensive  
tackle who's been out nearly a year while recovering from two 
operations on his arthritic right knee, is ready to play again. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors have cleared him, and he plans to see action in  
long-yardage situations against the New York Giants on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The knee's doing great,'' Swann said after Thursday's  
practice. ``I passed all the tests, the endurance test on it and 
the sprint test, so we're going to go out and just have some fun 
this weekend with the Giants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5 Swann, who said he's lost 30 pounds since he last  
played at a slimmed-down 305 pounds. He said that initially he will 
go in on second- and third-and-long situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm needed, I'll probably go in for more,'' Swann said.  
``If not, we're going to take it slow and re-evaluate it after 
three weeks. If everything is fine by then, I'm cleared to go the 
rest of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis said it's important to limit  
Swann's participation at first. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will use him in this ball game,'' McGinnis said, ``but when  
and how much will depend on what goes on the rest of the week. He 
won't play 70 snaps, that's for sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swann has been severely criticized by some fans and local sports  
talk show hosts who thought he abandoned the team by not trying to 
come back for last year's playoff run following the first surgery. 
But Swann has said he did what he had to do to try to save his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had to do something if I wanted to continue to play  
football, and my heart's still in the game,'' Swann said. ``I'm not 
done with the game yet. I've got probably another good six or seven 
years left in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swann, plagued by constant pain that he compared with ``running  
around with a tack in your shoe,'' first underwent surgery by 
Cardinals team doctor Russell Chick shortly after the seventh game 
last season, which also was against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissatisfied with the outcome, he had a second, more extensive  
and unorthodox surgery performed by Dr. Richard Steadman, the noted 
knee specialist in Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	What followed was a long rehabilitation process.  
</P>
<P>
	``I see a guy that's anxious to get back, didn't like the  
situation he was in and has worked extremely hard to get back,'' 
coach Vince Tobin said. ``It's been the popular thing to throw 
brickbats at Eric Swann, but I've seen a guy that's worked awfully 
hard in a very lonely, regimented routine to get back as quickly as 
he can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swann's imminent return was welcome news to a team that limps  
into the Giants game with a 1-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully he'll be lifting up those guards and centers on the  
other team and throwing them in the backfield,'' quarterback Jake 
Plummer said. ``It's great to have him back. He's worked so hard. 
I'm excited to see him play. He's such a force in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swann said he knows opponents will target his knee in his first  
few games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they are. I've been doing that myself,'' he said with  
a smile. ``I've allowed my 2-year-old to jump up and down on it, 
and cut block me and everything else, so it feels great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Cardinals were awaiting word from defensive  
tackle Mark Smith, who went to Colorado for a second opinion from 
Steadman on what should be done about fluid on Smith's right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	If Smith has arthroscopic surgery, he could be out 3-4 weeks.

<HEADLINE> West Antarctic May Melt Completely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The massive West Antarctic ice sheet may be  
headed for a complete meltdown in a process that a new study 
indicates was triggered thousands of years ago, not as a result of 
global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	As scientists have been increasingly able to document melting  
and the discovery of icebergs breaking off from Antarctica in 
recent years, concerns have risen that human-induced climate change 
could be damaging the Antarctic ice sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	But the future of the West Antarctic ice sheet ``may have been  
predetermined when the grounding line retreat was triggered in 
early Holocene time,'' about 10,000 years ago, a team of scientists 
led by Howard Conway of the University of Washington reports in 
Friday's edition of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	The grounding line is the boundary between floating ice and ice  
thick enough to reach the sea floor, and the scientists found that 
line has receded about 800 miles since the last ice age, 
withdrawing at an average of about 400 feet per year for the last 
7,600 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like the rate (of melting) that been going since the  
early Holocene is similar to the rate right now,'' Conway said in a 
telephone interview. ``Collapse appears to be part of an ongoing 
natural cycle, probably caused by rising sea level initiated by the 
melting of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets at the end of the 
last ice age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continued shrinking of the ice sheet, perhaps even complete  
disintegration, ``could well be inevitable,'' the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The ice sheet's disappearance is of concern because of estimates  
that its complete melting could raise the global sea level by 15 to 
20 feet, swamping low-lying coastal communities around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	At the current rate of melting, that will take about 7,000  
years, the researchers estimate. Conway said the melting annually 
contributes about 1 millimeter -- nearly one-twenty-fifth of an inch 
-- to sea-level rise. 
</P>
<P>
	While the study indicates global warming is not causing the  
melting, climate change remains a problem, Conway said: ``Global 
warming could well speed the process. Our study doesn't address 
that problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists have grown concerned that industrial chemicals  
added to the atmosphere are trapping heat like a greenhouse, 
causing the Earth's temperature to increase. There is disagreement, 
however, about the process and how great a hazard it may pose. 
</P>
<P>
	Conway's report is one of three in this issue of Science  
focusing on the Antarctic ice sheet. In the others: 
</P>
<P>
	--Scientists studying satellite-based measurements found a  
complex system of tributaries feeding major rivers of ice on the 
West Antarctic Ice Sheet. This web of tributaries forms a 
transition zone between the sluggish inland ice and the swiftly 
moving ice streams closer to the margins. 
</P>
<P>
	--Other researchers, using the ages of volcanic debris that  
erupted onto the ice sheet, reconstructed the past elevation of the 
West Antarctic Ice Sheet as it began to melt just after the end of 
the last ice age. They concluded the sheet was not the source of a 
massive flow of meltwater into the oceans 10,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	West Antarctica is the section of the continent south of the tip  
of South America. It is covered by an ice sheet that extends about 
360,000 square miles -- close to the combined areas of Texas and 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Conway's team calculated the movement of the grounding line  
using evidence gathered from raised beaches and radar imaging of 
subsurface ice structures. The timing of start of the melting was 
determined by carbon-14 dating of samples found on raised beaches.

<HEADLINE> Court Strikes Down Race-Based Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Montgomery County public school officials  
should not have relied solely on race to deny a white couple's 
request to transfer their 7-year-old to another school, according 
to an appeals court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was handed down Wednesday by the same Fourth U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals that struck down a similar race-based 
school admissions policy in Arlington, Va., last month. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in those and similar cases around the country is  
whether school districts can allow or deny students admission into 
schools, classes or special programs because of their race or 
ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I read it, it sounds like they have invalidated the policy,  
said Patricia Brannan, the school district's attorney who argued 
before the appeals court in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what this means in terms of impact on other  
students,'' she said. ``We're just going to have to figure that 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Eisenberg, father of 7-year-old Jacob and a lawyer who  
handled his own appeal, says he feels vindicated by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jacob was about to enter first grade last year, his parents  
sought to enroll him in Rosemary Hills Elementary School's math and 
science magnet program. 
</P>
<P>
	The request was denied because of its so-called ``impact on  
diversity'', according to a letter the Eisenbergs received. 
</P>
<P>
	``Race is a difficult and unsettled issue in this country. I  
regret being on the opposite side of the dispute of those who are 
trying to solve the problem,'' Eisenberg said. ``But Montgomery 
County's case had no merit. It's clear they now have to try to 
promote diversity in a race-neutral fashion.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Adopts Sex Bias Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. General Assembly has adopted a  
legal protocol that will enable women for the first time to submit 
sex discrimination complaints directly to the United Nations if 
they don't get heard in their home country. 
</P>
<P>
	The protocol does not require, however, that countries hand over  
information about individual cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Acting without a vote, the assembly adopted the 21-article  
optional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms 
of Discrimination against Women. The assembly also urged all 
parties to the treaty to ratify it as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The optional protocol to the convention was opened for  
signatures after it was approved Wednesday. It will enter into 
force as soon as 10 countries have ratified it. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention, adopted by the General Assembly in December 1979  
and ratified by 163 countries, bars abuses against women. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the treaty requires that women have equal  
rights to work, pay, benefits and safe working conditions. It also 
prohibits discrimination against women in political activities and 
requires a minimum age for marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	But the treaty did not include complaint procedures so women  
could bring their grievances before the United Nations if they 
weren't addressed by their own countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty years later, women are likely to get that right.  
</P>
<P>
	After four years of negotiations, the Commission on the Status  
of Women approved the optional protocol in March and sent it to the 
General Assembly for final approval.

<HEADLINE> Self-Destructing E-mail Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Thinking of sending a harassing e-mail  
message? Getting involved in an interoffice affair? How about an 
arms-for-hostages deal? 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a product for you: e-mail that becomes impossible to read  
after as little as a few seconds or minutes, using a self-destruct 
feature set by the sender. 
</P>
<P>
	A startup high-tech firm, Disappearing Inc., has developed a way  
to put time-bombs in e-mail messages, ensuring that they are 
readable only as long as the sender wants them to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a cool idea,'' said Kerry Stackpole, head of the  
Electronic Messaging Association, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	E-mail, designed to be a fleeting, spur-of-the-moment way of  
communicating, has turned up as evidence in lawsuits -- witness Bill 
Gates' threats against Microsoft's rivals -- and even congressional 
investigations into Monicagate and the Iran-Contra affair. 
Virtually every workplace has its own horror stories of e-mail 
reaching the wrong people. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would stop them cold,'' Stackpole said.  
</P>
<P>
	The system, which should be available early next year, encrypts  
each message with an electronic key, also held by the receiver. The 
sender can decide how long the key will work -- anywhere from a few 
seconds to years. After that, the key self-destructs and the 
message becomes unreadable. 
</P>
<P>
	The system works within a company's existing e-mail system.  
Messages flow through existing servers and companies can continue 
to use their current e-mail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Disappearing Inc. is a privately held company that was formed in  
February.

	House OKs HMO Lawsuit Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House today approved a sweeping bill meant  
to give patients a stronger hand in dealing with their health 
insurance companies, including a controversial new right to file 
lawsuits. The final vote was 275-151. Now the House bill must be 
reconciled with a considerably more limited version already 
approved by the Senate. The Senate bill has no new rights to sue 
and excludes many Americans from other patient protections. 
Earlier, the House rejected a GOP-backed patient protection bill 
that included new rights to sue, but only in federal court and only 
in limited circumstances.

	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- American Home Products Corp. resolved one of  
the largest product liability cases ever today by agreeing to pay 
$3.75 billion to settle claims that its once-popular fen-phen diet 
drug combination caused dangerous heart valve problems. The 
settlement covers thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide, along 
with any of the roughly six million people who took the drugs even 
if they didn't sue. It will include money to pay those who say they 
were made ill by the drugs and for future medical monitoring for 
those who are still healthy. Individual benefits will range from 
$30 for prescription refunds to a maximum of $1.5 million per 
person for people with serious health problems. AHP shares were at

	U.S. Consumers Keep Buying  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans maintained their shopping spree at the  
nation's stores and malls in September, hardly slowed by volatility 
in the stock market, stormy weather and rising interest rates. 
While sales reports today were generally strong, some merchants 
lost business because of Hurricane Floyd, which battered the East 
Coast last month. The storm also boosted the number of Americans 
filing new claims for employment benefits to the highest level in 
more than two months. Indicatons are that good retail sales will 
continue through the end of the year and into the Christmas season, 
according to Steve Paspal, senior retail analyst at Sovereign Asset 
Management, a subsidiary of John Hancock Funds.

	Consumer Borrowing Rises in August  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' borrowing raced ahead in August,  
posting the largest monthly increase in seven months, led by strong 
demand for loans for everything from autos and boats to education 
and vacation. Consumers' credit outstanding, excluding mortgage 
debt, advanced at a 9.6 percent annual rate in August to a 
seasonally adjusted $1.367 trillion, the Federal Reserve said 
today. All told, consumers borrowed $10.8 billion more in August 
than during the month before. That was the biggest monthly increase 
since January when it rose by $15.3 billion The increase in the 
level of borrowing in August was much stronger than many analysts 
expected. They were forecasting a monthly gain of $6.5 billion.

	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A federal grand jury has indicted rogue

money-laundering, the U.S. attorney's office said today. If 
convicted of all charges, Frankel faces a maximum of 410 years in 
prison. Frankel, under arrest in Germany, is accused of absconding 
with more than $200 million in insurance company assets he was 
supposed to be investing. Frankel disappeared from his 
fortress-like Greenwich mansions in early May, shortly before 
firefighters responding to an automatic alarm found smoldering 
documents in a safe and a ``to-do'' list upon which item No. 1 was 
``Launder money.''

inflation is needed to justify an interest rate rise. The Dow Jones 
Stoxx Index of 614 European companies rose 2.64 points to close at 
311.57. The best performing sector was telecommunications, up 2.3 
percent, with MCI WorldCom's bid for Sprint earlier this week 
fueling talk about consolidation across Europe. In London, telecom 
shares were the best performers in the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip

similar lawsuits across the country, a lawyer for gun makers said 
today. In the first dismissal of such a case, Hamilton County 
Common Pleas Judge Robert Ruehlman said the city's claims were 
vague and unsupported by legal precedent. ``It very clearly points 
out the weaknesses in the other cities' suits,'' said Jim Dorr, a 
Chicago lawyer for gun makers Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co. Inc., of 
Southport, Conn., and Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., of Springfield, Mass. 
Cincinnati intends to appeal the decision within a few days, said

Amoco doesn't want to take any chances, said Linda McCray, a 
company spokeswoman in Cleveland. The company will post warning 
signs at Amoco and BP stations by the end of the year. ``We are 
unaware of any incidents here in the U.S. in which a cellular has 
been linked to a fire or an explosion,'' she said. ``This is not a

<HEADLINE> Superintendent Named for Yosemite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- The new superintendent of  
Yosemite National Park arrived for introductions Thursday with a 
huge task already awaiting him: finding a way to please both 
environmentalists and carloads of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	David Mihalic, introduced by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt,  
will be taking over Oct. 25 with a charge to finish a long-delayed 
management plan for the park by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan includes decisions on whether to widen a highway and  
allow more buses and cars into the center of the congested park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just a poor, shy country boy from Montana, and the world  
out here in California moves pretty quickly, so I'm just going to 
have to get used to it,'' Mihalic said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mihalic, 53, who is replacing Stanley Albright, 68, comes to  
Yosemite from Glacier National Park in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt said the Montana park is second only to Yosemite when it  
comes to complex visitor and political problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the most difficult and complicated planning  
exercises in the National Park Service,'' Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yosemite can trace many of its woes to its spectacular setting --  
too many people want to drive in to marvel at the granite cliffs 
and stunning waterfalls. As many as 7,000 cars squeeze into the 
park on any given day. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's room in this park for every American and their  
families,'' said Babbitt. ``There's not enough room in this park 
for everyone and their cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yosemite has also faced some darker problems this year with the  
disappearance of three female sightseers who were later found dead 
and the decapitation death of park naturalist Joie Ruth Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Cary Stayner, 38, a part-time handyman at a motel just outside  
the park, has pleaded innocent in the Armstrong case and has not 
been charged in the other deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	At Glacier, Mihalic dealt with controversies over rebuilding a  
vital road, restoring historic buildings and banning personal 
watercraft and overflight tours. 
</P>
<P>
	Glacier's 1.4 million acres draw 1.8 million tourists a year.  
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, 3.8 million visitors crowded into Yosemite's  
748,000 acres in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before Albright arrived in October 1997, Congress approved  
$176 million to repair damage from a devastating 1997 flood that 
sent the Merced River spilling over its banks, damaging roads and 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Sierra Club sued over plans to widen a road along the  
river, and persuaded a federal judge this summer to order up a new 
river management plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mihalic's past has won him supporters within the environmental  
movement. 
</P>
<P>
	His management plan at Glacier banned snowmobiles and Jet Skis  
and included language to ban air tours, said Rose Fennell of The 
Wilderness Society in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's definitely someone we can work with,'' said  
Fennell. ``He seems to have put resource conservation before 
recreational uses.''

<HEADLINE> Mining Cos. Burned by Price Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The extraordinary rebound in gold prices in recent  
days is claiming some unlikely victims -- a few of the gold mining 
companies themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashanti Goldfields Co. Ltd. won a reprieve this week when  
creditors agreed to give it time to come up with some $270 million 
in additional collateral for risky bets that gold would remain 
depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	With 23 million ounces in gold reserves, Ashanti should be  
profiting handsomely from the skyrocketing price for gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Ghana-based company is strapped for funds, thanks  
to its unfortunate decision to hedge its bets by committing 40 
percent of its reserves against an anticipated decrease in price. 
It will have to buy or borrow gold to meet its commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashanti isn't the only producer to have placed bad bets.  
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts say hedging decisions by Cambior Inc., a  
Canadian mining firm, will cost it more than $30 million if gold 
prices stay at current levels. An Australian company, Sons of 
Gwalia, hedged all of its gold reserves and stands to suffer 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's quite ironic,'' Philip Klapwijk of the precious metals  
consultancy Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd., said Thursday. 
``It's not unalloyed joy that the price has gone up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until two weeks ago, gold producers were slashing costs just to  
survive. World prices for the metal fell to 20-year lows, flirting 
with $250 a troy ounce, after Britain's Treasury announced in May 
that it would sell much of its gold reserves and replace them with 
securities offering a higher yield. 
</P>
<P>
	But gold prices reversed course abruptly after 15 European  
central banks announced on Sept. 26 that they would limit their 
combined sales of bullion to 400 tons per year for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices responded immediately, rising by 30 percent in less than  
two weeks. Gold was trading late Thursday in London at $322.50 a 
troy ounce and contracts for October delivery closed at $322.80 
later on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Most mining companies 
have seen their inventories and share prices grow in value along 
with prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly wasn't a sequence of events we anticipated,''  
said Kelvin Williams, executive director of the world's largest 
gold mining company, Anglo Gold Ltd. of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Thursday from his office in Johannesburg, he added:  
``We're enormously pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so Ashanti Goldfields, which had gambled that prices would  
continue their slide. Before the recent run-up in prices, it locked 
in the value of 40 percent of its reserves with contracts to sell 
them at a fixed price at a future date. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the rising price for gold approached and then exceeded  
the prices Ashanti had contracted to sell at, the company saw the 
paper profits in its so-called hedge book turn to losses. And the 
banks that had lent the company money to buy those hedging 
contracts on margin began asking for cash as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashanti, which was trading above $10 a share last week, lost 25  
percent of its value on Wednesday and fell nearly 20 percent on 
Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, where it dropped 81 1/4 cents 
to close at $3.31 1/4 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have done in recent days is to buy sufficient time to  
enable us to restructure ... to ride out any problems that have 
come about as a result of the spike'' in price, said James Anaman, 
Ashanti's general manager in Accra, Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaman said Ashanti had ``stress-tested'' its hedged inventories  
to make sure they would remain profitable even if gold prices 
fluctuated by up to $50 an ounce. But it wasn't prepared for what 
actually happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody expected a spike of $70,'' he said in a telephone  
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Klapwijk, the London consultant, suggested that Ashanti is a  
special case due to its large margin calls. The banks that financed 
Ashanti's activities also are vulnerable, he said -- hence their 
decision not to call loans they knew the company could not readily 
repay. 
</P>
<P>
	But other gold producers may soon share Ashanti's distress.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think clearly there will be a large number of companies  
whose hedge books are underwater,'' Klapwijk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cambior of Canada holds futures contracts requiring it to sell  
912,000 ounces of gold at $287 an ounce, all by the end of this 
year, said Roger Chaplin, director of research at T. Hoare 
Canaccord, a London-based brokerage specializing in precious 
metals. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Cambior will have to buy or borrow gold at spot prices  
to honor those contracts, that means Cambior faces a potential loss 
of $35.50 an ounce, or $32.4 million, at current gold prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In Australia, Sons of Gwalia was so confident prices would fall  
that it hedged 113 percent of the value of its total reserves, said 
Mike Jones, a mining analyst at T. Hoare Canaccord. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will likely face severe losses when it has to enter  
the spot market to honor its ill-timed sales contracts. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Diabetic Hiker Found Dead in Mtns. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- A diabetic man who didn't return after a  
weekend hike in the San Gabriel Mountains was found dead Wednesday, 
his dog by his side. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies searching Angeles National Forest found the  
body of Tadeo Yanez, 26, of Commerce in a trail camp about nine 
miles from where he left his sport utility vehicle Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother reported him missing Monday morning.  
</P>
<P>
	She said Yanez usually injected himself with insulin when he  
started a hike, and authorities said a used syringe was found in 
his vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles County Sheriff's Detective Joe Martinez said it  
appeared that Yanez struggled for a while at the place where he 
fell and then succumbed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some scratch marks on the body that would indicate  
the dog was attempting to revive or at least awaken the master,'' 
Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dog, Lobo, was still at Yanez's side when searchers found  
him.

<HEADLINE> 'Contact' Is Exhilirating Fun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It has been so long since dance played an  
important part in musical theater that ``Contact,'' billed coyly as 
``a dance play,'' seems positively revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only revolutionary but fun, exhilarating in a way that few  
musicals have been during the past several seasons. ``Fosse'' 
doesn't count, being solely about the master choreographer's way 
with movement, not character or story. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contact,'' which Lincoln Center Theater opened Thursday, makes  
you realize what audiences have been missing in terms of watching 
characters express their feelings through dance. 
</P>
<P>
	The concept for the show, playing at the compact Mitzi Newhouse  
Theater, couldn't be more simple. Credit Susan Stroman, director, 
choreographer and co-creator with author John Weidman, with 
devising three striking meditations on yearning -- one joyous, one 
poignant, one desperate. Dialogue is at a minimum and the emphasis 
is on dance, although the movement grows out of the people Stroman 
and Weidman have created. 
</P>
<P>
	The first and shortest piece on the triple bill is ``Swinging,''  
based on ``The Swing,'' a painting by 18th-century artist 
Jean-Honore Fragonard. A trio of players, a servant, an aristocrat 
and a girl on a swing, flirt and frolic to jazz violinist Stephane 
Grappelli's rendition of ``My Heart Stood Still.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This athletic menage a trois exudes a playful sensuality. Sean  
Martin Hingston and Scott Taylor as the amorous swains and 
Stephanie Michels, a saucy object of desire, scamper across the 
stage with alarming speed. And watch Hingston and Michels on that 
swing. Who knew that an old childhood pastime could be so erotic? 
</P>
<P>
	Gears switch dramatically in the second piece, ``Did You Move?''  
It is set in an Italian restaurant in Queens in 1954. The music 
mixes Dean Martin (``You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You'') with 
classical compositions by Grieg, Tchaikovsky, Bizet and Puccini, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
	An overbearing, brutish husband (Jason Antoon) and his mousy  
wife, played by the wonderful Karen Ziemba, have an uneasy dinner 
in the restaurant. He makes her meal miserable, ordering her not to 
move while he makes periodic trips to the buffet table. During 
those interludes, the wife finds an escape in reverie, including a 
dreamy romance with the headwaiter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ziemba is heartbreakingly effective as the mistreated mate. She  
is more than a fine dancer. The woman really acts. She has an open, 
trusting face and expressive eyes that make an audience root for 
her inner triumph over her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	After intermission, the title vignette takes over. It deals with  
a disillusioned Manhattan advertising executive, outwardly 
successful but emotionally dying inside. Boyd Gaines portrays the 
weary exec with appropriate anguish. 
</P>
<P>
	The man find his way to a swing club where he meets a woman in a  
yellow dress. She's played by the striking Deborah Yates. Yates, 
with the longest legs this side of Cyd Charisse, projects an 
elegant sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	Sex smolders right on the club floor, as couples dance to  
everything from Dion's ``Runaround Sue'' to Bobby Darin's version 
of ``Beyond the Sea'' to ``Sing, Sing, Sing,'' which, 
coincidentally, also is featured in ``Fosse'' and ``Dancin','' 
another Fosse show. Gaines must fight, meaning dance, to win the 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
	It's fascinating watching the actor, a nondancer, work with real  
pros. That's part of Stroman's concept. His character's halting 
connection with other human beings is finally achieved -- through 
dance. It doesn't matter that he doesn't possess their considerable 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroman knows that dance can express the most basic of emotions,  
and this ``Contact'' brings them strikingly to life.

<HEADLINE> State Farm Shuns Aftermarket Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (AP) -- State Farm suspended all use of  
aftermarket auto-body repair parts Thursday -- three days after a 
jury awarded $456 million to the insurer's policyholders in a 
class-action lawsuit over the use of such parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Some insurance groups expected other companies would follow the  
lead of State Farm -- the nation's largest auto insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really traumatic when the industry leader makes a  
decision such as this, and I'm sure that other companies are going 
to take note,'' said Kirk Hansen, a spokesman for the Alliance of 
American Insurers, a trade group representing about 300 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was made to spare consumers ``confusion and  
misinformation'' about the quality of aftermarket parts, State Farm 
spokesman Dave Hurst said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say such parts -- which are modeled on manufacturers'  
parts but made without access to factory specifications -- are of 
lower quality than original equipment parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means that, effective immediately, all customers  
who bring their cars in for repair will get original equipment or 
recycled parts, Hurst said. Currently, about 10 percent of the 
crash-repair parts installed in State Farm repairs come from 
aftermarket manufacturers, according to the insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will not pay extra for the non-aftermarket parts, as  
would normally be required under State Farm's policy, nor will 
premiums be increased, Hurst said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a jury awarded 4.7 million current and former  
policyholders $456 million after finding State Farm's use of 
aftermarket parts constitute a breach of contract to restore 
customers' automobiles to their pre-accident condition. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm's decision Thursday was not related to the impending  
ruling by Williamson County Circuit Judge John Speroni on the 
second count of the lawsuit, Hurst said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speroni is expected to rule by Friday on whether State Farm  
committed fraud by failing to properly notify consumers about the 
parts it requires body shops to use in repairs. The plaintiffs have 
asked for nearly $4 billion in actual and punitive damages and an 
injunction requiring additional disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Johnson, an analyst who tracks the aftermarket parts  
industry for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis, said it was too 
early to say what effect the decision could have on the industry -- 
which accounts for about 10 percent of the $10 billion crash-repair 
parts business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly not good news,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Littleton, one of the attorneys involved in the lawsuit  
against State Farm, claimed the decision as a victory for 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we've done good,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Self-Destructing E-mail Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Thinking of sending a harassing e-mail  
message? Getting involved in an interoffice affair? How about an 
arms-for-hostages deal? 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a product for you: e-mail that becomes impossible to read  
after as little as a few seconds or minutes, using a self-destruct 
feature set by the sender. 
</P>
<P>
	A startup high-tech firm, Disappearing Inc., has developed a way  
to put time-bombs in e-mail messages, ensuring that they are 
readable only as long as the sender wants them to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a cool idea,'' said Kerry Stackpole, head of the  
Electronic Messaging Association, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	E-mail, designed to be a fleeting, spur-of-the-moment way of  
communicating, has turned up as evidence in lawsuits -- witness Bill 
Gates' threats against Microsoft's rivals -- and even congressional 
investigations into Monicagate and the Iran-Contra affair. 
Virtually every workplace has its own horror stories of e-mail 
reaching the wrong people. 
</P>
<P>
	``This would stop them cold,'' Stackpole said.  
</P>
<P>
	The system, which should be available early next year, encrypts  
each message with an electronic key, also held by the receiver. The 
sender can decide how long the key will work -- anywhere from a few 
seconds to years. After that, the key self-destructs and the 
message becomes unreadable. 
</P>
<P>
	The system works within a company's existing e-mail system.  
Messages flow through existing servers and companies can continue 
to use their current e-mail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Disappearing Inc. is a privately held company that was formed in  
February.

<HEADLINE> NLRB Rules on Organizing Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Non-union employees working in so-called  
closed shops can be required to help pay for union organizing 
activities, the National Labor Relations Board has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruling 4-1 in a dispute involving supermarket workers and meat  
cutters who withdrew from the Food and Commercial Workers union, 
the board said a union's ability to recruit new members is directly 
tied to its ability to bargain collectively with employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unions are able to negotiate higher wages for the employees  
they represent when the employees of employers in the same 
competitive market are organized, and unions are less able to do so 
when they are not organized,'' the board said in a written opinion 
issued Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thus, represented employees, whether or not they are members  
of the union that represents them, benefit through the results of 
collective bargaining,'' the board said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hiatt, the AFL-CIO's general counsel, said the ruling is  
consistent with the labor federation's position that ``organizing 
does have a very direct relationship to collective bargaining and 
therefore it should properly be seen as a chargeable expenditure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When a union has organized all the supermarkets in a given  
city, they are going to be in a much better position to bargain 
good benefits and wages for their workers than if they only 
organized one supermarket in that city,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which  
opposes compulsory union dues, said Thursday it will challenge the 
board's ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Clinton NLRB has turned its back on America's working men  
and women, who will now be fired if they decline to finance big 
labor's empire building,'' said Stefan Gleason, vice president of 
the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of labor contracts require workers who choose not to  
join the unions representing them to pay fees similar to what union 
members pay in dues. 
</P>
<P>
	However, in a 1988 ruling the Supreme Court said that unions may  
not use money from nonunion workers for any purposes other than 
collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1988 case, 20 employees of AT&AMP;T in Maryland sued the  
Communications Workers of America, contending they should have the 
right to withhold a portion of their non-member fees to avoid 
subsidizing union political goals they didn't agree with. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case before the NLRB, supermarket and meat processing  
workers in Michigan, Colorado and California who quit the food 
workers union in 1989 complained they continued to be charged 
non-member fees that helped pay for union organizing activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The NLRB, which is acts as an out-of-court referee of  
labor-management disputes, ruled that they should have to pay, 
saying recruiting new members indirectly bolsters a union's 
bargaining clout to the benefit of members and non-members alike. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Robert Brame III, a dissenting board member, said the  
majority's opinion contradicted past rulings in which the Supreme 
Court has even more specifically addressed this question. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court recognized that, where a union shop provision is in  
place, the bargaining unit employees are already organized, so 
organizing expenses are necessarily spent on employees outside the 
unit,'' Brame wrote in his dissenting opinion.

<HEADLINE> Networks' Studios Clog NYC Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Overcome with excitement, Claudia Debro screamed  
at the top of her lungs on a Times Square sidewalk, waving a sign 
addressed to her favorite MTV veejay, trying desperately to get the 
attention of a television camera. She has waited for this moment 
for -- well, weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind her, a man was simply trying to get by. He stepped to the  
left. Unwittingly, she stepped into his path. Back to the right. 
Same thing. Finally, he lifted the 14-year-old by the shoulders and 
moved her aside. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crossroads of the World has never been particularly easy to  
maneuver, but some New Yorkers are objecting to what they say is 
the transformation of Times Square and other areas of midtown into 
de facto sound stages for TV networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks have discovered that turning the camera back at the  
viewer during some of its programs yields high ratings -- and crowds 
of people trying to get into the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent trend started in 1994 with NBC's ``Today Show'' at  
its Rockefeller Center studios. MTV and ABC's ``Good Morning 
America'' have since followed with their own glass-walled studios 
in Times Square, and the Fox News Channel has also broadcast 
programs out of its ground-floor facility in Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS plans to unveil its own $30 million storefront studio in the  
General Motors building across from Central Park on Nov. 1 for the 
debut of its new morning program, the ``Early Show.'' Bryant Gumbel 
will be the host. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the owners of a swank hotel up Fifth Avenue have gone  
to court to stop CBS. Also, some Times Square-area merchants and 
residents are peeved at ABC for allegedly filming on the sidewalk 
outside its studio on 44th Street and Broadway, causing more than 
the normal congestion. Others unhappy about the trend simply mutter 
and shove -- a traditional New York way of dealing with crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look, this area is crowded anyway, but when MTV goes live and  
these irritating screaming kids come in, the sidewalk is 
impassible,'' growled 66-year-old Manhattan resident Gina Reynolds 
as she pushed through a passel of teen-agers blocking a sidewalk 
outside the music channel's studio at Broadway and 45th Street 
earlier this week. ``Makes me miss the old Times Square. It was 
quieter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The networks, which have invested millions in the studios, say  
they are doing their best to avoid disruptions. Police use 
barricades to keep fans from spilling into the streets, and some of 
the networks also employ their own security personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers filed earlier this month, the owners of the  
Sherry-Netherland Hotel objected to CBS's indoor-outdoor studio 25 
blocks north in the General Motors building across the street from 
Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The network, the hotel says, plans to use the building's plaza  
and ground-floor studio ``as a `tourist destination' where crowds 
(will be) able to gawk through glass at the goings on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People will be waving and shouting and creating that fake  
Beatlemania-like sensation,'' and ``CBS will be able to stage 
everything from concerts to cooking demonstrations,'' according to 
the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the programs or networks that now broadcast from a  
glass-walled studio has seen its ratings swell, including ``Good 
Morning America,'' where viewership has gone from 3.8 million to 
4.5 million since the debut of its studio in September. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting this week with midtown residents, ABC officials  
promised to try to avoid inconveniencing the public while using its 
``Good Morning America'' studio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their studio is fabulous, wonderful,'' said Lola Finkelstein,  
head of the local community board. ``But they've got to know that 
they shouldn't block the sidewalk.''

<HEADLINE> NJ Trooper Sues State Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A highway patrolman who opened fire on a  
van carrying four men is suing the State Police, claiming they knew 
better than to put him back on the beat after he was attacked by a 
motorist in an earlier incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The fear and trauma from the attack made him ``a risk to himself  
and to others,'' James Kenna said in his answer to a civil rights 
lawsuit filed by the van's driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenna also has filed his own injury lawsuit seeking unspecified  
damages from the State Police. 
</P>
<P>
	The Attorney General's office released a copy of the lawsuit  
Thursday. Office spokesman Roger Shatzkin and Kenna's lawyer, Jack 
Arseneault, would not comment. Kenna has routinely declined 
requests for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lawsuit, Kenna says he was traumatized March 18, 1998,  
when a man he had pulled over knocked him to the ground, jumped 
into his patrol car and nearly ran him over as he fled. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenna was sent to the State Police's Employee Assistance Program  
for psychological counseling, then returned to duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the severe psychological trauma he had suffered  
following the above incident, Kenna was recommended by these 
representatives as fit to return to duty,'' his lawsuit contends. 
</P>
<P>
	The staff ``knew or should have known that Kenna's condition  
created a risk of harm to himself or others,'' the suit states. 
</P>
<P>
	One month after the attack, on April 23, 1998, Kenna and Trooper  
John Hogan stopped the van driven by Keshon Moore. During the stop, 
three passengers, all minorities, were shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers said they fired because they thought the van was  
backing up to hit them. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were indicted last month on charges of attempted murder and  
are suspended without pay.

<HEADLINE> Japan May Close Nuclear Reactor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A Japanese nuclear reactor may be shut down because  
last week's accident at a reprocessing facility means there is no 
place to store its spent fuel, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fugen thermal reactor in Tsuruga, 200 miles west of Tokyo,  
has been storing spent fuel on-site since a fire and explosion 
closed another fuel reprocessing plant north of the capital in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	With no more storage space at the reactor, the operator had  
planned to apply this month to fully reopen the reprocessing plant, 
which is only partially operational. 
</P>
<P>
	But the application was delayed after last week's accident at a  
uranium-reprocessing plant in Tokaimura made it increasingly 
unlikely that authorities will reopen any closed nuclear 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sept. 30 accident 70 miles northeast of Tokyo exposed at  
least 49 people to radiation and heightened fears about safety 
procedures at facilities handling nuclear material. 
</P>
<P>
	No decision has been made on the Fugen plant, but an official  
with its operator, the state-run Japan Nuclear Cycle Development 
Institute, acknowledged that it had no more space to store spent 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fugen plant had been scheduled to shut down at least  
temporarily in mid-January to remove spent fuel rods, spokesman 
Hitoshi Haniya said. The plant cannot go back on-line until a place 
is found for the used uranium. 
</P>
<P>
	The March 1997 accident, also in Tokaimura, exposed 37 workers  
to low levels of radiation. The operator of the plant acknowledged 
hiding details of the accident from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation of last week's accident has centered on  
corner-cutting at that plant, where operator JCO Co. reportedly 
issued operations manuals to employees instructing them to skip 
crucial security steps to save time. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has acknowledged that its response was slow and  
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmental group Greenpeace said today its own analysis  
of the radiation surrounding the plant showed that the number of 
people exposed was probably higher than officials said. The group 
also called on the government to carry out more comprehensive 
physical exams on residents to measure their exposure to radiation 
and to monitor their long-term health. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have stepped up their probe into whether plant operators  
were criminally negligent, raiding the nuclear complex in Tokaimura 
and JCO headquarters in Tokyo on Wednesday. Government regulators 
are reportedly preparing to revoke JCO's license. 
</P>
<P>
	About 120 environmentalists and others marched to the Parliament  
building in Tokyo today, demanding an independent investigation of 
the accident and a review of Japan's nuclear policy.

<HEADLINE> EPA Targets Truck Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The new super-huge sport utility vehicles  
coming into showrooms are a mix of big truck and passenger car. But 
as far as the Environmental Protection Agency is concerned, they 
are going to be treated more like cars -- meaning they'll be subject 
to tighter emission standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA announced a proposed regulation Wednesday that would  
impose on the behemoth SUVs such as the new Ford Excursion more 
stringent pollution controls, though not quite as tough as those on 
smaller cars and SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule was part of a two-pronged strategy to cut dramatically  
the air pollution from large trucks. A separate initiative, to be 
formally proposed early next year, would require diesel-powered 
tractor-trailer rigs and other heavy-duty trucks to cut tailpipe 
emissions by 90 percent by 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	But the regulations on the largest SUVs will have the most  
immediate impact. 
</P>
<P>
	In requiring the tougher pollution controls on SUVs weighing  
8,500 pounds or more, the EPA is attempting to close what critics 
call a loophole left over from the agency's decision this year to 
require all passenger vehicles to be less polluting. 
</P>
<P>
	The tougher emission requirements proposed in May, and soon to  
be made final, applied to cars and light trucks, including SUVs, 
weighing less than 8,500 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	But there has been concern among many of the clean air  
specialists at the EPA that manufacturers will avoid the tougher 
emission controls on some SUVs by boosting their weight above the 
8,500 threshold. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers recently have begun introducing -- or have on the  
drawing boards -- super-large SUVs such as the Ford Excursion and 
some models of the Chevrolet Suburban that are heavier than 8,500 
pounds and now fall under weaker ``heavy truck'' emission rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The new EPA proposal ``would close any possible loopholes for  
the new, super-large SUVs now being built by ensuring that they 
also meet strict emissions standards,'' said EPA Administrator 
Carol Browner. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers had hoped that these vehicles would continue to come  
under the much weaker heavy truck standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``These rules are going to affect only a small percentage of  
SUVs. But it will put pressure on our auto engineers, who already 
have a very full plate,'' said Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for 
the Alliance of Auto Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Brown, director of environmental engineering at Ford Motor  
Co., said the new SUV requirements ``will pose significant 
challenges'' and reflect ``another layer on top'' of the earlier 
tailpipe standards for the passenger car fleet. He questioned 
whether the requirements will be achievable in the time period 
outlined by the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rule on large SUVs will be wrapped in with the  
earlier regulations applying to the smaller vehicles, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest gasoline-powered SUVs by 2004 will have to meet  
emission controls similar to those being imposed by California, 
making them 78 percent cleaner than today. Further emission 
reductions are expected by 2009 when the other SUVs will have to 
meet their toughest tailpipe controls, EPA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	But some environmentalists questioned whether the EPAs rules are  
tough enough. 
</P>
<P>
	They noted that if the super-large SUVs use diesel fuel, they  
would have to cut emission by only 40 percent by 2004. 
Manufacturers are indicating that they may move to diesel engines 
for their large SUVs ``and this could be a continuing loophole,'' 
said Frank O'Donnell of the Clean Air Trust, an environmental 
advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Donnell said that many environmentalists also believe  
automakers could achieve greater emission reductions by 2004 than 
will be required by the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
	Motor vehicles produce about 30 percent of all the nitrogen  
oxide and volatile organic compounds that are key to creating smog. 
The American Lung Association estimates that smog and fine soot 
account for 15,000 premature deaths, 400,000 asthma attacks and 1 
million various respiratory problems annually.

<HEADLINE> Fed May Revise Disclosure Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve, worried that its new  
disclosure policy is confusing financial markets, announced 
Thursday that Chairman Alan Greenspan had set up a working group to 
recommend improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed stressed that the working group, to be chaired by Fed  
Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson, did not signal a retreat from its new 
policy but was merely an effort to refine it to eliminate 
confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the Fed began immediately announcing changes in its  
policy directive, which signals where interest rates may be headed 
in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel to examine that procedure will be made of Fed  
insiders: three board members and three regional bank presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Open Market Committee -- the officials who meet eight  
times a year to set interest rates -- has since 1994 announced 
immediately after their closed-door talks any actual changes made 
in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel also votes on a policy directive, which it sets at  
neutral or biased either toward raising rates or lowering rates. 
Those directives were always disclosed only after the next FOMC 
meeting, six to eight weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, the Fed changed its operating procedures to allow  
for the immediate disclosure of any ``significant'' changes in the 
policy directive. In May, for the first time, it announced it had 
changed the directive from neutral to one leaning toward an 
increase in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At the next meeting, June 30, the Fed followed through and  
raised interest rates for the first time in two years, pushing the 
federal funds rate up by a quarter-point to 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the FOMC that day also moved its policy directive back to  
neutral, an announcement that triggered a big rally in stocks and 
bonds as investors believed it meant the central bank might stop 
with just one rate increase. Those hopes were dashed when the Fed 
raised rates for a second time at the Aug. 24 meeting. This week, 
the Fed left rates unchanged but said it had moved the policy 
directive back to one leaning toward raising rates, an announcement 
that triggered an abrupt sell-off in the bond market as investors 
began to fear a November rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists said investors have been reading too much into  
policy directives, given that a bias toward either raising rates or 
lowering them often doesn't translate into actual rate changes at 
later meetings. But they said the trend to more openness is a good 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Free market economists generally prefer openness and  
transparency because it produces small corrections along the way 
rather than one gigantic correction,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief 
economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. ``I can't imagine any 
market participant who would want to go back to the old days when 
the Fed was communicating in sign language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until Greenspan championed a push for more openness in 1994, the  
Fed did not announce changes in the federal funds rate, its key 
instrument for controlling the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Fed watchers were forced to divine the central bank's  
intentions on interest rates from watching its operations through 
the New York Fed in buying and selling government securities, a 
procedure that sometimes led to misreadings of Fed actions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed minutes released Thursday said that Greenspan formed the  
working group because Fed officials were concerned that the 
directives were ``subject to differing interpretations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The minutes released Thursday showed that Robert McTeer,  
president of the Federal Reserve regional bank in Dallas, was the 
lone dissenter against both the June 30 and the Aug. 24 rate 
increases. They show he gave the same reason for both dissents: a 
view that inflation remained low and that productivity gains would 
continue to dampen the effect of higher wages on unit labor costs.

<HEADLINE> United Airlines Slashes Commissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines, the nation's largest air  
carrier, announced Thursday it is slashing the commission it pays 
travel agents for selling tickets from 8 percent to 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel agents denounced United's move -- which takes effect early  
Friday and applies to both domestic and international tickets -- as 
being anti-consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's rising at United is the price the consumer will  
ultimately pay for the airline ticket,'' said Joe Galloway, 
president of the American Society of Travel Agents in Alexandria, 
Va. United said it will pay agents a 5 percent commission for all 
tickets purchased in the United States for travel within the 
country, with a maximum payout of $50 for round-trip travel and $25 
for one-way travel. 
</P>
<P>
	For international travel, the maximum pay out will be $100 for  
round-trip travel and $50 for one-way travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's announcement is part of our continuing efforts to  
examine all facets of our cost structure,'' United Airlines 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jim Goodwin said in a 
statement. ``We expect this action to result in savings of 
approximately $150 million annually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other airlines did not immediately respond to United's  
announcement. But in three of the previous commission cuts, United 
has led the way and all the other airlines eventually followed 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by United, the major airlines last November capped  
commission payments on all international flights at 8 percent or 
$100 a round trip. Delta went further, announcing it will pay only 
5 percent up to a maximum of $10 for a booking over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	United also led the move in 1997 to cut commission rates for  
domestic tickets to 8 percent from 10 percent, with a $50 cap for a 
round-trip fare. The move was quickly matched by other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel agents sell about 80 percent of the airline tickets sold  
in the country, Galloway said. It is obvious United wants that to 
change, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``United is trying to force the cost of distribution onto the  
shoulders of consumers,'' he said. ``Consumers will be forced to 
pay more because they won't have adequate comparative information 
that travel agents alone provide or they will have to pay more 
because the travel agent will be forced to charge more or raise 
service fees for crucial services that consumers seek from them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway said there is no way to know what effect the cuts will  
have on individual travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	However, William Gallagher of Gallagher Travel Service Inc. in  
Chicago said it is likely that travel agents will charge fees for 
services they previously provided for free. 
</P>
<P>
	``For example, you call asking for the lowest fare from 'A' to  
'B,' that will cost you X number of dollars,'' he said. ``We 
haven't charged a fee in the past. There is no question we will 
have to now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to an ASTA survey taken last year, 64 percent of  
member agencies are charging some type of fee for services such as 
issuing refunds, canceling trips and sending faxes to customers. 
The average fee for a service is about $10. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher said the new commission level makes commercial travel  
planning unprofitable and means his agency will emphasize leisure 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted travel agents can get commissions from tour operators,  
rental car agencies and hotels. He said it is likely those segments 
of the travel industry will follow United's lead and cut 
commissions.

<HEADLINE> Wrestler ``The Droz'' Hurt in Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- World Wrestling Federation star Darren  
Drozdov is recovering from surgery after being paralyzed below the 
waist from a neck fracture during a match. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident at the Nassau Coliseum on Tuesday is the second  
professional wrestling tragedy in five months. 
</P>
<P>
	The tattooed, body-pierced wrestler known as ``The Droz,''  
underwent three hours of surgery Wednesday to relieve pressure on 
his damaged neck, said orthopedic surgeon Dr. Laurence Mermelstein 
of the Nassau County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's way too early to say whether or not he'll regain use of  
his legs,'' Mermelstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drozdov, 30, of Mays Landing, N.J., suffered two dislocated and  
fractured discs while wrestling against D'Lo Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the loss of feeling in his legs, Drozdov was in good  
spirits when he arrived at the hospital, Mermelstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons removed a piece of Drozdov's pelvis to replace the  
injured discs. They also attached a plate and screws to the area in 
an effort to stabilize his neck, the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 270-pound wrestler was given the same steroid  
medication as New York Jets defensive end Dennis Byrd and Chinese 
gymnast Sang Lan when they suffered spinal cord injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd later regained use of his legs. Lan was paralyzed from the  
chest down in an accident -- also at the Nassau Coliseum -- during 
the 1998 Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Drozdov's injury came just five months after the WWF suffered an  
in-ring fatality. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrestler Owen Hart, 34, known professionally as the Blue Blazer,  
died May 23 during a live pay-per-view event when he fell from the 
ceiling of the Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Mo. His family has 
since sued the WWF and its owner, Vince McMahon, for wrongful 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF had no immediate comment Wednesday on Drozdov's  
accident.

<HEADLINE> UPS Ending Some Gun Deliveries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service plans to stop shipping  
handguns via its ground service, instead forcing customers to use 
the more expensive air service -- a cost dealers and manufacturers 
say will be passed on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-based UPS, the world's top package delivery company,  
says handguns are attractive to thieves and easy targets in the 
company's fleet of brown trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taking this step as a responsible corporate citizen,''  
UPS spokesman Norman Black said Thursday. ``This is the best way 
for us to add security to the movement of these weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule goes into effect Monday. The company will continue  
to ship long guns, rifles and shotguns by ground because those guns 
are more difficult to steal, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said ``hundreds'' of handguns are stolen from UPS each  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our attitude is that even one such instance is one too many  
and we just had to find some way to improve the security around 
these shipments,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS's Next Day Air service is a separate, more controlled system  
where packages are handled by fewer people and stay in the system 
for only one night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said he did not know what percentage of the gun market UPS  
shipped, but industry leaders say the company handles about 75 
percent of guns sent from manufacturers to distributors and nearly 
all firearms shipped from distributors to dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	UPS' biggest competitor, Federal Express, has restricted guns to  
its Priority Overnight service for the past 20 years, said 
spokeswoman Carla Boyd. Airborne Express, the No. 3 express 
carrier, restricts gun shipments to air, said spokesman Tom 
Branigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service will not ship handguns unless they are being  
sent to a law enforcement agency or among gun dealers and makers. 
</P>
<P>
	RPS is the only company that accepts guns for shipment on the  
ground. Spokeswoman Betsy Momich said the company does not ship 
very many guns but officials are discussing what affect the UPS 
decision will have on their business. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are re-evaluating what our policies are because safety is  
first and foremost in our mind,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Chambers, executive director of the Sporting Arms and  
Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute, said shipping handguns via air 
could cost anywhere from three to four times more than ground 
shipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said that estimate is ``completely out of the ballpark.''  
</P>
<P>
	``It would certainly be fair to say that in general it's going  
to be at least double, but even then, it truly is going to vary 
depending on size and weight,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Chambers said members of the gun industry are looking at  
alternative methods to going to the air. 
</P>
<P>
	He added, however, ``We're not interested in a haphazard way to  
ship firearms though the system. We don't want to see firearms get 
into the wrong hands anymore than anyone else does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Jannuzzo, vice president of Glock Inc., said the gun  
manufacturer will continue to ship with UPS, but the increase in 
cost will be passed on to dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too substantial to absorb,'' said Jannuzzo, who works at  
Glock's U.S. headquarters in Smyrna. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he understands the decision  
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, federal investigators arrested a UPS employee for  
stealing 130 Glock guns being shipped via the carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it will cut out the theft problems, it will be a good  
thing,'' said Jannuzzo.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Set To Offer Farm Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Targeting an increasingly sour farm  
economy in a key political state, Democratic presidential candidate 
Bill Bradley is offering a $5.5 billion aid package that would 
restore direct payments to farmers when prices fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The emergency payments would be temporary and limited to avoid  
big checks going to absentee landlords, but the package would 
return a ``safety net'' to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Bradley also calls for sharply increasing the  
number of environmentally fragile acres taken out of production, 
increases in farm research programs and a ``rigorous review'' of 
concentration of ownership in the meat industry. 
</P>
<P>
	To accomplish that review, Bradley would shift responsibility  
for monitoring the industry from the Agriculture Department to the 
Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley plans to outline the proposals during a speech today on  
a farm near Des Moines. Details of the package were made available 
to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal will be unveiled at a time when the sour farm  
economy is getting increasing attention. Commodity prices have 
fallen to historic lows, and current farm policy phases out most 
traditional subsidy payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley calls for an ``income stabilization program'' that would  
provide temporary payments to farmers when prices fall. Payments 
would be triggered by a formula linking commodity process 
production costs for items such as fertilizer and seed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The payments would also be capped to ensure that the bulk of  
the benefits go to small, independent producers and their 
families,'' said background documents describing the package. It 
also would require farmers to actually work the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley calls for spending $5.5 billion on that effort, with  
some of the money redirected from other farm spending. The package 
sets new spending at $1.32 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wants to expand a program known as the Conservation  
Reserve Program, which pays farmers to take environmentally 
sensitive land out of production. His goal is to have 42 million 
acres idle at a cost of $580 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Another piece of the plan calls for payments to farmers to  
reward them for using environmentally friendly farming techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Bradley would spend $1.25 billion on conservation  
programs. That appeals to farmers, because of extra farm spending, 
and environmentalists worried about increasing chemical use and 
soil erosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shifting oversight of the industry to the Justice Department  
would cost $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the plan calls for meatpackers to be forced to  
disclose what they pay for animals. Some critics argue that 
meatpackers cut special deals with giant producers to pay them 
better prices than smaller, family farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Another $60 million piece of the program would bolster farm  
research and create new rural economic development programs ``that 
help farmers develop their communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also pledged to support farm-owned cooperatives ``to give  
producers the opportunity to move closer to the consumer.'' That is 
part of an effort to encourage commodity processing, adding value 
to raw commodities and boosting farm income. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley does not mention ethanol in the package, an issue he  
previously has had difficulty with. Ethanol is very popular in Iowa 
because it's distilled from corn. Backers say an ethanol-gasoline 
blend is more environmentally friendly than other chemicals meant 
to reduce emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley opposed tax breaks for ethanol as a U.S. senator, but  
says he's changed his mind as a presidential candidate and now 
supports the breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	His speech opens a hectic political weekend in which he and his  
rival, Vice President Al Gore are to attend the Iowa Democratic 
Party's biggest annual fund-raiser Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have shown Gore -- who has issued his own package of farm  
proposals -- with an edge in the state where precinct caucuses 
launch the nominating season.

<HEADLINE> A Rivalry Week in Early October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Winning a national championship is the ultimate goal, of course,  
but taking home the Golden Hat, Paul Bunyan Trophy or Textile Bowl 
sounds cool, too. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, those prizes -- and more -- are at stake when No. 23  
Texas plays Oklahoma in Dallas for a gold hat mounted on a piece of 
wood; No. 3 Michigan is at No. 11 Michigan State for a four-foot 
high statue of a lumberjack; and Clemson and North Carolina State 
meet for a bronze bowl on a three-foot wooden base. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan coach Lloyd Carr probably described most rivalry  
trophies best when he said of the Bunyan prize: ``It's the ugliest 
trophy in college football. When you don't have him you miss him, 
but it's ugly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Michigan-Michigan State matchup is a beauty. For the first  
time since 1961, both teams enter the game undefeated at 5-0. While 
Carr and Michigan State's Nick Saban are trying to play it cool, 
they know how important it is to win this game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a terrific situation where we are both going into it  
undefeated,'' Saban said. ``In addition to the traditional rivalry, 
the game has added significance because we're both in the Big Ten 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Carr: ``In this rivalry, I don't think it matters what the  
records are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, the Wolverines have won the last three meetings,  
including 29-17 last year at Ann Arbor. Michigan holds a 60-26-5 
lead in the series that began in 1898. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State features the nation's top-ranked rushing defense,  
which allows 42.8 yards per game, and the steady play of Bill 
Burke, with 909 yards and 11 touchdown passes including a school 
record-tying four TDs in last week's 49-3 win over Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	In Anthony Thomas, the Wolverines figure to have a running back  
who will test the Spartans' defense. Thomas has run for 96.8 yards 
per game against the likes of Notre Dame, Syracuse, Wisconsin and 
Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Top 25 games Saturday, it's No. 19 Miami at No. 1  
Florida State; No. 2 Penn State at Iowa; Iowa State at No. 4 
Nebraska; No. 5 Virginia Tech at Rutgers; No. 10 Georgia at No. 6 
Tennessee; North Carolina at No. 7 Georgia Tech; No. 8 Florida at 
LSU; Kansas at No. 9 Kansas State; and Baylor at No. 13 Texas A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, it's No. 14 Mississippi State at Auburn; Southern  
Mississippi at No. 16 East Carolina; No. 17 Purdue at No. 21 Ohio 
State; No. 20 Wisconsin at No. 25 Minnesota; No. 22 Southern Cal at 
Arizona; and California at No. 24 BYU. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 12 Alabama and No. 15 Marshall are off Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	No. 18 Syracuse was at Pittsburgh Thursday night.  
</P>
<P>
	There are a few other rivalry games Saturday, including Kansas  
and Kansas State playing for the Governor's Cup and Wisconsin and 
Minnesota playing for the Paul Bunyan Axe, not to be confused with 
the Paul Bunyan Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	At Dallas, it's Texas (4-2) vs. Oklahoma (3-1) for the 94th  
time. Both teams are coming off tough losses, but that won't matter 
in the Cotton Bowl as this showdown could turn into a quarterback 
shootout between the Sooners' Josh Heupel and Longhorns' Major 
Applewhite. 
</P>
<P>
	Heupel, despite his team's 34-30 loss to Notre Dame last week,  
has thrown for 1,358 yards and 16 TDs; Applewhite, who had six 
turnovers -- three interceptions, three fumbles -- in last week's 
35-17 loss to Kansas State, has thrown for 1,763 yards and 11 TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	At Raleigh, N.C., the Wolfpack (3-2) play coach Tommy Bowden's  
Clemson Tigers (3-2) in their first home game since East Carolina 
fans tore down the goal posts after upsetting Miami. The Pirates 
played their ``home game'' at NC State because of flooding in 
Greenville caused by Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tallahassee, Fla., the Seminoles (5-0) will be without Peter  
Warrick, a top Heisman Trophy contender, as they try to extend 
their 44-game non-losing streak at Doak Campbell Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, who along with fellow wide receiver Laveranues Coles,  
was suspended following his arrest Thursday on charges of grand 
theft. A store clerk also was arrested and accused of letting the 
two players buy $412.38 worth of clothing for $21.40 on Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes (2-2) were the last team to win at Florida State  
-- 17-16 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, Miami is a 4-0 club,'' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden  
said. ``They are so close to being undefeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes opened with two wins but lost by identical 27-23  
scores to Penn State and East Carolina. Both times, Miami blew 
fourth-quarter leads.

<HEADLINE> Klein Seeks Partner in Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Provocative American designer Calvin Klein is  
shopping for a buyer or partner for his New York-based fashion 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	After watching this year's bidding wars over Gucci, Fendi and  
other designers, Calvin Klein decided to steal some of the 
spotlight and hired an investment bank to line up a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein wants to expand his $2.5 billion empire's line of  
accessories, menswear, active sportswear and home furnishings. The 
privately owned company also wants to open more retail stores -- a 
move that will relax the grip department stores have on the 
56-year-old designer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Calvin, by hooking up with a deep-pocketed partner, gets the  
infrastructure to grow the business in both venues -- retail stores 
and accessories,'' said Edward Nardoza, editor-in-chief of Women's 
Wear Daily, a trade publication which reported Calvin Klein's plans 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Klein issued a statement Wednesday saying it had hired  
Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. to explore ``strategic courses of action that 
the company may pursue in order to further develop and grow the 
business ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Executives declined to comment further.  
</P>
<P>
	Some of the most prestigious names on the catwalks have changed  
hands this year, including Gucci, Valentino and Jil Sander. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Gucci is jousting with Prada Holdings Ltd. and LVMH  
Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton for control of the Italian house of 
Fendi, which makes the hot-selling baguette handbag. 
</P>
<P>
	The bidding wars have escalated to couture prices. That should  
help Calvin Klein, which has one of the most widely recognized 
brands in the business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the feeding frenzy here, we have definitely gotten the  
sense these guys will be able to command a very nice price,'' said 
Faye Landes, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Klein, the designer, own 43 percent of his company. Barry  
Schwartz, the firm's chairman and chief executive, and Klein's 
childhood friend from the New York City borough of the Bronx, also 
owns 43 percent. The rest is held by family trusts. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most likely buyers are European firms, such as LVMH,  
Prada, HdP, and Pinault-Printemps-Redoute. Other potential suitors 
include Warnaco, which owns the license for Calvin Klein jeans and 
underwear, and Unilever, the Dutch-Anglo consumer products giant 
that holds the license for Calvin Klein's Obsession and other 
fragrances. 
</P>
<P>
	The consolidation trend started with the department stores,  
which have snapped up competitors and closed extra stores to prop 
up profit margins. The department stores then used their bargaining 
power to drive hard bargains with vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	To survive, fashion houses have expanded overseas, found new  
niches and opened their own stores. But that takes money. 
</P>
<P>
	While several designers raised money in the early 1990s by  
selling stock to the public, their shares have run hot and cold, 
like sales of capri pants and bell bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Klein is not looking to go public, according to a person  
familiar with the company's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are always peaks and valleys in the fashion industry,''  
said Susan Silverstein, an analyst at Banc of America Securities. 
``But the more diversified a company is the less risky that fashion 
element becomes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calvin Klein, like many designers today, wants to broaden its  
reach by putting its name on sheets and towels, running shoes, 
luggage and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to see more consolidation and mergers and  
partnerships between brands and companies,'' Silverstein said. 
``It's what I call cross-dressing in the fashion industry.''

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Grand Jury May Report Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The grand jury investigating the death of  
JonBenet Ramsey was scheduled to meet today and Friday, and one 
adviser says he knows of no further meetings set for the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not be surprised if there wasn't some kind of  
announcement next week, as opposed to waiting until the 20th or 
even the week of the 20th,'' Adams County District Attorney Bob 
Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grant, one of four metro-area prosecutors who have advised  
District Attorney Alex Hunter on the case, was referring to the 
legally mandated conclusion of the grand jury's term. It was 
originally set to end April 21, but a judge extended it at the 
prosecution's request to Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-year-old JonBenet was found strangled, beaten and her wrists  
bound with cord in her home on Dec. 26, 1996. Her millionaire 
parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, have been identified as suspects 
but maintain they are innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the grand jurors were spotted at the Boulder County  
Justice Center on Wednesday, all appearing to leave by 
midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzanne Laurion, spokeswoman for Hunter's office, said, ``It  
would be my thinking that perhaps an explanation today is that a 
review session was scheduled.'' The grand jury has held several 
informal evidence review sessions since it began meeting.

<HEADLINE> Violence Turns Off Stars' Modano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas Stars center Mike Modano, who strained neck  
ligaments after being sent head first into the boards last week, 
said the NHL is growing increasingly violent and if it doesn't 
change, he'll retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano, who also broke his nose and had a mild concussion after  
Anaheim defenseman Ruslan Salei cross-checked him from behind in 
Saturday's game, admits he's nervous about playing again and taking 
another hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a scary incident,'' said Modano, who was knocked  
unconscious and remembers waking to find doctors and trainers 
hovering over and yelling at him to try to move his arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see it on replay ... and to see how close (the hit)  
could've been to hampering me or from keeping me from playing ever 
again ... it makes you wonder whether it's worth it to play in this 
game and in sports in general,'' said Modano, the bridge of his 
nose bruised and scraped. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with reporters after a light workout, the team's best  
offensive player said he still feels like he's ``in a bit of a 
fog.'' Recent neurological tests showed he was recovering well, but 
Modano said he's not sure when he'll play again. 
</P>
<P>
	If the career-ending or life-threatening violence doesn't stop,  
Modano said he will get off the ice for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``If things continue, I'm not going to play anymore,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've only got four or five years more (to play), then I'm  
done,'' Modano said. ``I still have the rest of my life to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Clean hard-hitting physical play'' will always be an  
acceptable part of hockey, he said. But in the past two or three 
years, incidents of intentional violence have increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started, you didn't hear much about concussions. Now  
it's evolved into an anything-to-win attitude, even if that means 
taking out a team's top players,'' said Modano, who led the Stanley 
Cup champions in regular-season scoring with 81 points and playoff 
scoring with 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Campbell, NHL's vice president of hockey operations,  
warned last year that the league would crack down on deliberate 
attempts to injure -- particularly hits to the head. The league was 
concerned about the growing number of concussions that sidelined 
such headliners as Paul Kariya, Eric Lindros and Pat LaFontaine in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week Campbell said, ``Our stance against hits to  
the head remains very much in place. Such behavior will not be 
tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Modano and teammate Darryl Sydor, who fractured his left  
eye socket in a fight with Anaheim's Jim McKenzie, felt the NHL 
missed an opportunity to slap longer suspensions on the Mighty 
Ducks players and send a message that gratuitous violence won't be 
tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we have to wait for someone to be paralyzed or killed  
before the league, teams and players come together and act?'' said 
Modano, whose doctors told him he was lucky he could walk, much 
less play again. 
</P>
<P>
	The league suspended Salei for 10 games for the hit and will  
forfeit $109,756 in salary. McKenzie was suspended for four games 
and will lose close to $13,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydor, who joined Modano on the ice at Dr. Pepper StarCenter,  
said he gets headaches and his vision is occasionally blurry but 
feels lucky he isn't blind in his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was talking to my wife about it and I wonder if it's all  
worth it,'' the defenseman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano urged the Stars not to seek revenge during Friday's  
contest against Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am calling on my teammates to set an example for all  
players. I am looking forward to getting back on the ice and 
playing as soon as possible, but not to getting even,'' Modano said 
in a statement. ``More importantly, I don't want anyone getting 
even on my behalf.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Shares Close Up / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Wall Street's gains overnight boosted Japanese  
share prices Thursday. The dollar was higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 240.13  
points, or 1.34 percent, to close at 18,136.55 on Thursday. The 
average closed up 112.27 points, or 0.63 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei closed up for the sixth consecutive day.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was trading at 107.84 yen on the Tokyo foreign  
exchange market Thursday, up 0.48 yen from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo stock market also gained on growing optimism about  
Japan's economic outlook, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is pretty strong. The outlook for the Japanese  
economy is bright,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the 
stock division at Chuo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is struggling to emerge from its worst economic downturn  
in 50 years. Recent positive signs -- such as two straight quarters 
of economic growth -- have fueled optimism that the worst is over. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 187.75  
points, or 1.8 percent, to close Wednesday's session at 10,588.34. 
Stocks rose on a rebounding bond market and optimism about 
corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 12.51 points, or 0.83 percent, to 1,525.04. The 
TOPIX closed up 2.47 points, or 0.16 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the Nikkei's gains didn't stop investors  
from selling yen to buy dollars. Usually, investors buy yen when 
Japanese share prices rise, so they can buy into the rising market. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese investors, particularly pension and trust funds, bought  
dollars Thursday for investment in dollar-denominated assets, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overseas investors now realize that their purchases of yen for  
investing into Japanese stocks will, in the end, lead to a fall of 
the Nikkei because of a yen rise,'' said Minoru Shioiri, assistant 
manager of foreign exchange at Nippon Credit Bank. ``The link 
between dollar/yen rates and the Nikkei Average is now gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese authorities fear that too strong a yen could hamper the  
economic recovery. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more 
expensive overseas and could hurt corporate earnings if sales 
suffer as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback also benefited from pro-dollar comments by  
government officials, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs,  
Haruhiko Kuroda, said Thursday that recent yen strengthening has 
eased somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro bought 115.48 yen at midday, up  
from 115.28 yen late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7200 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.6950 percent. Its 
price fell 0.22 points to 99.82.

<HEADLINE> Bill Imperils Truck Safety Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A spending bill awaiting President Clinton's  
signature would effectively bar the Transportation Department from 
imposing fines on truckers violating safety regulations, the 
department's general counsel told a House hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
	If the $50 billion fiscal 2000 transportation spending bill  
becomes law, said Nancy McFadden, safety officials ``will not be 
able to pursue a violation by initiating a civil penalty action or 
seeking an injunction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our enforcement efforts would be severely hampered by this  
legislation,'' she told the House ground transportation 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	A provision in the bill bars the Office of Motor Carriers and  
its parent agency, the Federal Highway Administration, from 
spending money to enforce certain truck safety regulations. If 
Clinton, as expected, signs the bill, the OMC spending ban could 
run counter to existing law giving the federal highway 
administrator sole authority to assess civil penalties for 
violations of motor safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lives of the driving public will be placed in serious  
jeopardy,'' with the bill, said Rep. Nick Rahall of West Virginia, 
ranking Democrat on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible remedies to the problem, lawmakers said, are either to  
have the president veto the bill so it can be amended or pass new 
legislation redelegating penalty assessment authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an emergency, a serious problem and we've got to deal  
with it,'' said Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the 
Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	McFadden said even with the new law the department would still  
be able to issue rules, operate programs relating to motor carrier 
safety, conduct border inspections and conduct safety compliance 
reviews of bus and trucking companies. It would also be able to put 
out of service carriers that pose an immediate safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the department is studying whether to move OMC  
staffers and their duties to a new agency or an existing office in 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
	OMC head Julie Anna Cirillo, in a memo to staff members Monday,  
said they would be transferred en masse to the new organizational 
unit while members of the enforcement teams will be reassigned to 
other duties. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision was inserted into the spending bill by OMC critics  
who want to move truck safety functions to a different agency. They 
contend the office has been too close to the trucking industry, 
impeding regulators' ability to address the problem of 
truck-related traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 5,300 people are killed each year in accidents involving  
trucks, and the administration has pledged to cut that number in 
half.

	First E. Timor Refugees To Return Home  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- In Kupang, West Timor, 94 people from 15  
families boarded a cargo plane Friday to be flown back to East 
Timor, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees said. Before boarding, the refugees, who had been living 
in overcrowded camps with no water or sanitation, filled out 
voluntary repatriation forms and then held a small prayer service 
in the waiting area. Meanwhile, international peacekeepers moved 
into rocky terrain along East Timor's border with West Timor on 
Thursday, a day after repelling a militia ambush, in an effort to 
keep pro-Indonesia militiamen from carrying out more attacks.

	Death Toll Soars to 218 in Mexico Floods

	TEZIUTLAN, Mexico (AP) -- With dozens of people believed buried  
alive in mudslides, rescue workers struggled Thursday to reach 
remote towns in southern and central Mexico, where flooding brought 
on by more than a week of rain has killed at least 218 people. 
Official death tolls soared throughout the day as rescue workers 
fought through mudslides for buried victims using everything from 
bulldozers to buckets to bare hands.

	House Proposes Minimum Wage Hike  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The minimum wage would rise $1 over three  
years and businesses would get $35 billion in tax cuts under 
bipartisan legislation circulating Thursday in the House. 
Republicans and Democrats acknowledge that an increase in the 
$5.15-an-hour wage is all but inevitable, but many are looking for 
a way to offset the estimated $16 billion cost to businesses. 
``It's about two dollars of tax relief for every dollar it's 
costing,'' said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who is part of a group 
drafting the measure.

	Trump Considers Presidential Run

an exploratory committee to help him determine if he could win a 
presidential race as a Reform Party candidate. He said his first 
choice for vice president would be Oprah Winfrey. ``The only thing 
that could interest me is if I could win. I'm not talking about the 
nomination, I'm talking about the whole megillah,'' he said in a 
telephone interview from New York, where he plans to build the 
world's tallest residential building and where he lives in a 
marbled penthouse in a Fifth Avenue tower bearing his name.

	House HMO Vote Is Win for Democrats  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Thursday's House  
approval of new rights for medical patients ``shows that America is 
no longer willing to allow unfeeling practices of some health plans 
to add to the pain of injury or disease.'' The 275-151 vote marked 
a striking triumph for congressional Democrats and the White House, 
overcoming last-ditch efforts by GOP leaders to water down the 
right-to-sue provisions. Under the approved measure, patients who 
are denied care would be able to sue in state courts after seeking 
redress in an external review process.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Non-union employees working in so-called  
closed shops can be required to help pay for union organizing 
activities, the National Labor Relations Board has ruled. Ruling 
4-1 in a dispute involving supermarket workers and meat cutters who 
withdrew from the Food and Commercial Workers union, the board said 
a union's ability to recruit new members is directly tied to its 
ability to bargain collectively with employers. The National Right 
to Work Legal Defense Foundation said it will challenge the board's 
ruling.

Texas as the New York Yankees beat the Rangers 3-1 Thursday night 
for a 2-0 lead in their AL division series. Juan Gonzalez homered 
in the fourth, ending the Rangers' postseason scoreless streak at 
25 innings. But that was all they managed in 7 1-3 innings against 
Pettitte, the left-hander New York nearly dealt away at the July 31

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At this point, it doesn't seem to matter which  
pitcher the New York Yankees put on the mound against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers can't hit any of them.  
</P>
<P>
	Andy Pettitte, once again proving he's at his best in the  
biggest games, took his turn at shutting down Texas in a 3-1 
victory Thursday night that gave the Yankees a 2-0 lead in their AL 
division series. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Gonzalez homered in the fourth, ending the Rangers'  
postseason scoreless streak at 25 innings. But that was all they 
managed in 7 1-3 innings against Pettitte, the left-hander New York 
nearly dealt away at the July 31 trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like every year I struggle and they talk about  
trading me and then somebody stands up for me, like Joe,'' Pettitte 
said. ``I had a tough year, a lot of people doubting me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But manager Joe Torre never was one of them.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen Andy do it before. When you need to count on him, he  
doesn't disappoint,'' Torre said. ``He makes big plays, he makes 
big pitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees won their ninth straight postseason game and sent  
Texas to its eighth playoff loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Ledee's tiebreaking double in the seventh off loser Rick  
Helling and a bases-loaded walk to pinch-hitter Jim Leyritz in the 
eighth put the Yankees one win away from their second consecutive 
3-0 sweep of Texas in the opening round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas manager Johnny Oates shook up his lineup, moving Royce  
Clayton into the leadoff spot for only the third time this year. It 
did not do much. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers have just two runs in their last 51 postseason  
innings, and now the World Series champions will try to finish it 
Saturday night at Texas when Roger Clemens pitches against Esteban 
Loaiza. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know in our heart we can play with these guys,'' Oates  
said. ``But until we start doing it, there's always going to be 
doubts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No surprise, it was Pettitte who put the Yankees in position to  
advance to the next round. A demonstrative Pettitte, too, who 
pumped his fist and shouted after a big strikeout in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm usually not very emotional, but it was a big game,''  
Pettitte said. ``I was locked in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte almost missed out on this party when the Yankees came  
close to trading him to Philadelphia more than two months ago. At 
the time, Pettitte was struggling at 7-8 and seemed distracted, 
possibly by his father's heart problems back in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But Torre, with help from general manager Brian Cashman,  
convinced owner George Steinbrenner not to make the deal. 
Steinbrenner agreed, and challenged Pettitte to ``show what kind of 
man he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since, Pettitte backed up Torre's confidence. And against  
Texas, he looked every bit as focused as the pitcher who won the 
clinching Game 4 of last year's World Series and the crucial Game 5 
of the 1996 Series against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what I remember about Andy,'' Torre said. ``I remember  
him walking that tightrope in '96.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte gave up one run and seven hits, walking none and  
striking out five. Last year, he also beat Helling 3-1 in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Every Yankees infielder rushed to the mound to offer pats of  
congratulations to Pettitte when Torre brought in reliever Jeff 
Nelson in the eighth. Pettitte received a standing ovation from the 
crowd of 57,485 -- a stark contrast to the rude treatment the fans 
gave him earlier this year -- and he responded with an enthusiastic 
wave of the cap. 
</P>
<P>
	``He understands the magnitude of these games,'' Yankees catcher  
Joe Girardi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson struck out Ivan Rodriguez and Gonzalez, and Mariano  
Rivera pitched the ninth for a save. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Brosius, MVP of the 1998 World Series, hit a tying double  
in the fifth for his first hit of his postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	New York took a 2-1 lead in the seventh after Tino Martinez led  
off with a walk and took third on Chili Davis' single. 
</P>
<P>
	Ledee, a World Series hero last year but sent to the minors  
early this season, delivered a fly-ball double to right-center for 
a 2-1 lead. Center fielder Roberto Kelly seemed to have a chance at 
catching it, but appeared to back off a bit when Gonzalez came over 
from right. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz drew his bases-loaded walk in the eighth from Mike  
Venafro. 
</P>
<P>
	After being blanked 8-0 in Game 1, the Rangers rewarded Gonzalez  
with exuberant high-fives after he reprised his role as a 
Yankees-killer with a line-drive homer into the left-field stands 
in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez put on incredible power show in the 1996 playoff series  
against New York with five home runs, including two against 
Pettitte. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte had escaped a first-and-second, no-outs jam in the  
second, then kept the Rangers from adding to a 1-0 lead in a tense 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly led off with a single and took third on Lee Stevens'  
double. Mark McLemore struck out and Clayton, after taking a minute 
because he had trouble shaking the weighted doughnut off his bat, 
grounded out to a slightly drawn-in Brosius at third. 
</P>
<P>
	Rusty Greer ran the count full before striking out on a breaking  
ball in the dirt, prompting Pettitte's exaggerated reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly had our opportunities,'' Oates said, ``but Andy  
kept making pitches where he wanted to when he had to. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer, cut in the ear and left jaw  
by Chuck Knoblauch's foul ball in Game 1, wore a gag gift in the 
first inning when Knoblauch batted -- a military helmet with a 
Yankees logo. Zimmer had a bandage over his wounds. ... Clemens is 
1-2 with a 3.88 ERA in nine career starts in the postseason. Loaiza

<HEADLINE> NASA To Test 'Synthetic Vision' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Va. (AP) -- NASA researchers are planning their first  
test of a high-tech cockpit display designed to give commercial 
pilots a clear, virtual reality view even when the weather is bad. 
</P>
<P>
	The display works like a detailed, three-dimensional video game,  
showing mountains, runways and other landscape features as the 
plane approaches. Researchers call it ``synthetic vision'' and say 
it could dramatically cut the number of accidents caused by poor 
visibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am extremely confident that in the future, this will be the  
way the world will fly,'' said Mike Lewis, director of the nation's 
Aviation Safety Program, led by NASA's Langley Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted synthetic vision could be on commercial planes in  
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Visibility-induced errors account for more than 30 percent of  
fatal air accidents. A pilot who can't see landmarks can become 
disoriented and make deadly mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have theorized that's what happened when John F. Kennedy  
Jr. crashed this summer when he was trying to land his plane at 
night on Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, NASA plans to have a pilot fly a Convair  
twin-propeller research plane from Hampton to Asheville, N.C., 
using a 3-D map on a cockpit screen. 
</P>
<P>
	The map was built from a database compiled from images taken by  
a survey aircraft, Lewis said. It cost $50,000 to map the test 
flight route alone. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA plans to develop a more comprehensive database using radar  
on an upcoming space shuttle mission that will map 80 percent of 
the world's land surface for the Defense Department's National 
Imagery and Mapping Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA expects to spend roughly $75 million over five years to  
develop synthetic vision, with private companies kicking in an 
additional $20 million to $30 million, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, he said, commercial and private pilots may wear  
virtual-reality goggles that will keep the display in front of 
their eyes at all times.

<HEADLINE> Charges Filed Against Papers Thief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New federal charges have been filed against a  
man convicted of stealing papers signed by Thomas Edison, Thomas 
Jefferson and others for allegedly trying to sell more documents to 
an antiques dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI complaint said Daniel Spiegelman of New York contacted a  
Greenwich, Conn., store last Friday and tried to sell stolen 
manuscripts and letters worth about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Items signed by five presidents -- Jefferson, James Monroe,  
Andrew Jackson, James Polk and John Quincy Adams -- were offered 
along with scientific papers of Edison and a rare manuscript, all 
stolen from Columbia University, according to the complaint filed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Greenwich charged Spiegelman last week after the owner  
of Alexander Autographs Inc. in Greenwich said a man identifying 
himself as Andrew Osharksy had offered items that he recognized to 
be part of the stolen Columbia collection, authorities said. 
Prosecutors said Osharksy is an alias used by Spiegelman. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal charges against Spiegelman allege that he illegally  
transported stolen documents across state lines for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Fallick, a lawyer for Spiegelman, declined to comment  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiegelman was sentenced to five years in prison in July 1998  
after he was convicted of stealing $1.3 million worth of historical 
documents from Columbia University's Rare Collection Library in 
1994.

<HEADLINE> FBI Shorthanded in Battling Hackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI is teaching agents across the country  
to investigate threats posed by computer-savvy terrorists and 
hackers trying to break into the nation's most sensitive data 
networks, but so far has been able to train agents in only a 
handful of its biggest field offices. 
</P>
<P>
	That shortfall, disclosed in congressional testimony by the head  
of the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center, comes 
during a time of growing recognition within the federal government 
that even some of the nation's most critical computer networks are 
inadequately protected. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Vatis, director of the center, told the Senate Judiciary  
technology and terrorism subcommittee Wednesday that the FBI has 
trained teams of at least seven cyber-agents in field offices in 
Washington, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and four other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``because of resource constraints, the other field offices  
have only one to five agents dedicated to working on ... (computer 
intrusion) matters,'' Vatis told the Senate panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our bench is thin, very thin,'' Vatis told The Washington  
Post. ``We have put together a good starting lineup. But if we had 
several major incidents at the same time, we would be severely 
stretched, to put it mildly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI's case load for computer hacking and intrusion  
investigations continues to grow dramatically, too. Vatis said the 
agency has 800 pending cases, and the number of those 
investigations is doubling every year for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of  
Congress, released a report earlier this week warning that computer 
systems at the Defense Department, law enforcement and private 
industries are at risk because of poor management and lax 
oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said it will take more than the federal government to  
tighten security on its networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``All our efforts to put the federal government's house in order  
and to serve as a model for industry will be of little service if 
our government information systems are impossible to break into, 
but the electrical power that they operate on is shut down by 
malicious actions of a foreign government,'' said John Tritak, 
director of the government's Critical Infrastructure Assurance 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Vatis also acknowledged for the first time publicly that the FBI  
believes that hackers suspected of breaking into some of America's 
most sensitive networks earlier this year originated from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Those attacks, dubbed ``Moonlight Maze'' by investigators, were  
first reported in July by a London newspaper. Citing congressional 
sources, it said the attackers may have stolen some of the nation's 
most sensitive military secrets, including weapons guidance systems 
and naval intelligence codes. 
</P>
<P>
	The intruders have stolen ``unclassified but still-sensitive  
information about essentially defense technical research matters,'' 
Vatis said. ``About the furthest I can go is to say the intrusions 
appear to originate in Russia,'' he told the subcommittee.

<HEADLINE> Herenton Re-Elected Memphis Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The city's first black mayor, Willie  
Herenton, won a third term Thursday despite a bitter challenge from 
Joe Ford, a member of Memphis' most politically powerful black 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	With 100 percent of the votes tallied, Herenton led with 74,896  
votes, or 46 percent, while Ford pulled 41,161 votes, or 25 
percent. Coming in third was pro wrestler Jerry ``The King'' 
Lawler, with 19,092 votes, or 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford conceded about two hours after the polls closed.  
</P>
<P>
	Herenton, 59, charged that the family of former Rep. Harold Ford  
was attempting a power grab by running Ford, a brother of the 
former congressman and an uncle of current Rep. Harold Ford Jr., 
D-Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Fords serve on the City Council, County Commission and in the  
state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe Ford's name is on the ballot, but Harold Ford Sr. is  
running. That's no secret,'' Herenton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Ford, who did not seek re-election to the City Council,  
where he served as chairman, accused Herenton of selling out to 
special interests by spending money downtown while ignoring the 
city's poorest residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Herenton campaigned on the strong local economy, the  
revitalization of downtown Memphis and a falling crime rate. The 
term lasts for four years, and there is no chance for a runoff -- 
whoever gets the most votes wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Memphis, with 650,000 residents, is 55 percent black.  
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates in the nonpartisan election included Lawler,  
who in 1982 slapped comedian Andy Kaufman on ``Late Night With 
David Letterman,'' and Pepper Rodgers, the former college football 
coach who led Memphis' failed attempt to get an NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican Party tried to rally support for Pete Sisson, a  
white former county commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard feelings boiled over this summer in a dispute over  
campaign signs. Ford backers said an off-duty police officer on 
Herenton's security detail began videotaping campaign supporters 
putting up signs. The Ford camp said the officer displayed a gun 
after he was bumped by the Ford supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Herenton said the officer was trying to catch the Ford group  
throwing away Herenton signs. The officer said he got his gun 
because Ford supporters were flashing gang hand signals. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges were filed.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Fire Manager Ray Miller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles today fired manager Ray  
Miller after two straight losing seasons with one of the 
highest-paid teams in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles announced they would not exercise their option to  
keep Miller as manager. Owner Peter Angelos would not say whether 
general manager Frank Wren would remain with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to fire Miller was not unexpected. When he replaced  
Davey Johnson in November 1997, the Orioles were coming off two 
straight appearances in the AL championship series. Yet Baltimore 
finished 79-83 last year and was never in contention this season 
after stumbling to a 4-14 start. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite carrying a $78.5 million opening day payroll,  
third-highest in baseball, the Orioles were 36-51 at the All-Star 
break and needed a 13-game winning streak in September to finish 
78-84. 
</P>
<P>
	No replacement was immediately hired. Former Milwaukee Brewers  
manager Phil Garner is considered to be the leading candidate. 
Garner was in the midst of his seventh straight losing season when 
he was fired by the Brewers in August, but he had the disadvantage 
of working in a small market and with a team whose salary paled 
compared to the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Trebelhorn, the Orioles' director of player development and  
former manager of the Brewers and Chicago Cubs, is also a 
possibility. So is former Oriole Don Baylor, who gained his 
managerial experience with the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time that Miller failed to field a winner as  
a major league manager. He went 50-50 with the Minnesota Twins in 
the second half of the 1985 season and was fired in September 1986 
with the team struggling at 59-70. 
</P>
<P>
	The 54-year-old Miller said Saturday he would not accept another  
job within the Baltimore organization, even though he has enjoyed 
tremendous success as the Orioles' pitching coach from 1978-85 and 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad pitching cost him his job. The Orioles had a club-record  
.279 batting average and set a franchise record with 1,572 hits, 
but Baltimore lost a whopping 24 games when it scored at least six 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is the latest in a series of Baltimore managers to come  
and go under Angelos, who hand-picked Miller after accepting 
Johnson's faxed resignation after the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos fired Johnny Oates after the 1994 season and hired  
former pitching coach Phil Regan, who lasted one year. Johnson 
stuck around for two seasons; ditto for Miller, whose career record 
as a manager now stands at 266-297.

<HEADLINE> Employees at Paris Airports Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Many ground personnel at the two main Paris  
airports went on strike today to highlight their demands during 
talks under way with management over implementing a 35-hour 
workweek. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike did not concern pilots and flight attendants. It  
slowed air traffic and closed off one of two runways at Orly 
airport and one of three runways at Charles de Gaulle airport 
today, causing delays of up to one hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Both runways were operational by the afternoon, said Isabelle de  
Villaneuve, a spokeswoman for the Airports of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how many employees participated in the strike,  
waged as employees and management are in talks about instituting 
the 35-hour workweek, a plan proposed by France's leftist 
government coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies have some flexibility in deciding how adopt the  
project. The Paris airports have proposed that employees take more 
time off during slow seasons, rather than spreading the downtime 
over each week, but some unions have expressed concern over this 
and other measures, Villaneuve said. 
</P>
<P>
	The employees have many, often seemingly minute demands, over  
retirement and flexibility, among others. They complain that 
management is not listening to their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	By Jan. 1, 2000, companies with more than 20 employees will be  
required by law to implement the 35-hour workweek. The government 
passed a law last year that encourages companies to sign on to the 
plan ahead of schedule by giving them tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's leftist government hopes that  
reducing working hours will force companies to hire more employees 
to maintain the same level of productivity, and help reduce 
unemployment.

<HEADLINE> Thompson Won't Compete at World's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- Jennie Thompson reinjured her left ankle  
in practice and will not compete for the U.S. gymnastics team in 
the World Gymnastics Championships, a team spokeswoman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 18, third in the U.S. championships in August, hurt  
the ankle Monday while practicing the vault, spokeswoman Susan 
Polakoff said. Team officials decided Thursday night she wasn't fit 
for the championships, which start Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	She will be replaced by Morgan White, 16, who, like Thompson,  
trains at the Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy. White finished seventh 
in the U.S. championships and was the all-around gold medalist in 
the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson was a member of the American team that placed fifth in  
the last World Championships in 1997. In 1993, at 12 years old, 
Thompson was the youngest ever U.S. junior national champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's team of White, Kristen Maloney, Vanessa Atler,

<HEADLINE> House Approves HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to a stream of HMO horror stories,  
the House approved bipartisan legislation Thursday granting new 
rights to patients, including a broad ability to sue their health 
insurance companies for denying care. 
</P>
<P>
	The 275-151 vote marked a striking triumph for congressional  
Democrats and the White House, overcoming last-ditch efforts by GOP 
leaders to water down the right-to-sue provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	In a poignant moment shortly before the final roll call, Rep.  
Greg Ganske told the story of a young boy who lost his arms and 
legs to gangrene after his HMO ordered his parents to drive to a 
distant emergency room for treatment of a high fever. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he had a finger and you pricked it, it would bleed. He's  
not an anecdote,'' said the Iowa Republican, while the boy, 
7-year-old James Adams, sat in the front row of the House chamber 
playing contentedly. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who lobbied for passage of the bill by phone,  
said afterward the outcome on the House floor ``shows that America 
is no longer willing to allow unfeeling practices of some health 
plans to add to the pain of injury or disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican critics cautioned that the bill was a boon to trial  
lawyers and that the lawsuit provisions would drive up the cost of 
insurance, prompting many employers to abandon health care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we really want to take a chance that millions of Americans  
are going to lose their insurance?'' asked Rep. John Boehner, 
R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a risk the House seemed willing to take.  
</P>
<P>
	The measure would guarantee access to reasonable emergency room  
care, give patients the right to see pediatricians and 
obstetricians without permission from primary care doctors and 
require routine care associated with clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who were denied care would be able to sue in state  
courts after seeking redress in an external review process. There 
would be no limit on the amount of damages that could be recovered 
so long as the patient adhered to the decision made by the outside 
appeals panel. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote capped a two-day debate over health care access and  
accountability, and set the stage for what will likely be 
contentious negotiations with the Senate on a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Companion legislation to be rolled into the compromise talks  
would create a variety of new tax breaks for health insurance. That 
bill, crafted by the Republican leadership, cleared the house on 
Wednesday on a largely party-line vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The patient protection bill triggered fierce lobbying in the  
House. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore telephoned wavering 
lawmakers in the hours before the vote, urging support for the 
bipartisan measure crafted by Reps. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., and 
John Dingell, D-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also issued a letter designed to reassure Democrats  
concerned about possible Republican campaign attacks. In it, he 
pledged he would refuse to sign any House-Senate compromise that 
wasn't fully paid for without dipping into the Social Security 
trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., struggled  
unsuccessfully to head off the most stinging defeat of his 
nine-month tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	In a closed-door caucus of the Republicans' rank and file,  
according to a GOP source who spoke on condition of anonymity, 
Hastert recognized the difficulty in their voting for a version -- 
backed by Republican leaders -- that went further than many would 
have liked on the right-to-sue issue. 
</P>
<P>
	But, according to this source, Hastert said the alternative  
would be ``handing the reins over'' to Dingell. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging the political potency of the issue, Hastert  
cautioned that Republicans ``cannot afford to be held responsible 
for killing patient protection legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the alternative measure Republicans pushed to the  
floor was defeated on a vote of 238-193, with 29 Republicans 
rejecting Hastert's pleas. 
</P>
<P>
	An even greater number of Republicans, 68, swung behind the  
bipartisan measure and helped push it to approval once the GOP 
alternative had failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes underscored the difficulty the GOP leadership has had  
all year on the patient protection issue. The insurance industry 
opposes any right to sue, and many Republicans philosophically do, 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other alternatives were defeated during the day.  
</P>
<P>
	One, authored by Boehner would deny individuals the right to sue  
their insurance plans. It fell, 284-145. 
</P>
<P>
	The second, proposed by Reps. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., and Lindsey  
Graham, R-S.C., was similar to the GOP-backed measure on lawsuits, 
but closer to the bipartisan measure on other provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from Ganske's description of the young boy's ordeal,  
lawmakers of both parties recited stories of care inexplicably 
denied with disastrous results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these horror stories ... have resonated with members''  
of the House, said Rep. Ray Lahood, an Illinois Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time we asked the insurance industry to be responsible  
for its actions,'' said Norwood, a former dentist and Georgia 
Republican who has bucked his leadership for years in pushing for 
the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-passed bill would guarantee participants in HMOs the  
right to pediatric or obstetrical and gynecological care without 
clearance from a primary care physician. 
</P>
<P>
	HMO patients in a physician network would be guaranteed the  
option of a point-of-service plan, with a broader array of 
physicians. Coverage would be guaranteed for emergency room care if 
a ``prudent layperson'' believed their health was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	While the GOP-backed measure included roughly comparable  
provisions on all these points, the struggle for much of the day 
revolved around creation of a new right to sue HMOs that currently 
enjoy protection from lawsuits.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings 7, Thrashers 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Steve Yzerman scored his first goal of the season  
to ignite a three-goal first period Thursday night and the Detroit 
Red Wings went on to a 7-1 victory over the expansion Atlanta 
Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second NHL game for the Thrashers, who lost in their  
debut on Saturday 4-1 to New Jersey at Philips Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Yzerman also had a pair of assists as the Red Wings won for the  
second time in three starts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the opening period, Yzerman scored Detroit's first goal and  
got an assist on the second one by Igor Larionov. Vyacheslav Kozlov 
scored the third goal with Larionov getting an assist on that one. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers averted a shutout when Petr Buzek beat Detroit  
goaltender Chris Osgood on a 30-foot slap shot 2:23 into the final 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings, however, broke it by scoring three goals in 3:33  
for a 6-1 lead before a sellout crowd of 18,535. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Duchesne scored at the 5:23 mark, Yzerman assisting.  
Sergei Fedorov followed with another goal only 56 seconds later for 
a 5-1 lead. Tomas Holmstrom, who assisted on Fedorov's goal, 
knocked in a 15-foot slap shot after 8:56 and Doug Brown, with an 
assist from Holmstrom, made it 7-1 with a goal with 1:08 left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings (2-1) peppered Thrashers goaltender Norm Maracle  
for a dozen shots in the opening period with Yzerman, who has led 
Detroit in scoring 10 times in his 16 NHL seasons, beating the 
former Red Wings goalie from in close after only 6:50. 
</P>
<P>
	Maracle, taken by the Thrashers in the June expansion draft, had  
played in 20 games for Detroit during the previous two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Larionov made it 2-0 at 11:56 by knocking one past Maracle from  
just to the side of the net with Yzerman and Larry Murphy getting 
assists. Kozlov closed out the first period scoring with a rebound 
goal after 15:38. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Wings forward Darren McCarty, ended his holdout earlier in  
the day by signing a three-year, $5.4 million deal. He was in 
uniform and played sparingly.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Are Barely Changed / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond markets barely moved Thursday as  
traders awaited a government report on employment as they looked 
for clues on the course of interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dipped 3/32  
point, or 94 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 6.18 from 6.17 percent 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders essentially sat still preparing for Friday's release of  
September's figures on employment and hourly wages, a key inflation 
indicator. 
</P>
<P>
	With labor markets already tight, another big increase in the  
number of jobholders can drive up wages, something that adds 
pressure on consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Friday's figures could provide a general sense of  
whether the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates for a 
third time this year when policy-makers next meet on Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting Tuesday, the Fed left rates unchanged, but said it  
was watching for signs of rekindled inflation and ready to increase 
rates to cool off the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were either unchanged or rose 1/32 point, while intermediate 
maturities ranged from no change to a decline of 1/32 point, 
reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, the yield on three-month Treasury was 4.83  
percent, as the discount rose 0.04 point from Thursday to 4.70 
percent. The six-month yield was 5.11 percent as the discount rose 
0.05 percentage point to 4.91 percent. The one-year yield rose to 
5.32 percent, and the discount rose 0.01 to 5.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay at maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.31 percent from 5.19 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 3/16 to 111 9/32. The average yield to 
maturity of the index was 5.95 percent, up from 5.94 percent.

<HEADLINE> Grains Fall; Soybeans Steady / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain futures prices fell and soybean futures  
prices were steady to fractionally higher in trading Thursday on 
the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean futures were supported by higher than expected weekly  
export sales figures, released Thursday by the U.S. Agriculture 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean exports totaled 975,400, according to the USDA, beating  
the most optimistic analyst estimates by well over 100,000 metric 
tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Weighing on soybean futures was harvest weather in the Midwest,  
which continues to look good for producers. Positioning by traders 
ahead of Friday's USDA crop production report also affected the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures prices fell on expectation the USDA will raise the  
size of the 1999-2000 crop in its production report. Also 
pressuring corn futures was the rapid pace of the corn crop harvest 
and reports China's corn exports will increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were sharply lower on fears the government will  
report another increase in the size of wheat stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery was 5 1/2 cents lower at $2.58 3/4 a  
bushel; December corn was 1 1/2 cents lower at $2.03 1/4 a bushel; 
December oats were 2 cents lower at $1.09 3/4 a bushel; November 
soybeans were unchanged at $3.89 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle and hog futures prices rose in trading on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle futures rallied due to higher cash prices and the  
likelihood strong demand will continue to the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hog futures were higher on expectation of increased demand and  
on the possibility U.S. farm aid to Russia will result increased 
exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork belly futures were sharply higher due to rising cash  
prices. Increasing demand for bacon by fast-food restaurants also 
was a boost to prices. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle were .80 cent higher at 70 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle were .65 cent higher at 83.02 cents a pound; 
December lean hogs were 1.05 cents higher at 45.75 cents a pound; 
February pork bellies were 3 cents higher at 64.22 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Auditors Criticize HUD Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government auditors say a housing program  
championed by the Clinton administration is a poorly conceived, 
poorly run waste of money that is tainted by politics, and they 
have recommended that the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
	But HUD officials said a report critical of the Community  
Builders program is itself a one-sided political document timed to 
strengthen the Republican position as the government scrambles to 
finish the federal budget for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, this isn't about the merits of the Community Builders  
program,'' David Egner, a HUD spokesman, said Wednesday. ``It's 
just about scoring partisan political points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the report, released Sept. 30, HUD's independent inspector  
general's office called the Community Builders program an ``overly 
expensive'' endeavor that exacerbates the department's 
long-standing management problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our opinion, HUD should discontinue the Community Builder  
position,'' the report said. ``It cannot afford the Community 
Builder concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program was created in 1997 to separate ``customer service''  
functions in HUD from the department's operation, monitoring, 
enforcement and policing of dozens of housing programs. At the time 
it was touted as one of Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo's efforts to 
overhaul HUD and do away with its reputation as a ``poster child of 
inept government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was about not having the same person playing both good cop  
and bad cop,'' a senior HUD official said Wednesday, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD officials said 400 employees in the department were  
transferred into the Community Builders program and another 400 
were hired from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
	But the department's auditors said the reorganization was not  
properly planned or implemented, and HUD officials may have 
violated hiring rules in building its staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``To establish the Community Building position, HUD had to  
allocate salary, training and travel dollars, as well as personnel, 
from its monitoring and enforcement role at a time when the 
department was already significantly decreasing its workforce,'' 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The result, the auditors said, was a dramatic increase in the  
number of HUD employees ``not part of a specific program, engaged 
in customer relations and owing their jobs to the department's 
political management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton supports the program so strongly his senior  
advisors have recommended that he veto an appropriations bill 
funding HUD if Republicans in Congress persist in trying to kill 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Friday, the White House Office of Management and  
Budget said on reason advisors would recommend a veto is because 
``the administration strongly objects to the Senate's intention to 
eliminate the Community Builders Program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Egner also said several independent consulting firms, including  
Ernst &AMP; Young, have praised the program as innovative and 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
	A letter signed by 17 Democratic senators Wednesday praised  
Community Builders and urged Appropriations Committee Chairman 
Christopher Bond, R-Mo., to reconsider a plan to reduce or 
eliminate it. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a minimum, it is clearly far too early to judge whether the  
program should be terminated,'' the letter said. ``In addition, the 
current bill significantly reduces HUD staff, thereby undermining 
the department's efforts to reorganize and improve its service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HUD and the department's independent inspector general's office  
have clashed before. An apparent feud between Inspector General 
Susan Gaffney and top housing officials spilled into the public in 
March, when Deputy Secretary Saul Ramirez told a Senate 
subcommittee that Gaffney had taken a ``destructive, attack 
approach'' to the department.

<HEADLINE> Cincinnati Gun Lawsuit Cismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- An Ohio state judge today dismissed the city's  
lawsuit against gun manufacturers, a distributor and three trade 
associations on the grounds that it was vague and unsupported by 
legal precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other cities across the country also have sued the  
firearms industry. Today's action was the first dismissal of such a 
suit, a lawyer for gun manufacturers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Dorr, a Chicago lawyer for gun makers Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co.  
Inc., of Southport, Conn., and Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., of 
Springfield, Mass., said he hopes to use the ruling by Hamilton 
County Common Pleas Judge Robert Ruehlman in seeking the dismissal 
of 17 similar lawsuits representing 27 city or county governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Those lawsuits are pending in state or federal courts around the  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``These lawsuits filed by the cities have been, in our opinion,  
nothing but smoke and mirrors with no legal foundation to them,'' 
Dorr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruehlman became the first judge to dismiss any of the lawsuits,  
Dorr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati had demanded reimbursement for the costs of providing  
police, emergency, court and prison services in connection with 
shootings in the city, regardless of whether those shootings were 
homicidal, suicidal or accidental. 
</P>
<P>
	The city also sought damages for alleged reduction of property  
values and loss of taxpayer revenues, plus court orders that would 
force the defendants to change the way they design, distribute and 
advertise their products nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the Legislature, not the courts, has the authority to  
impose that type of regulation, the judge ruled. Ruehlman rejected 
other claims by Cincinnati as vague or not supported by laws or 
precedent in court cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley M. Chesley, Cincinnati's lawyer, said he expects to  
appeal within the next few days to the 1st Ohio District Court of 
Appeals in Cincinnati. The judge's ruling was premature because the 
city had not been allowed to review documents from the defendants, 
Chesley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants in Cincinnati's lawsuit are Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co.; Smith  
&AMP; Wesson; Beretta U.S.A. Corp.; Bryco Arms Inc.; Colt's 
Manufacturing Co. Inc.; H &AMP; R 1871 Inc.; Hi-Point Firearms; Lorcin 
Engineering Co. Inc.; North Americans Arms Inc.; Phoenix Arms; 
Taurus International Manufacturing Inc., Fabrica D'Armi, Pietro 
Beretta S.P.A. and B.L. Jennings Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati's claims included alleged design defects in firearms  
and alleged failure to warn users of possible risks from use of 
firearms. The judge rejected those. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be liability for failure to warn only if the risk is  
not open and obvious or a matter of common knowledge. The court 
finds as a matter of law that the risks associated with the use of 
a firearm are open and obvious and matters of common knowledge,'' 
Ruehlman wrote in his five-page ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The city's claim of liability for defective firearm designs  
failed to meet a requirement under Ohio law of identifying specific 
products or specific injuries and their causes, the judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruehlman said he ruled on the basis of written filings and  
lawyers' arguments he heard on Sept. 27.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Faces Zimbabwe at Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With the volatile John McEnroe in charge and  
Andre Agassi back on the team, the Americans will be heavy 
favorites will they face Zimbabwe in the first round of the Davis 
Cup on Feb. 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough travel trip, but I like our chances,'' McEnroe  
said at a news conference in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States was drawn Thursday to play at Harare,  
Zimbabwe, in a potentially tricky first-round World Group match. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zimbabwe, which upset Australia away from home two years  
ago, has a strong veteran team led by brothers Byron and Wayne 
Black. And the Americans will have to cope with a long trip to an 
unfamiliar country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a very tricky first match for John,'' said Boris  
Becker, the former three-time Wimbledon champion who manages 
Germany's Davis Cup team. ``They will have to travel to Africa 
after the Australian Open. That will be hard on the players, and 
the Black brothers perform well under pressure. America has to play 
with its best team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe said he recently talked to Pete Sampras about playing.  
</P>
<P>
	Then he dropped to his knees with his hands clasped as in  
prayer, saying, ``Here's the nature of my talk with Pete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he realizes it's the right thing to do.'' McEnroe  
said. ``I think his priorities have shifted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe also noted that Todd Martin has indicated a desire to  
play and said he would like Jim Courier to consider playing 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think things are turning around in a positive way,'' McEnroe  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zimbabwe's top tennis official described the pairing with the  
United States as a ``dream draw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be the biggest sporting event ever in Zimbabwe,''  
tennis federation president Paul Chingoka said. ``It can't get any 
bigger than this. Just think. A small nation like ours hosting a 
giant. 
</P>
<P>
	``The result of the match doesn't matter so much. Having  
McEnroe, Agassi and hopefully Sampras coming to town will have a 
huge impact on the development of tennis in Zimbabwe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The matches will be played on an indoor hard court at the  
5,000-seat City Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's already sold out,'' Chingoka said. ``The atmosphere will  
be electric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Davis Cup crowds in some countries can be rowdy and  
unruly, Chingoka said the Americans will have nothing to fear in 
Harare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zimbabwe is a sporting country,'' he said. ``The fans will  
applaud the Americans. They will never be hostile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Americans beat Zimbabwe, they will next face either  
Britain or the Czech Republic in the second round. That throws up a 
possible repeat of this year's thrilling first-round match at 
Birmingham, England, where the Americans, with Martin and Courier 
playing singles, beat Britain's Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	The other leading countries in America's top half of the draw  
are Spain, which entertains Italy, and Russia, which plays at home 
against Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia, which beat the United States in this year's  
quarterfinals, plays France in the final at Nice on Dec. 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australians will open next year's competition in  
Switzerland, Germany will be at home against the Netherlands, 
France will play in Brazil, and Slovakia entertains Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe was appointed U.S. captain last month, capping a long  
campaign to be put in charge of the team. He succeeded Tom 
Gullikson, who captained the team for six years but bore the blame 
for the U.S. defeat to Australia in suburban Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe is one of America's most successful Davis Cup players,  
compiling an overall record of 59-10 and playing on five 
championship winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the draw, McEnroe got a boost when Agassi  
announced he would play in the first round. Agassi, who is back at 
No. 1 in the world rankings after winning the French Open and U.S. 
Open this year, had vowed earlier this year never to play Davis Cup 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, who has had a history of run-ins with the U.S. Tennis  
Association, changed his mind when McEnroe was appointed, 
announcing at the U.S. Open that he would play Davis Cup next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to be the best captain ever so far,''  
Agassi said. ``He'll bring a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of energy, a 
lot of experience. It's an advantage to have someone on your team 
with his kind of fighting spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras has been sidelined with a herniated disc in his back, an  
injury that forced him to pull out of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe said he would not put himself on the team to play  
doubles, ``unless I cannot get anybody to go to Zimbabwe.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Proposes Parental Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Offering relief to working parents, Democratic  
presidential candidate Bill Bradley today proposed a $26 billion 
program of education grants for parents and children and an 
expanded family and medical leave law. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a plan that looks ahead to our long-term interests in  
human terms not just economic ones,'' Bradley said in remarks 
prepared for a campaign speech today at New Hampshire's Contoocook 
Valley Regional High School. 
</P>
<P>
	He also poked at the Clinton-Gore administration's boast of  
economic success, saying ``A prosperity that fails to bolster 
families is a hollow and unsustainable one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $26 billion, 10-year cost of new grants for early childhood  
education and parent-friendly community colleges would be paid for 
-- like his $65 billion-per-year universal health plan -- from the 
federal budget surplus that is projected to reach about $1 trillion 
over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included in the package is an older-person's version of  
President Clinton's ``Americorps.'' With a goal of enlisting 
500,000 volunteers over three years, Bradley would offer $200 
annual, tax-free stipends to senior citizens who give at least 15 
hours per week to approved nonprofit youth programs such as the 
YMCA, Boys and Girls Clubs, school tutoring, or faith-based 
mentoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are all in this together,'' said the former senator from  
New Jersey. ``And what individual families cannot build on their 
own, we can all build together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing a proposal voiced by Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday,  
Bradley said he would expand to workers in firms at least 25 
employees the popular Family and Medical Leave Act. The 1993 law, 
which currently applies only to businesses with 50 or more workers, 
guarantees them 12 weeks' unpaid leave to tend to a new child, a 
seriously ill family member or their own personal illness. 
</P>
<P>
	He said workers also should be given an additional 24 hours each  
year to meet other family obligations, such as attending 
parent-teacher conferences, taking a child to the dentist or 
helping an elderly relative with medical appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley aides appeared caught off guard when told late Wednesday  
that Gore, Bradley's rival for the Democratic presidential 
nomination next year, had articulated the same proposed changes to 
the family-leave law at a New York fund-raiser a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's plan would give $2 billion per year to state and local  
partnerships -- comprised of groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, 
Parent-Teacher Association, local child welfare agencies and 
churches -- to find new ways of tackling needs for child care, 
school readiness, parenting education and special services for 
children with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty percent of the new money would be reserved to bolster  
existing programs, such as Head Start, with the balance intended to 
pay for new services. 
</P>
<P>
	The program, Bradley said, ``operates under the simple  
understanding that we all have a shared responsibility for our 
children. Government, acting as a catalyst, can provide the kind of 
supporting infrastructure that families need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley would offer $2 billion in competitive grants to  
community colleges that do a better job of matching high school 
graduates' needs with demands in the local job market, providing 
flexible class schedules and on-site child care for working parents 
and improving students' technological skills. 
</P>
<P>
	The programs' remaining costs involve the proposal for a senior  
volunteer corps. 
</P>
<P>
	``My proposal focuses on four areas that are of vital concern to  
all families and is premised on a simple idea: That if you have 
health care coverage, good child care, educational opportunity and 
supportive work environments, you can be a better parent,'' Bradley 
said.

<HEADLINE> GE Profits Rise 16 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- General Electric Co.'s profits rose 16  
percent in the third quarter, led by strong growth in its aircraft 
engines, power systems and NBC divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The conglomerate, the nation's fifth-largest company, earned  
$2.65 billion, or 80 cents per share, compared with $2.28 billion, 
or 69 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were a penny over the expectations of analysts  
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. GE's stock fell $1.81 1/4 to 
$121.87 1/2 in New York Stock Exchange trading amid a mostly down day 
for the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	GE said its revenues rose 13 percent to $27.2 billion from  
$24.14 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman John F. Welch said the increase was driven by global  
growth, expansion of the company's product services and the 
introduction of new products. 
</P>
<P>
	At GE's Power Systems division, profit rose 51 percent to $383  
million, up from $254 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At Aircraft Engines, earnings rose 28 percent to $535 million,  
up from $417 million a year ago. The division continued to win more 
than half of the global orders for airline passenger jet engines. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's earnings increased 31 percent to $265 million, up from  
$202 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At GE Capital Services, GE's financial services arms, earnings  
rose 17 percent to $1.26 billion, up from $1.08 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	At Industrial Products and Systems, earnings increased 25  
percent to $491 million, up from $393 million. The Technical 
Products and Services division's earnings rose 27 percent to $316 
million from $249 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At GE Appliances, earnings fell 28 percent to $137 million, down  
from $189 million. 
</P>
<P>
	And in GE's plastics segment, earnings fell 5 percent to $390  
million from $412 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of the year, earnings rose 15 percent  
to $7.62 billion, or $2.29 a share, up from $6.63 billion, or $1.99 
a share, in the same period in 1998. Revenues grew 10 percent to 
$78.77 billion, up from $71.83 billion a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Mammograms Rise in Women Over 40 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The percentage of women over 40 who said they'd  
had mammograms increased nearly 33 percent between 1989 and 1997, 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 survey found that 84.8 percent of women reported having  
had a mammogram, up from 63.9 percent in 1989. During the same 
period, the CDC said, women who reported receiving a mammogram 
within the previous two years increased from 54.3 percent to 71.3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association this year joined the American  
Cancer Society in recommending that women in their 40s get annual 
screenings instead of at two-year intervals. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Blackman, a CDC medical epidemiologist, said the findings  
indicate that health officials need to do more to encourage women 
to come back for repeat screenings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-state survey questioned 20,511 women in 1989 and 38,027  
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 175,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer  
this year, and 43,300 will die, the CDC said. Early detection 
allows for earlier treatment that can increase the chances of 
survival.

<HEADLINE> Trump Praises Possible Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump considers himself a ``great  
builder and conceptualizer'' and says those qualities would serve 
the country well if he were elected president as a Reform Party 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what needs to get done and I'm able to get it done,''  
the wealthy real estate developer said in a ``Dateline NBC'' 
interview Wednesday. ``I'm a quick study.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, a registered Republican who says he identifies with  
former President Reagan, said the country ``is essentially in huge 
debt'' -- which he knows a thing or two about. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who made a better showing with large debt than I did?'' asked  
Trump, who rebounded from the brink of bankruptcy in the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he's socially liberal and fiscally conservative,  
supports major tax cuts, abortion rights and health care for all, 
but opposes gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	He also handicapped his prospective competition, saying Texas  
Gov. George W. Bush was ``really untested,'' that Vice President Al 
Gore ``has more ability than is being shown,'' and that Bill 
Bradley quit the Senate in 1996 because he was ``a loser in New 
Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If elected, his first act would be to ``give the country  
spirit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing we have going and not insignificant ... is a  
good economy,'' Trump said. ``If that economy goes, we're going to 
be a very, very depressed place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump said he'll announce a decision in a few months.  
</P>
<P>
	``The National Enquirer ... did a poll and said I'd win the  
election,'' Trump said in an interview on NBC's ``Today.'' Reminded 
that in a Newsweek poll, 2 percent said they were likely to vote 
for Trump and 73 percent said their were unlikely, he replied: ``If 
I had 2 percent how come they put me on their cover?''

<HEADLINE> Yachtsmen Plan Trans-Atlantic Sail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's a mark that's stood for almost a decade:  
Crossing the Atlantic Ocean by catamaran in six days, 13 hours and 
three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, yachtsman Steve Fossett and his crew, including Virgin  
Airlines chief executive Richard Branson, are aiming to break the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew of the 105-foot catamaran PlayStation -- considered the  
world's fastest sailboat -- pulled into New York City waters on 
Thursday to begin a two-week preparation period before starting the 
attempt to break the trans-Atlantic crossing record. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great ambition of mine to go after the  
trans-Atlantic record, and now we have a great chance at it,'' 
Fossett said. 
</P>
<P>
	The record was set by Serge Madec of France in 1990, on board  
the Jet Services V. 
</P>
<P>
	Fossett, who already holds other sailing records and failed in  
numerous attempts to sail around the world in a hot-air balloon, 
plans to leave around Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip from Ambrose Light outside New York Harbor to Cornwall  
in England is a distance of 2,888 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives me great satisfaction to have done these things,''  
Fossett said when asked why setting records was so important. ``It 
demonstrates that my team and me can sail well enough and sail 
faster than anyone's ever sailed before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He invited Branson as a favor after Branson had invited him  
along on a ballooning attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	Branson said he relished challenges like sailing and ballooning  
as ways of taking some time away from his business enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being out on the sea without a phone, without a fax machine,  
just taking on the elements with a group of people one admires 
enormously, it's very exhilarating and a complete change,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat was launched nine months ago in Auckland, New Zealand,  
and set a 24-hour travel record with a mark of 580.23 nautical 
miles in a day in March 1999.

<HEADLINE> Hubble Repair Bumped to December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA has bumped space shuttle  
Discovery's flight to the Hubble Space Telescope to December so 
workers can complete wiring and valve repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuttle managers said Thursday they're targeting a Dec. 2 launch  
date for Discovery. The telescope-repair mission had been scheduled 
for mid-October, then mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	A radar-mapping mission by Endeavour, meanwhile, has been moved  
to January. And the next flight to the international space station, 
by Atlantis, is now set for February. 
</P>
<P>
	The missions were delayed following Columbia's marred launch in  
July. A short circuit five seconds into the flight knocked out 
computers for two of the three main engines; defective wiring was 
to blame. Wiring defects subsequently were found in the other 
shuttles. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA also is contending with bad valves aboard Discovery. Two  
leaking valves in the right orbital maneuvering system must be 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	With only two shuttle launches so far in 1999, and only one more  
scheduled, this will be the leanest year for NASA since shuttles 
resumed flying in 1988 following the Challenger disaster.

<HEADLINE> Alabama Probes Dismissed Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Gov. Don Siegelman has been  
criss-crossing the state, trying to persuade voters to approve his 
proposed lottery at the polls next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of answering questions about lottery tickets,  
Siegelman has had to deal with queries on another ticket matter -- 
allegations of traffic-ticket fixing involving members of his 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing scandal threatens to dent support for Siegelman's  
plan for a lottery to benefit education. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Cooper, chairman of Citizens Against Legalized Lottery, said  
the scandal shows ``how the lottery corporation will be run. ... I 
don't trust Montgomery to be in the gambling business, and now they 
have proven me correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman acknowledged that lottery opponents would seize on the  
scandal, but added: ``I believe the people of Alabama are smarter 
than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press first reported last week that state records  
revealed how Alabama drivers often got tickets dismissed after 
seeking the help of lawmakers, court officials and the state 
trooper director's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost immediately, Siegelman forced the director of Alabama's  
state troopers, Mike Sullivan, to resign and suspended three top 
aides in the governor's office who had sought help with tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal has since widened to the University of Alabama  
football team. Sullivan has been the personal security escort for 
the Alabama head coach at games for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	One player, Shamari Buchanan, was benched during last week's  
game while school officials investigated a ticket that Sullivan 
ordered dropped for him. An assistant coach and an athletic 
department official have acknowledged using their influence to get 
tickets dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan has refused to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Then this week, the AP discovered that a ticket for going 78 mph  
in a 55 mph zone was given to the governor's chief of staff, Paul 
Hamrick, and was dismissed without ever making it to a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegelman, the former lieutenant governor who defeated Gov. Fob  
James last fall, said he has never had a ticket fixed and has never 
helped anyone have one fixed. Siegelman said he was first made 
aware of the ticket-fixing Thursday night by the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor has given all constitutional officers and state  
agencies 30 days to investigate any cases in their offices of 
interfering with traffic tickets, which is a misdemeanor. He has 
also asked court officials and legislative leaders to conduct 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket-fixing clearly pre-dates Siegelman's administration --  
doing favors has long been part of the political culture in 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing you can do about it,'' said Fred Posey, the  
court clerk in Autauga County for more than 50 years who dropped 
the $128 speeding charge against Hamrick. ``That's the system and 
that's the way it has always been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the timing has been bad for the governor, who campaigned on  
the lottery issue last year and has seen his proposal sail through 
the Legislature. All that's left is a referendum on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show a slight majority of Alabama voters favor the  
lottery, which the governor promises will pay for college 
scholarships, a pre-kindergarten program and school computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the ticket-fixing story broke, opponents had been  
running ads predicting a lottery would be corrupted by political 
favoritism and influence-peddling. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP reviewed copies of traffic tickets written by troopers  
over two years and interviewed drivers who said their fines 
disappeared after they asked for help. Some of the documents, 
including correspondence with people whose fines were dropped, were 
signed with Sullivan's secretary's initials. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, as Posey said, the ``media has gone crazy'' asking  
officials about favors with traffic tickets. State Sen. Jim Preuitt 
refused to tell the Montgomery Advertiser if he had ever fixed a 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media is going too far with this,'' Preuitt said. ``That's  
like asking if you've ever stepped out on your wife.''

<HEADLINE> Penguins 7, Devils 5 / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *by TOM CANAVAN    	
</P>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Jaromir Jagr had the go-ahead goal  
and two assists and the Pittsburgh Penguins gave Mario Lemieux his 
first win as an owner, defeating New Jersey 7-5 on Thursday night 
in a game that featured the ejection of Devils goaltender Martin 
Brodeur. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was the first between th teams since an injured Jagr  
rallied the bankruptcy-ridden Penguins to a first-round playoff 
victory over the Devils in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	While this game didn't have playoff intensity, it was nasty.  
Brodeur made the nastiest play, whacking the pesky Matthew Barnaby 
low on the back of his legs at 14:32 of the first period with the 
Penguins leading 3-1 on three goals by Aleksey Morozov, his first 
career hat trick. 
</P>
<P>
	Referee Paul Stewart gave the usually mild-mannered Brodeur a  
match penalty for intent to injure. It does not carry an automatic 
suspension but Colin Campbell will holding a hearing to review the 
action. Barnaby had to be helped off the ice but returned for the 
final two periods. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins also played without their No. 1 goaltender. Tom  
Barrasso left early in the first period and was replaced by Peter 
Skudra, who made 18 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrasso had a knee injury coming into the game, but it was  
never announced why he left. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiri Slegr, Robert Lang and Alexei Kovalev also scored for  
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Bombardir, Bobby Holik, Jason Arnott, Brian Rolston and  
Sergei Brylin scored for New Jersey in its home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	After Arnott and Rolston tied the game with second-period goals  
1:09 apart with New Jersey playing with a two-man advantage, Jagr 
took over, much like he did in the playoffs after returning from a 
groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Skating on a 2-on-3 break late in the second period, Jagr pulled  
up in the circle, used Devils defenseman Lyle Odelein as a screen 
and snapped a shot into the upper right corner of the net past a 
helpless Chris Terreri, who made 21 saves in relief of Brodeur. 
</P>
<P>
	Lang stretched the lead to 6-4 with a power-play goal just 1:47  
later, putting the rebound of Rob Brown's shot that Jagr set up. 
</P>
<P>
	Brylin scored on a power play with just under six minutes to  
play to get the Devils within a goal, but Kovalev scored on a 
giveaway in the final minute to clinch the game. 
</P>
<P>
	After Bombardir gave the Devils the lead at 36 seconds, Morozov  
scored three times over the next 7:12, twice taking advantage when 
New Jersey defenders had trouble controlling pucks at their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	After Holik and Slegr exchanged goals early in the second  
period, the Devils tied the game at 4-4 as Arnott and Rolston 
scored on two-man advantages in a 69-second span. The Penguins 
picked up four minor penalties in a span of 2:01.

<HEADLINE> US Teritories Dispute Y2K Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A U.S. report singling out Puerto  
Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for not dealing with the Year 2000 
computer bug is too pessimistic, officials from both territories 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are at the average level,'' insisted Sen. Kenneth  
McClintock, who has led a two-year effort to prepare government 
computers in Puerto Rico. ``About half of the states are doing 
better than us and half are doing worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office reported Wednesday that Puerto  
Rico runs a ``high risk'' of errors in its Medicaid-backed health 
care system on Jan. 1, 2000. More than 1.6 million people on this 
island of 3.8 million people receive free medical care from the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nearby U.S. Virgin Islands, the GAO said computers  
running Medicaid, food assistance and child support programs were 
at high risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 bug is a glitch that causes older computers to  
mistake 2000 for 1900 because they use only ``00'' to designate the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in both U.S. territories said that in many cases, they  
started ``de-bugging'' their computers late because of budget 
constraints. But they believe they can catch up within a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have full confidence that the system will carry us through  
January,'' said Priscilla Berry-Quetel, director of Medicaid funds 
in the Virgin Islands Department of Health. ``If the system doesn't 
work, we will revert to a manual system, which we have done after 
hurricanes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Work on the Virgin Islands' food stamp program started late, in  
October 1998, because of contract problems, but also should be 
finished by November, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico's $1.25 billion health program finished rewriting  
its computer codes in July and began a final round of tests last 
week, said Orlando Colon, Y2K Officer for the Health Insurance 
Administration. The agency's contractor, Computer Aid Inc., should 
have the computers ready by November, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Still Not at Knicks Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Memo to Latrell Sprewell: Pick up the  
phone and call the office. They're worried about you. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was still a no-show this afternoon on Day 4 of the New  
York Knicks' training camp. On Wednesday he flew from California to 
Milwaukee but failed to call the team. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent had told general manager Scott Layden that Sprewell  
would arrive by this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think anybody wants to be informed. It's a basic thing,''  
coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``But it's not a distraction. This, too, 
will pass. We'll be on to another controversy in another few 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks gave Sprewell permission to miss the start of camp  
because of a civil trial in Martinez, Calif., stemming from a 
traffic accident that Sprewell admittedly caused. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Sprewell said he'd join the Knicks after closing  
arguments, which were Monday. Then he said he wanted to wait for a 
verdict, which came Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Next came the news that he had flown home to Milwaukee and still  
wasn't giving the Knicks a firm arrival time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gotten different information from the different  
attorneys, so that part has been frustrating,'' Layden said. 
``That's one of the reasons I would like to get him here and talk 
to him face to face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell could be fined $2,500 for his first two missed  
practices, and $5,000 for any missed practices thereafter. Layden 
would not comment on whether the Knicks would fine Sprewell, saying 
he wanted to speak to the player first. 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates made light of the matter, with Larry Johnson  
pointing out that Sprewell is among the fittest athletes in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shape-wise, Spree usually keeps himself in pretty good  
condition,'' Johnson said. ``He could show up to days late and be 
in better condition than me and some the guys already here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy also tried to shrug it off.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to sit here and sell the notion that because he  
missed my first two practices he's doomed to fail this year,'' Van 
Gundy said. ``But at the same time, everyone has a responsibility 
to their teammates, coaches and team to work together. You can't 
have people missing practice, but the only reason there's any 
indecisiveness is because I haven't spoken to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other Knicks went through another set of two-a-day  
practices, and the team brought in referees from the CBA to give 
them a taste of how tightly games will be called this season under 
the NBA's crackdown on rough play. 
</P>
<P>
	Scrimmages that were supposed to last 8 minutes took 20, and Van  
Gundy said there wasn't a single set of back-to-back possessions 
that wasn't blown dead by a whistle. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Ewing, recovering from a ruptured Achilles' tendon,  
worked out on a treadmill while sitting out drills and scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you combined Patrick's yesterday and today, he'd (have  
walked) halfway back to New York,'' Van Gundy said.

<HEADLINE> Snoozing Mets Fans Miss Highlights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Students, teachers and even New York Yankees  
were exhausted after watching -- or snoring through -- Game 1 of the 
Mets-Arizona series that concluded at 2:05 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	And that wasn't even as bad as Game 2, which ended 20 minutes  
later this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball's decision to televise as many games as  
possible meant that New Yorkers were up well past their bedtime to 
catch the first two games of the Mets series at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so tired, I couldn't hold my eyes open,'' Yankees  
pitcher Andy Pettitte said Wednesday. ``As soon as he (Edgardo 
Alfonzo) hit the home run, I turned the TV off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte got home just in time for the ninth inning Wednesday  
night after the Yankees-Rangers game ended at 11:49 p.m. EDT. The 
two games overlapped for 38 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was as fortunate as Pettitte to last until the  
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made it until the fifth inning and then nature took over,  
but I missed the ninth inning,'' said 17-year-old Mets fan Jeffrey 
Sable, a senior at Forest Hills High School in Queens. ``I just 
fell asleep and I couldn't help it. Today, I was taking a test and 
my eyes were closing. I think I did pretty bad because I couldn't 
stay awake. It's just not fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The final out was recorded 2 hours, 53 minutes after it began.  
Many viewers fell asleep well before New York's Alfonzo provided 
the ninth inning dramatics with a grand slam to give the Mets an 
8-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad. It's wrong. Awful,'' said ESPN's Chris Berman, who  
worked the first two games of the Mets' NL playoff series at 
Arizona. ``Kids deserve a chance to see the teams. I'm disappointed 
as a fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely a detriment for kids,'' said Grover Cleveland  
High School assistant principal Ira Pernick. ``It hurts their 
studies. But there was no drop in attendance here and the students 
seemed to be alert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diamondbacks managing general partner Jerry Colangelo said major  
league baseball asked him which of the three starting times he 
favored. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have preferred our usual time (6:30 p.m. local time),  
but that wasn't one of the choices. It was 1, 4 or 8. I said 8 
because of our workers and the parking downtown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 2,500 workers at Bank One Ballpark also have day  
jobs or go to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it wasn't my call,'' he said. ``It was the networks'  
decision. They just asked for my preference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, it was baseball's decision and had nothing to do with  
the networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We try to show all four games whenever possible,'' major  
league baseball spokesman Rich Levin said. ``The fact that Arizona 
is a western team doesn't leave us with many options. We'd rather 
it not be this way, but we try to get all the games on and this is 
what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN would have preferred a starting time in which the entire  
country would be able to watch. However, it wasn't the first time 
the cable network televised a late, late game on the East coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 3 of the NL playoff series between Houston and San Diego  
last year was televised at 11 p.m. EDT and posted a 3.0 rating, not 
far off from the 3.3 playoff average at ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets-Diamondbacks game had a 2.7 rating. Combined with the  
3.7 for an afternoon playoff between Atlanta and Houston, it gave 
ESPN a 3.2 average for its first-day coverage, up 15 percent from 
the network's 2.8 for the first two games last year.

<HEADLINE> 'Mad Max' Brings His Act To Seattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Gary Payton has been after the Seattle  
SuperSonics for years to sign his good friend, Vernon Maxwell. 
Well, ``Mad Max'' is finally here. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics -- and Maxwell himself -- say this is a more mature  
Maxwell than the player who's had problems with money, marijuana 
and fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't done anything the last six, seven years,'' Maxwell  
said after the Sonics' training camp practice Thursday. ``I feel 
like I've matured and the past is the past. I just look forward to 
the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell, 34, has kept himself in tremendous shape in his 11  
seasons in the NBA. He's also kept himself in the news. 
</P>
<P>
	It should be an interesting season in Seattle, where Maxwell is  
playing for his seventh NBA franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics signed Maxwell to a three-year contract after falling  
short in their bid to get Mitch Richmond. Maxwell probably won't 
start, but he's likely to get a lot of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``A great, pleasant surprise for us have been his leadership  
qualities,'' said team president and general manager Wally Walker, 
who brought Maxwell to the Sonics at the request of Payton. ``The 
guys respect him and he really goes out of the way to encourage the 
younger players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said coach Paul Westphal: ``From what I've seen so far, it's as  
easy as it gets. He's a veteran, he's a very encouraging teammate, 
he knows the game and he plays very hard. You don't have to tell 
Vernon much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hot-and-cold shooting guard has been known as ``Mad Max''  
for his behavior both on and off the court. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1998, Maxwell filed for bankruptcy protection in  
federal court in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	His bankruptcy petition indicated his affinity for fancy cars  
had left him strapped. His two biggest creditors were the lenders 
who financed a Ferrari and an auto leasing company in Philadelphia, 
where he played in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in 1998, Maxwell served a 90-day jail sentence for a 1995  
marijuana conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1995, he rushed into the stands in Portland and  
punched a fan, for which he was suspended 10 games and fined 
$20,000. No evidence was found to back Maxwell's claim that the 
35-year-old man used racial slurs and taunted his family. Maxwell 
subsequently settled out of court with the fan. 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell arrives in Seattle with 10,198 points in 765 career  
games, including 51 in a game for the Houston Rockets against 
Cleveland in January 1991. In Sacramento last season, he helped the 
Kings make the playoffs, averaging 10.7 points in 46 games. In the 
Kings' first-round playoff loss to Utah, Maxwell scored 22 points 
in one game. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seattle, Payton hopes Maxwell can help him get back to the  
playoffs. The Sonics failed to get there in the lockout-abbreviated 
1998-99 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed somebody in the backcourt who is going to do the same  
things I do,'' Payton said. ``We're going to get in people's faces. 
We're not going to back down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payton and Maxwell both play with a lot of emotion. They've been  
friends since Payton came into the league in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always wanted to play with a guy with the same kind of  
temperament as me,'' Maxwell said. ``I'm looking forward to it. I 
know him real well and he knows me real well. We've always hung out 
in the summertime together. We're a lot like brothers. I think in a 
lot of aspects in life we're alike, except the money. He makes a 
lot more money than I do.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Challenges on Soft Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain is looking to his Republican  
presidential rivals for help in winning Senate passage of his 
legislation to ban unlimited ``soft money'' donations to the 
political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is scheduled to take up the issue next week.  
</P>
<P>
	McCain said in a speech Wednesday that he did not know whether  
he had the 60 votes that would be needed to end debate and bring 
the measure to a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	He has sent letters to most of his competitors asking for their  
support, including a special appeal for help to the GOP 
front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``If even half of the members of Congress who endorsed your  
candidacy were to honor your request, (the soft money ban) would 
pass with votes to spare,'' the Arizona senator wrote to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The response from the Bush camp was cool.  
</P>
<P>
	``Like thousands of other Americans who write to us, we're glad  
he recognizes Governor Bush's leadership and ability to lead,'' 
Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said, declining to elaborate on 
whether Bush would support McCain's bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush believes individuals should be able to make unlimited  
donations to political parties but corporations and unions should 
not, ``because shareholders and union members don't have any say in 
how that money is spent,'' Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft money ban offered by McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold,  
D-Wis., is a stripped-down version of campaign finance legislation 
killed in the Senate last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft money originally was used by political parties for  
party-building and get-out-the-vote efforts but is increasingly 
used for ``issue advertising'' designed to influence the outcome of 
an election. McCain says soft money has become a way for 
corporations and unions to get around bans on direct donations to 
candidates and for individuals to circumvent the $1,000 
contribution cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Warming up for next week's debate, McCain wrote to five GOP  
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need all the help we can get,'' he told the Committee for  
Economic Development, a business group that supports the bill. ``If 
they say they are for campaign finance reform, which they have 
stated publicly, I would hope that they would weigh in on the 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not send letters to Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who  
opposes the plan, and Patrick Buchanan, who McCain said has 
``already left the Republican Party'' by questioning U.S. 
involvement in World War II.

<HEADLINE> Bush Swings for New Jersey GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate  
George W. Bush joked that his reception at a local ballpark was ``a 
little warmer'' than one the Texas Rangers received in their 8-0 
lashing by the New York Yankees the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	About 750 New Jersey Republicans greeted Bush, a former managing  
partner of the Rangers and the GOP front-runner, at a 
$1,250-a-plate fund-raiser under a tent on the infield at Somerset 
Ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP officials expected to raise $800,000.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush praised state Assembly Republicans, pitched his credo of  
``compassionate conservatism'' and attempted to earn early points 
in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``All politics starts at the grass roots, as far as I'm  
concerned,'' he told the crowd. ``And New Jersey is an incredibly 
important state in the year 2000. I'm coming here to earn the 
support and respect of people all over your state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the governor of Texas, said New Jersey exemplifies his  
motto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe I'm looking at compassionate people who are  
conservative thinkers and I know your state is a better place for 
that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush cited Gov. Christie Whitman's effort to improve education  
standards and Republican efforts to reform welfare and cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman's withdrawal as a candidate for U.S. Senate next year  
immediately renewed speculation about her prospects as a possible 
vice presidential pick. Bush said it was ``far too early'' to talk 
about that, noting that he has not yet won his party's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman has yet to endorse a candidate.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Bush greeted well-wishers as he strolled  
around a New York City Italian food market and ate a 
pizza-and-pasta lunch with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George 
Pataki during a three-borough tour of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the market, Bush sampled food, chatted with vendors and  
called out ``Mucho gusto concerte!'' -- Spanish for ``nice to meet 
you'' -- to Marcia Hernandez, a Dominican immigrant picking up 
groceries to bring to a nearby senior center where she works. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yo tambien!'' (``Me too!'') she called back.  
</P>
<P>
	Pataki and Giuliani have a rocky personal relationship, but they  
put aside their differences to accompany Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Republican Party is unified,'' Bush said, standing with  
the pair during an earlier visit to a Queens job placement center 
for welfare recipients. ``Standing behind me are the pillars of the 
Republican Party in New York, people who put their minds to 
winning.''

<HEADLINE> UPS Ending Some Gun Deliveries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service said today it will stop  
delivering handguns through its regular service, saying it was 
taking the step to help prevent thefts of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Monday, Atlanta-based UPS -- which handles the vast  
majority of firearms shipments -- will ship handguns only through 
its Next Day Air service, which costs three to four times as much 
as ground service. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has become more than ever a tremendous issue of concern  
to our society,'' UPS spokesman Norman Black said. ``Society is 
concerned about these weapons falling into the wrong hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UPS' Next Day Air service is a separate, more controlled system  
where packages are handled by fewer people and stay in the system 
for only one night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Chambers, executive director of the Sporting Arms and  
Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute, said overnight delivery costs 
about $25 more per gun, or about four times as much as ground 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what we're trying to come to grips with. We're looking  
for alternative methods,'' Chambers told The Morning Call in 
Allentown, Pa., which reported the new UPS policy in a story 
published today. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will continue to ship long guns, rifles and shotguns  
by ground. Those guns are not as attractive to thieves as handguns, 
said another UPS spokesman, Robert Godlewski. 
</P>
<P>
	Godlewski acknowledged that shipping by air will be more  
expensive for gun manufacturers and dealers. But he said, ``We're 
going to err on the side of safety. If that costs more money, then 
that's the way it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each business day, Atlanta-based UPS delivers 12 million  
packages via its trademark brown trucks and brown-uniformed 
employees. UPS handles up to 75 percent of guns sent from 
manufacturers to distributors and nearly all firearms shipped from 
distributors to dealers, Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Jannuzzo, vice president of Glock Inc., said the gun  
manufacturer will continue to ship with UPS, but the increase in 
cost will be passed on to dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too substantial to absorb,'' said Jannuzzo, who works at  
Glock's U.S. headquarters in Smyrna, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, federal investigators said 130 Glock guns being shipped  
via UPS were stolen from a series of shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it will cut out the theft problems, it will be a good  
thing,'' Jannuzzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black couldn't say how many guns have been stolen from the UPS  
ground system in the past. He knew of no cases where a gun stolen 
from UPS had been used in a crime and a lawsuit resulted. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``our attitude is that even one such instance is one too  
many, and we just had to find some way to improve the security 
around these shipments,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley To Offer $5.5B Farm Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill  
Bradley is putting together a $5.5 billion farm package designed to 
restore the rural ``safety net'' by calling for cash payments to 
farmers when commodity prices sag. 
</P>
<P>
	The package, which calls for $1.32 billion in new spending, also  
proposes sharply increasing the number of environmentally fragile 
acres taken out of production, increases in farm research programs 
and a ``rigorous review'' of concentration of ownership in the meat 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's staff huddled with Iowa State University economist  
Neil Harl late into the evening Wednesday, crafting the proposal, 
which Bradley will unveil Friday during a speech at a farm near Des 
Moines. Details were made available Thursday to The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, already  
has issued his own package of farm proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when commodity prices have fallen to historic lows and  
most traditional subsidy payments are being phased out, Bradley 
calls for an ``income stabilization program'' that would provide 
temporary payments to farmers when prices fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The payments would also be capped to ensure that the bulk of  
the benefits go to small, independent producers and their 
families,'' said background documents describing the package. It 
also would require that farmers actually work the land, avoiding 
big payments to absentee landlords. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's package has an overall pricetag of $5.5 billion, but  
he said all but $1.32 billion would come from redirecting other 
farm spending. He would use the budget surplus to fund the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed expanding the Conservation Reserve Program so that  
farmers take 42 million acres of environmentally sensitive land out 
of production, at a cost of $580 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet another piece of his proposal would implement ``conservation  
security contracts'' which call for payments to farmers to reward 
them for using environmentally friendly farming techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Bradley would spend $1.25 billion on conservation  
programs. That appeals to farmers because of extra farm spending, 
and environmentalists worried about increasing chemical use and 
soil erosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley proposed spending $7 million as part of his effort to  
shift oversight of the livestock industry from the Agriculture 
Department to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wants meatpackers to be forced to disclose the prices  
they pay for animals. Some critics argue that meatpackers cut 
special deals with giant producers to pay them better prices than 
smaller, family farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The package calls for spending $60 million on farm research and  
to put in place new rural economic development programs ``that help 
farmers develop their communities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley does not mention ethanol in his farm package, and he's  
had difficulties with that issue in the past. Ethanol is very 
popular in Iowa because it's distilled from corn and blended with 
gasoline that backers say is more environmentally friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley opposed tax breaks for ethanol as a senator, but says  
he's changed his mind and now backs the breaks.

<HEADLINE> Violence Turns Off Stars' Modano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Dallas Stars center Mike Modano, who strained neck  
ligaments after being sent head first into the boards last week, 
said the NHL is growing increasingly violent and if it doesn't 
change, he'll retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano, who also broke his nose and had a mild concussion after  
Anaheim defenseman Ruslan Salei cross-checked him from behind in 
Saturday's game, admits he's nervous about playing again and taking 
another hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a scary incident,'' said Modano, who was knocked  
unconscious and remembers waking to find doctors and trainers 
hovering over and yelling at him to try to move his arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see it on replay ... and to see how close (the hit)  
could've been to hampering me or from keeping me from playing ever 
again ... it makes you wonder whether it's worth it to play in this 
game and in sports in general,'' said Modano, the bridge of his 
nose bruised and scraped. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with reporters after a light workout, the team's best  
offensive player said he still feels like he's ``in a bit of a 
fog.'' Recent neurological tests showed he was recovering well, but 
Modano said he's not sure when he'll play again. 
</P>
<P>
	If the career-ending or life-threatening violence doesn't stop,  
Modano said he will get off the ice for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``If things continue, I'm not going to play anymore,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've only got four or five years more (to play), then I'm  
done,'' Modano said. ``I still have the rest of my life to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Clean hard-hitting physical play'' will always be an  
acceptable part of hockey, he said. But in the past two or three 
years, incidents of intentional violence have increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I started, you didn't hear much about concussions. Now  
it's evolved into an anything-to-win attitude, even if that means 
taking out a team's top players,'' said Modano, who led the Stanley 
Cup champions in regular-season scoring with 81 points and playoff 
scoring with 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Colin Campbell, NHL's vice president of hockey operations,  
warned last year that the league would crack down on deliberate 
attempts to injure -- particularly hits to the head. The league was 
concerned about the growing number of concussions that sidelined 
such headliners as Paul Kariya, Eric Lindros and Pat LaFontaine in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week Campbell said, ``Our stance against hits to  
the head remains very much in place. Such behavior will not be 
tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Modano and teammate Darryl Sydor, who fractured his left  
eye socket in a fight with Anaheim's Jim McKenzie, felt the NHL 
missed an opportunity to slap longer suspensions on the Mighty 
Ducks players and send a message that gratuitous violence won't be 
tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do we have to wait for someone to be paralyzed or killed  
before the league, teams and players come together and act?'' said 
Modano, whose doctors told him he was lucky he could walk, much 
less play again. 
</P>
<P>
	The league suspended Salei for 10 games for the hit and will  
forfeit $109,756 in salary. McKenzie was suspended for four games 
and will lose close to $13,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydor, who joined Modano on the ice at Dr. Pepper StarCenter,  
said he gets headaches and his vision is occasionally blurry but 
feels lucky he isn't blind in his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was talking to my wife about it and I wonder if it's all  
worth it,'' the defenseman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano urged the Stars not to seek revenge during Friday's  
contest against Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am calling on my teammates to set an example for all  
players. I am looking forward to getting back on the ice and 
playing as soon as possible, but not to getting even,'' Modano said 
in a statement. ``More importantly, I don't want anyone getting 
even on my behalf.''

<HEADLINE> Differences Between HMO Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Differences between managed care bills approved by the House  
Thursday and the Senate in July: 
</P>
<P>
                           *WHO IS COVERED   	
</P>
<P>
	House: Covers all Americans with private health insurance.  
</P>
<P>
	Senate: Many provisions only apply to 48 million Americans who  
are in plans that are regulated only by federal law. This includes 
greater access to emergency rooms, specialists, medications and the 
right to choose a health plan that allows them to use doctors who 
are outside a defined network. 
</P>
<P>
                            *RIGHT TO SUE   	
</P>
<P>
	House: Lifts federal ban on lawsuits for Americans in health  
plans that fall under federal regulation. Injured patients could 
sue in state or federal courts for unlimited damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate: No new rights to sue.  
</P>
<P>
                  *OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS   	
</P>
<P>
	House: Allows women to see them without prior approval but not  
to designate them as primary care doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate: Similar, but only applies to federally regulated plans.  
</P>
<P>
                        *EMERGENCY ROOM CARE   	
</P>
<P>
	House: Requires payment for reasonable emergency room services  
without prior approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate: Similar, but only applies to federally regulated plans.  
</P>
<P>
                          *CLINICAL TRIALS   	
</P>
<P>
	House: Would have required health plans to pay routine health  
care costs associated with clinical trials. Excludes payments for 
trials funded by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate: Includes only cancer patients.  
</P>
<P>
                            *MASTECTOMY   	
</P>
<P>
	House: No provision.  
</P>
<P>
	Senate: Requires health plans pay for overnight hospital stays  
if doctor and patient want it. 
</P>
<P>
                         *CONTINUITY OF CARE   	
</P>
<P>
	House: Allows patients undergoing a course of treatment to stay  
with their doctors during a transition period, even if the doctor 
leaves the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate: Similar, but only applies to patients who are pregnant,  
terminally ill or institutionalized. 
</P>
<P>
                            *TAX CHANGES   	
</P>
<P>
	Both allow people who are self-employed to deduct the cost of  
health insurance and create a new deduction for long-term care. 
Allow more medical savings accounts, which let people set aside 
money, tax-free, to pay for routine care if they buy a 
high-deductible insurance policy in case of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
                             *APPEALS   	
</P>
<P>
	Both require health plans to allow patients to appeal denials to  
experts outside the plan. 
</P>
<P>
                      *INFORMATION DISCLOSURE   	
</P>
<P>
	Both require health insurance companies to disclose details  
about what they cover and how they operate.

<HEADLINE> Bolton Wants Judgment Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Michael Bolton asked a federal appeals  
court to overturn a $5.4 million judgment against him for 
plagiarizing an Isley Brothers song. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer's attorney told the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
on Tuesday that neither his client nor Bolton's writing partner, 
Andy Goldmark, had heard of the Isley Brothers song before the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, a Los Angeles jury decided Bolton had stolen elements  
of the 1966 song ``Love Is a Wonderful Thing'' for his 1991 hit of 
the same name. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded Ron and Marvin Isley 66 percent of all past and  
future royalties from the single and credited the song with 28 
percent of the success of Bolton's album ``Time, Love and 
Tenderness.'' A special master in 1996 set the total amount at $5.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been five or six years of the most difficult  
experience of my entire life,'' Bolton said after Tuesday's 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel is expected to rule within two months.

<HEADLINE> United States 6, Finland 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kristine Lilly scored two goals and Mia  
Hamm had three assists Thursday night, as the United States beat 
Finland 6-0 in the second leg of the U.S. Women's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of Lilly's goals came after the half as the defending World  
Cup champions improved to 2-0 in the three-game tournament. The 
United States, which outshot Finland 27-0 on Thursday, has 
outscored its opponents 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly's blast from inside the 6-yard box on an assist from  
Danielle Fotopolous made it 4-0 in the 54th minute, and she took a 
cross from Brandi Chastain at the top of the penalty area and drove 
it past goalkeeper Satu Kannas for a 5-0 lead in the 63rd minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 36,405 was the largest ever to see a soccer game in  
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm assisted on all three of the United States' first-half  
goals before sitting down at the start of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans scored in the 9th minute, when Tiffeny Milbrett  
put a left-footed shot past Kunnas from the edge of the area. Joy 
Fawcett made it 2-0 in the 14th minute when she took Hamm's pass 
and drove the ball into the top of the net from 10 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Whalen bounced a shot off a defender's leg in a crowded  
penalty area for a 3-0 lead in the 36th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States' final goal, in the 88th minute, was an own  
goal charged to Terhi Uui-Luomalahti. The ball went off her foot as 
she tried to beat Fotopolous to a pass from Shannon McMillan. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early game, Roseli and Raquel scored two goals each to  
lead Brazil to a 4-0 win over South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Roseli, who missed the World Cup with a knee injury as Brazil  
finished third, has four goals and one assist in two U.S. Women's 
Cup games. South Korea has been outscored 9-0 in its two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Roseli gave Brazil a 1-0 lead with a penalty kick in the 39th  
minute and made it 2-0 in the 53rd with a slow roller that went 
through the legs of goalkeeper Ho Jung Jung. Raquel's goals came in 
the 54th and 74th minutes.

<HEADLINE> Japan Weighs $51B To Help Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Finance Ministry wants the government to  
spend an extra $51 billion this fiscal year to maintain the 
nation's economic recovery, published reports said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministry officials made their proposal at a meeting with  
government policy makers. Members of Japan's three-party ruling 
coalition were planning to put forward their own recommendations 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	A ministry spokesman, speaking on customary condition of  
anonymity, said he was unable to confirm the proposal as it was not 
yet official. 
</P>
<P>
	A final proposal goes to Parliament for approval in November.  
Approval is likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposed outlays include $32 billion for public works projects  
and $19 billion to help small and medium-sized companies, the news 
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The money would be spent before Japan's fiscal year ends on  
March 31, 2000. It follows a first extra budget of about $5 billion 
approved in July as a way to create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese economy is just emerging from its worst downturn in  
decades, and the government has begun a massive spending campaign 
to keep the economy moving and get people to consume more. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of the three-way governing coalition said the  
ministry's proposed total is too small. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be more,'' said Shizuka Kamei, the ruling Liberal  
Democratic Party's policy affairs chief. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two coalition members are the Liberal Party and the  
New Komeito.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Falter: Dow Ends Off 51.29 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mostly lower Thursday as investors  
took profits from Wednesday's hefty jump in prices and looked 
nervously ahead to the government's employment report on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 51.29 to 10,537.05.  
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was off 7.76 at 1,317.64, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 
3.49 to 2,860.70. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taking profits is part of the story today after a big runup on  
Wednesday, and the other part is waiting for tomorrow to see what 
September's employment numbers look like,'' said Hugh Johnson, 
chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow climbed 187.75 to 10,588.34 on Wednesday as investors  
temporarily set aside worries about rising interest rates and 
focused on corporate earnings. But with the market's volatility 
during the past month amid nervousness over interest rates, many 
investors decided to take a prudent approach Thursday and collect 
profits before the September employment report from the Labor 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The market will be scrutinizing the report to see if there are  
signs of inflation that could prompt the Federal Reserve to push 
rates higher at its next policy meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if the jobs creation and wage figures contained in the  
report signal that inflation is indeed under control, analysts 
expect a continuation of the price swings Wall Street has seen over 
the past few weeks. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 
1,100 points from an all-time closing high of 11,326.04 on Aug. 25 
before recovering ground in recent sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wachtel, a market analyst for Prudential Securities, said  
upcoming third-quarter earnings reports, which traders have been 
optimistically awaiting, will help some stock sectors, but not the 
overall market. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of the averages, you're not going to get a clear-cut  
bull market going,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the technology-dominated Nasdaq index gave up early  
gains, some high-profile Internet stocks were higher. Among the 
notable performers, Yahoo! soared 14 1/2 to 190 1/4 after the Internet 
search company reported quarterly earnings results late Wednesday 
that were stronger than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Internet stocks have turned a corner,'' Johnson said.  
``But I've said that before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, reflecting more nerves about interest rates,  
were mostly lower, including Chase Manhattan, down 1 3/8 at 74 9/16 3/8 
and Bank of America, down 2 3/16 at 56 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products rose 3 5/8 to 48 3/4 after the drugmaker agreed  
to a $3.75 billion settlement over its once-popular diet pills 
fen-phen. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of about  
7-to-5 on the New York Stock Exchange, where the volume of all 
shares traded totaled 974.87 million shares, down from 1.08 billion 
in Wednesday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.65 to 428.11.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.3 percent,  
Germany's DAX index was up 1.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 
1.6 percent, and France's AC-40 was up 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rejecting Treaty Vote Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration pressed its case  
for a nuclear test-ban treaty today, even as supporters conceded 
there seemed little chance to prevail next week -- or to even 
postpone a showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to lead on this issue,'' Energy Secretary Bill  
Richardson told the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said rejection of the 154-nation Comprehensive Test  
Ban Treaty ``would announce that the United States refuses to lead 
on this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration appeared to be making little headway in  
picking up support for the treaty, now scheduled for a vote in the 
Senate Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though leaders of both parties continued to seek means of  
postponing the issue, a group of conservatives led by Sen. Jesse 
Helms, R-N.C., kept up pressure for proceeding with the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has rejected their demand that Clinton put in  
writing any request to delay a vote on an international nuclear 
test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's disappointing when our political leaders in a  
transparent way put partisanship ahead of what is clearly in our 
national security interest,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservatives also want Clinton to promise -- in writing --  
not to seek to revive the treaty during the 2000 presidential 
election year, a condition the White House has also rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., served notice on  
Senate leaders that he planned to block any effort to postpone a 
vote, whether Clinton seeks it in writing or not. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has made the treaty a top priority ``and  
should live with the consequences,'' Inhofe said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his testimony to the Armed Services Committee, Richardson  
said the government was managing to keep the nation's nuclear 
stockpile safe and reliable -- and that testing is not needed to 
make sure that the weapons will work. 
</P>
<P>
	The stockpile is ``safe, secure and reliable,'' the energy  
secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Democrats acknowledged there seemed to be little way  
to either win ratification of the treaty or persuade Republican 
leaders to postpone the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to kill it, I guess they can do it,'' Sen. Joseph  
Biden of Delaware, senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, told a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	With virtually no Republican support, the treaty appeared headed  
to defeat in the Senate. Its ratification requires 67 votes in the 
GOP-led chamber if all 100 senators vote. 
</P>
<P>
	That would represent a humiliating defeat for the  
administration, which has led an international campaign for the 
treaty -- and which had criticized Helms for bottling up the treaty 
for two years in his Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty would extend the present international ban on nuclear  
tests in the atmosphere to underground testing as well, resulting 
in a total ban on all nuclear explosions, no matter how small. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 154 nations have signed the treaty, although it has been  
ratified by only 48. Of the major nuclear powers, only Britain and 
France have ratified the pact. 
</P>
<P>
	Many prominent Republicans -- including GOP presidential hopeful  
George W. Bush and the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, 
Sen. John Warner of Virginia -- say the treaty is not verifiable and 
would not stop the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran. 
Further, they argue it would harm efforts to maintain the safety 
and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only were Democrats pressing for a delay in the face of a  
probable defeat, but many influential Senate Republicans were also 
suggesting the showdown be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of both parties expressed fear that an outright  
rejection of the treaty would draw international scorn on the 
United States and increase pressure for a resumption of nuclear 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms' objection to a delay is significant, because under Senate  
rules the only way that next week's vote can be called off is 
through unanimous consent of all senators. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ready to vote,'' Helms said, predicting that the treaty  
would be soundly rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats balked at Helms' terms -- particularly on his demand  
not to press for action on the treaty next year -- but Helms 
countered that Democrats ``are trying to dictate the terms of their 
own surrender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans joined Helms in demanding Clinton seek the  
delay in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He must share with the Senate leadership the burden of not  
going forward,'' said Warner. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said he still hoped  
a deal could be brokered with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., to avoid a floor showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that there is a desire on the part of many not to have  
a vote,'' Daschle told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the absence of a deal, both sides were preparing to begin  
the debate Friday.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England Leaves Rate Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The Bank of England decided Thursday against  
changing its official lending rate, currently 5.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, announced following a monthly monetary committee  
meeting, had been anticipated by the markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The British Chambers of Commerce called the bank's decision  
``good news for British business,'' which has been hampered in 
export markets by the relatively strong pound. An additional 
increase in rates would likely cause the pound to strengthen 
further, making British goods costlier than products priced in 
other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank surprised many last month when it raised its base  
lending rate by 0.25 percentage point in an effort to dampen 
inflation. Its base lending rate is what it charges for loans to 
financial institutions and the rate is often used as a benchmark 
for changes in commercial and consumer lending rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry and labor unions warned that another rise could imperil  
thousands of manufacturing jobs.

<HEADLINE> Death Recommended for Child Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- A remorseless drifter who urged jurors to  
give him the death penalty for murdering a 9-year-old boy got his 
wish. 
</P>
<P>
	After five hours of deliberation Wednesday, a San Diego County  
Superior Court jury recommended that Brandon Wilson, 21, receive 
the death penalty for killing Matthew Cecchi last year at beach 
restroom in Oceanside, north of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson smiled slightly as the verdict was read. His  
court-appointed attorney congratulated him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's quite pleased with the verdict,'' attorney Curt Owen  
said. ``It's what he wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying at his penalty hearing against his lawyer's advice  
this week, Wilson told jurors he felt no remorse for the killing 
and would ``do it again in a second if I had the chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Execute me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, who left his hometown of St. Croix Falls, Wis., two  
years ago to travel the West, admitted that he crept up behind 
Matthew while the boy stood at a urinal, slashed his throat and 
stabbed him five times in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how anyone can have no remorse for something of  
that magnitude,'' said Matthew's uncle, Mark Gerhard, who made the 
911 call to police moments after Wilson attacked the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew had traveled to Southern California with his mother and  
younger brother from their home in Oroville, north of Sacramento, 
to attend a family reunion. His aunt had escorted him to the 
restroom and was waiting outside for him when he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury foreman Gene Wagner said Wilson's death wish had no effect  
on his decision to vote in favor of capital punishment. He was 
moved more by Wilson's gleeful re-enactment of the crime in a 
videotaped police interview, which jurors viewed Wednesday before 
announcing their verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was ever a case that deserved the death penalty, this  
one's it,'' said Wagner, a lab scientist from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Wilson ``deeply psychotic,'' Owen said his client  
deliberately sabotaged his efforts to get him life imprisonment 
without possibility of parole rather than the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge John Einhorn will make the final decision  
at a sentencing hearing Nov. 4. He can choose the lesser penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew's father, Lou Cecchi, said in a phone interview from  
Oroville, that he was sure that Wilson would receive the death 
penalty. Neither he nor the boy's mother, Sharon Cecchi, were in 
the courtroom Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just very frustrated with the legal process, that it's  
actually going to take so long to do this guy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Coach Indicted for Theft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINBURG, Texas (AP) -- A grand jury indicted former University  
of Texas-Pan American basketball coach Delray Brooks on Thursday on 
a felony theft charge for alleged misuse of university money. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was fired Aug. 23 because Pan American officials believed  
he deposited a check from Southwest Missouri State for $25,000 into 
his personal account and then made withdrawals from the account. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks has acknowledged that $25,000 was placed in his account,  
but has denied depositing it or telling someone else to do so. 
Brooks has an unpublished phone number and could not be reached for 
comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan American hired him in 1997 to restore the dignity of the  
men's basketball program after the school lost its NCAA 
certification in 1996. The certification was fully restored in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, whose salary was nearly $63,000 last season, had an 8-46  
record in his first two seasons as the Broncs' coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The school also chose not to renew the contracts of two  
assistant coaches, George Morgan and Patrick Harrington, for the 
1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the university hired Bob Hoffman, men's  
basketball coach at Oklahoma Baptist for nine seasons, as the new 
head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, who played at Indiana and Providence, is a former  
assistant coach at Kentucky who helped the Wildcats to three Final 
Four appearances, including the 1996 national championship.

<HEADLINE> Death Spurs Town To Teach Tolerance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- In the year since gay college student  
Matthew Shepard was beaten and left to die on the freezing prairie, 
Laramie has done a lot of thinking about intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	The public schools have changed their conflict-resolution  
classes to focus more on preventing bullying, and in particular the 
harassment of gays. At the University of Wyoming, where Shepard was 
studying political science, education students are learning how to 
teach tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	And in what could be a sign of a growing public acceptance, the  
United Gays and Lesbians of Wyoming group reports that membership 
has increased from 150 to 250 since Shepard was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of our faculty were really appalled, had trouble  
believing it could happen here, and some went into denial,'' said 
Charles Head, superintendent of Laramie schools. ``But they 
recognized that it did happen here and we had to address that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ways Laramie has changed since Oct. 7, 1998, will come into  
sharper focus next week as the alleged ringleader in the attack, 
Aaron McKinney, goes on trial for murder beginning Monday -- which 
also happens to be National Coming Out Day and the beginning of Gay 
Awareness Week. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, 22, could get the death penalty if convicted. His  
alleged accomplice, Russell Henderson, 22, pleaded guilty and is 
serving a life sentence for his role in the murder. He has been 
subpoenaed to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, 21, was lured from a bar -- allegedly because he was gay  
-- driven out of town, robbed of $20, tied to a fence, 
pistol-whipped into a coma and left to die. A bicyclist who found 
him nearly hidden in the sagebrush 18 hours later at first thought 
the slight, 5-foot-2-inch Shepard was a scarecrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Laramie's 26,000 residents felt the town was unfairly  
portrayed as a rural, homophobic outpost. But they were also 
troubled by the fact that McKinney and Henderson were homegrown. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Laramie schools -- motivated also by the massacre at  
Colorado's Columbine High School -- have increased their sensitivity 
toward bullying and the mistreatment of homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of doubt if sexual orientation was being addressed to  
any real degree prior to this tragedy, and I'm reasonably certain 
that it is being addressed as we speak,'' Head said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the university, President Philip Dubois asked trustees to  
make certain that every campus policy statement bans discrimination 
based on sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	The university also plans to raise $1.5 million to endow the  
Matthew Shepard Chair of Civil Liberties. A benefit concert by 
Elton John in June brought in $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack on Shepard was one of six hate crimes in last year in  
Wyoming, which is nicknamed the Equality State. The others -- three 
against blacks, one against a person of Asian descent and one 
against a Jew -- were not fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's still basically underreported because it's  
undernoticed,'' said Wyoming Attorney General Gay Woodhouse. ``I 
don't know that officers still are in the mindset to ask the 
questions about whether or not this could be related to race or 
age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, she held a seminar last spring in which 70 law  
enforcement officers from around the state were shown how to 
recognize signs of hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Shepard attack, President Clinton called for improved  
national hate-crime legislation, and some places have expanded such 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wyoming's Legislature, however, seven hate-crime bills have  
failed. Opponents complained that gays and other protected groups 
would get special treatment and argued that existing laws are 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Shepard's murder led some gays to move away or become  
more fearful, others have felt freer to express their sexuality, 
said Joe Corrigan of Cheyenne, who founded United Gays and Lesbians 
of Wyoming in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely saw a lot of people coming farther out of the  
closet, becoming more active, saying, `I have laid low long enough 
-- I am not going to lay low any longer,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As McKinney goes on trial next week, the gay community will be  
watching closely. Prosecutors and McKinney's lawyers have declined 
to comment on their strategy, citing a gag order. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sense is that this particular murder has really struck a  
chord and deeply touched so many people -- gay and straight alike,'' 
said Cathy Renna, spokeswoman for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance 
Against Defamation. ``It seems like there's a desire just to know 
what happened and out of that, try to make some sense out of such a 
senseless tragedy.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Jackson St. Coach Carson Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Former Jackson State football coach James  
Carson, who was reassigned in May to the athletic department staff, 
died today at his home. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials confirmed the death, but did not have any  
details. A spokesman at Westhaven Funeral Home said funeral 
arrangements are incomplete. There was no immediate word on 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Carson asked to be relieved as coach duties after  
undergoing intestinal surgery a month earlier. Carson had missed 
all of spring practice. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Jackson State officials had declined to discuss his  
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Carson said he needed to have time to gain his strength back.  
</P>
<P>
	Carson's assistant head coach Robert Hughes was put in charge of  
the Tigers for this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Carson had a 54-25-1 career record at Jackson State, including  
Southwestern Athletic Conference championships in 1995-96. His 
teams made three trips to the NCAA Division I-AA playoffs. His best 
season was 1996 when the Tigers finished with a 10-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Carson had been a member of the Tiger coaching staff since 1977.  
</P>
<P>
	He was a 1963 graduate of Jackson State.

<HEADLINE> West Antarctic May Melt Completely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The giant West Antarctic ice sheet has been  
shrinking for thousands of year and its eventual disappearance may 
be inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
	At current melting rates that could mean oceans four inches  
deeper as they lap at low coastal areas a century from now. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the ice sheet is gone in 7,000 years or so, the  
water could be 15 to 20 feet deeper, according to a paper in 
today's edition of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, scientists increasingly have been able to  
document melting and the discovery of icebergs breaking off from 
Antarctica, raising concerns that human-induced climate change 
could be damaging the Antarctic ice sheet. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new paper says the West Antarctic melting began long  
before any human-induced climate change. 
</P>
<P>
	The future of the West Antarctic ice sheet ``may have been  
predetermined when the grounding line retreat was triggered in 
early Holocene time,'' about 10,000 years ago, according to the 
paper by a team of scientists led by Howard Conway of the 
University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The grounding line is the boundary between floating ice and ice  
thick enough to reach the sea floor. Scientists determined the line 
has receded about 800 miles since the last ice age, withdrawing at 
an average of about 400 feet per year for the last 7,600 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like the rate (of melting) that has been going since  
the early Holocene is similar to the rate right now,'' Conway said 
in a telephone interview. ``Collapse appears to be part of an 
ongoing natural cycle, probably caused by rising sea level 
initiated by the melting of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets at 
the end of the last ice age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continued shrinking of the ice sheet, perhaps even complete  
disintegration, ``could well be inevitable,'' the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Conway said the melting annually contributes about 1 millimeter  
-- nearly one-twenty-fifth of an inch -- to sea-level rise. 
</P>
<P>
	While the study indicates global warming is not causing the  
melting, climate change remains a potential problem, Conway said: 
``Global warming could well speed the process. Our study doesn't 
address that problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists have grown concerned that industrial chemicals  
added to the atmosphere are trapping heat somewhat like a 
greenhouse, causing the Earth's temperature to increase. There is 
disagreement, however, about the process and how great a hazard it 
may pose. 
</P>
<P>
	Conway's report is one of three in this issue of Science  
focusing on the Antarctic ice sheet. In the others: 
</P>
<P>
	--Scientists studying satellite-based measurements found a  
complex system of tributaries feeding major rivers of ice on the 
West Antarctic Ice Sheet. This web of tributaries forms a 
transition zone between the sluggish inland ice and the swiftly 
moving ice streams closer to the margins. 
</P>
<P>
	--Other researchers, using the ages of volcanic debris that  
erupted onto the ice sheet, reconstructed the past elevation of the 
West Antarctic Ice Sheet as it began to melt just after the end of 
the last ice age. They concluded the sheet was not the source of a 
massive flow of meltwater into the oceans 10,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	West Antarctica is the section of the continent south of the tip  
of South America. It is covered by an ice sheet that extends about 
360,000 square miles -- close to the combined areas of Texas and 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Conway's team calculated the movement of the grounding line  
using evidence gathered from raised beaches and radar imaging of 
subsurface ice structures. The timing of start of the melting was 
determined by carbon-14 dating of samples found on raised beaches.

<HEADLINE> Pneumonia, Flu Shots Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The flu appears to have killed more Americans  
than usual last winter, and there is also a growing threat from 
bacterial pneumonia -- underscoring doctors' pleas Thursday for 
Americans to get both a flu vaccination this month and a protective 
shot against pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Although both shots are free for Medicare patients -- those most  
at risk -- one-third of such patients don't get regular flu shots, 
and 55 percent have never had a pneumonia vaccine, said a study 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the shots also are vital for certain younger people, said  
Dr. Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic, recalling how he had to 
amputate the hands and legs of a young mother to save her from a 
pneumococcal infection that had spread into her blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``An epidemic of apathy and ignorance'' about the need for  
vaccination ``fuels an epidemic of disease and death,'' Poland 
said. ``This is a public health emergency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Influenza in an average year kills 20,000 Americans. The  
government has not yet finished analyzing last winter's cases, but 
preliminary data suggest many more people died, said Dr. Keiji 
Fukuda of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Of additional concern, influenza has started causing unusual  
outbreaks during the summer, he said. Up to 40,000 people, mostly 
tourists, from 47 countries were sickened by a flu outbreak in 
Alaska in summer 1998, and a similar outbreak occurred this year. 
The CDC also spotted summer outbreaks in Louisiana, Florida, 
Oklahoma and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, flu is always worse in the winter. People need a flu shot  
annually because different influenza virus strains circle the globe 
each year. The optimal time for vaccination is between now and 
mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way to predict'' how bad flu will be this winter,  
Fukuda stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials estimate that one in 10 Americans could suffer  
needlessly if vaccination rates don't improve. 
</P>
<P>
	A flu shot isn't the only protection: Too many patients, and  
even doctors, do not know that a vaccine against pneumococcal 
infection is vital, too, said Surgeon General David Satcher. Unlike 
flu shots, most Americans need just one dose of pneumococcal 
vaccine for lifetime protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Pneumococcal bacteria cause half a million cases of pneumonia  
each year, plus infections in the brain, ear and other organs. Some 
40,000 Americans a year die. 
</P>
<P>
	If those numbers aren't convincing, Poland says another reason  
for vaccination is that pneumococci are rapidly evolving to defy 
antibiotic treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to popular belief, younger people often need the  
vaccine, he said, describing the young mother whose respiratory 
infection spread into her bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman felt flulike symptoms for a few days before  
deteriorating rapidly. ``To our horror, she began developing masses 
of splotchy, jet-black gangrene,'' Poland recalled, saying he had 
to amputate both her hands and legs to save her life. 
</P>
<P>
	She should have been vaccinated, because her spleen had been  
removed several years earlier because of an accident -- and removing 
the spleen weakens the immune system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Flu and pneumococcal vaccination is highly recommended for:  
</P>
<P>
	--Everyone over 64. (One physician group recommends flu vaccine  
starting at age 50, something the CDC is investigating.) 
</P>
<P>
	--Younger people who have chronic heart or lung disorders,  
including asthma, or who have diabetes, kidney disease or a 
weakened immune system. 
</P>
<P>
	--Anyone in close contact with those high-risk patients,  
including family members and health care workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Flu vaccine also is recommended for women who will be in the  
second or third trimester of pregnancy during flu season. 
</P>
<P>
	Even healthy young people without those risks can benefit: One  
recent study found people who got a flu shot lost 43 percent fewer 
days of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Why don't people get vaccinated? The new Medicare study found 57  
percent of the unvaccinated said they didn't know they needed the 
pneumonia shot and 19 percent didn't know they needed the flu shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Too often, doctors don't recommend the vaccinations, public  
health officials complained -- and too often, doctors refuse to give 
flu shots after mid-November. Later shots can still be helpful, 
Fukuda said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't wait for your doctor to recommend vaccination -- be  
proactive and ask for the shots,'' CDC vaccine chief Dr. Walter 
Orenstein advised. ``It's your health and your life.''

<HEADLINE> Australia's Unemployment Rate Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Unemployment in Australia edged up to  
7.4 percent last month, the government announced Thursday, but 
Prime Minister John Howard said job creation is still rising. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said the increase, from 7.2 percent in August,  
probably does not reflect any imminent weakness in the nation's 
economy, which grew by 4.1 percent in the year to the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's unemployment rate stood at 8 percent in September  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given everything else that is happening in the economy, there  
is ample justification for an acceleration in employment growth 
from here,'' analyst Craig James of the Societe Generale bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, who was in Port Moresby on a one-day visit to Papua New  
Guinea, said employment growth of 12,600 was recorded in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``The forward indicators are that jobs are still being generated  
at a very fast clip,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Magnate Gives $60M to Smithsonian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Billionaire aviation magnate Steven Udvar-Hazy  
has a tendency to do things in a big way, but his $60 million gift 
to the Smithsonian Institution -- the museum's largest gift ever -- 
is the biggest. 
</P>
<P>
	Udvar-Hazy, a Hungarian immigrant who heads the world's largest  
aircraft leasing company, says he thought only five minutes before 
donating the money to help build a giant annex for the National Air 
and Space Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex, which will cost $173 million to design and build,  
will house nearly 200 historic airplanes and spacecraft too big to 
display at the museum on the Mall downtown. When it opens in 
suburban Virginia in 2003, visitors will see, for instance, the 
69,000-pound B-29 ``Enola Gay'' that dropped the atomic bomb on 
Hiroshima, the space shuttle Enterprise and the speedy, 
needle-nosed Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, which is more than 107 feet 
long. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how to say it. We're not seeking publicity, but  
we like to do things in a major, big way,'' Udvar-Hazy said 
Thursday about his gift. ``That's just our style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He flashed a mischievous grin under his reddish-brown mustache  
and added: ``It's a Hungarian, barbarian style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Udvar-Hazy, 53, of Beverly Hills, Calif., looked anything but  
barbaric at a ceremony here to recognize his donation. Tanned and 
dressed in a double-breasted dark suit, stark white shirt, red tie 
and gold lapel pin in the shape of an airplane tail, Udvar-Hazy 
squinted into a shower of camera flashes and talked about the 
largest donation he's ever made. 
</P>
<P>
	``It properly mirrors my love for aviation,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Udvar-Hazy's gift virtually fell out of the sky, said  
Smithsonian Secretary I. Michael Heyman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't really know him at all. He was referred to us by  
other folks. He fell in love with the idea after a fast visit,'' 
Heyman said. ``He goes places very rapidly and moves around very 
fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, maybe not on Thursday. Strong headwinds slowed his  
corporate jet flight to Washington, but once he arrived at the Air 
and Space Museum downtown, Udvar-Hazy -- a ``dynamic,'' 
``competitive'' man, according to his wife, Christine -- took center 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Udvar-Hazy got a standing ovation for remarks he made at a  
podium set up in front of the ``Spirit of St. Louis,'' the plane 
Charles Lindbergh flew for the first solo, nonstop flight across 
the Atlantic, and Chuck Yeager's ``Glamorous Glennis,'' a bright 
orange plane that first broke the sound barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke of growing up in Eastern Europe in the shadow of Soviet  
tanks. He talked of communist repression. Then he recalled a sunny 
spring day in 1953 when he went to an airshow just outside 
Budapest, Hungary. Udvar-Hazy, then age 7, was mesmerized by 
sunlight reflecting from the aluminum skin of a plane and vapor 
trails left in the sky by a MiG 15 Soviet fighter jet. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sees airplanes climbing into the air,'' said Udvar-Hazy,  
referring to himself in the third-person. ``There are soldiers and 
guards standing everywhere, but their importance is overshadowed by 
the sudden spirit of freedom, and the feeling that an airplane 
rising into the sky is the hope, the only way to reach into a 
bigger world, a world representing his future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a defining moment. Aviation had captured his imagination.  
He took his first flight the next year.At age 12, he and his family 
escaped Hungary, went to Sweden and later settled in New York City. 
While his friends played baseball, Udvar-Hazy watched takeoffs and 
landings at a nearby airport. While they read comic books, he 
studied airplane schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1968, he earned a bachelor's degree in economics from the  
University of California at Los Angeles and received his private 
pilot's license. Today, the father of four is president of 
International Lease Finance Corp., the leading commercial aircraft 
owner and lessor, which has a portfolio of more than 400 jet 
aircraft valued at more than $18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very passionate about what he does,'' his wife said in an  
interview. ``He's the eternal optimist. If it's aviation, it's 24 
hours a day. If he's having fun, you've got to have fun to the 
final moment.''

<HEADLINE> Poland Nixes Nazi Bill Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- The Polish parliament rejected opposition  
calls Thursday for a national referendum on a bill to compensate 
owners of property seized during Nazi and communist times. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of progress on the measure, which has been delayed  
since the country toppled communist rule in 1989, parliament sent 
it to a special committee. The committee must review the bill and 
return it to the lower chamber for consideration. It will also 
require approval of the Senate and President Aleksander 
Kwasniewski. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft was approved by a vote of 224 to 170.  
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, intended to deal with a painful legacy of  
Poland's past, has been delayed since the country toppled communist 
rule in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous governments argued that democratic and free-market  
reforms were more important priorities than satisfying Poles whose 
property was taken over by the Nazis during World War II or 
nationalized during the communist regime that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	The rightist-dominated Parliament, which began debating the bill  
Wednesday, rejected opposition demands to put it to a national vote 
and sharply limit the amount of compensation to be offered. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition leaders contend the measure will be too costly and  
undermine efforts to complete needed social and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, prepared by the Solidarity-led government of Prime  
Minister Jerzy Buzek, would offer 50 percent compensation to 
people, including Jews, whose property was seized between 1939 and 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
	The government wants to pay compensation in bonds or return half  
of the seized property, if it still exists and has no new private 
owner. The law would not apply to national parks and monuments. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the communist regime seized farms and factories across  
the country, as well as all of central Warsaw, some predict that 
Poland could face as many as 170,000 claims from 2.5 million 
people, totaling $27 billion to $32 billion. That is about the 
equivalent of Poland's annual government budget.

<HEADLINE> Mullin To Come Off Bench This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Age is catching up to Chris  
Mullin. 
</P>
<P>
	A starter most of his 14-year NBA career and a five-time  
All-Star, Mullin will come off the bench this season as the Indiana 
Pacers go with youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullin, 36, a teammate with Bird on the 1992 U.S. Olympic  
``Dream Team,'' was acquired in a trade with Golden State in 1997 
and started at small forward for the Pacers the past two years. 
Coach Larry Bird hasn't decided who will start in Mullin's place, 
although the frontrunner appears to be Jalen Rose, the top scorer 
off the bench last season at 11.1 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Others competing for playing time at small forward include  
Austin Croshere, the Pacers' top draft pick in 1997, and Al 
Harrington, who was drafted out of high school in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the same Chris,'' Bird said. ``He hits his shots and he  
never makes a mistake. He's awesome. But he knows it's time for a 
change, and we're happy he's going along with it because we need to 
look at these younger players, too.''

<HEADLINE> Mormon Fund Raising Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Local politicians are asking the IRS to  
investigate whether the Mormon Church is breaking the law by urging 
members to support a California initiative banning gay marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The push by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  
encouraging Mormons to donate time and money has helped give the 
March 2000 ballot measure a 4-1 cash advantage over its opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Initiative supporters have raised about $840,000 as of June 30,  
though it's unclear how much of that came from Mormon donors. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco supervisors see the church's involvement as an  
abuse of its tax-exempt status. IRS rules prohibit religious 
organizations from engaging in ``substantial'' political activity 
without endangering that status. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have a fair and honest debate,'' Supervisor Mark  
Leno said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that can't happen if large sums of tax-deductible  
dollars are allowed to ``completely overrun the entire ballot 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nonsense,'' said church spokesman Michael Otterson.  
</P>
<P>
	The Mormons aren't the only religious group supporting the  
initiative and tax laws apply equally to them all, Otterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS spokesman Larry Wright said he could not comment on whether  
the agency has agreed to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mormon Church mounted similar campaigns last year in Hawaii  
and Alaska that helped pass measures banning gays and lesbians from 
marrying. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hawaii, the money funded television ads that ``preyed on the  
most insidious emotions,'' said David Smith, who oversaw the failed 
campaign to defeat the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, three Mormon Church presidents asked California church  
leaders in a letter to urge their members ``to do all you can by 
donating your means and time to assure a successful vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later that month, a second letter from a church elder, also on  
church letterhead, explained the donations should not be solicited 
on church grounds or during church meetings or using church 
stationery. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign manager Rob Stutzman said the only church money spent  
was $50 in postage to send the two letters, the same sort of 
expenditures made by Roman Catholic and Protestant churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Rothman, an attorney and certified public accountant at  
Loeb &AMP; Trouber in New York, said the church probably is in the 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mormons could run into trouble, he said, if church leaders  
advocate for or against a particular candidate, use a substantial 
portion of their tax-deductible funds for political activities, or 
ask that donations be made directly to the church to support the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``A ballot issue would absolutely fall into the category of  
lobbying as opposed to political intervention,'' Rothman said.
