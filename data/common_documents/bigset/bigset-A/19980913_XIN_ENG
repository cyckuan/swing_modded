<HEADLINE> Taliban Allow Iran to Collect Bodies of Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban
authorities Saturday said it will allow an Iranian aircraft to
land in northern Afghanistan to collect the bodies of nine Iranian
diplomats killed there last month, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Iranian diplomats and one reporter went missing when
the Taliban took over the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif,
stronghold of the opposition Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who have been denying Iran's allegations of
abducting these diplomats, announced Wednesday that it had
recovered the bodies of nine diplomats. The whereabouts of the
other two diplomats and the reporter remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban had originally said it would hand the bodies over
to the International Red Cross. But after Pakistan interceded,
they agreed to let Iran send its own aircraft to northern
Mazar-e-Sharif to collect the bodies, the reports quoted a Taliban
spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iran has vowed to avenge the death of its diplomats and has
announced a second major military exercise on its border with
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban blamed the death of the Iranian diplomats on
renegade Taliban soldiers, warning Iran against military action
against Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"We have sent thousands of soldiers to Herat (in western
Afghanistan). We are not worried about Iran," the Taliban
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Stresses Coordination on Congo (K) Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PORT LOUIS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African
President Nelson Mandela Saturday reiterated coordination between
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) regarding the Congo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique have
agreed that there should be coordination between the summit in
Pretoria, South Africa, and the meetings held in Victoria Falls
of Zimbabwe on the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), Mandela told a press conference here in the Mauritian
capital Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We should coordinate with Salim Ahmed Salim, the
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity" on the
issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
He believed that progress will be made on how to normalizepthe
situation in the DRC and the implementation of the peace
initiatives during the forthcoming SADC summit scheduled on
Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
Since the armed revolt broke out on August 2 in the east of
the DRC, a couple of meetings of the SADC countries have been
held on how to resolve the crisis in the vast central African
country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who is also chairman of the SADC summit, recalled the
efforts made by the regional grouping, saying that many
initiatives have been taken by the various meetings on the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The summit in Pretoria called by Mandela in late August
decided on an immediate cease-fire, a standstill of all the
troops involved in the conflict, the withdrawal of foreign troops
and the start of negotiations which will eventually lead to the
introduction of a democratic government.
</P>
<P>
During the 12th Non-Aligned Movement summit in Durban, South
Africa in early September, Mandela said: "We decided that the
troops inside the Congo must meet to sort out the problems
themselves," referring to those Rwandan and Ugandan troops which
are allegedly backing the rebels, and the SADC alliance composed
J3qZimbabwean, Namibian and Angolan troops which were trying to
prop up the 16-month-old Laurent Kabila government.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela said it is not enough to simply take
initiatives. "We still have to go to the field where the
commanders are, to bring them together and explain to them the
decisions made in Pretoria and why the decisions are made," the
president noted.
</P>
<P>
"Innocent people are dying, the infrastructure in the country
has been destroyed and people want to get on with their lives,"
he appealed, adding that "they could only get it on the condition
of peace."
</P>
<P>
There has been disagreement on the approaches to the
settlement of the crisis in Democratic Congo between those led by
South African President Mandela who are for diplomacy and those
headed by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe who advocate
military intervention.
</P>
<P>
Nontheless, Mandela announced earlier that he understo@ the
steps taken by Zimbabwe whose troK0_.H4ad been invited by Kabila's
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of riot policemen
clashed with opposition protesters in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan,
on Saturday, arresting at least 50 people.
</P>
<P>
The police confronted the demonstrators rallying outside the
headquarters of the Popular Front, a major opposition party, and
used batons to disperse them, Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear if any demonstrators were injured.
</P>
<P>
News reports from Baku said about 600 people participated in
the rally despite a government ban, and about 500 police were
deployed to stop it.
</P>
<P>
The protesters were calling for delay of the presidential
election scheduled for October 11. Opposition leaders are
boycotting the election, saying the government has too much
control over the Central Election Commission.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, China Qualify for Women's Volleyball GP Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Two-time World Grand Prix
champion Brazil upset world and Olympic champion Cuba while
defending World Grand Prix champion Russia downed host China in
the semi-finals on Saturday to qualify for the final of the World
Women's Volleyball Grand Prix Finals at the Hong Kong Coliseum
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil defeated Cuba 16-5, 17-16, 11-15, 17-15 for the final
berth while Russia won over China 4-15, 15-11, 15-13, 10-15,
15-13.
</P>
<P>
Brazil will take on Russia for the championship title while
China is to face Cuba in the third-place play-off in the 560,000
U.S. dollar tournament.
</P>
<P>
Lowly-fancied Brazilians made a flying start by taking the
first two sets, to the surprise of the hot-favored Cubans. The
Olympic champions from the Caribbean island state collected
themselves together to win the following set.
</P>
<P>
But a relaxed and vigorous game brought the South Americans to
a final-set victory with a narrow margin of two points and the
triumph of the match.
</P>
<P>
It was a hard battle for the Chinese as they took on taller
Russians in their semi-final encounter. Encouraged by deafening
cheers from the partisan crowd, the Chinese won the opening set
15-13. But that was followed by a two-set slam by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
Although the Chinese managed to win one set back in the
following contest, the successful blocking by their opponents
proved to be fatal. The spiking Chinese lost the decisive set
after leveling the score 11-11.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Lang Ping praised her opponents for their
fierce spikes and tight defense, which she said caused her side's
defeat. The new members of the Chinese side needed more time to
gain international experience. "Experience proves to be crucial at
decisive moments," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied though with my players' performance today. They
have been tested in a very tough game and they did a good job,"
she added.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Faces Major Water Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's water supply system is
likely to face a major problem next year as most of the country's
water sources are drying up due to inadequate rainfall, said a
report reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Ghana Focus said the problem might be worsened
by the approaching long dry season as well as constraints placed
on the existing water supply system.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Nunoo, the Managing Director of the Ghana Water and
Sewerage Corporation was quoted as saying that inadequate
resources are preventing the corporation from undertaking
maintenance works as well as expanding its networks to cover the
whole country. Thus, it is forced to fall on aquifers to supply
water to some communities.
</P>
<P>
Nunoo made the remarks Thursday in Accra while meeting with
Claire Short, the British Secretary of State for International
Development, who was on a four-day visit to Ghana for talks with
government officials and inspection of British government funded
projects.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate rainfall has forced Ghana's hydropower plants to
reduce their output throughout last summer, causing serious power
shortage for both industries and residents.

<HEADLINE> Abducted Italian Nun Released in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGAIDISHU, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian nun Sister Marsa
was released late Saturday afternoon after three days of
captivity by the Somali gunmen in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The release came after intensified efforts of the prestigious
traditional leaders in the area.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the elders, the release has been
unconditional based on humanitarian grounds. Previously,
unconfirmed report said that those unidentified gunmen were
demanding a ransom of 240,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday nine out of the 12 abductors surrendered to
the Eyr subclan leaders after serious discussions and threats
inside the house where the nun was held in Hamar Ja-Jab district
of south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, no force was used against the abductors despite
the presence of over 10 battle wagons in the area and the fact
that the abductors had fired upon the release campaigners for
several times.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the last three militiamen holding
the nun surrendered at about 6:00 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
A convoy of nine battle wagons escorting the nun to her
residence in SOS ho3pital have passed through the main street of
the capital letting the people to know of the nun's release.
</P>
<P>
However, it not known what measures the elders are going to
take against the abductors who held Sister Marsa for the past
three days.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, it is not known how the dispute which brought about
the abduction of the nun will be settled since there is no word
as yet from the regional headquarters of SOS-International in
Nairobi and AbduLlahi Erro, the replaced administrator here in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The release of Sister Marsa is a relief for many Somalis since
her abduction has brought about the total closure of Mogadishu's
main maternity and child heath care SOS hospital which offered
free medical service to hundreds of women and children every day.
</P>
<P>
The abduction of Sister Marsa has totally been different from
previous ones because the politicians, women and children all
sympathized with the humanitarian activities of the nun.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Allied Militia Denies Plan to Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli allied South Lebanon
Army (SLA) denied on Saturday that the latest security measures
applied in the southern town of Jezzine under its control are
intended to expand the Israeli occupied "security zone."
</P>
<P>
In a statement quoted by the state-run National News Agency,
SLA's leader Antoine Lahd said that things haven't changed,
especially for Jezzine which was and will be outside the Israeli
"security zone."
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-styled security zone in parts of south
Lebanon in 1985 to protect its north from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been waging a
guerrilla war trying to oust some 1,000 Israeli soldiers and
3,000 SLA militiamen from the country.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Lahd imposed tight security measures on Jezzine,
which lies just north of the "security zone" and policed by SLA,
asking local residents to acquire permit from an SLA barrack in
the town to leave or return to the city which has a population of
35,000.
</P>
<P>
According to his order, incoming and outgoing cars must also be
subjected to the thorough search at the Bater and Kafar Falous
crossing that links Jezzine with the rest of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lahd said the measures are designed to maintain the security of
the predominantly Christian town which has always been targeted
by Hezbollah's bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three months, many SLA militiamen were killed by
Hezbollah guerrillas roadside bombs in Jezzine in which civilians
were also wounded.
</P>
<P>
Lahd's decision, which will come into force from October 1,
has provoked widespread concern and condemnation across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi feared that the tightening of
the SLA grip on Jezzine may be part of a plot to expand the
Israeli occupied border strip.

The Russian presidential press service said in a statement that
Yeltsin stressed the permanence of Russia's foreign policy,

United States; the consistency in the carrying out of reforms;
and the lack of an alternative to a market course.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Egypt, France Press Ahead Joint Peace Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Saturday that high-level Egyptian and French officials
will start meetings on Monday in Paris to discuss steps to enforce
their joint initiative to push forward the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was launched in May by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and French President Jacques Chirac who called for holding
an international conference to salvage the Mideast peace process
which has been languishing for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have came to a stop when Israel
began building Jewish settlement on the Arab East Jerusalem in
March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also pave the way for the meeting of Moussa
and his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine in New York on the
sidelines of the 53rd United Nations General Assembly this month.
</P>
<P>
Telling reporters here, Moussa added that Egypt and France
agree that they should go on with putting into force their peace
bid as long as no progress was made in the mediations long
spearheaded by the United State.
</P>
<P>
The American efforts have been frustrated by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to accept a 13 percent
pullback plan in the occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Paris meeting will discuss arrangements for the
international conference, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian delegation to leave here Sunday for Paris includes
Assistant Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul Kheir and the official in
charge of the Mideast at the foreign minister's office Ali Erfan.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Organizations Condemn Killing of Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Several Palestinian
organizations Saturday condemned the killing of two members of the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) by the Israeli troops, the
Voice of Palestine (VOP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Imad Awadallah and his brother were shot to death by Israeli
troops Thursday night in Nablus, triggering widespread anti-Israel
protests throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side said the two brothers were members of the
Hamas and were responsible for the bombing incidents in Jerusalem
last year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement of condemnation, the Palestinan Independent
Commission for Citizen's Rights demanded that Israeli leaders be
indicted as war criminals and be brought before the international
criminal tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The Law Society of Palestine said in a press release that the
incident was Israel's state-sponsored assassination. It also
criticized Israel for its closure of the Palestinian territories
follwing the killing, saying the Israeli government must be
responsible for the deteriorating situation in this region.
</P>
<P>
While asking the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to
protect the Palestinian people, the organization also requested
the PNA to investigate and release all the details of the killing
incident.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group said in a
statement that the killing incident was a political one.
</P>
<P>
"The time of the killing when the U.S. Administration is
trying to revive the peace process raises doubts about the
seriousness of the Israeli government in rescuing the peace
process," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, residents from various West Bank cities took to
the streets to protest against the killing incident and over 60
Palestinians were injured during clashes with Israeli troops and
police, VOP said.

<HEADLINE> House Speaker Says President Needs Chance to Respond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Newt Gingrich, Speaker of
the U.S. House of Representatives said Saturday that President
Bill Clinton needs a chance to answer Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's report and the judiciary committee needs time to process
Starr's allegations.
</P>
<P>
"I think you cannot render... any judgment until you have given
the president a chance to respond and given the judiciary
committee a chance to do its job," Gingrich was quoting by The
Associated Press as telling a campaign stop in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
On the lurid details in the report, Gingrich said, "It's
terrible that it's about this kind of topic, but it is a good
thing that the American people can fully participate in seeing
exactly the same information that their members of Congress are
seeing."
</P>
<P>
"I suspect by the end of this weekend, this will be the most
widely disseminated government report in history," he said.
</P>
<P>
The graphic text of the report was disturbing, Gingrich said,
adding he nonetheless felt it was necessary because of the nature
of the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
"I wish he had told us the truth from the beginning, and we
would not have read many things that have no place in public
literature," he said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Insists on Israel's Acceptance of U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat has insisted that Israel accept the U.S. proposal so that
the peace process could be moved forward, said a senior
Palestinian official Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Saeb Erekat, Palestinian peace negotiator and minister of
local government, told the Voice of Palestine radio that Arafat,
during his second meeting Saturday in Nablus with the U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross, said the U.S. proposal is the basis for moving
the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the U.S. proposal, which has not been
announced so far but rejected by Israel, asks Israel to pull out
from 13.1 percent of the West Bank territories during the
second-phase troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
After his first round of talks with Ross three days ago, Arafat
also informed the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that
any discussions concerning the peace process must be based on the
U.S. proposal which must be regarded as a whole package, Erekat
said.
</P>
<P>
Such discussions must include the interim issues, security
issues, the second and the third stage redeployments, the
timetable for redeployments and the U.S. guarantees for the third
redeployment, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat also disclosed that what has been discussed during
Ross' current mission is a review of the U.S. proposal to
determine which points need a mechanism for their implementation
and more work.
</P>
<P>
He said the ongoing peace talks between Arafat and Ross and
between Ross and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also
touched such interim issues as the safe passage linking the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, the Gaza airport and seaport and the release
of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Erekat expressed the hope that Ross will come back from his
talks with the Israelis with a clear "yes" on all these issues.
</P>
<P>
Ross returned to the region Wednesday and held his first round
of talks with Arafat in Ramallah shortly after his arrival.
</P>
<P>
Ross holds the third round of talks with Netanyahu here
Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> Iran Decides on Military Deployment Along Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Council of
National Security (SCNS) on Saturday decided to strengthen its
forces along the border with Afghanistan in order to prevent
possible challenge by the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
The SCNS made the decision in a meeting presided over by
President Mohammad Khatami and with participation of senior
political and military officials in the wake of the confirmation
of the killing of nine Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan, Tehran
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
An official close to the meeting said that the deployment was
aimed at protecting Iran's territorial integrity and preventing
any possible challenge by the Taliban along Iran's border with
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The official, whose name was not given, said the SCNS reviewed
present developments in Afghanistan and exchanged views on plans
and reports by members of the council.
</P>
<P>
The council commissioned all relevant Iranian authorities to
consider every possible channel and to adopt appropriate measures
for protecting Iran's national interests, and maintaining
regional peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that Iran would proceed with arrangements
for establishing peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
During the past month, the Iranian army and the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) have built up their military
presence on the country's eastern border with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC deployed 70,000 troops along the northeastern border
following a ground-breaking war game on September 1, while the
army dispatched three divisions to the southeastern border.
</P>
<P>
The army Saturday also announced to launch its biggest
maneuvers involving 200,000 troops in the border area.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that military deployment indicated a possible
military confrontation between Iran and the Taliban militia, as
senior Iranian officials have vowed to take revenge for the
killing of Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Local dailies said that a war in Afghanistan would be
"unavoidable" for Iran, though it would be unhelpful for
Khatami's declared policy of detente.
</P>
<P>
As the Taliban forces are advancing in the Bamyan province in
northern Afghanistan, the center of Iran-backed Shiite Muslims,
the only possible way to stop ethnic cleansing in Bamyan is
massive Iranian assistance, the pro-government newspaper Iran
Daily said in an editorial on Saturday.

BEIRUT -- The Islamic Development Bank (IDB) has offered to

Daoud Suleiman Al-Bourshid, head of an IDB delegation visiting
Beirut said "we are ready to finance the purchase of industrial
machinery, raw materials as well as financing trade and export
transactions worth between 50,000 and up to 3 million dollars."

has denied reports that any Yugoslav state funds have been
transferred en masse to be deposited for safe-keeping in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese newspaper Asharq Al-Awasat Friday quoted Saidi as
saying that an "honor charter" and strict measures agreed by
members of the Lebanese banking system "prohibit this kind of
operation which tends to tarnish the reputation of Lebanese banks
at a time international confidence in them is increasing."
</P>
<P>
He added that a special committee is working hard and daily to
deter "money laundering and other suspicious (financial)
operations."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports here said that Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic had transferred Yugoslav federation funds from a safe
haven in Cyprus to Lebanon in view of Cyprus' attempts to join
the European Union which is leading pressure for economic
sanctions on Belgrade over the crisis in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> (URGENT) White House Issues Second Rebuttal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A day after the release
of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report, the White House
fought back Saturday with a second rebuttal attacking each of the
prosecutor's allegations and said his arguments were focused on
sex.
</P>
<P>
While saying Clinton's actions were wrong, his lawyers said
"such acts do not even approach the Constitutional test of
impeachment -- treason, bribery or other high crimes and
misdemeanors."
</P>
<P>
"After impaneling grand juries and leasing office space in
three jurisdictions and investigating virtually every aspect of
the president's business, financial, political, official and
ultimately, personal life, the Office of Independent Counsel has
presented to the House a referral that no prosecutor would present
to any jury," the White House said.
</P>
<P>
Starr has argued that the case against Clinton was about
perjury, subornation of perjury, witness tampering and obstruction
of justice. But, the president's lawyers contended that Starr's
report demonstrates that "it is plain that sex is precisely what
this four-and-a-half-year investigation has boiled down to."
</P>
<P>
"The referral is so loaded with irrelevant and unnecessary
graphic and salacious allegations that only one conclusion is
possible: its principal purpose is to damage the president," the
rebuttal said.
</P>
<P>
The wrongfulness of Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky
is not in dispute, Clinton's lawyers said, "And yet that
relationship is the relentless focus of virtually every page of
the OIC's (Office of Independent Counsel) referral."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Lawmakers to Focus on National Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton, after what he called "an exhausting and difficult week"
in the capital, on Saturday urged lawmakers to "stay focused" on
national issues such as health care, economy and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot lose sight of our primary mission, which is to work
for the American people," Clinton said in his weekly radio address
to the nation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made no direct mention of the sex and perjury scandal,
but he began his remarks by saying "it has been an exhausting and
difficult week in the capital, not only for me but for many
others."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who was accused of committing possible impeachable
offenses in a lurid report by independent counsel Kenneth Starr
released to Congress and the public on Friday, wanted the American
people shift their focus from the scandal.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing to do now is to stay focused on the
issues the American people sent us here to deal with, from health
care, to the economy, to terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced 8.7 million U.S. dollars in federal grants to
93 community groups to fund programs designed to discourage
drug, alcohol and tobacco use by young people.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's drug policy director, Barry McCaffrey, said the
intention was to encourage more communities to form anti-drug
coalitions. He said there were now 4,000 such coalitions and the
goal was to raise the number to about 14,000 by 2005.
</P>
<P>
While overall illegal drug use has declined in the United
States, use by children has increased. McCaffrey said the
number of eighth graders who smoked marijuana or drank alcohol
had tripled over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also committed to continue to invest in education. "We
have to have smaller classes, more teachers, modernized schools,
all the classrooms hooked up to the Internet, and higher
standards," he repeated his the plan of his administration.
</P>
<P>
In his radio address, Clinton also urged lawmakers to enact
legislation to help the International Monetary Fund (IMF) deal
with the financial crises gripping Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton asked Congress to pass legislation that would give the
IMF 18 billion dollars to replenish its coffers, which have been
depleted by a number of multibillion-dollar bailouts.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would discuss the global economy with Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin in New York on Monday and urged Congress to
approve the IMF funding so that "America does not become a sea of
prosperity in an ocean of distress."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lesotho Coup Denied, But Problems Do </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Although both Lesotho
and South Africa have denied a military coup in Lesotho, it iw
believed that signs of a crisis do exist in the land-locked
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela said Saturday that
there was no crisis in Lesotho, claiming there was no need to be
alarmed by the situation in Ldsotho.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks while he was visiting Mauritius where
he is also to attend the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) summit due to open on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said he had spoken to Lesotho King Letsie III, quoting the
king as saying that reports of the arrest of Lesotho Prime
minister Pathakili Mosisili were false.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Lesotho Foreign Minister Tom Thabane, who was
in Mauritius attending a SADC council ministersPmeeting in
prepartion for the summit, confirmed that the Lesotho cabinet led
by Prime Minister Pathakili Mosisili was still in full control of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Thabane said that after some reports that Lesotho's army chief
Li%utenant-General Makhula Mosakheng and 28 senior military
officers quit late Friday amid signs of a coup and confusion over
who was in control of the country.
</P>
<P>
Thabane's South African counterpart Alfred Nzo, who chaired
the SADC council ministers meeting, also told reporters that
reports of a coup in Lesotho were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
However, Nzo confirmed that South African Defense Minister Joe
Modise would arrive in Maseru, the troubled capital of Lesotho,
late Saturday to mediate disputes between the cabinet and army of
the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
According to latest information reaching here Sunday, Modise
has held a series of meetings with Lesotho government officials
and military representatives.
</P>
<P>
As soon as his arrival in the mountain kingdom, Modise went
into talks with Prime Minister Pathakili Mosisili, his deputy
Kelebone Maope, and Foreign Minister Tom Thabane, South African
High Commission officials said Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Modise then went to the Defense Ministry for a meeting with
the newly installed head of army, Brigadier Anthony Thibeli. He
also met Mosakheng, who, together with 28 senior officers,
resigned on Friday night with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
Mosakheng did not mention the reason of his resignation.
However, political observers and diplomats believed that
Mosakheng made the resignation announcement under duress.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources, who asked not be named, quoted Thibeli as
saying that he was unsure of his status and that the South
African government still regarded Mosakheng as head of the
Lesotho army.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that Lesotho, troubled with
opposition's allegation of May electoral fraud by the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy since early August, is currently
under government's control, but situation in the small country
was extremely fluid in the capital.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe, that have jointly made
an investigation about the alleged Lesotho election fraud, are
expected to put their investigation report on the agenda of the
SADC summit due to be held in Mauritius on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Crown Prince Visits Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz left for Britain Sunday on an official
visit as part of a seven-nation tour, the Kuwait News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
British diplomats in Saudi Arabia said Saturday that during
his four-day visit, Prince Abdullah, also Deputy Prime Minister
and Commander of the National Guards, would meet with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and other officials on a number of
security matters in the Gulf region, the stalled Middle East
peace process and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said that the Saudi and British leaders would
also discuss the developments in Afghanistan and Kosovo, as
well as ways to enhance bilateral economic, investment and
defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
While the Saudi government has kept a low-key over Abdullah's
visit, the second since 1988, it was attached great importance
by British officials in London.
</P>
<P>
A senior British Foreign Office official has said that the
Saudi Crown Prince's visit would be "extremely important" as the
Gulf kingdom is "strategically the major country in the region."
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between Britain and Saudi Arabia have been
strengthened since the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the Gulf heavyweight, is a very important
market and the largest trading partner in the Middle East
for Britain. Bilateral trade stood at 4.5 billion U.S. dollars
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Britain exported to Saudi Arabia goods worth some 4.2 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996, up 51 percent compared with the figure in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, Saudi Arabia has signed several arms deals and
defense cooperation treaties with Britain with a total value of
about 44 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under these agreements, the British government had supplied
Saudi Arabia with defense equipment, military aircraft and
training facilities worth billions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by the Saudi Royal Palace, Prince
Abdullah's British tour will be followed by a similar
three-day visit to France where he will hold talks with
French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Prince Abdullah, accompanied by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince
Saud Al-Faisal, Minister of Finance and National Economy Ibrahim
Al-Assaf and Minister of Commerce Osama Faqih, will also head to
the United States, Japan, China, South Korea and Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Li Lanqing Inspects Flood-Hit Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing has called for still greater efforts to ensure good
sanitation conditions and prevent diseases and epidemics in the
flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour of northeast China's Heilongjiang and
Jilin provinces and northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
September 11-13, Li also said that a good job must be done of
reconstructing primary and middle schools destroyed by floods so
that teaching can be resumed.
</P>
<P>
"You have already suffered so much from severe floods and must
not be afflicted by diseases and epidemics," said Li, who is also
a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC). He was
addressing the people in a rural county near Daqing, an oil city
that was ravaged by floods this summer.
</P>
<P>
"You should pay particular attention to sanitation and disease
prevention and control," he said. "Only with good health can you
rebuild your homes."
</P>
<P>
Li, who said he was delighted by the news that no epidemics
have broken out in the flooded areas, warned people against
slackening their vigilance, saying that preventing diseases and
epidemics is a long-term task.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to several primary schools set up in tents and
temporary classrooms. Li urged the children to treasure their
hard-earned study opportunities and work harder to contribute to
the motherland in the future.
</P>
<P>
Schools and classrooms must be repaired or rebuilt; and in some
cases, residential houses or office buildings should be rented out
as classrooms before the arrival of winter to enable children to
study indoors and spare them the chill of winter, the vice-premier
urged.

<HEADLINE> Tax Reform Dominates Australian TV Election Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard and Labor Party Leader Kim Beazley argued heatedly
during Sunday night's election debate dominated by tax reform.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address to the 60-minute-long debate, Prime
Minister John Howard, leader of the Australian Liberal Party,
boasted of the economic competence of his government, and
repeatedly managed to steer the debate back on to his tax plan.
</P>
<P>
Kim Beazley, leader of the Australian Labor Party, performed
best when he widened the televised debate to social issues like
jobs, health and a vision for Australia.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the government had achieved a budget surplus 12
months ahead of schedule and brought interest rates to their
lowest level for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Beazley responded by saying Howard inherited high economic
growth and high jobs growth from the Paul Keating's government in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party said the election campaign needed to be
about more than the economy, and that people needed the security
of a decent public health system.
</P>
<P>
Howard was forced on the defensive over his failure to make
inroads into unemployment, and in particular youth unemployment,
after he promised in 1996 election campaign that his party was the
only party with a plan to bring down the youth jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate stands at 8.1 percent and youth jobless rate
at 28.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Every time Beazley tried to widen the debate to issues such as
health and jobs, Howard brought the argument back to tax, saying
tax reform was essential to providing the money for jobs and
social services.
</P>
<P>
While Howard scored the early blows on tax reform, Beazley
finished stronger with his vision for Australia.
</P>
<P>
In their closing arguments at Sunday night's debate, the two
leaders were asked about their vision for the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he hoped for an economically secure society, while
Beazley stressed racial tolerance and unity.
</P>
<P>
Although the prime minister did say he wanted a tolerant
Australia in the future but the race issue is something the prime
minister would try to avoid.
</P>
<P>
Howard has been accused of being partly responsible for the
rise of racism One Nation Party led by Pauline Hanson as he
repeatedly refused to condemn Hanson's racist remarks for about
one year in late 1996 and early 1997.
</P>
<P>
Beazley said he hoped for security, prosperity and fairness.
</P>
<P>
"I want Australia as a fair society and a secure society,"
Beazley said.
</P>
<P>
"I want an Australia in which every Australian values every
other Australian - where that good attitude towards mateship is an
expression of genuine affection for every Australian no matter
what their backgrounds, their cultural background, their racial
background."
</P>
<P>
After the debate, both Howard and Beazley camps said their man
was the winner of the debate, but Howard refused the Labor Party's
appeal for a second debate with his rival.
</P>
<P>
Beazley last week condemned the limit of one debate as absurd,
saying Sunday night's debate was too early as there were three
weeks away from October 3, the polling date announced by Howard on
August 30.

<HEADLINE> Popularize Common Tongue: ``People's Daily'' (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- "People's Daily", China's
leading newspaper, tomorrow will publish a commentator's article
calling for greater efforts to popularize the use of standard
Chinese, commonly known as putonghua or Mandarin.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that the popularization of Putonghua is a
landmark of the development level of both material as well as
socialist ethical and cultural progress, and is of major
importance for promoting economic growth and social progress.
</P>
<P>
"After years of effort, we have made remarkable progress in
spreading the use of Putonghua, but owing to China's vast
territory, large population and imbalanced economic development,
Putonghua is far from being uniformly used in the country as a
whole," the article notes.
</P>
<P>
With the in-depth progress of China's reform and opening up, as
well as more frequent exchanges both internally and
internationally, an increasing number of people have come to
recognize that the barriers caused by dialects have become
detrimental to social development.
</P>
<P>
The practice of many developed countries has also proved that
the popularization of common spoken languages and the
standardization of language are basic conditions for the
universalization of education, the development of science and
technology and the promotion of the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
More efforts should be made to enable people to become
increasingly aware of the importance and urgency of speaking
Putonghua so as to help create an atmosphere in which every person
can communicate in the common tongue.
</P>
<P>
The spread of Putonghua is not aimed at abolishing dialects,
which on specific occasions have their own uses and cultural
values, the article says.

"Instead, it is for the purpose of enabling people to master a
more widely and commonly used language apart from dialects so as
to break down communication barriers, and facilitate their study and
work," it says.
</P>
<P>
The article urges governments at all levels to put the
promotion of Putonghua high on their work agenda, noting that
Putonghua should be used as the common teaching and campus
language.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants should play a leading role in speaking
Putonghua, while radio announcers and TV anchorpersons should
constantly improve their Putonghua to make themselves role models
for the whole of society, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
It acknowledges that China is now in an unprecedentedly good
condition to popularize Putonghua, as there is not only a strong
social demand for the use of Putonghua but also conveniences
provided by the country's rapid development on all fronts.
</P>
<P>
"We should strive to seize this opportunity to promote
Putonghua in order to make it the common speech throughout the
country by the middle of the next century," the commentator's
article says.

<HEADLINE> China to Unveil Securities Law at Earliest Possible Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China will unveil its first
securities law at the earliest possible date, in an effort to
promote a stable and healthy development of the fledgling
securities market, an official source said here today.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the Securities Law is being revised and will be
made public as soon as possible, Li Yining, head of the drafting
team, told a symposium on China's joint-stock enterprises and the
growth of the securities market, which opened today.
</P>
<P>
However, Li, a noted economist who first advocated the
shareholding system in China, did not provide a timetable for the
unveiling of the law, which was first drafted in 1992 and tabled
for official discussion in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He said he is full of confidence about the development
prospects for the Chinese securities market, which already
includes more than 800 listed companies.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, listed companies have raised from the securities
market funds valued at a total of 322.28 billion yuan,
including 148.9 billion yuan pooled through the issue of A shares,
referring to those targeted at domestic investors only; 4.66
billion US dollars through the issue of B shares, which are
restricted to overseas buyers; and 10.08 billion US dollars
through the flotation of H shares in Hong Kong, according to the
latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from more than 200 enterprises and
intermediary service institutions from both at home and overseas
are attending the seminar.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Economic Development Area Attracts Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The economic development zone
in this north China port city has attracted nearly 800 million US
dollars in foreign investment so far this year, a rare feat for
any such zone in view of the Asian financial crisis.

drawn more than 10 billion US dollars in foreign funds, topping
all the development zones in the country, according to statistics

<HEADLINE> Arab FMs to Discuss Mideast Peace in Cairo This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Arab foreign ministers will
hold talks on the Mideast peace process and other vital issues
concerning the Arab nation at the Cairo-based Arab League (AL)
Wednesday, the Middle East News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat is
scheduled to address the AL Council session to open at foreign
ministers level.
</P>
<P>
His speech will deal with the current Mideast peace dilemma and
the Palestinian issue as both topics are high on the agenda of the
session.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's meeting will be another major Arab bid to press
ahead the stalled Arab-Israeli peace-making since the Council last
convened in the Egyptian capital on March 24.
</P>
<P>
At that time, the foreign ministers urged the Mideast peace
co-sponsors to intensify efforts to get Israel to abide by all
relevant international resolutions and resume talks on all peace
tracks.
</P>
<P>
The March gathering also called for continuing Arab contacts
with the United Nations and world countries to forge a unified
stance enabling Palestine to become a U.N. member. Palestine's
status in the U.N. has been upgraded to a near-state one, in July.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also likely to study the new developments of the
Lockerbie issue and possibility of fixing the seven-year crisis
over the trial of Libyan suspects over the bombing of an American
plane through a tentative solution at hand.
</P>
<P>
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid has played an effective
role in helping Libya and the West to reach a compromise recently.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the issues of setting up an Arab mechanism to settle
inter-Arab differences and the Arab Court of Justice are among the
vital issues to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also discuss the nuclear threat in the Middle
East region and the future of the Afro-Arab cooperation, MENA
added.

<HEADLINE> Littlejohn Outlines Big Spurs Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Broadcaster Richard
Littlejohn revealed on Sunday his involvement in a consortium
which is trying to buy a major stake in Tottenham Hotspur.
</P>
<P>
Littlejohn, who appears on TV and BBC Radio 5 Live and writes
a national newspaper column, is a Spurs supporter.
</P>
<P>
He said his group's proposal to buy 29.9 percent of club
chairman Alan Sugar's shareholding was originally put forward in
February.
</P>
<P>
"Tottenham has got a lot of very wealthy supporters. It's
probably the only club in Britain where the fans drive better
cars than the players," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is money there. They may not all be at the Alan Sugar
level of success but there are a lot of very clever and very
successful people there.
</P>
<P>
"I told Alan: 'If you want a deal, I can probably put one
together for you'."
</P>
<P>
"I've spoken to the bank this morning and that money is still
available," he said.
</P>
<P>
The plan envisages Sugar keeping a 10 percent interest and his
son, Daniel, remaining at the club to ensure some continuity.
</P>
<P>
Littlejohn said he had spoken to Sugar on several occasions
and the consortium's offer is still on the table.
</P>
<P>
But he believes news of Sky TV's 623m bid for Manchester
United has prompted Sugar to look to major media groups for a
buyer.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A severe conflict between

</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted the Baku Police Department as
reporting from Baku on Sunday that 15 organizers of a rally were
arrested and charged with breaching public order.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, a 600-strong crowd of opposition members
gathered near the headquarters of the influential opposition party
Musavat. When it was about to march to the central square Azadlyg
to form a rally in the evening, policemen barred the demonstration
and used batons to disperse it.
</P>
<P>
The second clash in Baku on Saturday occurred near the
editorial office of the newspaper Azadlyg, the headquarters of
the National Front led by former president Abulfaz Elchibei.
</P>
<P>
According to assistant chairman of the Popular Front of
Azerbaijan Fazil Mustafayev, over 70 protesters were injured,
among whom some were seriously injured, meanwhile 20
demonstrators were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The opposition organization, Musavat party, said about 100
people were injured, and 15 opposition activists were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Among those arrested was Panakh Jusseinov, a key opposition
leader, former prime minister and one of ex-president Abulfaz
Elchibey's closest allies, who led the government under Elchibey
between 1992 and 1993.

<HEADLINE> Clubs Queue up for Shearer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Ruud Gullit may have to
sacrifice the goalscoring skills of England captain Alan Shearer
to raise funds for a revamp of the Newcastle squad.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Sunday, clubs have been queuing
up to make bids for 28-year-old Shearer, one of the most feared
strikers in world football.
</P>
<P>
The Mail on Sunday says Inter Milan are prepared to offer a 20
million pounds deal to pair Shearer with Brazilian star Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
The deal could also involve Nigerian international Nwankwo
Kanu moving to St James' Park.
</P>
<P>
Manager Gullit is quoted as saying: "I already know what I
have to do, but it needs time.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is very helpful - the board, the staff, everyone.
But everybody understands also that there have to be certain
changes,"he said.
</P>
<P>
But the News of the World claims there are a shortage of FA
Premier League clubs willing to give Shearer the chance to remain
in England, if he agrees to leave his native Tyneside.
</P>
<P>
Aston Villa are said to have a 16m offer in mind, a sum which
would present no problems if a link-up with the Mirror Group --
which the newspaper says is under discussion - goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United and Liverpool are also reportedly keeping a
close eye on the situation.
</P>
<P>
United boss Alex Ferguson has tried to sign Shearer, losing
out most notably when he chose to move to Blackburn from
Southampton rather than go to Old Trafford.

<HEADLINE> Manchester United Still Open to Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League club
Manchester United is still open to offers if they can better the
623 milliion pounds BSkyB bid for the club, club chairman Martin
Edwards said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the BBC's Radio 5 Live, Martin Edwards said the
takeover of the club by the media giants was not a 'done deal'.
</P>
<P>
And despite heavy fire from fans opposed to the deal, he said
he wished to stay at the club's helm.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I certainly hope to stay as chairman. I want to and
I have been asked to and it is my intention to do so."
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Tom Usher told the programme that there is still time
for a rival bid to be made.
</P>
<P>
"It is perfectly open for someone to come in and make a rival
bid," said the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
"This is far from being a done deal. The Office of Fair
Trading will look at this takeover and weigh up the volume of
complaints and analyse if it is against the public interest."
</P>
<P>
Mr. Edwards conceded there was a possibility that BSkyB may
lose out on United.
</P>
<P>
"You are honour bound to listen to a bid. You are advised by
your merchant bankers and they will tell you whether to discuss a
deal or not."
</P>
<P>
But Vic Wakeling, head of Sky sports, said: "We do not think
there is a competition problem here."
</P>
<P>
Mr. Edwards was also quizzed about previous bids for the club
by Robert Maxwell and Michael Knighton.
</P>
<P>
"The Maxwell bid never got off the ground and in 1989 when
Michael Knighton approached us we did not then have the money to
rebuild the Stretford End."
</P>
<P>
"We needed to rebuild the stand and I felt that if I refused I
was putting myself above the interests of the fans," said Edwards.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, American investment bankers Salomon Smith Barney
have denied reports that they are ready to challenge BSkyB and
launch a 700m takover bid for Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph claimed that Smith Barney held talks with
United's financial advisers, HSBC holdings, but a spokesman for
the bankers said: "Salomon Smith Barney is not lodging a
counter-bid for Manchester United."

<HEADLINE> Kazakh President Optimistic about Investment Inflow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said the financial crisis in Southeast Asia and Russia
has not directly affected foreign investors' zest to invest in his
country despite its negative impact on the Kazakh economy.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months this year, Kazakhstan attracted a
total of 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment, which is
expected to continue its growth in the fourth quarter of the year,
reports here said.
</P>
<P>
Political stability is an important precondition for the
attraction of foreign investment, Nazarbayev said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the president said, Kazakhstan places a high premium
on improving its domestic investment environment and has worked
out a series of regulations and premium policies for the benefits
of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He said the Foreign Investment Commission under his direction
will convene for the first time in the latter half of
September.
</P>
<P>
By then, representatives from ten big foreign businesses and
banks stationed in Kazakhstan will be invited to attend the
meeting in which they are expected to air their views on a range
of issues related to the Kazakh investment environment to help
improve it.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Kazakhstan has reportedly absorbed an investment
inflow of 11 billion U.S. dollars, 35 percent of which has gone to
the field of petroleum and natural gas.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Post-Flood Reconstruction  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
has said that the reconstruction of flooded areas on the upper and
middle reaches of the Yangtze River should be combined with the
aim of eliminating future flood threats.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
made the statement during a study tour of the provinces of Hubei,
Jiangxi, Hunan and Sichuan, and the municipality of Chongqing
September 7-12.
</P>
<P>
The four provinces and municipality, all on the upper or middle
reaches of the Yangtze River, were this summer severely hit by the
worst flooding of China's longest river since 1954.
</P>
<P>
"The most urgent tasks right now are to make sure that the
people displaced by the flood can survive the winter and to
combine the reconstruction of the flood-devastated areas with work
to guard against and prevent future floods," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, greater efforts must be made to do a good job
in the next three or more months of accomplishing this year's
economic growth target, he said.
</P>
<P>
While the flood-control efforts should be continued as the
floods recede, the focus of work should be shifted to post-flood
reconstruction, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
First of all, he said, "we must take various measures to
rebuild the schools, health-care facilities and residential houses
destroyed by the floods."
</P>
<P>
Efforts must also be made to ensure that the flood-affected
people have enough to eat and wear, have places to live in, and
have ways to prevent and treat diseases, while students can
settle down to study, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the effort to rapidly restore life and
production in the flood-hit areas should be combined with the aim
to harness the rivers and accomplish the long-term goals.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Continue Between Palestinians, Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Five Palestinians were
wounded in the West Bank Sunday as the clashes between the
Palestinians and Israeli soldiers entered the third straight day
following the killing of two Palestinians by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reports said that four teenagers and a
seven-year-old girl were injured by rubber bullets and tear gas
fired by Israeli soldiers near a Jewish settlement southeast of
Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
The clashes erupted when Palestinian students threw rocks at
an Israeli army roadblock, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers closed a road near another West
Bank town of Ramallah, home to Imad Awadallah and his brother,
who were killed on Thursday night, after a spate of
stone-throwing incidents in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Palestinians and four Israeli soldiers have been
injured in several clashes in the West Bank and Gaza since
Israeli soldiers shot dead Awadallah brothers in Hebron on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Israel said the two were leaders of a military wing of
Hamas which was behind two deadly suicide bombings in west
Jerusalem last year killing dozens of Israelis and injured
hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army said the West Bank and Gaza would remain
closed for at least the next few days due to warnings of
planned terror attacks. All Palestinians have been barred from
entering Israel since the army clamped the closure early Friday
morning, but Palestinian goods were allowed in since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has vowed to revenge the killing of Awadallah
brothers, threatening to "respond with painful actions." The
Israeli army is said to believe that there are still Hamas
activists capable of carrying out suicide attacks within the
borders of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The tension broke out at a time when U.S. Middle East
envoy Dennis Ross is in the region shuttling between Israel
and the Palestinians in an effort to bridge their gaps over
the long overdue Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who has held separate talks with Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, traveled to Egypt earlier Sunday to brief
President Hosni Mubarak on the progress of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel has failed recently to persuade Cairo to pressure
Arafat to accept its proposals which the Palestinians said were
not in conformity with the U.S. initiative calling for
Israel to hand over an additional 13.1 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ross has succeeded in arranging a meeting between Israeli
Cabinet secretary Danny Naveh and senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat. The two will meet Sunday night at the residence
of U.S. Ambassador to Israel Edward Walker.

The felling of natural forests on the upper and middle reaches
of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers must be brought to a complete
halt, starting right now, to improve the ecology and reduce water
erosion, Zhu ordered.
</P>
<P>
"We must work hard for many years to come to reinforce
the major embankments of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, remove
barriers in the rivers, and dredge the river courses, and thereby
improve our capacity to prevent and control floods," he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to harness the Tongting and Poyang
lakes, China's two largest lakes, while the practice of reclaiming
land from lakes must be discontinued, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the effort to resume production should also
be combined with measures to expand domestic demand, increase
investment and accelerate infrastructure construction to promote
economic development.
</P>
<P>
"We should take advantage of the reconstruction drive to
effectively readjust the industrial structure," Zhu said, but he
warned that the operation of loss-making industrial enterprises
with unmarketable products and low efficiency must not be
resumed.

<HEADLINE> Iran Claims to Have Right to Punish Taliban's Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis Speaker Nateq
Nouri on Sunday reiterated that Iran reserves the right to punish
the crime committed the Afghan Taliban militia, calling on
international community to appropriately deal with the group.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem,
Nouri termed the Taliban's killing of nine Iranian diplomats
and a reporter in Afghanistan as a clear aggression.
</P>
<P>
The problem of genocide is not merely limited to Afghanistan
but is a crime against the entire humanity, the official news
agency IRNA quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nouri stressed that those responsible for the genocide should
be punished as war criminals.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official also expressed concern over Ankara-Tel
Aviv cooperation, hoping that Turkey would pay due attention to
the sensitivities of Muslim states and its neighbors regarding
its cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Cem, who arrived here Saturday evening, condemned the Taliban's
crime and expressed concern over the genocide by the Taliban in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey is aware of the sensitivity of the Islamic
countries, including Iran, towards Ankara-Tel Aviv cooperation and
assures them that the cooperation is not against any third
country.
</P>
<P>
Cem on Sunday also discussed the Afghan issue with his Iranian
counterpart Kamal Kharrazi, stating that Afghanistan has become a
factor of insecurity, horror and instability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that various Afghan groups should be encouraged to
hold negotiations to solve the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Iran's policies on Afghanistan are based
on non-interference in internal affairs of the country, making
efforts to settle disputes peacefully, and encouraging belligerent
afghan groups to hold talks on formation of a national
reconciliation government.
</P>
<P>
He said interference of certain countries in the affairs of
Afghanistan and their arming of the Taliban as well as rendering
political and financial support to the group are the factors
further complicating the crisis and resulting in mass murder of
innocent people in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the siege of Bamyan, the center for Shiite Muslims
in northern Afghanistan by the Taliban, he warned against an
imminent massacre by the Taliban in that region and voiced Iran's
deep concern over the emergence of another tragedy in Bamyan.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran would continue its diplomatic efforts to prevent
mass murder in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Hopes Clinton's Scandal to Pass Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu hoped on Sunday that U.S. President Bill
Clinton's sex scandal will pass soon.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Netanyahu said that Clinton
is a friend of Israel, and "he wants what's best for us and we
want what's best for him and the United States."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed that he did not want to interfere in the
internal affairs of the U.S., but his impression "is that the
American society, the democracy and the presidency are very secure
institutions and they will pass the test."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu added that he hopes "this affair will be over soon
and the U.S. will do (what) everyone expects as a great power, to
protect peace and ward off threats to it."
</P>
<P>
The independent counsel Kenneth Starr submitted his report on
the investigation of Clinton last Friday to Congress, which will
decide whether the report will lead to impeachment of the
president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is
continuing his mediation between the Israeli and Palestinian
leaders over the second redeployment of Israeli troops in the
West Bank to unblock the 18-month-old impasse.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to meet Netanyahu and Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat in the U.S. later this month, in
a bid to hammer out an agreement on the further withdrawal.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Jiangbei International
Airport in this youngest municipality in southwest China is to
undergo a 190 million-yuan expansion soon.
</P>
<P>
Under the expansion project, scheduled for completion by the
year 2000, passenger handling capacity of the airport will be
increased from the current 2.4 million to eight million a year. By
then, it will be able to handle 24 planes per hour at peak times.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing was made China's fourth municipality in June last
year, because of its increasingly important role in economic
development, and scientific and cultural exchanges as well as in
transportation in the southwestern region.
</P>
<P>
Jiangbei Airport was built in 1990. It can accommodate A300
passenger airbuses and Boeing 747s. Its expansion is of
significant importance for Chongqing's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The expansion fund will come from central and local government
financing as well as loans from the State Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The new facilities will include a runway measuring 2,800 m by
44 m, six D-grade and two C-grade parking lots, and anti-lightning
and fire-fighting equipment.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Win World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Two-time World Grand Prix
champions Brazil came out the biggest newsmakers as they stunned
the crowd by beating defending champions Russia three sets to
none to win the World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix Finals here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians, who had been rated lowly due to their sub-par
performance during the preliminaries of the Grand Prix, downed
Olympic champions Cuba in the semi-finals on Saturday, which
became the biggest upset of this year's tournament.
</P>
<P>
The South Americans downed the Russians 15-11, 15-13, 15-9 in
the finals Sunday afternoon to take their third Grand Prix title.
Brazil won the 1994 and 1996 Finals.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, Cuba downed hosts and local crowd
favorites China 3-15, 15-8, 15-9, 15-7 to take the third place.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians successfully kept their top form they
demonstrated less than 20 hours ago when beating the Cubans.
They pushed the Russians so hard in the finals that the defending
champions made one error after another after losing two sets in a
row. The Brazilian team won the match in straight sets in one
hour and 29 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"We had been well prepared for the match today," said
Brazilian coach Bernardo Rizende. "We blocked and defended very
well and this is the key to our victory," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We knew what we were doing and, as our players were tired
after a long tournament, anything could happen if the match went
longer than three sets," he continued.
</P>
<P>
The head coach said his team would try their best to win the
coming world champonships.
</P>
<P>
With excellent serving and blocking, hosts China took the
opening set 15-3 over Cuba with fairly easy efforts. But a lack
of stamina cost them badly as they lost the three following sets
in about one hour and 20 minutes, after collecting only 24 points.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Lang Ping praised the Cuban side as they
stood calm and collected themselves together and reversed the
tide by winning back the follwoing sets. "Their successful
serving destroyed the attacking chances of our side," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lang said her team will aim at the semi-finals of the coming
world championships. "But we had first to beat such teams as
South Korea, Italy and Croatia. We have a very difficult draw
for the championships," she added.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Picks Up in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China's principal economic
index show an overall rebound in August, according to a
just-released monthly State Statistics Bureau (SSB) report.
</P>
<P>
The report reveals that China generated an industrial added
value of 158.2 billion yuan in August, up 7.9 percent on an annual
basis or 0.3 of a percent point higher than in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The accumulated industrial added value for the first eight
months totaled 1.2 trillion yuan, representing a 7.8 percent rise
from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
This was attributed to the impetus of China's massive
infrastructure investment since early this year. Heavy industry
production, especially in the sphere of industrial materials,
witnessed leaps and bounds.
</P>
<P>
The country's industrial sales-output ratio in August reached
97.6 percent, representing the highest rate of the year.
</P>
<P>
The state sector recorded 158.1 billion yuan of fixed-assets
investment during the period, up 26.9 percent over the
corresponding month of last year and 4.1 percentage points higher
than in July. This brought the total for the first eight months to
894.3 billion yuan, up 17.4 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of the year, 513.8 billion yuan of
investment went to infrastructure projects, 176.8 billion yuan was
used as renovation capital and 157.3 billion yuan went into real
estate development.
</P>
<P>
The report also shows that the social retail volume in August
amounted to 231.5 billion yuan-worth, an annual rise of 9.3
percent. Stimulated by flood relief demand, sales of food,
medicines, cooling and heat stroke-preventive commodities became
hot sellers.
</P>
<P>
In August, although the consumer price index was still 1.4
percent lower than the previous year's level, prices for major
items, such as grain, meat and vegetables, inched up a little bit,
compared with the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade posted a slight fall in August, with exports
dipping 2.9 percent to 15.6 billion US dollars-worth and imports
edging down 1.7 percent to 10.9 billion dollars-worth. A trade
surplus of 4.7 billion dollars was recorded.
</P>
<P>
The SSB said that in the remaining months of this year China
will still focus on tapping domestic market potential to stimulate
the economy.

<HEADLINE> Flood Reconstruction, Anti-Smuggling Efforts Boost Shanghai's Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The huge demand for
reconstruction in the flood-ravaged regions in central China and
the country's anti-smuggling drive have boosted the industrial
performance of this dynamic economic powerhouse in east China.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's industrial output value in the first eight months of
this year totaled 378 billion yuan, up nine percent on an annual
basis, according to newly-released statistics.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qifan, director of the Shanghai Municipal Economic
Commission, said that the result was better than expected.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increase to soaring demand for textiles and
electrical appliances in the flood-relief work, and an intensified
campaign to crack down on smuggling, which poses a threat
especially to Shanghai's TV set, telecom, computer, petrochemical,
medical and tobacco industries.
</P>
<P>
The country's mammoth infrastructure financing also provides a
golden opportunity for the municipality's industrial sector to
compete in the domestic market, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
During the first eight months, industries in Shanghai
assimilated more than 2.4 billion US dollars of foreign
investment. The total amount for the whole year is expected to
reach 3.5-3.6 billion US dollars, accounting for about 75 percent
of the municipality's foreign capital utilization, compared with
2.5 billion US dollars projected for the whole year.

<HEADLINE> GE Seeks Investment Opportunities In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- General Electric of the
United States is seeking investment opportunities in China with
the help of the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
A GE delegation led by Vice-President and Asia-Pacific
President Goran S. Malm arrived in this capital of Northeast
China's Liaoning Province Saturday, after visiting north China's
Shanxi Province and northwestern Shaanxi Province, and Beijing and
Shanghai cities.
</P>
<P>
GE Vice-President Malm said that GE has concentrated its
business activities mainly in Beijing, Shanghai and other big
cities, resulting in an insufficient understanding of Shenyang and
other important cities.
</P>
<P>
He said their trip was aimed at making up for their lack of
understanding of these cities, and in the hope of locating new
business development opportunities.
</P>
<P>
To his delight, Malm said, Shenyang and the whole of Liaoning
Province have very sound industrial infrastructures and a huge
market, creating the possibility that GE can cooperate in
many fields with Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
GE currently has 24 joint ventures or solely-funded companies
in China, employing more than 7,000 people. Its total investment
in China exceeds one billion US dollars.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Taliban militia
Sunday claimed that they had captured the central Afghan city of
Bamyan, forcing the Shiite Hezb-e-Wahdat leaders and fighters to
flee towards mountains.
</P>

The Taliban forces overran the Bamyan provincial capital at
1:30 p.m. (Afghan local time) without facing any significant

<P>
The Taliban official said the leadership of the Hezb-e-Wahdat
including its chief Karim Khalili and some Iranian nationals were
evacuated from the city in three Iranian planes Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Condemns Killing of Iranian Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister
Abdul Ilah al-Khatib on Sunday condemned the killing of nine
Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan, the official Petra news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
In a telegram sent to his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi,
al-Khatib "denounced the assassination of the Iranian diplomats at
the hands of irresponsible elements in Afghanistan as a crime that
breaches teachings of Islamic Sharia (doctrine), humanitarianism
as well as international principles," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Jordanian government, the foreign minister
expressed condolences on the death of the diplomats.
</P>
<P>
For weeks, Iran had accused the Taliban, Afghanistan's student
militia, of holding 70 Iranians, including 11 diplomats and a
journalist after taking the city of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern
Afghanistan on August 8, but the Taliban had denied any knowledge
of the whereabouts of the diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the Taliban confirmed it had found the bodies of
nine Iranian diplomats and admitted that they were killed by its
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Iran has massed a massive force along the border with
Afghanistan for military exercises last week and vowed on Friday
to avenge the killing of these diplomats.

<HEADLINE> TV Debate Between Australian PM Howard and Beazley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia's two political
heavyweights Prime Minister John Howard and Opposition leader Kim
Beazley clashed over the TV Sunday night as the five-week election
campaign is entering its third week Monday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard launched a strong defense of his tax
reforms including a Goods and Services Tax (GST), arguing that the
government would not be able to provide basic services without it.
</P>
<P>
"Every recognized authority on taxation knows that we need to
change our tax system, that otherwise we won't be able to provide
the health services, the police, the roads and the education,
particularly through the states," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Beazley described the GST as desperately unfair and
unsustainable, "it is a tax in Europe which is more often evaded
than it is honored, it is at the heart of their black economy."
</P>
<P>
Using the leaders debate, the first and probably last, Howard
also tried to boast his government's economic competence, while
federal Opposition Leader Beazley argued that the election should
be about the unity of Australians.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address in the debate, Howard said his
government had achieved a budget surplus 12 months ahead of
schedule and brought interest rates to their lowest level in 30
years.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the government I lead, at a time of difficult
international economic circumstances, is better able to provide
greater strength and greater security for the Australian people,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The most important question people have got to ask themselves
is whether they wish to go back after only two and a half years to
the Labor Party or whether they're prepared to stick with the
government," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"But there's another reason why we should be returned, and that
is because we have the political courage to take the next
important step to further strengthen the Australian economy, and
that is to give Australia a new and fairer taxation system," he
stated.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the GST plan would boost exports and guarantee the
revenue needed in the future to provide services to the community.
</P>
<P>
But Beazley said Howard inherited high economic growth and high
jobs growth from the Keating Labor government. "What Mr. Howard
has is not a plan for a nation but a plan for a tax - it is a
risky tax," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a tax on jobs, a tax on consumers, at a point in time
when there are very substantial concerns confronting the
Australian economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
And he said the election campaign needed to be about more than
the economy, and that people needed the security of a decent
public health system.
</P>
<P>
"This election campaign has to be about the unity of our people
- we've lost our way over the last two and a half years," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We've turned against each other rather than to each other. We
now need a government of uniting our people ... confident in their
sense of nationalism as Australians, confident in their future -
and security and opportunity gives them that," he went on.
</P>
<P>
The nationally televised debate lasted one hour from 7:30 to
8:30 PM local time.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriot Pilgrims Visit Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Greek
Cypriots crossed into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled northern
Cyprus on Sunday for pilgrimage at the monastery of Apostolos
Andreas on the eastern tip of the island.
</P>
<P>
The 1,082 pilgrims, who were of all ages, gathered early
Sunday at Ledra Palace check point in Nicosia, the only way
through which one can enter the northern areas.
</P>
<P>
Strict measures were taken by police to make sure that things
would run smoothly after information came that some
anti-occupation groups against the visit might try to obstruct it.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Pancyprian Anti-occupation Movement had earlier
this week announced their intention to cross into the Turkish
Cypriots-controlled areas, demanding their right to free movement
and free performance of their religious rites.
</P>
<P>
The roads to Ledra Palace check point were blocked by police
and only those whose names were on official lists prepared by the
presidential commissioner for humanitarian affairs were allowed to
pass.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims, who were arranged by the U.N. Peacekeeping Force
in Cyprus, were transferred in Turkish Cypriot buses to the
monastery, 150 kilometers northeast of Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
It is the third pilgrimage in the past 13 months. More than
1,600 Greek Cypriots have visited the monastery on two occasions
since August last year.
</P>
<P>
The trips were allowed by the Turkish Cypriot side in return
for Turkish Cypriots being allowed to visit the Kokkina enclave in
government-controlled northeastern part of the island and pay
pilgrimage to Hala Tekke Mosque in Larnaca.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits was agreed upon by Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash during
their meetings in Nicosia last year.
</P>
<P>
This east Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974
when Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of
the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
People in the two sides have been prohibited to cross the
180-kilometer-long U.N.-controlled buffer zone which separates
the island into two parts.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rises to Three-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of
inflation had shot up to a three-year high of 8.78 percent for the
week ending on August 29, 1998 on sharp increase in prices of
edible oils, official sources said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest rate of inflation in the country since
1995. The sudden upsurge of prices was mainly on account of
resurgence of price rise in food items, especially in edible oils
following a ban on the use of mustard oil, which has caused dropsy
scare in the capital of New Delhi and other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the capital, many states have banned the use of
mustard oil after it was found to be adulterated. In one week
alone since then prices of imported edible oils have shot up by 24
percent.

<HEADLINE> Besenyei Wins First Leg of Aerobatics Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Peter Besenyei of Hungary
displayed great music flair and superb aerobatic skills to win
the first leg of the FAI China Cup aerobatics grand prix here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Besenyei, the inventor of knife-edge skill which is now very
popular in aerobatics, snatched the title with 8.367 points.
</P>
<P>
The lanky 42-year-old Hungarian was followed by Russian
Nikolai Timofeev on 8.357. Viktor Tchmal, also from Russia, came
in third on 8.138.
</P>
<P>
"The pilots' scores are very close today," said chief judge
Quintin Hawthorne. "In this competition, it requires much ability
to interpret the accompanying music and that just comes into
Besenyei's way."
</P>
<P>
Besenyei said music was his hobby. "I like music very much
and when I was six years old, I began to study playing piano,"
said the beaming Hungarian, "It helps a lot when I perform
aerobatics."
</P>
<P>
The next leg of the grand prix will be held in Nanjing, the
capital city of Jiangsu province in east China, which is three
hours' drive from Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The grand prix, which hailed by FAI president Eilif Ness as
the greatest festival of competitive aerobatics ever held, drew
the top 24 finishers of the world championships held last August.
</P>
<P>
The contestants, in the grand prix to be ended on November
2nd, will go on making tour competitions at Jinan, Tianjin,
Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, Wuhan and Changsha.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenya's Economic Growth Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The decline in Kenya's
economic growth that started in 1997 continued into May, 1998,
the central bank says in its September issue of the Monthly
Economic Review.
</P>
<P>
Real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 1.6 percent in
the year to May, compared with 2.3 percent in 1997 and 1.9
percent in the year to March, 1998. The latest figure is also far
below the country's growth potential, the bank says.
</P>
<P>
The bank warns that the weak economic performance is expected
to persist into the remaining part of 1998 and early 1999 unless
urgent measures focusing on cutting government's domestic debt
are implemented.
</P>
<P>
The government should make broader policy reforms for
enhancing efficiency, improving competitiveness and increasing
capacity utilization in all economic sectors so as to reverse the
general decline of the economy, the central bank urges.
</P>
<P>
The bank says the continuous weak economic growth arises from
the following economic and financial factors:
</P>
<P>
-- The crowding out of the private sector by the government in
the investable funds market which divert productive resources
from the more efficient private sector to public sector;
</P>
<P>
-- The lack of working capital and reduced local investments
caused by the high costs of domestic funds;
</P>
<P>
-- The decline in foreign investment caused by the low
investor confidence; 7
</P>
<P>
-- The dilapidated infrastructure, particularly roads;
</P>
<P>
-- insecurity and the on-and-off labor unrest which
encouraged potential investors to adopt the wait-and-see strategy
in decision making.
</P>
<P>
From May 1997 to May 1998, agricultural output was estimated
to have expanded by only 0.6 percent compared with 1.2 percent in
1997, according to the review.
</P>
<P>
The weak performance was reportedly caused by the adverse
weather, the rising costs of farm inputs and the relative low
returns that continue to accrue from agricultural activities.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative output of coffee fell by 47 percent in the
year to May, compared to the decline of 22.0 percent in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The value of coffee exported, in the first four months of
this year, also dropped by 35.7 percent to 4.5 billion Shillings
(75.63 million U.S. Dollars) from seven billion Shillings (117.6
million Dollars) in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Horticulture exports declined by 9.4 percent in the year to
May, 1998, compared with the 2.1 percent growth in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Sisal yield went down by 21.2 percent in the year to May,
1998 compared with the decline of 11.4 percent in the previous
period.
</P>
<P>
Tea production and exports, however, continued to increase
steadily, partkcularly in the first five months of this year. Tea
output shot up by 27.2 and 25.6 percent in the year to April and
the year to May respectively.
</P>
<P>
The hike in tea production was because of favorable
international price and the El Nino-related rains that boosted
output in early 1998, said the central bank in the review.
</P>
<P>
Partly as a result from the competition of cheaper imports,
manufactural industry in Kenya slowed down further to 1.4 percent
in the year to May, 1998 from 1.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The depression was also caused by the high costs of domestic
funds which limit access to working capital, as well as the poor
state of infrastructure such as roads, ports, power supply,
telephones and water supply.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank predicted that a recovery in the
manufacturing will begin in early 1999 as more affordable credit
becomes available to the sector.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) and the East African Cooperation is also expected
to lead to improvement in the sector, the bank says.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, growth in trade, restaurants and hotels estimated
to have declined to 3.2 percent in the year to May, 1998 from 3.9
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, performance in transport, storage and
communication fell to 1.4 percent from 1.8 percent, due to poor
infrastructure, particularly roads.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Irish PM Praises China's Role in Regional Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern praised China's role in the Asian financial crisis, saying
"its decision not to devalue its currency represents a very
significant contribution to the whole Asian region and indeed the
global economy."
</P>
<P>
"The real strength of China is demonstrated by its stablizing
role in the region where there is so much financial volatility,"
Ahern said in an interview with Xinhua before he visits China.
</P>
<P>
On his five-day official visit to China starting Monday, the
first by an Irish Prime Minister, Ahern said it is "extremely
important for me personally and for Ireland."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also expressed his confidence that the visit
will serve to consolidate the "already good bilateral relations"
and "lay the foundations for even closer relations in the future"
between Ireland and China, which he noted have enjoyed increasing
contact in political, economic and social spheres in recent times.
</P>
<P>
China and Ireland, both with rich histories and diverse
cultures, share the same goals of seeking greater prosperity for
their peoples, said the prime minister, adding that he expected
the visit to "allow us to achieve greater understanding of each
other."
</P>
<P>
On what he called excellent economic ties, Ahern said that
"given Ireland's industrial and technical strengths and
competitiveness in world markets, and given the active interest of
Irish companies in doing business in China, I believe that there
is substantial scope for expanding our trade partnership,
particularly in the high technology sectors, in electronics,
telecommunications, chemicals, machinery and other areas."
</P>
<P>
Ireland greatly welcomes China's intention to become a member
of the World Trade Organization and hopes that the current
negotiations will be speedily concluded on acceptable terms to all
so that China can take its rightful place in the world trade
community and share to the full in its economic benefits, Ahern
said.
</P>
<P>
The Irish prime minister also expressed satisfaction with the
progress of the China-European Union (EU) relations in different
fields.
</P>
<P>
Ireland is very pleased with the outcome of the EU-China summit
in this past April, and the ASEM (Asia-Europe Meeting) process
will continue to promote China's ties with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Talking about China's role on the international arena, Ahern
said that "China's position at the United Nations as one of the
five permanent members of the Security Council (of the United
Nations) puts it at the forefront of international political
developments."
</P>
<P>
"We are heartened by the responsible role which has been played
by China on many international issues at the United Nations," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Determined to Maintain Steady Supply of Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
determined to maintain steady supply of food to the people in any
circumstances as it has adequate food grains to meet the
post-flood demand in the country, said an official handout
reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to import one million tons of
additional food on commercial basis to increase its food reserves,
it said, adding that arrangements for importing 0.6 million tons
of rice and wheat had already been finalized.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements for importing the remaining 0.4 million tons of
foodstuff are now under process.
</P>
<P>
At least 218,000 tons of wheat purchased on commercial basis
will reach Chittagong port between the last week of this month and
the middle of the next month, the handout said.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the devastating flood, which has lasted for over two
months and destroyed large areas of crops in the country, the
total loss in grain output might increase to the level of two
million tons or more, according to an estimate made recently by a
United Nations disaster management team.
</P>
<P>
The government has already made appeal to the donor countries
and international agencies for 1.38 million tons of food grains to
avoid any famine after the flood.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Wages War Against Street Children Syndicates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has ordered a fresh crackdown on syndicates forcing
children to beg in the streets or peddle illegal drugs, Press
Undersecretary Lcasiano Gutierrez said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said the president mounted the campaign after
receiving reports that these children were being held captive and
coerced to pose as beggars by well-entrenched syndicates which
squeeze them of their earnings every night.
</P>
<P>
The worse, some drug rings have allegedly been using these
children as couriers of their illegal trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president, Gutierrez said, has instructed the police and
local government officials to go hard on these syndicates, saying
there will be no sacred cows in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching the Office of the President said these
syndicates were being protected by some influential groups and
quartered in four safe houses in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Estrada tapped the Department of Social Welfare and Development
as the lead agency in overseeing the campaign to help the
resettlement and rehabilitation of the street children who number
more than 75,000 in the capital region alone.
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said President Estrada described the plight of the
kids as "a deep social wound" which demands serious attention from
the government and the private sector alike.
</P>
<P>
"The president said the government will be relentless against
these syndicates because by destroying the future of these
children, they are undermining the very future of our country,"
Gutierrez said.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia's shooters
grabbed two gold medals to put the country on the top of the
medals standings on the second day of the Commonwealth Games
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Carolyn Quigley and Kim Frazier retained their r
ifle prone pairs title and Christine Trefry and Annette Woodward
won the women's sport pistol pairs in Sunday's shooting
competition.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, Cara Honeychurch and Maxim Nable took the
tenpin bowling women's pairs and that, for the moment, took A

medal table with seven gold, five silver and four bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
England took four golds, one silver and two bronzes with Chris
Hector and Nigel Wallace winning the men's pairs air rifle and N
ick Baxter and Michael Gault taking the men's pairs free pistol
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was bad for the Australian team for its elite swimmer
Michael Klim hitting a slump in form.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old qualified for 100 meters butterfly final -- an
event in which he holds the world title and world record -- with
only the fifth fastest heats time.
</P>
<P>
He also struggled in Saturday's 200m freestyle heats and was
well beaten by schoolboy Ian Thorpe in the final.
</P>
<P>
Klim won the butterfly world title in January with the best
time of the year, 52.25sec.
</P>
<P>
Aussie swimming legend Kieron Perkins only returned to
training Sunday after being struck down by illness.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Lyn Bessette won the women's 192-kelometer cycling
road race title on Sunday after tragedy struck Anna Wilson.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Wilson, who was aiming to preserve Australia's
unbeaten reign in the road race, looked to have the gold medal
sewn up until her foot slipped off the pedal 500 meters from the
finish.
</P>
<P>
Bessette, who converted middle distance running to take up
cycling two years ago, swept past her to Canadia's second golds
at the current Games.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian hosts had another stunning day, taking two more
silver medals through Lai Kin Ngoh and Shalin Zulkifli in the
women's tenpin bowling and Mutalib Abdul Razak and Mohd Emran
Zakaria in the men's pairs air rifle.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia had collected three silver and one bronze medals,

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan has withdrawn a
unilateral truce declaration he made two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the London-based pro-PKK MED-TV Sunday,
Ocalan said "they (Turkish soldiers) did not abide by the truce we
declared. We have developed new war tactics, and we will intensify
out attacks."
</P>
<P>
"I offered a truce, but did not get a serious answer. Those who
have lost everything have nothing more to lose. I would fight to
the last rather than lead a dishonorable life," the PKK leader
added.
</P>
<P>
The government has rejected Ocalan's offer for a ceasefire as
of September 1, saying Ankara will never negotiate with the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, formed in April 1979 and declared illegal following a
1980 military coup, has been fighting since 1984 for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, home to half of
the 10 million Kurds in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Over 20,000 PKK members have been killed since Turkish
government declared a state of emergency in southeastern Turkey in
1987.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Syria, among other countries, of providing
support for the PKK.

<HEADLINE> CPP Supporters Holds Large-Scale Demonstrators in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 13 (Xinhua) -- About 20,000 supporters of
the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) demonstrated Sunday morning,
and Chea Sim, CPP president and president of the National
Assembly, urged all parties to solve disputes through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The CPP supporters, most of them from provinces of Kandal,
Takeo and Kompong Speu, gathered at the Olympic Stadium and were
protected by the fully-armed military police.
</P>
<P>
While marching through city streets at about 9:30 (local time),
the demonstrators, many of whom carried sticks and guns, shouted
against opposition leaders Sam Rainsy and Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, demanding they accept the results of the July 26
election and urging Ranariddh to join new Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
The police blocked the main streets. No clashes were reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chea Sim made a statement Sunday on behalf of the
National Assembly, calling for all political parties to stop
holding rival demonstrations and heed to the call of King Norodom
Sihanouk to avoid further bloodshed clashes.
</P>
<P>
He also urged all Cambodian politicians, especially the three
major parties, to resolve their disputes through dialogues, which
will help the convening of the National Assembly session and the
formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Funcinpec party and Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) have
agreed Saturday to cancel its Sunday-planned mass rally of 20,000
supporters, after they are requested by the government not to hold
further rally to avoid clashes.
</P>
<P>
"In order to ease the tension of bloodshed in the capital, we
have decided to postpone our mass demonstration tomorrow," Prince
Ranariddh, president of Funcinpec Party, said Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Reform of State-owned Firms Pays Off in Liaoning Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, a leading
heavy industry center in northeast China, has made breakthroughs
in transforming key state-owned firms, technological upgrading
with foreign funds and boosting development of non-governmental
businesses, a provincial official said today.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has more than 900 large- and medium-size state-owned
enterprises, accounting for one-tenth of the national total. Their
combined fixed assets exceeded 500 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the provincial government
experimented with reforms of ownership in 200 designated large-
and medium-size state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It has also formed 38 inter-regional and cross-trade enterprise
groups with the largest one, Huajin Chemical Group, having total
assets exceeding 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province has adopted more flexible measures on the
management of smaller firms. Through the end of June, 45 percent
of firms at the municipal level and 60 percent of businesses at
the county or district levels have introduced joint venture or
joint stock systems. Some poorly managed ones have gone bankrupt
or been merged with others.
</P>
<P>
To date, the province has absorbed 3 billion U.S. dollars from
abroad to upgrade 2,200 state-owned enterprises. More than
one-fifth of the top 500 companies in the world are cooperating
with Liaoning in industrial upgrading. About 60 percent of
equipment imported from abroad is close to the highest level in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, 41 of 60 key state
firms built 161 joint ventures with overseas counterparts. The 60
firms are expected to use at least 600 million U.S. dollars in
each of the next few years.
</P>
<P>
A non-government economic commission has been set up in
Shenyang, the provincial capital, to boost the development of
individual or collective firms.
</P>
<P>
The government urged the sector to raise its output value at an
annual rate of 20 percent to reach 70 billion yuan by 2002.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Hold Presidential Election in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Moves are afoot to hold
presidential election in Sri Lanka on March 3 next year -- almost
20 months ahead of schedule, the Sunday Times here reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said political as well as astrological factors have
been taken into consideration in coming to this decision.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper learnt of this decision from the Bandaranaike
family and those with close ties both to the president and prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the presidential election early next year
would also result in a further postponement of provincial
elections scheduled for August this year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Constitution, the president cannot call a
presidential election till she completes four years in office --
that means till November this year.
</P>
<P>
In the event of her calling an early election, she foregoes the
rest of her first term. However, if she is re-elected in March,
next year, she could continue in office till March, 2005.

<HEADLINE> Former Loggers Practice Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Devastating summer floods in
the Yangtze River Valley have claimed the lives of thousands of
people and caused losses of massive property and have prompted the
Chinese government and people to unveil a massive afforestation
program in related areas.
</P>
<P>
The ban on logging in natural forests in the upper reaches of
the Yangtze have prompted 45,000 lumberjacks in southwest
China's Sichuan Province to abandon the tools of their trade and
pledge to cover the region with trees by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
"We never dreamed our work could produce such catastrophic
consequences," said Shou Cezheng, a lumberjack working for the
forest bureau in Puwei County. Flood waters inundated the home of
Shou's parents-in-law in Jianli County, Hubei Province, one of the
hardest hit regions in the middle reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
"We must do our best to protect the ecological environment,"
said Shou, who worked as a lumberjack in the deep mountains for
over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Heavy deforestation has been cited as the major causes of this
year's heavy flooding. Loggers have witnessed a sharp decline in
ancient forests and many have expressed a sense of guilt when
felling trees.
</P>
<P>
Chinese citizens have gradually become aware of the importance
of protecting natural resources and the environment, and the
country has paid a heavy price for the past inattention, said Peng
Huang, deputy director of the Sichuan Forestry Department.
</P>
<P>
"However, related costs and pain will not have been shouldered
in vain, but instead will stimulate us to work harder to rebuild
the nation's forests," said Peng.
</P>
<P>
He said the province plans to plant 140,000 hectares of trees
annually between now and the year 2,010, in addition to carefully
protecting existing forests.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The two-month-long deluge
across Bangladesh has relaxed its grips as the waters from most
rivers began to recede, except along the coastal belt, media
reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation would continue to deteriorate in
Chandpur district, 64 kilometers southeast of here, due to
abnormal tidal waves in the Bay of Bengal, despite fall of all the
rivers in the coming hours, the Flood Forecasting and Warning
Center (FFWC) cautioned Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The flood situation along the Brahmaputra-Jamuna and Padma
rivers would also continue to improve in the coming hours, the
FFWC added.
</P>
<P>
In the midst of continued crushing down of water, the rivers in
the north and middle parts of the country started receding though
significant rainfall had been recorded in the upper catchment in
the last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
"Rainfall is no matter now," said an expert at the Water
Development Board, adding that the water level would go down
"rapidly" in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
The flood situation in the central parts of the country would
continue to improve while around the capital city of Dhaka the
situation might also show slight improvements, the EEWC predicted.
Major rivers, including the Buriganga and the Lakhaya around
Dhaka, displayed downtrend, and the Brahmaputra-Jamuna and the
Padma recorded further fall at all points, the FFWC added.

BEIJING -- China's telecommunications market is likely to
remain immune to Asia's financial turmoil and keep fast growth
this year, thanks to increased infrastructure spending, vibrant

The Ministry of Finance announced a bond issue worth 100
billion yuan earlier this month to fund infrastructure
construction. It did not specified how much of the capital will go

BEIJING -- A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation said Saturday the strict

The spokesman said that China has expressed a deep concern
about the regulations signed by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture
on Friday, and reserves the right to further reactions.

Pointing out that China opposes trade protectionism of various
forms, the spokesman expressed hope that the United States would

departments and experts of both sides would conduct sincere and
effective cooperation in seeking a proper settlement to safeguard
the general situation of the development of bilateral trade.

<HEADLINE>   Biomedical Industry No. 2 Employer in California: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The biomedical Industry
has become a major employer in California, the United States,
according to a survey released this week.
</P>
<P>
Last year, health care technology businesses ranked second in
employment in the U.S. West Coast state, surpassing the
traditional big employers of motion pictures and aerospace and
trailing only the electronic industry.
</P>
<P>
About 210,000 workers were employed by health care technology
firms in 1997, up 40,000 over the previous year, according to the
survey conducted by the California Healthcare Institute (CHI).
</P>
<P>
The category encompasses biotech, pharmaceuticals, medical
devices and medical diagnostics.
</P>
<P>
In Silicon Valley, 29,000 people are employed in health care
technology careers at 322 companies. Another 3,200 local workers
are engaged in biomedical research and development at the Valley's
Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
San Francisco and San Diego, in the north and south of the
state respectively, are other centers of the industry.
</P>
<P>
CHI said that California reigns in health care technologies
because it has complex and delicately balanced economic
"microclimate" for biotech, which is comprised of academic
scientists, enterprises, capital, investors and the physical place.
</P>
<P>
The industry offers high-paying, knowledge-intensive jobs for
Californians, the CHI study said.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that two-thirds of health technology employees
in Silicon Valley work on medical device and diagnostic projects;
the rest focuses on biotech and pharmaceutical research. They
earn an average salary of 70,000 U.S. dollars -- the highest wage
for the industry of any region in California.
</P>
<P>
With its unique concentration of university research, high-tech
talent and venture capital experience, Silicon Valley has become
the global leader in combining innovative information technology
with breakthroughs in the life science, according to CHI.
</P>
<P>
Such combinations have launched whole new industry sectors,
like the marriage of DNA sequencing and a computer chip technology
called bioinformatics.
</P>
<P>
The biotech industry is growing about two percent a year, no
faster than the overall California economy. But CHI said it
offers a much higher-value product than many other major
industries.

MEXICO CITY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government

<HEADLINE> U.S. Northwest Airline Pilots End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The 14-day Northwest
Airline pilots strike ended Saturday after leaders of the pilots
union ratified a four-year contract with the fourth largest
airlines in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Northwest pilots may now return to work," said Steve Zoller,
chairman of the 17-member pilots' executive council, which
ratified the tentative agreement reached with the company on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the pilots will have a 12 percent
pay increase over the four years under the new contract.
</P>
<P>
The pilots had asked for 14 percent increase over three years
while the airline had agreed on a hike of 9 percent over four
years. The dispute triggered the 6,200-pilot strike on August 29.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the salary increase, pilots won a phasing out of
a two-tier wage scale that pays new hires at a lower rate, Zoller
said. They also received stock options and profit sharing, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The strike forced the airline to cancel all its 1,700 daily
flights and temporarily lay off some 30,000 employees. It also
caused the industry a loss of more than 300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the agreement, Northwest immediately began
to call the laid-off employees back to work.
</P>
<P>
Company officials said it should have one-fourth of its
schedule in operation by Wednesday. The airline expects to be at
full speed by September 21.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia's Second General Election Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Sarajevo residents lined up
in front of the polling stations early Saturday morning as Bosnia's
second general election started across the country.
</P>
<P>
The election, going on over the weekend, is being held under
the 1995 Dayton peace accord which ended the three-and-a-half-year
Bosnian war and divided the former Yugoslav republic into two
ethnically-based entities -- the Serb republic and the
Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
More than 2.7 million have registered to elect Bosnia's
three-member state presidency, state parliament deputies and the
two entities' assemblies as well as the president of the Serb
entity.
</P>
<P>
As many as 83 parties, coalitions and independent candidates
are contesting in the election, with 12 candidates from 16 parties
representing the Muslims, Croats and Serbs running for the the
three-member state presidency alone.
</P>
<P>
No violent incidents have been reported so far although
balloting process was delayed in dozens of the 2,650 stations due
to computer problems.
</P>
<P>
The prevailing calm and order is seen largely as a result of
the heavy international supervision. Also the presence of the
multinational Stabilization Force of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), and over 3,000 supervisors from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
International figures now in Bosnia include NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander
Wesley Clark, International High Representative to Bosnia Carlos
Westendorp and United Nations Special Envoy Elisabeth Rehn.
</P>
<P>
The international community is cherishing big hopes for the
election to produce new Bosnian leaders who can faithfully
implement the Dayton accord and ensure a smooth post-war
reconstruction and refugees repatriation, while Bosnians are
looking forward to a future of peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> Dini: Reform Italy's Foreign Aid Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini on Saturday urged for reforms in Italian foreign aid
policies which were formulated back in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"What needs to be developed are the mechanisms for coordination
and consultation to broaden Italy's international cooperation,"
Dini said, "However, the mechanisms must also ensure that foreign
aid follows a common plan."
</P>
<P>
More private capital has been allowed to flow to the developing
countries since the end of the Cold War, Dini added, so many
governments doubt whether governmental foreign aid should exist.
</P>
<P>
However the Italian government presented to the parliament a
foreign aid bill last December, asking to increase foreign aid
volume from 0.28 percent of the national budget to 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
"With the reform of foreign aid policy," Dini explained, "we
want to streamline the ministry's structures, and dedicate our
energies to negotiation with the recipient nations."
</P>
<P>
Dini added that his ministry would also set up an agency to
speed up the aid deliver. "This is the most crucial point of our
activities today," he said.

CARACAS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Judicial Technical
Police agents seized 100 kilograms of cocaine in the Turmero and
Maracay districts, according to the local press Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The drug was seized early Friday after weeks of searching
in Santa Cruz, Turmero, and some villages in the state of Sucre.
</P>
<P>
The antidrug agents arrested a National Guard's retired
lieutenant, Jumy Esparza, wanted since 1992, and detained four
workers in Aragua.
</P>
<P>
The seizure revealed a very tricky way of smuggling drug inside
frozen chickens, press reports said.
</P>
<P>
Agents have also investigated another abattoir, from which they
presume have come out several cocaine cargoes, all for Africa and
Europe.

ROME, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Italian police on Saturday found
170 kilograms of gold in the residence of Licio Gelli, former head
of the once powerful and secret organization P2 Lodge.
</P>
<P>
The gold was found hidden in flower pots in the garden of
Gelli's Tuscan mansion.
</P>

The search was ordered by Rome prosecutors investigating
charges of usury against Gelli, who has also been sentenced to 12

<P>
Gelli, 79, who escaped to France in May when he was sentenced
for the Banco Ambrosiano case, was arrested two days ago in Nice.
</P>

As head of the P2 Lodge until its discovery in 1981, Gelli

<HEADLINE> Italian Minister: No Need to Revise Draft 1999 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government sees no
need to revise its draft 1999 budget despite less optimistic
projections for the country's gross domestic production (GDP),
Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government forecasts an increase of 2.5 percent in GDP this
year, but industrialists and several independent research
institutes are saying that nothing more than 2 percent can be
expected.
</P>
<P>
"A difference of a few tenths of a decimal point does not
automatically mean there will be consequences" for the budget,
Ciampi said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts differ on how much the Russian and Asian crises will
affect Italy, although most agree the impact will be slight.
</P>
<P>
According to Foreign Trade Minister Augusto Fantozzi, Italy is
relatively insulated from the Asian crisis because only 7 percent
of its exports go to China, Japan and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The risk from Russia is also "limited" in his view because
export earnings from that country account for as little as 1.7
percent of Italy's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the effects on GDP, Ciampi argued that any shortfall
in funds entering state coffers would be offset by other factors.
</P>
<P>
He pointed in particular to savings from lower interest rates
on government bonds.
</P>
<P>
In working out the 1999 budget, the government calculated its
interest rate bill on the basis of a 4.5-percent rate on 12-month
bonds. At the last treasury auction, however, rates were down to
4.06 percent.
</P>
<P>
The budget, which must be completed by September 30, is
expected to improve the country's finances by 13.5 trillion lire
(7.7 billion U.S. dollars). The Treasury is aiming at savings of
about 9.5 trillion from cuts and new revenue of about 4 trillion,
mostly from a tax amnesty.
</P>
<P>
There will be no new taxes in the package. After years of
budgetary belt-tightening, Italy's tax burden has risen to become
one of the highest in Europe and employers charge that this is
holding back the economy.
</P>
<P>
At a convention in Bari, Prime Minister Romano Prodi said that
the 1999 budget would launch attempts to reduce taxes paid by
companies on labor and thus free up cash for investment.
</P>
<P>
"With this budget we will begin a long-term manoeuvre to reduce
the fiscal element of labor costs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Italy's overall tax burden, Prodi said the
government aims to reduce it thanks to extra revenue resulting
from stricter checks on evasion.
</P>
<P>
The budget would also contain measures aimed at alleviating the
worst cases of poverty, which is a "partly distorted welfare
system ignored," he said.
</P>
<P>
These would be the first steps in a "comprehensive revision of
the welfare system" which parliament will begin debating in
January, Prodi added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- NATO started a military
maneuver in Macedonia Saturday to show its military strength, news
reports from Macedonia's capital Skopje said.
</P>
<P>
The move, coded Best Cooperative Effort 98, aims at
intervention in conflicts under the U.N. resolutions. As many as
1,500 soldiers from 13 NATO members including the United State and
13 NATO countries of peaceful partnership including Albania take
part in the three-stage maneuver.
</P>
<P>
The eight-day manoeuvre will feature air strikes and air
transportation of humanitarian relief.
</P>
<P>
This is the second military exercise held by NATO within one
month in a country bordering on Kosovo, with the first, held in
Albania in August.
</P>
<P>
Wesley Clark, European Supreme Allied Commander, said at the
opning ceremony the manoeuvre has nothing to do with the Kosovo
situation, though the whole world is paying close attention to
that area.
</P>
<P>
Maneuver spokesman Simon Macdowell said NATO is considering
plans, including military ones, to resolve the Kosovo issue, but
noting the manoeuvre is not linked with the matter.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian Defense Minister Lazar Kitanovski said the exercise
is very important for his country, because it shows NATO's
attention to his country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The government is considering
measures to ensure a sustainable development of agriculture in
China, "Business Weekly" reported.
</P>
<P>
The cream of the country's traditional agro-technology will be
combined with new environmentally friendly agricultural technology
in establishing an agro-tech network that saves energy and
protects the environment, the newspaper quoted an official from
the Ministry of Agriculture as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ecological agriculture will be developed mainly in the upper
and middle reaches of the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, the windy and
dusty regions in the northern parts of the country. And efforts
will also be stepped up to protect agricultural resources by
legislative means, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry and other concerned government
departments will draft and implement the State Regulations on
Comprehensive Administration of Agriculture Resources.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is also drafting the Agricultural Action Plan for
the China 21st Century Agenda, which includes a series of
environmental projects to ensure a sustainable development of
agriculture in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is also engaged in implementing regulations to protect
arable land, about 80 percent of which will be permanently
reserved for farming.
</P>
<P>
The official said that a tough task for the ministry is to
instill awareness about sustainable development among China's
population of farmers.
</P>
<P>
Though China has made much progress in achieving a sustainable
development of agriculture, it needs to make greater efforts in
this regard, challenged by such problems as growing population,
shrinking resources, worsening pollution and soil erosion, said
the official.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Agriculture and
Agricultural Cooperatives of Thailand will issue shares worth 1.5
billion baht (37.5 million U.S. dollars) next month to boost
capital, the Bangkok Post newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Ennoo Suesuwan, executive vice-president of the bank,
the newspaper said the shares sold to the public will be an
instrument for the bank to increase its lending capability, in
addition to capitalization efforts by the government.
</P>
<P>
The shares will be sold in packages of one ordinary share and
four preferred shares, which can be sold back to the bank after
five years.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary shares will offer a dividend of 2-4 percent while the
preferred shares carry a return equivalent to the going interest
for bank fixed deposit account, or 10-11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank choose to issue new shares instead of bonds to boost
its capital because the ongoing interest for bonds is now as high
as 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank has a foundation from which funds can be drawn should
any of the buyers want to resell shares before or at the end of
the five-year period.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry plans to inject some 10 billion baht (250
million dollars) from its sale of global bonds to help increase
the bank's capital but the project has been delayed because of the
delay in the sale of the bonds.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia and Bulgaria
Saturday congratulated Yevgeny Primakov for his appointment as
Russia's new prime minister amid the political and economic crises
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulatory message to Primakov, Yugoslav Prime
Minister Momir Bulatovic said that he believes the close
traditional friendship and the mutually beneficiary cooperation
between the two countries will continue to develop smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Such development of friendship and cooperation between the two
countries will be conducive to the maintenance of world peace and
to the definition of relations of equity among sovereign states in
the international community, Bulatovic said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov also sent a congratulatory
message to Primakov Saturday, saying he hopes Primokov would
continue to implement the policy of reform and take resolute
measures to ease the economic crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Nadezhda
Mikhailova said Primakov is a reformist who has the ability to
unite the political forces in Russia and the whole society of the
country, win support from the international community and lead
Russia out of the crises.
</P>
<P>
In Budapest, Hungarian Foreign Minister Martonyi Janos said
Saturday the Hungarian government welcomes Russia's choice and
believes the formation of a new government in Russia will lead to
stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
He added Primokov's familiarity with international affairs
would certainly help Russia get out of the current crises in the
interest of Russia and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin named Primakov, 68, as
premier's nominee on Thursday after the State Duma rejected Viktor
Chernomyrdin as candidate for prime minister twice. Russian State
Duma on Friday endorsed Primakov's nomination as prime minister by
an overwhelmingly majority.

private capital and foreign investors, "Business Weekly" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Badly damaged firms that caused serious pollution, relied on
out-of-date technology or showed no sign of making profits before
the floods will be shut down or allowed to die a "natural death,"
said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Private capital is expected to flow into the areas where the
closure of such plants creates fresh investment potential and room
for development.
</P>
<P>
A principle established by the State Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC) stipulates that reconstruction in flooded areas
should not simply copy the pre-flood situation. For years, many
state enterprises have been expected to have their ownership
structure altered.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, SETC is engaged in discussions with
other ministries on new policies to encourage structural
adjustment of industries and technical upgrading in the
flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Some building materials and construction companies in Beijing
have rushed to Hunan and Hubei provinces to grab orders and
contracts.
</P>
<P>
As the floods recede, local officials are talking about
restarting credit programs for fledgling private enterprises.
Regional authorities that have made persistent efforts to foster
non-public owership seem well aware that this is an ideal moment
to usher in more private capital to restructure old-fashioned
economic structures.
</P>
<P>
A new wave of bankruptcies, mergers and acquisitions is likely
to emerge in view of cheaper labor, lower land-use costs, and
lower prices for property rights of companies affected by the
floods.
</P>
<P>
Fan Gang, director of the National Economic Research Institute,
said the flooding was "well timed" for the government to phase out
loss-making enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To attract more private funds and overseas investment, other
economic specialists also suggested measures such as giving
preferential taxation treatment, favorable loan interest rates to
relatively long-term and low-return infrastructure projects, and
the establishment of a bail-out risk fund for banks lending money
to investors.
</P>
<P>
Information from SETC said that state-allocated funds for
reconstruction will bring up an extra investment of 300 billion
yuan to the flood-hit areas.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Develops Software to Erase Child Porn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A Bangkok-based
non-governmental organization has successfully developed an
anti-virus software with a German firm to block child pornography
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The software is capable of identifying all files that contain
child pornography sent on the Internet and also erasing similar
files from computers, the Bangkok Post reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted foreign ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul as
saying that the organization, End Child Prostitution, Pornography
and Trafficking of Children (ECPAT), had begun distributing the
software, with the cooperation of Thai Interpol.
</P>
<P>
ECPAT has been persuading Internet service providers to use the
software and will encourage general Internet users to install it
in their computers, Kobsak said.
</P>
<P>
The spread of pornographic materials on the Internet prompted
the United Nations to hold a meeting in Stockholm in 1996 and sign
a declaration against child pornography.
</P>
<P>
ECPAT has closely monitored the situation ever since, Kobsak
said.
</P>
<P>
UN figures show that there are now about 650,000 prostitutes
worldwide below 16 years of age.

<HEADLINE> CIS Leaders Make Positive Comments on Premiership of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) have issued positive comments on the new
premiership of Russia after its approval by the Russian lower
house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulatory message to the new Russian premier, Yevgeny
Primakov, Saturday, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko
described Primakov as "an outstanding statesman" and "talented
scholar and diplomat."
</P>
<P>
Primakov has always supported the friendship between Russia and
Belarus and has long used his rich experience to make
contributions to Russia and the common cause between Russia and
Belarus, Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov Saturday expressed his
confidence that Primakov will be able to unite the whole society
of Russia in getting out of the political and economic crises,
according to media reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Primakov as the new premier will not only be
conducive to the mutual understanding among all circles in Russia,
but will also be beneficial to the strengthening of the strategic
partnership between Russia and Tajikistan, Rakhmonov said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Russian State Duma, or the lower house of
parliament, overwhelmingly confirmed Primakov on Friday, Armenian
President Robert Kocharyan described Primakov as "an experienced
statesman," saying that Primakov will be able to find a solution
to the current crises faced by Russia.
</P>
<P>
Moldovan President Peter Luchinsky also sent a congratulatory
message to Primakov Saturday, saying that the traditional friendly
relations between Moldova and Russia will further develop toward
mutually beneficiary cooperation after Primakov assumed the
premiership.
</P>
<P>
Luchinsky said that Primakov will continue to implement
Russia's policy of reform.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin named Primakov as premier's
nominee on Thursday after the State Duma rejected Viktor
Chernomyrdin as candidate for prime minister twice. Russian State
Duma on Friday endorsed Primakov's nomination as prime minister by
an overwhelmingly majority.

<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
Most of the newspapers report on the front page the remarks
made by Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao in Beijing
yesterday. Zhu said that any act that contradicts the purpose and
principles of the U.N. Charter and relevant resolutions of the
U.N. General Assembly and interferes in the internal affairs of
other countries is doomed to meet opposition from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks after the General Committee of the on-going
U.N. General Assembly refused again on September 11 the proposal
by a small group of countries asking for listing so-called
Taiwan's representation in the United Nations on the agenda of the
U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- North China's Hebei Province reported a 9.6 percent growth
in its gross domestic product (GDP) from January to June thanks to
increased capital spending since the beginning of this year. The
province was placed the third in the country in terms of GDP
growth during the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
-- A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation said the strict regulations by the United
States on Chinese wood packaging are "irrational" and severely
hinder normal Sino-U.S. trade and bilateral economic cooperation,
especially China's exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- People in Shanxi Province's Dazhai, which used to be an
agricultural model for hard struggle in China, have now led a life
featuring greater prosperity and freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
-- The five-day second China fair for investment and trade came
to a close in Xiamen, a port city of east China's Fujian Province,
clinched 2,766 successful business deals which will involve a total
use of overseas investment of 14.21 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- Reconstruction in areas devastated by the floods this summer
will offer unprecedented investment opportunities to private
capital and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese economists dismissed the rebound of the Japanese
currency last week as an event of minor significance to China.
</P>
<P>
-- The glut-stricken building materials industry is expected to
be the biggest beneficiary of this year's floods once the massive
reconstruction program gets under way.
</P>
<P>
-- More financial measures are being prepared to help boost
Chinese exports, said Liu Mingkang, deputy governor of the
people's Bank of China, last week in Xiamen, a port city of east
China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China will remain the leader in trade financing.
Other financial institutions are also expected to give more
support to export enterprise clients.

LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Billy Schwer
retained his European lightweight title here on Saturday by
beating Frenchman Manuel Fernandes in the seventh round of a
scheduled 12-round contest.
</P>
<P>
Schwer's aggression and greater variety of blows finally told
against the plucky challenger who finished with blood pouring
from his right ear.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes had a brief spell of success in round four when he
closed Schwer down, pushing him back on his heels with hooks to
the head. But the contest turned dramatically in Schwer's favor
in the next round when he hurt his opponent with a tremendous
punch which landed on the ear.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes, under relentless pressure, turned away and dropped
his hands in surrender midway through the seventh round and the
referee called it off.
</P>
<P>
It was Schwer's 36th win in 39 contests, and he is clearly in
the running for a world title chance.

<HEADLINE> Prices of China's Imported Commodities Rise as Smuggling Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Prices of China's imported
commodities have risen sharply since the central government
initiated a nationwide anti-smuggling campaign in early August,
reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the cost of imported cigarettes, for
example, has gone up by 28 percent in Beijing, while films,
another popular import item, climbing up 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The anti-smuggling campaign has almost cut off my imported
cigarette supply," said one grocery store owner.
</P>
<P>
The campaign which involves efforts from customs, police and
industrial and commercial administrations has effectively boosted
prices of major imported commodities, such as automobiles, refined
oil and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The computer market was among the "hardest-hit" in the drive
with component prices soaring last month. Prices for computer
chips and CPUs went up by an average of 20 percent for the period.
</P>
<P>
However, there are some retailers who have adopted a
wait-and-see strategy, maintaining the original price of imported
commodities.
</P>
<P>
"The films here, including Kodak and Fuji, are all sold at the
same prices for the benefit of our customers," said Yang Guangwei,
general manager of Beijing Red Ribbon Film Store.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau said that
the price rise of imported cigarettes will do little to raise the
retail prices for domestic brands because the country's tobacco
market is oversupplied.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that although consumers suffer losses in a
short term in the price rise, they will later enjoy better product
quality, as the anti-smuggling drive is helpful to establishing a
normal production and sales environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Two persons died and 77 were
injured Friday in demonstrations on the 25th anniversary of the
1973 military coup in Santiago, a Chilean police head said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Uniformed Police Director Colonel Sergio Apablaza said
356 were detained during the Friday violent demonstrations that
lasted until Saturday on the outskirts of Santiago.
</P>
<P>
He said that 18 official vehicles, traffic lights and
electricity lines were damaged and two buildings were attacked.
</P>
<P>
Vice Interior Minister Belisario Velasco said that the violent
actions showed that the security measures implemented by the
government were fully justified.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, the Chilean government failed to obtain
a congressional majority in the elections and encountered a
deteriorating economic situation as well as an intensification of
opposition to its policies. Accelerated inflation led to food
shortages and repeated clashes between pro- and anti-government
activists.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces intervened in September 1973 and President
Salvador Allende was killed in the coup.

<HEADLINE> China's Telecom Market Picks Up Amid Asia's Weak Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- China's telecommunications
market is likely to remain immune to Asia's financial turmoil and
keep fast growth this year, thanks to increased infrastructure
spending, vibrant domestic demand and limited dependence on Asian
economy, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance announced a bond issue worth 100
billion yuan earlier this month to fund infrastructure
construction. It did not specified how much of the capital will go
to telecommunications but said total investment for the sector
will more than double the figure set earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Information Industry (MII) said that even the
previous investment projection represented a rise of 20 percent
over last year.
</P>
<P>
Much of the funds would go to construction and expansion of
trunk line optical cable, mobile communications and local
telephone networks, said MII.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the huge investment, the domestic demand for
telecom, unlike other markets in China, enjoys robust growth.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom, the country's dominant telecom operator, set a
goal to raise the number of cellular phone users by 7 million this
year to 20 million. The company accounts for 98 percent of the
country's cellular market.
</P>
<P>
Foreign players also benefit from China's sound telecom
performance. Zhang Ken, director of Ericsson (China)'s wireless
technology department, said that in 1997 China was Ericsson's
second largest market after the United States.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Intelligence Coordinating Board Head Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The head of Indonesia's State
Intelligence Coordinating Board (Bakin) has been replaced, the
Jakarta Post Saturday quoted Minister/State Secretary Akbar
Tandjung as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said President B.J. Habibie has promoted his loyal
advisor Lieutenant General (ret.) Zaini Azhar Maulani to replace
Moetojib as head of the Bakin.
</P>
<P>
The replacement of Moetojib was merely routine because he had
held the position for three years, Akbar said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed speculation that Moetojib's failure to give
accurate reports on the current wave of student demonstrations was
the main reason for his replacement.
</P>
<P>
Students this week have stepped up protests against the
government for its inability to control the rising prices of
essential commodities.
</P>
<P>
Bakin is directly under the president's supervision and falls
under the State Secretariat administratively. The board's main
responsibility is to monitor foreign affairs and developments.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces has its own intelligence body, the BIA, which
is in charge of monitoring the domestic security situation.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted reliable sources as saying that it was quite
natural that Habibie preferred Bakin to be headed by his own
trusted aide, especially since as a civilian he did not know much
about the agency.
</P>
<P>
Maulani was born on January 6, 1939 in South Kalimantan. During
his period of active military service, Maulani was deemed one of
the Armed Forces' most promising officers as a result of his
intellectual capability.
</P>
<P>
He served as Habibie's advisor when Habibie was state minister
of research and technology and he also became a military
columnist.
</P>
<P>
Maulani was then appointed secretary to the vice president, a
job he kept even after Habibie replaced president Soeharto in May.
He received the honorary title of lieutenant general (ret.) in
April.

<HEADLINE> Aston Villa Lead English Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Merson made the breakthrough in the first half and, after
Wimbledon's Carl Leaburn was sent off, Ian Taylor sealed the
three points with the home side's second.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Aston Villa jumped to the lead in the team
standings over Liverpool with three points clear.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool, who had 10 points from five matches, lost to West
Ham United 2-1 at Upton Park. John Hartson and Israeli Eyal
Berkovic scored the Hammers' goals, with Karlheinz Riedle pulling
one back for Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Leeds, with a 0-0 draw at Everton, was third in the standings.
</P>
<P>
At Villa Park, John Gregory's side struggled early on to break
down a determined Wimbledon side, who started the day in fourth
place.
</P>
<P>
When Alan Thompson missed his second penalty of the season
after 36 minutes it looked like it wouldn't be Villa's day.
</P>
<P>
Right on half-time Villa earned a second spotkick when Leaburn
elbowed Ugo Ehiogu off the ball.
</P>
<P>
Leaburn was sent off and Merson, signed last week for 6.75
million pounds from Middlesbrough, stepped up to take the
penalty, only for Wimbledon's Neil Sullivan to parry his weak
effort. Fortunately for Merson, Sullivan couldn't hold the ball
and the England international gratefully converted the rebound.
</P>
<P>
From then on Villa controlled the match and Taylor fired home
a cross from the excellent Julian Joachim after 57 minutes to
seal a comfortable victory.
</P>
<P>
West Ham's Hartson and his old Arsenal team mate Ian Wright,
made captain for the day, were a constant menace against
Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Hartson opened the scoring after just four minutes, his header
from a corner deflecting off Jamie Carragher and in.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool surged back at the start of the second half but were
caught on the counter after 51 minutes when Berkovic fired home
from 20 yards after good work from Hartson.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Riedle hit a post and then pulled one back for Live
rpool with a trademark header in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
"It was important we won after the game in midweek but we were
hanging on for grim life at the end," said West Ham coach Harry
Redknapp, whose side threw away a 3-0 lead to lose 4-3 at home to
Wimbledon on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United are fifth with eight points and a game in
hand after Dwight Yorke scored his third goal in two games as
they saw off Coventry 2-0 at Old Trafford. Norwegian Ronny
Johnsen scored United's second.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Hughes scored a late but spectacular 35-yard equaliser
for champions Arsenal to grab a 1-1 draw at Leicester. It was the
misfiring Gunners' fourth successive league draw.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Establish More Nature Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial and commercial center, plans to establish three new
large nature reserves and a number of smaller reserves covering
over 40,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The three larger reserves will include polders along the
eastern shores of Chongming Island which are home to more than
2 million cranes, swallows and ducks.
</P>
<P>
A reserve covering 27,000 hectares set for the Yangtze River
estuary will provide a protected habitat for both Chinese and
white sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
The last of the larger reserves on the Beigan Mountain will
provide a home for some 10,000 egret.
</P>
<P>
Smaller reserves will be established around Dianshan Lake, on
Taiyang Island and in East Sea polder areas. All projects are
scheduled for completion by the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Bans Coral-Reef Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Southern China's Hainan
Province has issued an order banning the mining of coral reefs in
sea waters in an effort to protect its coral reef resources.
</P>
<P>
The province's Marine Environment and Resource Administration
said the mining, selling and transporting of coral reef or coral
products are now totally forbidden in the province.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who damages the coral reefs will be fined by the
departments concerned and punished in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the excessive mining of coral reefs by
fishermen has destroyed 80 percent of the reef resources. Coral
can be used in lime production, housing construction, and creating
artistic works.
</P>
<P>
The province had to impose the ban to stop the further
destruction of the reefs.
</P>
<P>
Experts here say that nearly half of all marine organisms live
in sea waters rich in coral reefs. Coral reefs also act as
wave-barriers in coastal areas and sea water clarifiers. Coral
reefs are also tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 400 varieties of coral reefs along the
Hainan coast, and more than 600 small islands in the South China
Sea are coral reefs.

<TEXT>
<P>
Brazil defeated Cuba 16-5, 17-16, 11-15, 17-15 for the final
berth while Russia won over China 4-15, 15-11, 15-13, 10-15,
15-13.
</P>
<P>
Brazil will take on Russia for the championship title while C
hina faces Cuba in the third-place play-off of the 560,000 U.S.
dollars tournament on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lowly-fancyed Brazilians made a flying start by taking the
first two sets, to the surprise of the hot-favored Cubans. The
Olympic champions from the Caribbean island state collected
themselves together to win back the following set.
</P>
<P>
But a relaxed and vigorous game brought the South Americans to
a final-set victory with a narrow margin of two points and the
triumph of the match.
</P>
<P>
It was a hard battle for the Chinese as they took on taller
Russians in their semi-final encounter. Encouraged by deafening
cheers from the partisan crowd, the Chinese won the opening set
15-4. But that was followed by two-set slam by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
Although the Chinese managed to win one set back in the
following contest, the successful blocking by their opponents
proved to be fatal. The spiking Chinese lost the decisive set
after leveling the score 11-11.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Lang Ping praised her opponents for their
fierce spikes and tight defense, which she said caused her side's
defeat. The new members of the Chinese side needed more time to
gain international experience. "Experience proved to be crutial
at decisive moments," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied though with my players' performance today. They
have been tested in a very tough game and they did a good job,"
she added.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Discovered in Indonesia's Irian Jaya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Large natural gas reserves
were discovered in Bintuni Bay, Manokrawi regency in Indonesia's
Irian Jaya province, Antara News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The latest result of a survey of the reserves shows that the
reserves reach 15 trillion cubic feet, large than those in other
countries in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from ARCO, one of the American oil
companies operating in Irian Jaya, the natural gas reserves would
soon be exploited enabling Manokwari to export liquefied natural
gas next year at the latest.
</P>
<P>
ARCO has already started making preparations including a
technical survey for the construction of the necessary
exploitation facilities and socio-cultural research on
acceptability of the local population with regard to the
developments taking place in the area, the report said.
</P>
<P>
No only will it become the largest natural gas producer in
Indonesia, Manokwari is also rich in marine, plantation, forestry
and mineral resources, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Davenport Beats Hingis to Win U.S. Open Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Lindsay
Davenport of the United States beat world number one Martina
Hingis of Switzerland to win her first Grand Slam title at the
U.S. Open tennis championships here Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Playing in her first Grand Slam final, Davenport smashed
forehand and backhand winners down the lines and won 12 of the
last 15 points to gain a 6-3, 7-5 victory over the defending
champion.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old, the first American-born women's champion at
the U.S. Open since 1982, did not lose a set in the seven rounds
of the tournament, winning 700,000 U.S. dollars for the first
prize.
</P>
<P>
The victory is a sweet gift for her mother's birthday. "I
guess she thinks she's getting a really nice gift now," Davenport
said as she accepted the check, breaking into a laugh when she
looked at her mom in the players' box.
</P>
<P>
After hitting a backhand volley winner on match point, the
champion put her hands on her head in disbelief, then looked
lovingly at her racket before smiling at her mom.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a great story. She's the one that used to drive me
hours and hours to practice, since I was 6 when I started playing
tennis," Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first year since 1990 that four different women
have won the Grand Slam singles titles.
</P>
<P>
Davenport got an early service break for a 2-1 lead in the
first set by dictating play with sharp volleys and passing shots.
Hingis was handcufffed by the wildness that bothered her
throughout the tournament.
</P>
<P>
In the seventh game, at deuce, Davenport got a break when the
wind knocked off her white baseball cap as she hit the ball into
the net on a tough volley. Davenport won the replay to move to
break point.
</P>
<P>
Hingis looked on in dismay, then lost the next point to give
Davenport another service break for a 5-2 lead. When she came
back from the changeover, Davenport had secured her cap with
bobby pins.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who moved past Novotna to No. 2 in the world
rankings, wrapped up the first set in 37 minutes with a backhand
on the line.
</P>
<P>
Hingis seemed frustrated at times during the second
set,dropping her racket on the court after losing one point and
screaming at herself after another.
</P>
<P>
Davenport broke for a 4-2 lead but Hingis broke right back and
again for a 5-4 lead. But Davenport regained control, breaking
back as Hingis ended the 10th game with a double fault and shook
her head in dismay.
</P>
<P>
Davenport held serve in the last game and finished off the
match with a clever shot.
</P>
<P>
Davenport and Hingis will face each other Sunday in the
women's doubles final.

Kenneth Starr's report, the White House fought back Saturday with
a second rebuttal attacking each of the prosecutor's allegations
and said his arguments were focused on sex.
</P>
<P>
While saying Clinton's actions were wrong, his lawyers said
"such acts do not even approach the Constitutional test of
impeachment -- treason, bribery or other high crimes and
misdemeanors."
</P>
<P>
"After impaneling grand juries and leasing office space in
three jurisdictions and investigating virtually every aspect of
the president's business, financial, political, official and
ultimately, personal life, the Office of Independent Counsel has
presented to the House a referral that no prosecutor would present
to any jury," the White House said. (BC-US-Rebuttal)

TEHRAN -- Iran's Supreme Council of National Security (SCNS) on
Saturday decided to strengthen its forces along the border with
Afghanistan in order to prevent possible challenge by the Afghan
Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
The SCNS made the decision in a meeting presided over by
President Mohammad Khatami and with participation of senior
political and military officials in the wake of the confirmation
of the killing of nine Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan, Tehran
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
An official close to the meeting said that the deployment was
aimed at protecting Iran's territorial integrity and preventing
any possible challenge by the Taliban along Iran's border with
Afghanistan. (Iran-Troop Deployment-Afghanistan)

JERUSALEM -- Several Palestinian organizations Saturday
condemned the killing of two members of the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) by the Israeli troops, the Voice of Palestine
(VOP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Imad Awadallah and his brother were shot to death by Israeli
troops Thursday night in Nablus, triggering widespread anti-Israel
protests throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side said the two brothers were members of the
Hamas and were responsible for the bombing incidents in Jerusalem
last year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement of condemnation, the Palestinan Independent
Commission for Citizen's Rights demanded that Israeli leaders be
indicted as war criminals and be brought before the international
criminal tribunal. (Palestinians-Condemn-Killing)

MOSCOW -- The appointment of Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister
was an unequivocal proof of Russia's commitment to a free market
course, said Russian President Boris Yeltsin in a telephone
conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian presidential press service said in a statement that
Yeltsin stressed the permanence of Russia's foreign policy,
including a mutually beneficial and equal partnership with the
United States; the consistency in the carrying out of reforms; and
the lack of an alternative to a market course.
</P>
<P>
During the conversation Yeltsin spoke about recent events in
the country, including the government's appointments.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in return, said that the United States supports
Russian as before on its reform path. It is ready to continue the
most active cooperation with new Russian government, including
within the framework of the Gore-Primakov commission, the press
statement said. (Yeltsin-Clinton)

<HEADLINE> Rafter, Philippoussis to Meet in U.S. Open Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Patrick
Rafter spoiled American Pete Sampra's bid for a record-tying 12th
Grand Slam title as he capitalized on a leg injury to upset the
top seed and four-time winner 6-7 (8-10), 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 in
the semifinal of the U.S. Open tennis championships here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rafter will attempt to win his second consecutive U.S. Open
title Sunday against fellow Australian Mark Philippoussis, who
beat 10th seed Carlos Moya of Spain 6-1, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 in another
semifinal. It will be the first time two Australians fight in the
Open's final since 1970.
</P>
<P>
Sampras appeared to be in control of the match late in the
third set when he sustained an injury to his upper left thign. He
managed to hold on to win the final game of the set, but was
unable to move at a normal pace for the remainder of the match.
</P>
<P>
Sampras was hardly competitive after the injury, especially
returning serve. In the fourth set, Rafter broke in the opening
game and that was all he needed as Sampras never really
threatened to break back.
</P>
<P>
Rafter broke again to build a 2-0 lead in the fifth set and
Sampras, whose strong serve was the only weapon he could rely on,
faded in the final service game. He fell on match point as Rafter
unleashed a wicked backhand passing shot to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
"I could see he was having problems," said Rafter. "I tried to
keep the ball away from him as best as possible. I didn't want to
hit it right at him. He could still hit winners but I saw he was
having a bit of a problem with his mobility."
</P>
<P>
Sampras sustained the injury serving at 4-2 in the third set
and apparently in control of the match after breaking Rafter. He
dashed to the net to hit a volley and his left leg appeared to
buckle after the shot. Sampras grabbed the leg in pain and left
the court with a trainer for treatment after holding for a 5-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Rafter and Sampras was their 11th but
their first in Grand Slam play. Sampras lost to Rafter for only
the third time and suffered his eighth defeat in 64 matches
lifetime against Australian opponents.
</P>
<P>
Rafter nearly became the first defending champion to go out in
the first round the following year as he rallied from two sets
down to beat Hicham Arazi of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Rafter improved to 8-0 this year against players ranked in the
top 10 and won his 10th consecutive five-set match.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Rafter will attempt to become only the sixth player
in the Open Era to successfully defend his U.S. Open title.

<HEADLINE> Philippoussis Beats Moya in U.S. Open Semifinal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Unseeded Mark Philippoussis
of Australia beat 10th seed Carlos Moya of Spain 6-1, 6-4, 5-7,
6-4 to advance to his first Grand Slam final at the U.S. Open
tennis championships here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis, one of the hardest servers in tennis,
overpowered Moya, who was attempting to pull off a rare double in
winning the French Open and the U.S. Open in the same year.
Philippoussis had 21 aces with 11 double faults and 75 winners
against 36 unforced errors. Moya, meanwhile, managed only six
aces and recorded only 32 winners while making 12 unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
"I've been working extremely hard on my all-around game," said
Philippoussis. "I've been spending a lot more time on the court
than normal, just working on all parts of my game. I concentrated
extremely well. I applied the pressure on him. He felt the
pressure. I just served great. Right now, I honestly feel like no
one can beat me. I can win this thing."
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis broke Moya twice and won the opening set in only
20 minutes and needed only another 31 minutes to capture the
second, breaking to go up 4-2, and serving out the set. But Moya
rallied in the third set after fending off four break points at
5-5. Moya held to 6-5 and then took the set on two consecutive
double faults by Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
Moya fought to 2-2 in the fourth set but could not work his
way out. He was called three times for foot faults.
</P>
<P>
"Three foot faults in one game when they didn't call one the
whole match," said Moya. "I don't know what to think anymore.
There was another call the woman missed. I'm sorry to say but
that woman was a little bit old. The ball was like 130 mph. I
thought it was out. How can she see the ball? No way!"
</P>
<P>
After Moya saved two match points at 4-5, Philippoussis ended
the match in one hour 50 minutes with a crisp backhand volley.

<HEADLINE> Gore Says, Starr Report Not Ground for Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al
Gore said Saturday that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report
to Congress is not grounds for impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe this report serves as the basis for
overturning the judgment of the American people ... that Bill
Clinton should be their president," Gore said after ceremonies
opening a light-rail line into this Portland suburb in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
"He has accepted responsibility for his actions. He has said he
did wrong. He has asked for forgiveness. He has addressed the
issues he needs to address," media reports quoted Gore as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gore, making a weekend swing through Portland and Seattle to
speak on environmental issues and campaign for congressional
candidates, made no mention of the Starr report in his remarks to
a crowd of 2,000.
</P>
<P>
But in a short statement to reporters afterward, he stressed he
would not abandon the president in his darkest hours.
</P>
<P>
"For almost six years now, I have served alongside this
president as he has led us toward unprecedented prosperity, toward
solutions to problems we need to address," Gore said. "He is
doing a tremendous job as president. I look forward to beginning
to work with him as we continue to address the issues that face
this country."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Bosnia-Croatia Deal on Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Saturday welcomed a deal reached between Bosnia and Croatia, which
would allow Bosnia to use the Croatian port of Ploce and give
Croatia transit through the town of Neum.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. welcomes the successful conclusion of negotiations...
regarding Bosnian use of the Port of Ploce and Croatian transit
through Neum," State Department spokesman James Rubin said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement "represents an effort by both countries to put
aside the mistrust of the past and look to a new era of economic
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"Croatian President (Franjo) Tudjman and Bosnian President
(Alija) Izetbegovic are to be commended for their contributions
that made possible the initialing of this important agreement,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. looks forward to an early signature and ratification
of the Ploce/Neum agreement by both countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached a draft agreement last weekend, giving
Bosnia the right to free transit to and from Ploce port on the
Adriatic sea.
</P>
<P>
Ploce was the main port used by the country when it was part of
federal Yugoslavia for transporting raw materials and industrial
products.
</P>
<P>
The right for Bosnia to use the port was granted by the 1995
Dayton peace agreement, signed by all the parties involved in the
civil war in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> White House Issues Second Rebuttal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A day after the release of
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report, the White House fought
back Saturday with a second rebuttal, calling the prosecutor's
allegations a "hit-and-run smear campaign" lacking legal merit.
</P>
<P>
"It is plain that 'sex' is precisely what this four-and-a-half
year investigation has boiled down to," the White House argued in
its second counter report.
</P>
<P>
"The referral is so loaded with irrelevant and unnecessary
graphic and salacious allegations that only one conclusion is
possible: its principal purpose is to damage the President," the
rebuttal said.
</P>
<P>
While President Clinton's actions were wrong, the acts
described by prosecutors "do not even approach the Constitutional
test of impeachment," Clinton's White House and private lawyers
argued. Their report provided a point-by-point rejection of the 11
grounds for possible impeachment cited in Starr's referral made
public Friday.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the lurid nature
of the report was unfortunate but caused by the president's denial
of a sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. He called on lawmakers to reserve judgment.
</P>
<P>
"I think you cannot render... any judgment until you have given
the president a chance to respond and given the Judiciary
Committee a chance to do its job," Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
Starr's allegations are "simply part of a hit-and-run smear
campaign, and their inclusion says volumes about the
(prosecutor's) tactics and objectives," the White House said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in his weekly radio address Saturday, said it had been
"an exhausting and difficult week in the capital -- not only for
me, but for many others." Without a mention of the Starr report,
he pledged to press ahead with his policy agenda.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing to do now is to stay focused on the
issues the American people sent us here to deal with, from health
care to the economy to terrorism," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers this weekend were home campaigning and listening to
voters. The next set of jurors on the case, members of the House
Judiciary Committee charged with deciding whether impeachment
proceedings are warranted, reacted cautiously.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously he did something wrong," said Representative Thomas
Barrett, a Democrat who was appointed to the committee on Friday.
"I want to see what the evidence is with regard to the other
allegations and listen to what the president has to say and then
make a decision as to what is right for the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Representative Steve Rothman, a Democrat said, "I'm not going
to make my decision about whether to impeach the president from
newspaper accounts of documents that I'm eventually going to be
presented."
</P>
<P>
Republicans disagreed with White House arguments there was
nothing worthy of impeachment in the report, but they too were
careful not to predict whether proceedings would begin.
</P>
<P>
"Even those defenders of the president who sought to diminish
the significance of perjury in a civil case have acknowledged that
it's simply unacceptable for a president to lie before a grand
jury," said Representatives Charles Canady, a Republican, another
Judiciary Committee member. "I am reserving judgment on all these
matters."
