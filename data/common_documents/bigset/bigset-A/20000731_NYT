CHANG BEATS INJURED GAMBILL

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Michael Chang was trying ever so hard to appear
the impassive little warrior, consistent in both game and demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not even the often-stolid Chang could keep his whirl of
emotions inside after winning his first tournament title in 21
months Sunday when he captured the Mercedes-Benz Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, tennis' one-time boy wonder who almost had fallen into
the ATP netherworld, was comparing tennis to life in overcoming
obstacles during a postgame interview broadcast throughout the Los
Angeles Tennis Center when the facade crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're down, you have to pick yourself back up ...''
</P>
<P>
   And then his voice cracked and he grew silent, momentarily
overcome and unable to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's emotional for me,'' he said. ``The last couple of years
have been tough.''
</P>
<P>
   So tough that Chang, 28, ranked third in the world at the end of
the 1997 season had fallen as low as No.76 two years later.
</P>
<P>
   So tough that even winning Sunday 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, ret. - when
Jan-Michael Gambill was forced to retire with a sprained ankle
after they split the first two sets - could not abate his
uncharacteristic momentary lapse of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember the last time I was that emotional,'' Chang
said later. ``Maybe the '89 French Open.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be when he won his Grand Slam at age 17, announcing
to all that the world's next great tennis phenom had arrived. Chang
would go on to win 33 ATP titles, but it was almost two years
before he found his way to No. 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty special for me,'' Chang said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mercedes-Benz Cup, Gambill's injury default was a
fitting ending to a frustrating week of no-shows, injuries and
ejections that had all but stripped the tournament of the game's
big names.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill was just back from the losing U.S. Davis Cup effort in
Spain and had been playing non-stop tennis for almost three months.
Tendinitis started bothering his left knee this week, flared up
again in his semifinal victory over Arnaud Clement on Saturday
night, and then grew worse later when he returned to play three
sets of doubles.
</P>
<P>
   He frequently appeared in pain during the early going Sunday,
but his booming serve - he had 16 aces in the two sets - kept him
in the opening set, until it overpowered Chang in the tiebreaker
7-6 (7-2).
</P>
<P>
   In the second set, Chang's consistency began to wear Gambill and
his knee down. Chang was leading 3-2 when he broke Gambill for the
only time all afternoon. With Chang up 5-3 in the set's ninth game,
Gambill was leading 40-15 and threatening to return the service
break, when he went high for an overhead smash.
</P>
<P>
   Chang scrambled and returned brilliantly to win the point, while
Gambill collapsed in front of the net with a right ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was favoring the left leg and just came down on (my right)
wrong,'' Gambill said. ``I heard it pop. I'd never heard anything
in my body pop before.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambill took an injury timeout, had the ankle taped and tried to
return, but was suddenly reduced to an arthritic old man at age 23.
The only weapon he had left was his serve, but Chang held on to
take the second set 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill then limped over to the umpire, and recognizing what all
could already tell, and said he couldn't continue.
</P>
<P>
   Chang had won his first tournament since Shanghai in October of
1998, and back in his old hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to finally be able to break through here in L.A., is
very special,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And even emotional.

   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The pale young girl in the wheelchair was
sobbing uncontrollably, so Nomar Garciaparra came over and gave her
a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone saw it. And the tiny gift was of no consequence
when the Oakland A's went on to beat the Red Sox, 5-2, Sunday
afternoon. But it was a gesture of infinite grace and kindness.
</P>
<P>
   It was something Ted Williams would have done in his prime. In
fact, I'm beginning to wonder about Nomar and Ted. Same
Mexican-American/Southern California heritage. Same .400
flirtation. Same disdain for the media. Same haircuts. Same
affinity for kids _ especially kids who struggle with sickness and
disability.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year-old Amy Giffin has cerebral palsy. So imagine the
bravery it took for her to stand in front of 29,847 fans and sing
our national anthem a cappella before Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   She stood with the aid of a large chrome walker. She hit all the
high notes. After ``our flag was still there,'' the gentle,
supportive Bay Area folk started to applaud and carried her right
through ``the home of the brave.''
</P>
<P>
   Finished with her performance, Amy dissolved into tears and
collapsed into the arms of her mom. Amy's parents helped her into
her wheelchair as fans took their seats and the umpires came out
for the exchange of lineup cards. Relieved it was over, Amy
couldn't stop crying.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams was first to visit Amy from the Sox dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amy's parents were set to steer her wheelchair off the field
when a second voice said, ``Wait, wait, wait.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Nomar,'' said Amy's dad, Marty. ``He came around from
behind us and gave Amy a baseball and said, `Great job.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There are ceremonial first-ball tossers and anthem singers
almost every day and night at every ballpark in the major leagues.
They are easily ignored in the everyday rush to get ready for a
ballgame. Players are stretching, putting resin on bats, arranging
batting gloves and helmets, and lining their pockets with sunflower
seeds. They are required to stand and remove their hats during the
anthem, but no one says they have to acknowledge the performer when
it's over.
</P>
<P>
   This was special. It was a courageous teen, battling a lifelong
affliction (Amy weighed 2 pounds at birth), needing a lift after an
emotional performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous, but once I got out there, I was like, `OK, I
can do this,' '' said Amy. ``Near the end, I didn't realize the
fans were all cheering for me. I was like, `Wait, I'm not done
yet.' Those high notes are brutal. Then people were saying, `Good
job,' and shaking my hand and I kind of blocked out what they were
saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaking his head and smiling after the game, Nomar said, ``She
was good, man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Win or lose, that might have been the most important part of
the day,'' said Williams. ``To see her out there standing with that
roller thing. Then listening to her and seeing what she did
afterward. I think those were tears of happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   The late Tom Dowd, former traveling secretary of the Red Sox,
used to accompany Ted Williams on his countless secret visits to
Children's Hospital in Boston. Offering a description of Williams
and his teammates delivering a ball and chatting up a
cancer-stricken boy, Dowd said, ``In those moments, the kid was
whole again. He was one of them, there with his heroes in a
beautiful world.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the power of fame. Small acts of kindness take on
enormous significance for the recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday afternoon, more than an hour after the
nerve-wracking anthem, Amy was sitting in upper deck section 224
with her parents. In the bottom of the fifth inning _ holding her
autographed baseball _ Amy watched as Garciaparra went deep into
the hole, backhanded a hard-hopper by Randy Velarde, and fired a
125-foot throw to first, beating Velarde by a half step.
Garciaparra's momentum carried him almost to the A's bullpen mound.
It was a sensational play.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not the best thing he did all day.
</P>
<P>
   He may hit .400 this year. He may win the Most Valuable Player
Award and lead the Red Sox to their first World Series victory
since 1918. But nothing Nomar does in 2000 will surpass this small
gesture of kindness, which hardly anybody saw, in a pregame
ceremony in Oakland before the 101st game of the Red Sox' regular
season.

RED SOX, ARROJO WALK THE PLANK

   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Ken Burns could narrate this chapter of
baseball lore. A guy making $11 a month to play baseball in Cuba
defects to the United States and becomes a millionaire major
leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Luis Rolando Arrojo.
</P>
<P>
   Another kid scraps his way out of Chicago, barely makes the
bigs, and hits .219 until Kansas City ships him to Oakland this
spring for a player to be named later and $1.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Salvatore Frank Fasano.
</P>
<P>
   Their journeys brought them 60 feet 6 inches from each other
Sunday, and it was Oakland's dollar-store catcher who spoiled the
millionaire-in-exile's Red Sox debut, as Fasano touched Arrojo for
two home runs, including a grand slam, in Boston's 5-2 loss to the
A's before 29,847 at Network Associates Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   But Fasano's outburst was not all that separated the teams as
they raced for playoff spots. Arrojo, in his first start since the
Sox acquired him last week in a seven-player swap with Colorado,
hurt his cause by issuing three walks before Fasano's slam. And the
Red Sox again mustered only minuscule production while Carl
Everett, their suspended home run and RBI leader, watched from the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are 2-4 with Everett on the sideline. They scored only
three runs in back-to-back losses to the A's after winning the
first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not many games where we don't miss him,'' said
designated hitter Scott Hatteberg, who homered for one of Boston's
two runs Sunday. ``He's huge. I think we can score runs without
him, but it's tough. A lot of the pressure falls on guys who aren't
used to feeling the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Varitek homered for the other Boston run. But the Sox
never waged a serious rally as Oakland's Gil Heredia (13-7) and
three relievers scattered six hits and one walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to win, it has to come from different people,'' Varitek
said. ``Look at what Fasano did for them.'
</P>
<P>
   The unlikeliest of heroes, Fasano is a career .219 hitter who
has never hit more than eight home runs in a season and had a
lifetime batting average against the Sox of .111. What's more, he
had seen Arrojo pitch and wanted no part of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I was so shocked at what happened,'' Fasano said.
``Because when I've seen him pitch, I've thought, `Man, I don't
want to face this guy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But with the bases loaded and two outs in the second inning,
Fasano popped an Arrojo slider for his first career grand slam.
``He was trying to throw a nasty and he made a mistake with it,''
Fasano said. ``It's unfortunate for him, but it's good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The slam was Oakland's 10th of the season, two shy of the major
league record shared by Cleveland and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo was less rueful about the homer than he was the walks
that preceded it. ``He doesn't think he lost with the home run,''
said Pedro Martinez, acting as interpreter for the Spanish-speaking
Arrojo. ``He lost with the three bases on balls he gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   Take away the five walks he issued _ and the two homers by
Fasano _ and Arrojo was all Sox general manager Dan Duquette was
seeking. He allowed only one other hit, a harmless single, and
struck out four in 6 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Relievers Rheal Cormier and Hipolito Pichardo held the A's
hitless the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   But the walks, as they say in Pitching 101, will kill you, as
Jeff Fassero was reminded in Saturday night's 12-1 loss. Pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan noted that eight of the 13 A's who drew walks in
the last two games scored. ``And that's it in a nutshell,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan said before the game he stressed to Arrojo, through
interpreter Rich Garces, the importance of throwing his first
pitches for strikes. He said the A's, who are second in the
American League in drawing walks, swung at the first pitch only
four times Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the whole series, they had only one hit on the 67
first-pitch strikes we threw,'' Kerrigan said. ``It shows they're
not aggressive on the first pitch, and we tried to use that to our
favor, but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. Kerrigan said Arrojo's wildness may have
sprung from being nervous in his first Red Sox start. But Arrojo
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't nervous,'' Martinez said. ``He was probably rushing
a little bit with his mechanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo, an All-Star in 1998 when he was 14-12 with Tampa Bay,
went 0-for-July, winless in five starts with the Rockies and one
for Boston. He is 5-10 overall this year. But he said he was proud
to wear the Red Sox uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt big pitching out there with this team,'' Martinez
said. ``This is a team with a lot of history and it's now his turn
to be part of that history.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox fans are hoping it's a good part.

BELICHICK, PATRIOTS READY TO RAISE CURTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ Perhaps someone should change the name of this
place to Debut City.
</P>
<P>
   With Monday night's Hall of Fame game between the Patriots and
San Francisco 49ers, Dennis Miller and Dan Fouts debut in the ABC
``Monday Night Football'' broadcast booth; Bill Belichick debuts as
Patriots coach and makes his first return to Ohio as a head coach
since being fired by the Cleveland Browns following the 1995
season; the Patriots debut their new uniforms, road whites with
blue pants; and Jeff Garcia debuts as the first No. 1 quarterback
of the 49ers other than Joe Montana and Steve Young in 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the overriding concern of Belichick and 49ers coach Steve
Mariucci is that the game be injury-free. Both teams, which already
are banged up, need only look at Saturday night's Jets-Saints game
for an example of how bad it can get. The Saints likely lost
cornerback Steve Israel (broken leg) and tight end Cam Cleeland
(torn Achilles' tendon) for the season, and safety Rob Kelly
(broken leg) for up to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be a little thin, but we're going to get a good
look at our rookies and rookie free agents and get a very good
evaluation of them,'' Mariucci said Sunday night following the
49ers' walk-through practice at Fawcett Stadium. ``This is going to
be a little different for us because we now have probably the
youngest team in the league. We used to have a lot of veterans, and
sure, any coach would love to have Hall of Famers all over the
field, but that's not what we're faced with.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick was so concerned earlier this week he canceled a
scrimmage against the New York Giants. The concern has been
alleviated slightly because his young, raw offensive linemen have
made steady improvement in practice. But practice is practice. This
is not a ``real'' game, but it's a close facsimile, an exhibition
on national TV in which the players should be motivated to play at
their best.
</P>
<P>
   The pressing questions surround the young offensive line, which
consists of Jason Andersen at left tackle, Derrick Fletcher at left
guard, Damien Woody at center, Adam Davis at right guard, and Greg
Robinson-Randall at right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, who put his team through a one-hour walk-through
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, heaped praise on his young linemen last week. He's
built up Fletcher and Robinson-Randall, both of whom have looked
very poised.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick takes great pride in bringing along young linemen, as
does offensive coordinator Charlie Weis. Last season in New York,
Weis started youngsters Randy Thomas and Jason Fabini. Experienced
defensive linemen will have field days early in the season, as did
the Patriots' Willie McGinest against Fabini in last year's season
opener. The hope is the young linemen develop and eventually win
more battles than they lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis Colts certainly experienced this in 1997, when
they started rookies Aaron Meadows and Tarik Glenn. Now the two
tackles protect their quarterback (Peyton Manning) as well as
anyone. Whether the Patriots' young linemen are as talented as
Meadows and Glenn is still very much in question, and the
exhibition games, particularly when they're up against
first-teamers, will tell how far they have to go.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci will start a defense that will be missing numerous
veterans, including end Anthony Pleasant, left tackle Bryant Young,
right tackle Junior Bryant, left outside linebacker Julian
Peterson, left linebacker Ken Norton Jr., right linebacker Winfred
Tubbs, and strong safety Lance Schulters, all of whom have injury
or practice time concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots backup quarterback Michael Bishop should get a chance
to show his stuff, too. Drew Bledsoe is expected to take only about
a dozen snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my chance to show people what I can do,'' said Bishop,
taken in the seventh round of last year's draft. ``A lot of guys
have been drafted in front of me, but if I get the chance maybe
people will find out that they made a mistake not taking me. I'd
like to prove people wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop is exciting because of his scrambling capabilities, but
he's been more contained in practice this year, looking to pass
first. The Patriots have some Bishop-friendly plays, including some
option plays at the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both teams are in the same boat,'' said Mariucci. ``We're both
trying new players. We both have injury concerns, but I expect a
hard-fought game and hopefully we can put on a good show for the
people who come out here.''

RICE ISN'T LOOKING FOR RESTING PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ Jerry Rice was on the sideline of Fawcett
Stadium, home of the McKinley High School Bulldogs, the Timkin High
School Trojans, and the Glenoak High School Golden Eagles. And Rice
was being mobbed by hundreds and hundreds of fans.
</P>
<P>
   A high school field, yes, but a football field only a large hill
and a hundred yards from the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Rice is
here to play against the Patriots Monday night but his permanent
home in a few years will be down the hillside and in the Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows it.
</P>
<P>
   The thousands of fans who waited and waited late on a Sunday
afternoon, sitting through a torrential thunderstorm to see Rice,
know it. San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci knows it. All football
fans know it. Jerry Rice knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could picture himself in the building across the
way, Rice said, ``You'll never get that out of me. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Rice is 37 and in his 16th year with the 49ers. His limber
body does not look the part but what can't be escaped is that for
the first time in his career, Rice is starting the exhibition
season without Joe Montana or Steve Young throwing him passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big difference not having those guys here,'' Rice said,
``because just having those guys on the field was special for us,
and special for the fans. They're really missed. But I can always
look back at the old times. And I can smile about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without Young or Montana at quarterback, Rice insisted on
playing more football for the 49ers. He wasn't sure how it would
feel when he signed a three-year contract during the offseason, but
now that he's taken the field without Young or Montana, Rice feels
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like a different era,'' said Rice. ``And, you know,
it seems like how Joe stated it in his speech Saturday, that now he
has a new team.'' And that's how Rice feels, that he's still a
member of the 49ers but now he has a new team.
</P>
<P>
   But now that camp has started, his approach has not changed,
said Rice. ``I'm approaching camp the way I've always approached
training camp _ and that is to work hard to make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   That's been a given on the great 49er teams of the past and most
certainly a given on this young, green team that faces a grim, grim
season. San Francisco may be battling New Orleans to escape the
cellar of the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a bunch of young guys here and a couple of older
guys,'' Rice said of his team, ``and we're just out there to try
and win some football games.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, of course, is one of those ``older guys.'' Sixteen years
ago, the Patriots _ among other teams _ passed on drafting the
receiver who had all the huge numbers at little-known Mississippi
Valley State. And if Rice couldn't catch a cold, let alone a pass,
early in his first year with the 49ers, he soon developed into
perhaps the greatest receiver ever.
</P>
<P>
   But Montana was throwing him passes then. And Saturday, Rice
watched on television as Montana was inducted into the Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just enjoying it all, seeing so many people from the
49ers (inducted were former teammates Ronnie Lott and Montana, with
former 49er owner Eddie DeBartolo presenting Montana) and seeing so
many 49er fans. I mean, it was crowded and everybody was really
excited. And it felt really good to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice then turned and began a slow march along the stands of the
high school stadium, signing autograph after autograph, the fans in
a constant chorus of ``Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci was in the middle of the field taking it all in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry loves this, he's good at it, and he deserves it,'' said
the coach. ``Steve (Young) is going in (to the Hall of Fame) next,
just because of the timing, and then Jerry is in. You know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course.
</P>
<P>
   And so do the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Once Rice and the 49ers left the high school field, a couple of
Frisbee-catching dogs entertained the crowd until the Patriots took
the field for their practice. By then, about two-thirds of the fans
had left. They had seen Jerry Rice close to the Pro Football Hall
of Fame, a few years before they'll see him enter it.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci was right. They knew that.

M'S MANUFACTURE VICTORY OVER TORONTO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mariners' attempt to trade for Detroit slugger
Juan Gonzalez came crashing down Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' attempt to win another series, on the other hand,
was a rousing success.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle dipped into its bag of tricks to score 10 runs on just
five hits, getting on base in a manner designed to frustrate and
confound the Blue Jays in a 10-6 win over Toronto. The Mariners
walked 11 times, got hit by a pitch once and turned six of those 12
free trips to first base into runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers and the Mariners talked twice Sunday, and after the
first conversation between Tigers' general manager Randy Smith and
the Mariners' Pat Gillick, the Mariners had reason to believe they
could get a deal done for two-time MVP Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was on solid enough footing that a call went to Class
AAA Tacoma to hold right-handed pitcher Joel Pineiro out of his
scheduled start for the Rainiers last night. But after the second
call, word out of both camps was that the deal had ground to a
halt.
</P>
<P>
   The stumbling block? Gillick said, ``we couldn't come to a
meeting of minds'' with Detroit. From the Tigers' view, however,
the Mariners' reluctance to part with any of Seattle's best talent
torpedoed the trade.
</P>
<P>
   From the first, the Tigers were told that pitchers Freddy
Garcia, Gil Meche and Ryan Anderson were not tradable. When Detroit
asked about infielder Carlos Guillen, the Mariners said he wasn't
available.
</P>
<P>
   Gillick wouldn't move and Smith said he needed more to justify
the trade of Gonzalez. End of deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You listen to what they say, but they've got to give up what
we think is good value,'' Smith said. ``I don't anticipate talking
to them again (about Gonzalez).''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's five-hit game underscored why the Mariners feel they
needed a Gonzalez-type slugger. But it also underscored why the
Mariners are in first place in the West, four games in front. The
Mariners worked their way on base with patience and guile, then
manufactured runs without big hits.
</P>
<P>
   True, Jay Buhner had a huge two-run homer in the third and Alex
Rodriguez had a solo shot in the fifth, but the Mariners got one
run home on an infield out, one on an error and two on sacrifice
flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first number on the scoreboard (runs) is the only one that
counts,'' center fielder Mike Cameron said. ``Look at us. We always
have a lot of guys on base. Baseball is about what you do with men
in scoring position, and we are patient. We almost always have lots
of men on base.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron has walked 47 times, including once Sunday. On the Blue
Jays, that would be good for third on the team, behind the Jays'
No. 2 walks man, Jose Cruz Jr. On the Mariners, however, there are
five players with more walks than Cameron _ John Olerud (77), Alex
Rodriguez (62), Mark McLemore (61), Edgar Martinez (57) and Jay
Buhner (51).
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't even count Rickey Henderson, No. 2 on the
all-time walks list with 2,032, including a Mariners-record-tying
five Sunday. Henderson has 35 for Seattle, but he had 24 with the
Mets before joining Seattle, so he has 59.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have five or six guys drawing all those walks, it
starts to add up,'' Cameron said. ``All you need then is a couple
of big hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner's was the biggest on this day, coming at the end of a
five-run third. David Bell was hit by a pitch and Henderson had
drawn the second of his walks to open the inning. With one out,
Toronto left fielder Rob Ducey dropped the ball on what would have
been a nice running catch of a Rodriguez fly ball near the line.
That scored one run. Edgar Martinez made it 2-0 with a single and
Olerud's grounder made it 3-0 before Buhner crushed his 19th homer
to deep left.
</P>
<P>
   Three more walks in the seventh loaded the bases and chased
Toronto starter Kelvim Escobar. Olerud delivered an opposite field
double, slipping the ball past third baseman Tony Batista for two
more runs in what would be a three-run inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about patience at the plate,'' manager Lou Piniella
said. ``We've shown that we have that.''
</P>
<P>
   They have the wins to prove it.

WHO NEEDS JUAN? BUHNER'S A STEADY POWER SOURCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jay Buhner and the citizens of Marinerville had barely
come down off the high of Buhner's 300th career homer last Tuesday
when Old Man Bone launched another one Sunday _ No. 19 in a season
he didn't expect to be this darn good.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Buhner was a dairy farmer in a former life. He's been
cranking at the creamery called Safeco lately.
</P>
<P>
   Creamin' 'em: That's the kind of stroke Buhner said he used the
other day after he took A's closer Jason Isringhausen deep,
crushing a 98-mph fastball to become 86th on baseball's all-time
homer list.
</P>
<P>
   It was an epic accomplishment for one of Seattle's most beloved
stars _ a 36-year-old Texan-turned-Northwesterner who has fought
off bum elbows, shoulders, hamstrings and ankles to return to
steady action this season.
</P>
<P>
   If this is a curtain call, Buhner has hardly lost his sense of
the dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if the shackles of achieving this significant career
milestone had come flying off, Buhner rocketed another longball
Sunday, crushing a two-run homer in the third inning to help lead
the Mariners to a 10-5 victory over the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Just when talk of how much the Mariners need some added punch in
the lineup heats up, Buhner ramps up his power stick, fanning the
flames of love and loyalty for the bald-headed man who is now the
longest-tenured Mariner outside of Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The power surge made it a little more ironic that a
rent-a-player outfielder whose services were sought and discussed
by the Mariners Sunday was none other than Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   If we scoffed at talk of bringing back David Segui or wondered
about the Royals' willingness to deal Johnny Damon, the name Juan
Gonzalez is enough to inspire.
</P>
<P>
   What price the Mariners are willing to pay for Gonzalez _ or
anyone else still on the block _ remains to be seen, but at least
Buhner knew his price.
</P>
<P>
   The M's and Tigers talked twice Sunday about Gonzalez. By the
time the Mariners had beaten Toronto and were back in their
clubhouse, relaxing and waiting and watching rumors fly on TV,
Buhner had made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not giving him my number, I'll tell you that. I'll give
him some playing time but not the number. They'll have to release
me if they promise him that,'' Buhner said.
</P>
<P>
   The right fielder who wears No. 19 and who has become a Seattle
institution in the 12 years he has played here was at ground zero
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner had to compute the ramifications of the M's possibly
adding another high profile right fielder who wears No. 19 and who
has spent productive seasons winning division titles in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things that could be done, I suppose. I know
Rickey (Henderson) bought his number off Turner Ward when he was
traded to the Blue Jays. Rickey bought him a Rolex. I don't need a
Rolex. A fishing boat, maybe. A 22-footer. But I'm not giving him
the number.''
</P>
<P>
   In the trade game, which ends this afternoon when major league
baseball declares its deadline at 1 p.m. PST Monday, there are
always hitches.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of number swapping are usually minor details,
which Buhner understands and which is why he could afford to
chuckle _ not that he wasn't serious about denying Gonzalez any
access to the beloved No. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater importance, though, is how much fleecing the Mariners
are willing to have done to them in order to bring in a big bopper
like Juan Gone and how will such a move impact the team.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner said he found it curious that the Mets were able to bring
in guys like Bubba Trammell, Rick White and Mike Bordick in a hurry
this weekend while all around baseball, general managers in places
like Kansas City and Detroit are trying to hold up the Mariners for
a fleet of pitching prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it has to do with the way the Mariners used to trade away
talent to get some hired help for the stretch drive, Buhner
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you wonder sometimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, with Pat Gillick calling the shots, the feeling
throughout the Mariners clubhouse is that if a big deal gets done
before tonight's game against the Red Sox, it's going to be for the
right part, for the right reasons, without selling off everyone
named Ryan Anderson, Gil Meche and Carlos Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   For Buhner, there was a twist of fate in all the talk Sunday
about Gonzalez. In his final year or so of action, Buhner would
like to ride all the way to the World Series. What a way to go out,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   If it means that it comes at the expense of his ability to
contribute, Buhner is OK with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to accept it. I don't have to like it. But if it comes
to that, I'll accept. It will never come to be a cancer in the
clubhouse. It would never be like that. I think I'll get my playing
time and have a good season. I'll do whatever it takes for us to
win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He'll share his position. He'll share his spotlight. The number
is non-negiotiable.

 NEW TECHNIQUES MEAN LESS RADIATION FOR CANCER PATIENTS  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Marybelle Riley sat in the hospital waiting room
making small talk, with a patch over one eye _ the one caught in
the grip of a virulent tumor that clutched at her optic nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cancer is way up under here,'' said Riley, 89, brushing
her lower left eyelid.
</P>
<P>
   In a lead-lined room down the hall, technicians prepped the
computer-driven linear accelerator that would soon travel in a wide
arc over Riley's body. Along that path, it would emit hundreds of
high-energy X-ray bursts of varying intensity, following a firing
pattern calculated to disintegrate the tumor without damaging the
eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be 90 in September,'' Riley said. ``I want to live and I
want to have my sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley has a fighting chance of getting both wishes, thanks to
the convergence of several advances _ including new ways to
pinpoint tumors, more precise X-ray guns, and computer-driven
treatment plans _ that enable radiation therapists to bombard
cancers while they tiptoe around sensitive nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can now put higher doses of radiation into tumors than ever
before, and cut way down on the dose that hits the tissues you
don't want to affect,'' said Dr. Theodore Phillips, a radiation
oncologist at the University of California at San Francisco, where
Riley is being treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using it in many locations,'' Phillips said. ``Head and
neck, prostate, lung, everywhere you have normal tissue that you
want to protect close to the tumor.''
</P>
<P>
   This new technique, called Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy
(IMRT), has moved from the experimental stage into clinical
practice in the past few years. But the procedure's high price and
complexity have made IMRT relatively rare in hospitals and not well
understood even among cancer professionals.
</P>
<P>
   IMRT will be discussed this week, when 2,700 cancer specialists
assemble in San Francisco for the annual meeting of the American
Head and Neck Society.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer fighters are a specialized breed. In addition to having
tumor specialties, such as head and neck, they take different
treatment approaches. Surgeons cut out tumors. Radiation
oncologists blast them with X-rays. Medical oncologists poison them
with chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, all three techniques are used in combination, but
a certain lack of understanding remains among experts in the three
approaches. Dr. Jesus Medina, a cancer surgeon and president of the
Head and Neck Society, said a seminar tomorrow morning will help
explain the new radiation therapies to practitioners of the other
cancer-fighting arts.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding state-of-the-art radiation therapy is complicated
by the fact that the advances are not the result a single
breakthrough, but the convergence of several developments,
beginning with some astonishing improvements in imaging
technologies that peer under the skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new imaging technologies allow us to distinguish the
normal tissues from the cancer cells with a precision that wasn't
possible even a few years ago,'' said Geoffrey Dalbow, a physicist
with Varian Medical Systems in Palo Alto, Calif., a leader in
radiation oncology systems.
</P>
<P>
   Dalbow said radiation oncologists use an array of imaging
techniques to get several different views of the tumor. Then they
assemble these data, using software programs, into a treatment plan
that drives the radiation gun.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dalbow, these images typically include CT or MRI
scans, which lay out the basic position of the organs inside the
body, showing the location of sensitive tissues in relation to the
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   To get a more precise fix on the tumor, physicians rely on
several technologies, including MRS scans. An MRS scan is a variant
of an MRI. Scientists have shown that certain molecules are found
in higher concentrations in cancer cells. MRS instruments detect
the magnetic signature of these molecules, and plot areas of
concentration, which equate with cancer hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   Other imaging systems are used to double-check tumor locations.
Because cancer cells are constantly growing and dividing, they
consume more of the body's basic fuel, glucose, than normal cells.
</P>
<P>
   To get a better understanding of the malignant tumor, cancer
specialists give patients a small dose of radioactive glucose and
measure which cells absorb the most of this nutrient. A technology
called SPECT detects the irradiated sugar. High concentrations
indicate tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   With these imaging clues, radiation oncologists draw a tumor
target area, and decide how large a dose of radiation will be
needed to kill or control the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   These targeting techniques would be useless, however, were it
not for innovations that have improved the accuracy of radiation
guns, and allowed these instruments to be controlled by computer
programs that can plot and execute firing sequences of astonishing
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Carol, a San Francisco
neurosurgeon-turned-entrepreneur, played a central role in these
advances in the early 1990s. By the time Carol entered the picture,
radiation guns had evolved into powerful instruments, which could
travel over the patient, delivering high-energy X-rays from
different angles.
</P>
<P>
   This swiveling feature was a big innovation because of the way
X-rays kill cancer. As the beams plow through the patient, they
break the DNA of any cell that is about to divide, killing it in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation treatment is particularly deadly to cancerous cells
because they are constantly dividing.
</P>
<P>
   However, X-rays are indiscriminate. They also kill fast-dividing
normal tissues such as stomach or skin cells. So hitting the cancer
from different angles lessens the damage to innocent cells that
happen to be in the path of the beam.
</P>
<P>
   Carol, who pioneered the IMRT technique, saw what was needed to
improve the previous generation of radiation therapy. There had to
be a way to modulate the intensity of the radiation beam. The
radiation guns of early '90s vintage had only two settings: off or
full-bore. They could not be controlled like a stove, which can be
turned up to boil water, but turned down low to melt butter.
</P>
<P>
   To solve this problem, Carol founded a company called Nomos
Corp., which came up an ingenious system that did two things:
First, it modulated the intensity of the radiation beam and, more
importantly, created a software program that made full use of the
modulation capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carol, by the early 1990s, radiation sources
already were routinely equipped with special lead shutters that
controlled the shape of the beam to conform to the shape of the
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Nomos, which is based in Pennsylvania, adapted the shutter to a
new purpose. The company devised a way to open and close the
shutter rapidly. A longer shutter opening meant more radiation, a
brief opening meant a lower dose. In effect, Nomos created a switch
to control intensity.
</P>
<P>
   But the real genius of the system lay in the software Nomos
wrote to marry this intensity control to the targeting data, thus
creating a firing pattern that delivers maximum radiation to the
tumor while minimizing damage to innocent cells.
</P>
<P>
   The software involved some phenomenal calculations at the
crossroads of geometry and biology.
</P>
<P>
   The geometric component was the arc of the radiation gun as it
traveled over the patient. The biological variables were the types
of organs between the X-ray source and the tumor. Doctors have a
good idea how much radiation it takes to kill a tumor. They also
know how much radiation different types of healthy cells can absorb
before they suffer unacceptable harm.
</P>
<P>
   The program's job was to pick out the optimal path, ordering
long shutter openings when the imaging data showed the tumor
shielded by dense bone _ which can absorb more radiation without
undue damage. On the other hand, the program would close the
shutter when the X-ray gun passed over a sensitive spot such as
Marybelle Riley's eye.
</P>
<P>
   The program generated a firing pattern, which is loaded onto a
floppy disk, that could control the radiation gun the way a
perforated music sheet runs a player piano.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation oncologists who have used IMRT technology _ which is
new, expensive and rare _ say the results are worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Hoppe, chairman of the radiation oncology department
at Stanford University, said patients benefit from fewer side
effects. Treating head and neck cancers with radiation often means
killing saliva glands, and causing side-effects such as loss of
taste and tooth decay.
</P>
<P>
   ``With IMRT, you can reduce the dose to the salivary glands,
avoiding these complications,'' Hoppe said.
</P>
<P>
   A scientific paper written by cancer researchers Michael
Zelefsky and Steven Leibel of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital
also suggests IMRT can improve cure rates, by allowing radiation
oncologists to give higher doses to tumors in sensitive spots _
such as the prostate _ with fewer side effects than conventional
therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Since Nomos brought its system through the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval process in the mid-1990s, similar systems
have appeared. Some are third-party programs that work with the
radiation guns produced by the Big Three X-ray firms: Varian
Medical in Palo Alto; Siemens Medical Systems in Walnut Creek,
Calif., which is a division of a German multinational; and Elekta,
a Swedish firm. Varian has also developed its own software system
that runs with its own, as well as with competing, X-ray guns.
</P>
<P>
   IMRT systems aren't cheap. If a hospital has a modern radiation
device, it might cost $300,000 to $500,000 to add the IMRT system.
The price tag on the latest X-ray source along with an IMRT package
could be $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the few dozen IMRT systems used in medical practice are
found mainly in leading-edge medical centers such as UCSF and
Stanford. But financial analyst James Terwilliger, with the Houston
investment bank of Sanders Morris Harris, predicts cancer centers
at most hospitals will buy IMRT systems because radiation therapy _
which can cost $35,000 _ is a profit center and the hospitals won't
want to see patients go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was a drug, it would be a multibillion-dollar
blockbuster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At UCSF, meanwhile, Marybelle Riley lay perfectly still as the
radiation gun passed overhead, making a sound like chattering teeth
as the lead shutters quickly opened and shut, opened and shut,
hundreds of times, under orders from the computer-driven treatment
plan.
</P>
<P>
   When the chattering stopped, members of the medical team helped
the elderly patient get ready for the ride home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to work out,'' Riley said, as a home health nurse
wheeled her down the hall. ``I know it is.''

 BIOSCOPE: HUMAN CLONING COULD BE JUST AROUND THE CORNER  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Most people think of cloning as the production
of carbon-copy creatures, a practice that might be acceptable when
it comes to making sheep, but morally suspect when it comes to
making babies.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Eibert, an attorney and cloning advocate in Half Moon Bay,
thinks most people are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Cloning, says Eibert, isn't about churning out another copy of
you, me or him. In the world according to Eibert, such a mistaken
view assumes that people are completely, or mainly, the product of
their genes, and ignores the huge role the environment plays in
shaping the person. Genes nonwithstanding, the kid raised on
``Beavis and Butthead'' will have a whole different outlook than
the child spawned on ``Leave it to Beaver.''
</P>
<P>
   Correcting ``misconceptions'' about cloning is important to
Eibert, who believes this technology offers thousands of infertile
people _ folks who may have tried in vitro fertilization techniques
and failed _ one last hope for producing a child that is
biologically theirs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one has cloned a human, at least no one has taken
credit for it. Even so, shortly after Dolly the sheep was cloned,
President Clinton issued an executive order banning the use of
federal funds for human cloning research.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's edict does not prevent any private entity from
bankrolling such experiments. California and a handful of other
states stepped in to plug this perceived loophole by passing laws
that make human cloning experiments, even by private parties,
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Eibert, who is mulling a legal challenge to the California law,
first contacted me in January after I wrote about the state
advisory panel that has been asked to recommend whether the ban
should be extended or be allowed to expire in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   He recently sent me a 30-page manifesto laying out his case. It
sat on my desk for a while, until I picked it up and began reading
_ and couldn't put it down. I'm not sure I swallow his arguments,
but he presents a provocative case that deserves to be heard in the
court of public opinion, if not in a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Eibert considers the cloning ban unconstitutional,
because the state has no right to prohibit a technology that would
allow a person to have a child. He views infertility as a
disability, according to the definitions of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, the cloning ban unconstitutionally prevents a
minority _ infertile people who have failed to benefit from
assisted reproduction technology _ from using a technique that
might ``cure'' their affliction.
</P>
<P>
   Eibert, 44, compares today's attitudes toward cloning with the
suspicion that greeted the birth of the first test-tube baby in
1978. Over time, he says, public opinion has accepted the use of a
wide array of assisted reproduction techniques so that infertile
people can bear children who are their genetic offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But, Eibert argues, the current techniques fail more than half
the time, because they still require the couple to produce a viable
egg and sperm. If one or the other can't deliver, the procedure
ends in disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   And we're not talking about a mere handful of folks, he says.
According to his estimates, upwards of 500,000 Californians fall
into this affected class of infertile persons who cannot have a
child by any current means.
</P>
<P>
   Eibert says cloning has technical advantages that might give
these people an alternative. Although the technique hasn't yet been
proven on humans, we know from animal work that the first
prerequisite for cloning is a viable egg.
</P>
<P>
   If the woman involved in the cloning can't produce a good egg, a
donor egg would be fine because the nucleus of that egg can be
removed and replaced with the nucleus of some cell _ any cell _ of
the person seeking to reproduce by cloning.
</P>
<P>
   This altered egg must then be prompted to develop into an
embryo, and transplanted into any woman who will bear the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes cloning so revolutionary as an infertility
treatment is that it does not require the patient to produce viable
eggs or viable sperm,'' Eibert says. ``It's the only infertility
treatment that should work for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else I may think of Eibert's views, that last assertion
seems, at best, only half true. To begin with, for some people who
can't have a child without assistance, the difficulty lies in the
womb. Although fertilization may occur normally, a chemical
imbalance can dislodge the developing embryo and prevent a woman
from bringing the child to term.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those whose infertility is caused by the unviable sperm
or egg scenario, it seems to me only half of those folks would walk
away from a cloning event with a child that inherited their genes.
</P>
<P>
   You see, there's only room in that donor egg for one nucleus. A
couple making a clone would have to choose whose DNA gets to make
their child.
</P>
<P>
   I can hear the discussion now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my womb.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's flip a coin.''
</P>
<P>
   Eibert is probably right when he suggests that, whatever you or
I may think about the morality of human cloning, it's just a matter
of time before the first human clone emerges from the womb. New
animals are being cloned all the time, extending our skill at the
process.
</P>
<P>
   As Eibert says: ``I have met infertile physicians, infertile
scientists and infertile biotech executives who have a huge
personal stake in seeing cloning technology developed, and who
already possess the training and skills and resources necessary to
make cloning a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the potential for human cloning will force us to
question whether sexual reproduction should be the only way to
produce a child. I'm speaking now of sex from a biological
perspective, the trading of genes and swapping of traits that
occurs when egg and sperm do their molecular tango.
</P>
<P>
   Cloning would allow the willing parent or parents to make the
birth dance a molecular solo, so long as they had a donor egg, a
willing womb and an assist from biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm relatively certain that some profound evolutionary
advantage gave rise to sexual reproduction in the first place.
Otherwise the birds and the bees would still duplicate by division
like the amoeba.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm also aware that the old verities no longer serve many in
our modern society. Eibert mentions the infertile as one group that
might benefit from cloning. Gays and singles are others who might
see asexual reproduction through cloning as a chance to achieve
biological parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes may seem frightening. On the way into work the
other day I saw a bumper sticker that took a swipe at gay marriage.
``God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   I got news for the driver. God ain't necessarily in charge of
marriage any more. But if it's any small consolation, it would seem
Darwin's losing his grip on making babies.
</P>
<P>

ANGELS TRADE BOTTENFIELD FOR GANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels traded pitcher Kent
Bottenfield to the Phillies for outfielder/designated hitter Ron
Gant and cash Sunday, and in the process proclaimed that the club's
future is now.
</P>
<P>
   Trading the veteran Bottenfield, 31, means the Angels must rely
even more on their group of young starters in this season's pennant
race, a risk general manager Bill Stoneman and manager Mike
Scioscia believe is worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottenfield was a guy who showed the way for a lot of our
younger starters,'' Stoneman said. ``And now it's time for those
younger guys to step up. We've had a lot of faith in those guys all
year, and maybe this is a way of demonstrating that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Scioscia: ``These guys are not young in the sense of the
poise they've shown or productivity. There are unique circumstances
that led up to this. Usually, a club in the race is looking for
pitching. But it's a situation where the young guys have done so
well, we had a spare part. And we were able to trade it for
something we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk was one the Angels think they needed to make because of
the lack of production coming from the DH spot and off the bench
from the right side. Gant, 35, hit .254 with 20 homers and 38 RBI
for the Phillies this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing in a right-handed power hitter that is
experienced and capable,'' Stoneman said. ``He's been in a pennant
race before and had success in these situations. And he's had a lot
of success this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Scioscia: ``It gives us a veteran bat. He's a guy who
still has an explosive bat. He's very productive and is proven.''
</P>
<P>
   The group of young starters - Jarrod Washburn (25), Seth
Etherton (23), Scott Schoeneweis (26), Brian Cooper (25) and Ramon
Ortiz (24) have combined to go 23-15 with a 4.85 ERA (the American
League composite ERA is 4.98).
</P>
<P>
   Washburn is on the disabled list with a strained biceps muscle,
and Ortiz is at Triple-A Edmonton. Ken Hill is the only pitcher in
the rotation with significant experience, but the club also has
Kent Mercker set to begin a rehab assignment today and will start
him if they need to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it means they're giving us the ball,'' Washburn said.
``I love that they have that confidence in us. They know we can
pitch and we've got the stuff. It's a great vote of confidence for
them to say, basically, `you're our guys.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield was acquired by the Angels, along with second
baseman Adam Kennedy, in a trade with the Cardinals for Jim Edmonds
on March 23. But after winning 18 games last season, Bottenfield
was a disappointment this year, going 7-8 with a 5.71 ERA in 21
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stay here,'' Bottenfield said. ``But I knew about
a week ago I wasn't going to be here. I've been in the game a long
time, 15 years. When you've been around that long you know people
around the league and get a good sense of what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield said he believes he would have been traded even if
here were 10-2, and not 7-8, because the team is committed to the
young pitchers and didn't plan to re-sign him next season. He added
that he believes good things are ahead for this year's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``With or without me, they're going to be in the playoffs,'' he
said. ``Because this team does not give up. ... I hope they win.
I'm not going to be looking in the papers saying, `Ha, ha, you
shouldn't have traded me' if they lose a game. I hope they win the
division.''
</P>
<P>
   Gant, like Bottenfield, is eligible for free agency at the end
of the season. He is making $5.04 million this season, $3 million
of which is being paid by the Cardinals, for whom Gant played
before joining the Phillies. The Phillies were responsible for the
other $2 million, which included about $700,000 owed for the rest
of this season. The Phillies have agreed to pay the Angels a
portion of the $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gant will join the Angels in Anaheim today and start against the
Tigers. He started most of the games with the Phillies hitting No.
2 in the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to take on any role,'' Gant said. ``My bat will
complement their left-hand hitters.''

FOR NOW, ANGELS WILL STICK WITH FOUR-MAN ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ With the trade of Kent Bottenfield, the
Anaheim Angels are down to a four-man starting rotation of Seth
Etherton, Ken Hill, Scott Schoeneweis and Brian Cooper. Because of
an off-day next Thursday, they won't need a fifth start until Aug.
8.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Jarrod Washburn will be eligible to come off the
disabled list to start that game against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn's return could mean the end of Edgard Clemente's place
on the team, if it doesn't happen sooner. Clemente's role will be
filled by Ron Gant, who will join the team today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgard is still a part of this club,'' manager Mike Scioscia
said, even though the team is believed to be trying to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   In 44 games as a reserve outfielder/DH, Clemente is hitting .218
with no homers, five RBI, 27 strikeouts and no walks in 78 at-bats.
The Angels can't send him to the minors without first having him
clear waivers because he is out of options.
</P>
<P>
   A sure sign that Scioscia has lost faith in Clemente is that he
has used Benji Gil as the DH the past two games with an opposing
left-hander on the mound. Clemente, the nephew of Hall of Famer
Roberto Clemente, was acquired during spring training from the
Rockies for minor-leaguers Norm Hutchins and Jason Dewey.
</P>
<P>
   The journeyman: Bottenfield learned of the trade early Sunday
morning, but he was still in the clubhouse mingling with his
ex-teammates and saying his goodbyes until gametime. Having been
dealt to the Angels from- the Cardinals on March 23, Bottenfield
will be joining his third team the Phillies - in a four-month span.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little different leaving here because I was only here
four months, as opposed to a couple of years,'' he said. ``But I
was starting to build relationships with these guys. If this
happened a year from now, it would be extremely difficult. As it
is, it's hard. I respect these guys here very much. By no means is
it easy. I hope they do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield was well-respected in the clubhouse by the other
players, particularly the other pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to lose a guy like Bottenfield, he's a great
clubhouse guy,'' closer Troy Percival said. ``He sucks up a lot of
innings, and as a reliever, you like a guy who sucks up a lot of
innings. But we had a chance to do something to get better. And I
think this makes us a better team.''

BATTLE OF AGES MOVES TO TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
 GYMNASTICS CHAMPIONSHIP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It was a showdown between those who can belly up to
the bar and those who need fake IDs. ``A beautiful battle of the
two generations,'' US women's gymnastics team coordinator Bela
Karolyi exulted.
</P>
<P>
   On one side were the Atlanta veterans _ Amy Chow, Dominique
Moceanu (an old 18), Dominique Dawes. On the other were the China
survivors _ Elise Ray, Kristen Maloney, Jamie Dantzscher, Vanessa
Atler. The 20s vs. the teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The younger generation prevailed this time,'' Karolyi declared
Saturday night, after Ray et al. swept the top five places at the
US Gymnastics Championships at the Kiel Center. ``But it was one of
the most disputed championships in many, many years. So don't think
there won't be some surprises next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the surprises at the Olympic trials, which will be held
Aug. 17-20 at the FleetCenter in Boston, likely will come in the
back room, where Karolyi and three other selectors will choose half
of the six-member team for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The top two seem set _ Ray, the new champion, and Maloney, who
had won the last two US all-around titles. After that, it's a
scramble among Dantzscher, Atler, Alyssa Beckerman, Chow, and
Morgan White, who were all within half a point here. Not to mention
Moceanu and Dawes, who shook off enough gold dust to place a
creditable eighth and ninth, respectively, and easily make the
12-woman cut for the trials.
</P>
<P>
   The rogue variable is Shannon Miller, who, like Dawes, is trying
for a third Olympic team at 23. Though she withdrew here after the
prelims to avoid jeopardizing the shinbone she cracked at the
beginning of the month, Miller is seeking an injury waiver into the
trials (as is Magnificent Seven teammate Jaycie Phelps).
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see Shannon coming back to claim her place
like she could, she should, and I think she will,'' said Karolyi.
``But I have to tell you, it will not be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who didn't get back into the gym until December,
competed in only a token bars routine here, just to show federation
officials that she still knew how to put on a leotard. To get a
ticket to Boston, she'll need to prove she can handle all four
events at a special show-me session at Karolyi's Houston ranch
several days before the trials.
</P>
<P>
   If she can get anywhere close to the form that won her seven
Olympic medals, Miller will probably land one of the specialist
spots, if only to get her marquee name, her maturity, and her
stability onto a team that lacks all three.
</P>
<P>
   Though the younger generation ruled here, their last world-level
appearance was a wobbly sixth at last year's global meet in
Tianjin. ``I did not see them in China,'' said Karolyi, ``but it
was a big difference here.''
</P>
<P>
   The US males, also sixth in China, have no golden oldies to
bring back _ only three of the Atlanta veterans returned. One of
them, Chainey Umphrey, finished 30th in his first nationals since
1997. Another, four-time champ John Roethlisberger, was delighted
to place as high as fifth after falling off the pommel horse and
taking an 8.75 on floor.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves five-time titlist Blaine Wilson, who is so far above
the field that he's already been guaranteed a ticket to Sydney no
matter what he does at the trials. Wilson could win a couple of
medals at Olympus _ he missed the bronze in the world all-around by
a thousandth of a point. All he needs is a team around him.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Townsend, who gave Wilson a spirited go here until he fell
off the horse, looks solid for one spot. So does 17-year-old Paul
Hamm, the best natural talent since Wilson came on the scene seven
years ago. So does world-teamer Stephen McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Had Jason Gatson made it back from the blown-out knee he
suffered at last year's nationals (he was a gutsy 18th here), coach
Peter Kormann would have had another solid block to build on.
Instead, he and the selection committee will have to play
mix-and-match, fiddling with computers and calculators to choose
the final two members of the team. ``If you don't want to be
handpicked,'' Wilson said, ``better finish in the top four.''
</P>
<P>
   Handpicking means closed doors and politics and, invariably,
yelps of protest from those passed over. ``We won't have
controversy,'' insisted Karolyi. ``Or we won't have more
controversy than ever. There will always be some crying, some
praising, some bitching, some moaning. That's the sport.''

CELTICS TRY TO GET POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Unable to broker a sign-and-trade deal and left holding
two exception-level salaries, the Celtics shifted their focus over
the weekend from shooting guard to point guard.
</P>
<P>
   By all indications, sought-after shooting guards Tariq
Abdul-Wahad, Ron Mercer, and Derek Anderson are not within Boston's
reach. By all estimations, backup point guard candidates Bimbo
Coles, Randy Brown, and Jacque Vaughn could fall into the exception
category. At least, that's what Celtics deal-makers hope.
</P>
<P>
   Testing the marketplace with salary slots of only $2.25 million
and $1.2 million available, Boston coach Rick Pitino and general
manager Chris Wallace could not afford the players they wanted
most. Left to the whims of teams with cap room, the Celtics came
frustratingly close to pulling off a deal. With teams allowed to
make deals with free agents official Tuesday, Boston appears to be
restructuring its priorities, entering a phase of the free agency
period that it will have more control over and that will likely
lead to a signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have any direction as far as 2-guards are
concerned,'' said Pitino. ``When the Clippers fell off (a three-way
deal with the Celtics and Nuggets), we felt (Abdul-Wahad) was going
to Denver at that point. We're looking at Ron Mercer, but we
thought he'd go to Chicago. (Anderson) would have to be a
sign-and-trade because we don't have anything to offer Derek and it
doesn't look like the Clippers want to do anything with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably, right now, we're heading in a different direction,
looking at backup point guards and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Wallace: ``Almost all the point guards have always been
exception-level players from day one. Cap room has not really been
allocated for point guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Making them good targets for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino worked out Vaughn on the West Coast. Wallace gave Brown
the grand tour of Boston last Friday. And Coles enjoyed a round of
golf and dinner with Celtics personnel during the Shaw's Pro Summer
League.
</P>
<P>
   In his third season with Utah, Vaughn played in 78 games last
year, averaging 11.3 minutes per game, 1.6 assists, and 3.7 points.
According to Wallace, the young point guard served an
``apprenticeship'' with the Jazz, learning from veteran John
Stockton and playing behind Boston College product Howard Eisley.
Before heading to Salt Lake City, Vaughn played with Celtic forward
Paul Pierce for two seasons at Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Competing for the Bulls last season, Brown came back from minor
arthroscopic surgery on both ankles and worked through a case of
turf toe. He played in 59 games (starting 55) and averaged 27.5
minutes, 2.4 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 6.4 points per game. He can
provide a tough, energetic presence and can draw on his
championship experience (1996-98) with Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Coles can offer the Celtics versatility. He has played both
point guard and shooting guard over a 10-year NBA career. Last
season with Atlanta, he played 80 games (54 starts) and averaged
24.1 minutes, 2.2 rebounds, 3.6 assists, and 8.1 points. He may be
the Celtics' most intriguing exception-level option.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bimbo left Boston after his visit there, he was extremely
impressed with them,'' said his agent, Sean Holley. ``In fact, to
the point of had they made a firm (midlevel) offer at that time,
this all probably would've been over. That's not to say we're
disappointed or anything of that nature.''
</P>
<P>
   And Coles has no reason to be disappointed. There is a long list
of teams interested in his services, including Atlanta, Cleveland,
Miami, Milwaukee, Orlando, Portland, and Utah. He has received at
least one midlevel exception offer. He started his career with
Miami and returned for a recruiting visit last Saturday. In the
next couple of days, Coles will make his way to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not so concerned about starting,'' said Holley. ``He's
willing to let that be the coach's problem, with regards to why he
shouldn't be on the court. He's going to do whatever he can to make
that a difficult decision. He's not looking to go to teams to be a
starter. He wants to go to a strong team that has potential to do
something. If it's not a playoff team, a team that certainly has
the potential to be in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics should appreciate the optimism, considering Boston
remains high on Coles's long list of suitors. Whether or not Coles
wears a green-and-white uniform next season, Wallace expects
``sometime between Tuesday and Thursday an awful lot of this
business will be done.''

`BIG MAMA' GIVES MLS MARKETING SPARK 
</HEADLINE>
 ALL-STAR GAME-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ A 6-foot-4-inch, orange-haired striker
nicknamed ``Big Mama'' made the MLS marketing department's job a
lot easier. Mamadou Diallo stole the show in an otherwise
superfluous event called the All-Star game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the talk during the week foused on determining expansion
cities (Long Island and Philadelphia in 2002) and building new
stadia (Los Angeles, New Jersey). But the lifeblood of professional
sports _ star players _ cannot be manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   And Diallo proved he is that special kind of performer.
Actually, Diallo has been proving that all season. He scored 16
goals in the first 16 games for the Tampa Bay Mutiny and leads
Major League Soccer with 18 goals.
</P>
<P>
   In the All-Star game, Diallo _ coming in after halftime _
displayed agility and speed, an excellent touch, and lethal
finishing instincts. Considering that Diallo was also the biggest
player on the field (along with Chicago goalkeeper Zach Thornton),
it seems safe to say the MLS has a larger-than-life attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The only doubt the MLS has had about featuring Diallo was
specious _ English is his third language, after Wolof and French.
But should Diallo never utter another bon mot, the publicity
campaign should suffice with images of him touching the ball past
Kansas City's Peter Vermes, accelerating around Colorado's Marcelo
Balboa, teasing Thornton by dancing past on a step-over move near
the end line.
</P>
<P>
   The best players' personalities are exhibited through their
style of play and Diallo has plenty of personality.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo showed a good understanding of the frivilousness and
seriousness of the All-Star game, accepting the most valuable
player trophy and, in a booming baritone voice, telling the Crew
Stadium crowd:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Big Mama. And Big Mama controls the field and scores
goals. That is what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   That combination of serenity, simplicity, and sincerity
outstripped all the nicely polished speeches of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Diallo, 28, has the single-minded mentality of a
goal-scorer. Before this season, Diallo had 78 goals in 120 matches
for MSV Duisburg (Germany), Lillestrom and Valarenga (Norway), St.
Gallen (Switzerland), and Zeytenburu (Turkey), plus 21 goals in 46
games for Senegal's national team.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he chose to conclude a particularly intricate
individual move by tapping into an open net instead of passing to
Columbus Crew forward Dante Washington, Diallo replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to score goals. And I earned that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mamadou wanted to prove that he should have been a first-team
player in this game,'' said Patrick McCabe, Diallo's agent. ``But
we had breakfast (Sunday) morning and the All-Star game is in the
past for him. He is laser-focused on being the top scorer in the
league. He has been a professional for 10 years, so a game like
that was not that big of a deal for him. He is not affected by the
hype. This is his chance to shine and he said he is going to take
it and no one is going to stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo departed after a minor lower back strain midway through
the second half of the East's 9-4 win over the West.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's success should increase interest in African players,
which is the specialty of McCabe, a former Medfield resident who

   ``The other African strikers _ Junior Agogo (Ghana/Colorado
Rapids) and Abdul Thompson Conteh (Sierra Leone/San Jose
Earthquakes) _ have some of the same qualities as Mamadou,'' McCabe
said. ``Physical strikers with that kind of skill are effective in
the MLS because American defenders haven't been trained to stop
them. I think they will change the game in the US because the
defense is going to have to adjust. They are going to have to find
quicker defenders.''
</P>
<P>
   McCabe discovered Diallo while placing South African Olympic
team goalkeeper Emile Baron in Norway. And McCabe has a list of
African prospects, from strikers such as South African Pollen
Ndlanya (``well-built but lighter than Diallo and just as skilled
and with much the same personality'') to defenders such as Emmanuel
Kuffour of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some African players have not been successful in the MLS, but
a lot of Latin players have not made it, either,'' McCabe said.
``Some of the marketing to Latinos is losing its luster and coaches
are saying, `Get me guys who can help us win.' ''

COWBOYS' SUBS TURNED OPENER INTO A NIGHT TO FORGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ By halftime of the Dave Campo prime-time debut,
it was already 38-10 in Pittsburgh's favor, and a traffic jam was
beginning to form outside of Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against the Dallas Cowboys' new coach. Campo's backups
had turned a reasonably competitive exhibition scrum into a waste
of a warm summer evening.
</P>
<P>
   The night had its moments. Hopefully, you weren't at the
refrigerator and missed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved the ball well and put it in the end zone,''
quarterback Troy Aikman revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard backs him up. In two first-quarter possessions,
Aikman was 6-of-7 for 83 yards. The two big-money receivers, Joey
Galloway and Rocket Ismail, each had compelling pass receptions.
And the Cowboys did, in fact, score their only touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   In his lone ensuing series, an old nemesis from the dark side,
Randall Cunningham, now a Cowboy, scrambled for 21 yards and took
the team to a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, egads.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, Randall, Rocket and Galloway all retired early for the
night, perhaps to that dallascowboys.com chat room. Loyal Cowboys
fans began flipping the dial, searching for ``Walker, Texas
Ranger'' reruns.
</P>
<P>
   And the visiting Pittsburgh Steelers, like an in-law at a
buffet, rudely piled it on.
</P>
<P>
   The name Paul Justin must be mentioned here. His performance, or
lack thereof, as Campo's third quarterback of the night made
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than 10 minutes, Justin lost one fumble, threw
three intercepted passes and was jeered lustily by the estimated
35,000 in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Has a quarterback in a Cowboys uniform ever been booed in the
first half of the first exhibition game? I didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   What's curious is that Justin is no rookie, but a sixth-year
pro, and he was signed by the Cowboys (at a cost of $500,000)
because he spent time with the Super Bowl-winning Rams and has
experience running the Jack Reilly offense.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, sure.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, though, Justin's play was symptomatic of how a lot
of the second- and third-team Cowboys _ the ones not named
Cunningham _ performed against the opportunistic Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Backup receivers dropped passes. Backup cornerbacks were bullied
around by the Steelers' big receivers. Backup offensive linemen
failed to open holes for backup running backs.
</P>
<P>
   It was owner Jerry Jones himself who said that he believes this
team has more roster depth than any of his previous ones.
</P>
<P>
   But young players _ among them, Dwayne Goodrich, Mario Edwards,
Wane McGarity and Chris Brazzell _ appeared to have problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think on the young guys, there will be some individual
performances that were good,'' Campo said. ``But I was disappointed
as a whole. I'm not worried, though, about those young corners
losing any confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, receivers Plaxico Burress and Malcolm Johnson, who
caught a combined six passes and scored two of the Pittsburgh
touchdowns, are both 6-5. The Cowboys don't list a single backup
cornerback over six feet. Mismatches abounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new guys have a chance to get out there and get a taste of
how it's going to be,'' starting safety George Teague said. ``The
next game will be more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Justin's turnovers at quarterback turned the night into a
debacle, but any crispness that the Cowboys might have displayed
vanished after Cunningham went out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first quarter was fine,'' new offensive coordinator Reilly
said. ``We should have ended it right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it doesn't work that well. In the NFL summer, you pay your
money and you take your chances. Which is why it was a dead heat
this week over which was worth more _ two tickets to
Cowboys-Steelers or that Napster stock you bought last Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Campo. It was no way to introduce himself as the new head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   But that's preseason. He had to stay. You got to watch ``Walker,
Texas Ranger''. nn

SPEEDY NEWCOMER GALLOWAY LIKES POSSIBILITIES OF COWBOYS' OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ On the Dallas Cowboys' first offensive play in
Sunday night's 38-10 blowout loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers,
quarterback Troy Aikman opened the much-publicized ``deep-ball
era'' with a 5-yard pass to fullback Robert Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, whose off-season revitalization included a new
stretch-the-field offense and the addition of speedy receiver Joey
Galloway, called a pass on the ensuing play.
</P>
<P>
   This time Aikman was good on a 5-yard pass and 4-yard run _ to
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make an old fullback proud, while causing many
in the stands at Texas Stadium to wonder what in the name of a $42
million contract was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' predecessor, radio announcer Daryl ``Moose'' Johnston,
proved prophetic in the Cowboys' broadcast booth when he gushed
that the passes to Thomas ``would open things up'' on the outside
for Galloway and his equally speedy receiving partner, Raghib
Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Aikman found Galloway for 14 yards.
</P>
<P>
   That drive eventually stalled because of poor pass protection.
But when Aikman trotted back on the field for the Cowboys' next
possession, he went right at Galloway for 25 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman came back to Ismail for 23 yards with a similar route on
the other side of the field, giving the Cowboys a first down at the
Pittsburgh 6.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Chris Warren scored two plays later, ending the
evening for the first-team offense.
</P>
<P>
   Though his stint was an abbreviated 11 plays, Galloway's debut
lived up to advance billing. The Cowboys' offense, which played
without starting running back Emmitt Smith (sprained toe), tight
end David LaFleur and guard Larry Allen, showed deadly potential.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman completed 6 of 7 passes for 83 yards. Thomas had three
receptions for 21 yards, but Aikman's passes to the receivers were
down-field darts. Galloway caught two for 39. Ismail hauled in one
for 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to throw to Rocket and Joey and get a couple of
good completions,'' Aikman said. ``We moved the ball well in a
short time, which was a good sign. I thought our execution was
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The best part was the inclusion of Galloway, who was given the
megabucks contract to replace the retired Michael Irvin and provide
the juice the offense lacked last season.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway, who is still developing an on-field relationship with
Aikman, said Sunday's results were only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to finally get in the stadium and play a game,''
Galloway said. ``I also enjoyed getting the opportunity to work the
timing with Troy in a game setting. I think we executed well with
the opportunities we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterback Randall Cunningham came away impressed, even
though Galloway was out of the game when Cunningham took the field
with the second-team offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey is just so talented he doesn't look like he has to work
as much as other people ... he can do anything you need as a
player,'' Cunningham said.

OFFICIALS SAY CHAVEZ WINS VENEZUELA PRESIDENTIAL VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Rallying to President Hugo Chavez's call
for radical social and political change, Venezuelans on Sunday
granted the former paratrooper a new six-year term with enhanced
powers, top officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a day of revolution,'' Chavez, 46, who in 1992 led an
unsuccessful military coup attempt, said after casting his ballot
on Sunday morning at a suburban polling station. ``Today a new
republic is being born.''
</P>
<P>
   The ease with which Chavez will be able to carry out his
revolution, however, depends on the outcome of races to elect 165
members of Congress and 23 state governors.
</P>
<P>
   Results of those races were still being tallied early on Monday.
Supporters of the president are expected to win a majority of the
posts, but polls indicate that Chavez may fall short of the
two-thirds majority he needs in the National Assembly in order to
govern without constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has promised to use his time in power to sweep away the
last remnants of the traditional political order in this nation of
23 million people that in recent years has been the United States'
top oil-supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the polls were supposed to close, there were no
official results. However, both the head of the outgoing
legislature and the interior minister, Luis Davila, said on
national television that preliminary official results showed that
Chavez had won handily.
</P>
<P>
   Voter surveys posted by the the newspaper El Nacional gave
Chavez as much as a 20-point margin over his main challenger,
Francisco Arias Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 18 months, Venezuela's poor, disillusioned by
decades of corrupt and unresponsive government, have united around
Chavez and his plan for a complete overhaul of society.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary results, announced late Sunday night, were
quickly followed by fireworks and other celebrations across the
capital. Thousands of jubilant Chavez supporters wearing the red
beret that is the emblem of their movement marched with flags and
banners on the Miraflores presidential palace downtown, demanding
that Chavez appear on ``the people's balcony'' to address them.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally emerged, wearing the same red beret and a
military-style uniform, Chavez called for national ``unity,
persistence and patience.'' But he once again resorted to the
language of conflict and confrontation that has become his
trademark, boasting that ``we have routed the forces of the
adversary'' and warning that ``one battle has ended and another is
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote on Sunday was the culmination of a contentious process
of sweeping political change that began with Chavez's landslide
victory in a December 1998 presidential vote. As a candidate, he
promised voters a ``peaceful social revolution'' if elected, but
also said he would need a new constitution with expanded powers in
order to carry out the transformation the country needed.
</P>
<P>
   In three elections last year, a constitutional assembly was
first convoked and next selected and then finally it submitted a
new charter to voters for approval last December.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Chavez's term of office was expanded from five to
six years, and a ban on sitting presidents seeking immediate
re-election for one more term was removed _ creating the
possibility that Chavez could remain in office until 2013.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the changes were approved, though, the Congress,
dominated by discredited opposition parties, and the Supreme Court
were eliminated and replaced by weakened entities that have proven
subservient to Chavez and his leftist Patriotic Pole coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The authority of governors and mayors was also reduced, the role
of the armed forces was vastly expanded and a Chavez loyalist was
placed in charge of the powerful state oil company after it was
purged.
</P>
<P>
   With the new Constitution in hand, Chavez called a vote to elect
a new unicameral congress, as well as governors, mayors and state
and municipal legislators, a total of more than 6,200 elected
posts. In what he described as an attempt to ``relegitimize'' his
rule, he also submitted the presidency to a new vote, anticipating
no real challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But in February, Cardenas, a former army colonel who was
Chavez's second-in-command during the 1992 coup and spent two years
in jail with him afterward, broke ranks and announced his own
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, he charged, was assuming dictatorial powers, tolerating
the corruption he had pledged to eradicate, alienating the United
States and forging an undesirable alliance with President Fidel
Castro of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual last-minute incursion into the campaign, Castro
invited a group of Venezuelan journalists to Cuba on Saturday and
issued a ringing endorsement of Chavez, wishing him ``good luck and
lots of votes'' during a rambling news conference that was
televised live here. ``Hugo, I am sure that nothing or no one can
hold you back,'' the Cuban leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's remarks, which appeared to violate a ban on politicking
here after the formal close of the campaign, came days after a man
turned up claiming to be a Cuban intelligence agent and said that
Castro has sent 1,500 operatives here to infiltrate the Venezuelan
government. As the news conference was taking place, Chavez called
Castro, and the two men discussed baseball before ridiculing the
accusations of a Cuban spy network operating here.

 CARACAS, Venezuela: operating here.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since taking office 18 months ago, Chavez has consistently
praised Castro and the Cuban revolution while attacking his
domestic critics as ``a rancid oligarchy'' and pursuing a
nationalist and populist political line. The resulting polarization
of Venezuelan society, with the poor overwhelmingly lining up
behind Chavez and the middle class reluctantly supporting Arias,
was once again on display during the balloting on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   One of Chavez's strongholds here is a working-class neighborhood
called 23 de Enero, the site of a popular uprising in which
hundreds of people died in 1989, after the government raised
gasoline prices. The area voted heavily for Chavez in 1998, and
appeared today to have rallied to his side again, with scarcely a
supporter of Mr. Arias to be found during interviews with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venezuela has awakened, and we will never let ourselves be
fooled again,'' said Julia de Tirado, 61, who described Chavez on
Sunday as the antidote to 40 years of corruption and misgovernment
under a pair of traditional parties. She praised him for being
``honest and hard-working'' and said that ``if he were not our
president, things would be disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   But across town, at a polling place at a private high school in
the middle-class neighborhood of Chacao, a woman conducting an exit
poll for a local firm said Arias appeared to have a two-to-one
advantage over Chavez. Among the the most vociferous of those
voting against the president was Irma Galindo de Baez, 50, who was
wearing a button that proclaimed ``throw the crazy man out.''
</P>
<P>
   Baez said she voted for Chavez in 1998 because ``Venezuela
needed a change _ it couldn't go on with the dictatorship of the
political parties.'' But ``this government has been a disaster,''
she said. ``This guy has really scared us'' with his incendiary
language, ``there has been a lot of corruption,'' and the police
have allowed a farm owned by her family to be seized by peasants.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez himself voted early, thanked Venezuelans for choosing ``a
new horizon, a new path,'' and then spent several hours playing
baseball. Later, though, he met with his economic team to draw up
what he described as ``measures of great impact for the first 100
days of the new government,'' and on Sunday night he said he will
address the nation on Aug. 2 to announce the details of ``a new
economic model for Venezuela.''

SEDER GETS A LEG UP ON KICKING JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS AND CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys are hoping to have a kick
this season. And they might if they can find a kicker.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys couldn't buy a field goal of more than 40 yards last
season, which is why they went into this season desperately seeking
a new kicker. Richie Cunningham and Eddie Murray were 4-of-11 on
field goal tries of 40-49 yards.
</P>
<P>
   For one night at least, Ashland University's Tim Seder had no
problem getting it through the upright from long distance.
</P>
<P>
   He made a 48-yarder with room to spare with 12:17 remaining in
the second quarter, capping a seven-play, 40-yard drive directed by
backup quarterback Randall Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't too bad,'' Seder said. ``It's just habit. It's nice
to work with (long snapper) Dale (Hellestrae). I don't know if
there is more pressure, but when you make a kick like that, you get
more confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Rian Lindell, Seder's competition for the job, kicked the extra
point after the Cowboys' touchdown in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Punter Barry Cantrell, who is in competition with Micah Knorr
for the vacant punting job, re-aggravated a strained left hamstring
in pregame warmups and did not play. Knorr averaged 40.4 yards on
five punts. SPECTATORS
</P>
<P>
   Four Cowboys starters missed Sunday night's game with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Emmitt Smith said Sunday that his sprained left toe
was not 100 percent, which prevented him from playing. Left guard
Larry Allen (fractured right hand), tight end David LaFleur (groin)
and free safety George Teague (strained glute) also did not play.
</P>
<P>
   Starting right defensive end Greg Ellis, who still is recovering
from a fractured left tibia and fibula suffered last season,
cornerback Charlie Williams (left knee), linebacker Barron Wortham
(left knee) and receiver Jeff Ogden (right foot) were among other
players who got a sideline view of the game. LUCKY LIKELY OUT FOR
YEAR
</P>
<P>
   The season is likely over for backup tight end Mike Lucky, who
injured his right knee Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys won't know for sure until Monday when he undergoes a
magnetic resonance imaging exam. However, the coaching staff is not
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys tight ends coach Les Miles said it doesn't look good for
Lucky, who was battling Brian Roche for the third tight end spot
behind David LaFleur and Jackie Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Also out of the year is free-agent safety Sean Key, who broke
his right tibula and fibula. MEANINGLESS?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are 1-10 in the exhibition season since 1998. They
have not had a winning preseason record since 1989 when they went
3-1. That's the same season the Cowboys went 1-15 during the
regular season. HERE TODAY...
</P>
<P>
   The best quarterback for the Steelers was Paul Justin.
</P>
<P>
   Justin played his first game as a Cowboy. Justin, who will make
$500,000 if he makes the team as the third-string quarterback,
completed only 2-of-7 passes for 11 yards, threw three
interceptions that led to three Pittsburgh touchdowns and was booed
every time he walked onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Dewayne Washington returned a Justin pass 17 yards for a
touchdown with 4:53 left in the second quarter. Justin's next pass
was intercepted by Mike Vrabel, which led to a 29-yard Steelers'
touchdown on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   Just before halftime, a Justin pass was picked off by Deshea
Townsend, and the Steelers needed only five plays for their next
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime that happens to you, your job is on the line,'' Justin
said. HERE FOR GOOD
</P>
<P>
   Randall Cunningham played only one series. He completed 1-of-4
passes for 7 yards, but two of his incompletions were drops. He
also had a 21-yard scramble as the Cowboys got a field goal out of
the seven-play, 40-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did feel comfortable,'' said Cunningham, who signed as a
free agent in the off-season. ``I felt like I knew what I was
doing. When I first got here, and they threw that playbook in front
of me, oh, my goodness. My head was spinning. I was like, `You're
kidding. These aren't really the plays are they?' Coach said,
`Yeah, you just get them down. It'll take time.' Then I went up to
Troy (Aikman), and I said, `Troy, how long did it take you?' He
said, `Man, when I first learning the system, it took me a little
while to call the plays.' That made me feel good. He's really
helped me. I felt comfortable based on I knew it was going to take
some time to get these plays down.'' ROOKIE MISTAKE
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent rookie quarterback Clint Stoerner completed 7 of 12
passes for 67 yards and one interception. It was the interception
that was bothering him after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner's third pass, which was intended for Wane McGarity, was
picked off by Ainsley Battles in the Steelers' end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rule of thumb for a quarterback is don't throw the ball back
across the field like that anytime, and especially when you're
inside the red zone and you've got a chance for a field goal or a
touchdown,'' Stoerner said. ``As soon as I released it, I knew it
was wrong.'' RANDY MOSS?
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Steelers beat writers long to start comparing
rookie first-round draft choice Plaxico Burress to Minnesota
Vikings receiver Randy Moss. One exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Burress caught four passes _ two of them spectacular _ for 60
yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be Plaxico Burress,'' Steelers quarterback
Kordell Stewart said. ``Calling him Randy Moss is not giving Randy
Moss any respect, because he earned that title in the sense of a
guy who's out there making great plays and making things happen.
Him going up and making those plays can kind of tease you a little
bit to make you think that way. But he still has some work to do.''

   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys are hoping to have a kick
this season. And they might if they can find a kicker.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys couldn't buy a field goal of more than 40 yards last
season, which is why they went into this season desperately seeking
a new kicker. Richie Cunningham and Eddie Murray were 4-of-11 on
field goal tries of 40-49 yards.
</P>
<P>
   For one night at least, Ashland University's Tim Seder had no
problem getting it through the upright from long distance.
</P>
<P>
   He made a 48-yarder with room to spare with 12:17 remaining in
the second quarter, capping a seven-play, 40-yard drive directed by
backup quarterback Randall Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't too bad,'' Seder said. ``It's just habit. It's nice
to work with (long snapper) Dale (Hellestrae). I don't know if
there is more pressure, but when you make a kick like that, you get
more confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Rian Lindell, Seder's competition for the job, kicked the extra
point after the Cowboys' touchdown in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Punter Barry Cantrell, who is in competition with Micah Knorr
for the vacant punting job, re-aggravated a strained left hamstring
in pregame warmups and did not play. Knorr averaged 40.4 yards on
five punts. SPECTATORS
</P>
<P>
   Four Cowboys starters missed Sunday night's game with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Emmitt Smith said Sunday that his sprained left toe
was not 100 percent, which prevented him from playing. Left guard
Larry Allen (fractured right hand), tight end David LaFleur (groin)
and free safety George Teague (strained glute) also did not play.
</P>
<P>
   Starting right defensive end Greg Ellis, who still is recovering
from a fractured left tibia and fibula suffered last season,
cornerback Charlie Williams (left knee), linebacker Barron Wortham
(left knee) and receiver Jeff Ogden (right foot) were among other
players who got a sideline view of the game. LUCKY LIKELY OUT FOR
YEAR
</P>
<P>
   The season is likely over for backup tight end Mike Lucky, who
injured his right knee Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys won't know for sure until Monday when he undergoes a
magnetic resonance imaging exam. However, the coaching staff is not
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys tight ends coach Les Miles said it doesn't look good for
Lucky, who was battling Brian Roche for the third tight end spot
behind David LaFleur and Jackie Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Also out of the year is free-agent safety Sean Key, who broke
his right tibula and fibula. MEANINGLESS?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are 1-10 in the exhibition season since 1998. They
have not had a winning preseason record since 1989 when they went
3-1. That's the same season the Cowboys went 1-15 during the
regular season. HERE TODAY...
</P>
<P>
   The best quarterback for the Steelers was Paul Justin.
</P>
<P>
   Justin played his first game as a Cowboy. Justin, who will make
$500,000 if he makes the team as the third-string quarterback,
completed only 2-of-7 passes for 11 yards, threw three
interceptions that led to three Pittsburgh touchdowns and was booed
every time he walked onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Deshea Townsend returned a Justin pass 17 yards for a touchdown
with 4:53 left in the second quarter. Justin's next pass was
intercepted by Mike Vrabel, which led to a 29-yard Steelers'
touchdown on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   Just before halftime, a Justin pass was picked off by Deshea
Townsend, and the Steelers needed only five plays for their next
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime that happens to you, your job is on the line,'' Justin
said. HERE FOR GOOD
</P>
<P>
   Randall Cunningham played only one series. He completed 1-of-4
passes for 7 yards, but two of his incompletions were drops. He
also had a 21-yard scramble as the Cowboys got a field goal out of
the seven-play, 40-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did feel comfortable,'' said Cunningham, who signed as a
free agent in the off-season. ``I felt like I knew what I was
doing. When I first got here, and they threw that playbook in front
of me, oh, my goodness. My head was spinning. I was like, `You're
kidding. These aren't really the plays are they?' Coach said,
`Yeah, you just get them down. It'll take time.' Then I went up to
Troy (Aikman), and I said, `Troy, how long did it take you?' He
said, `Man, when I first learning the system, it took me a little
while to call the plays.' That made me feel good. He's really
helped me. I felt comfortable based on I knew it was going to take
some time to get these plays down.'' ROOKIE MISTAKE
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent rookie quarterback Clint Stoerner completed 7 of 12
passes for 67 yards and one interception. It was the interception
that was bothering him after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner's third pass, which was intended for Wane McGarity, was
picked off by Ainsley Battles in the Steelers' end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rule of thumb for a quarterback is don't throw the ball back
across the field like that anytime, and especially when you're
inside the red zone and you've got a chance for a field goal or a
touchdown,'' Stoerner said. ``As soon as I released it, I knew it
was wrong.'' RANDY MOSS?
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take Steelers beat writers long to start comparing
rookie first-round draft choice Plaxico Burress to Minnesota
Vikings receiver Randy Moss. One exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Burress caught four passes _ two of them spectacular _ for 60
yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be Plaxico Burress,'' Steelers quarterback
Kordell Stewart said. ``Calling him Randy Moss is not giving Randy
Moss any respect, because he earned that title in the sense of a
guy who's out there making great plays and making things happen.
Him going up and making those plays can kind of tease you a little
bit to make you think that way. But he still has some work to do.''

RANGERS' OLIVER ROUGHED UP AGAIN, MIGHT LOSE SPOT IN ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ One bad outing by a pitcher frequently is an
aberration. Two can be put down to misfortune. But do it three
times, and it becomes a disturbing trend.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Oliver allowed seven runs on eight hits in two innings as
the Texas Rangers lost to the Detroit Tigers, 8-7, Sunday night at
The Ballpark in Arlington, his third consecutive poor outing since
returning from the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' said Oliver, who allowed six runs in the first
inning, all with two outs. ``I know I can pitch a lot better than
this. It's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Perisho, Jeff Zimmerman and John Wetteland provided seven
innings of stellar relief, collectively holding the Tigers to one
run on three hits and giving the Rangers a chance to get back in
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers pecked away with a run here, a couple of runs there.
They even scored two runs off Tigers closer Todd Jones in the
ninth, the first time he has been scored on since May 24.
</P>
<P>
   But just as it was Saturday, when Kenny Rogers gave up six in
the first, the early deficit was too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have back-to-back nights when you get behind 6-0 in
the first, it's hard to keep battling back,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped Oliver to 0-2 with an 11.57 ERA in his past
three starts, and 2-6 with a 7.33 ERA overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers dropped to three games below .500, and 101/2 games
behind the Seattle Mariners in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin said Sunday he isn't inclined to
make a major trade before 3 p.m. Monday, the nonwaiver deadline,
mostly because he hasn't received an attractive offer for closer
John Wetteland but also because he'd like to give the club a chance
to make a run at a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be hard to get back into the race without an
extended winning streak, and it will be hard to put together an
extended winning streak unless Oliver improves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to do better,'' Oates said. ``Right now, it's
not very pretty. His velocity is there, but location-wise he
stunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver complained of a tired arm after a start May 31 and didn't
pitch for 10 days. He was ineffective when he returned to the
rotation, going 0-1 with a 11.88 earned-run average in his next two
starts.
</P>
<P>
   After further examinations he was diagnosed with tendinitis in
his left shoulder, and placed on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   He went 1-1 with a 0.84 ERA in three starts for Triple-A
Oklahoma on medical-rehabilitation assignment and was activated
June 20, but he has been wretched since returning to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's hard to figure it out out there, and it's a
struggle,'' he said. ``I wish I had the answers, but I don't. I
can't put the ball where I want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, he's 0-3 with a 11.70 ERA in five starts after first
saying his arm hurt, and hasn't pitched past the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, he insists there's nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative might be even worse. If Oliver isn't injured,
the pitcher signed to a three-year, $18 million contract as a free
agent in the off-season might merely be ineffective. That's a
possibility, considering he was 2-3 with a 5.98 ERA before the
problems with his arm. His two victories in 16 outings are the
second fewest by an AL pitcher with at least 15 starts. The New
York Yankees' David Cone has one in 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things where you have to keep going out
there and keep battling,'' Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   Unless he improves, Oliver might not have the chance to go out
there much more. Doug Davis, 8-3 with a 2.84 ERA in 12 starts at
Oklahoma, is in the bullpen awaiting his chance.
</P>
<P>
   Oates didn't rule out a switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will announce any changes that I may want to do'' Tuesday,
he said, referring to the day after the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Rangers are to have any chance to getting back in the
race they need better results from that spot in the rotation, from
Oliver or someone else. nn

49ers owe success to Montana pick
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   You shudder to think how one decision, one wrong road taken, can
change a life, a team or a city. It is a matter of record that Bill
Walsh, still a few years away from being hailed as a genius, did
not intend to draft Joe Montana in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco had a fairly urgent need for a quarterback with
potential, but Walsh had his eye on Phil Simms, who figured to be
gone by the time the 49ers made their pick, and Steve Dils, who had
played for Walsh at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   It was John Brodie, the former 49ers quarterback, who urged
Walsh to take the senior from Notre Dame, who at 6-2 and 190 pounds
looked almost frail. What he had going for him was a reputation for
bringing his team from behind. Of course, it helped to have played
under the Golden Dome, attached to the legends of Knute Rockne,
George Gipp, Angelo Bertelli, Johnny Lujack and all of the other
saints who walked forever along the misty banks of the Wabash.
</P>
<P>
   But no one had yet forecast immortality for Joe Montana. The rap
against him at Notre Dame was his casual attitude toward practice
and his inconsistency. Then Walsh watched him work out and was
intrigued by his quick feet and the way he set up to throw. ``If he
can be great for one game,'' Walsh wondered, ``why not two? Or
more? He was willing to learn. That was easy to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   So the 49ers grabbed Montana in the third round, making him the
82nd player selected. Think about it. What if they had indeed
drafted the forgettable Dils, and Joe had wound up with the
Patriots or Jets? Would the 49ers have won four Super Bowls in the
'80s? Would Walsh have kept his job, much less qualified for a
genius badge? Would something called the East Coast offense have
ruled the pros and spread across the land?
</P>
<P>
   We can only guess.
</P>
<P>
   Few quarterbacks were more skilled at taking the guesswork out
of a big game. He had an almost supernatural sense of timing. No
one hurried Joe Montana, standing in the pocket or on the podium of
the Pro Football Hall of Fame at Canton, Ohio. He took his own
sweet time and, mercy, what sweet times they were.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh was patient with Montana, letting him understudy Steve
DeBerg for almost two seasons. Nor was that a new role for the
quiet kid with icy blue eyes. At Notre Dame, he had been ranked
last among the three quarterbacks on the freshman roster. Funny
about football myths. By the time Joe was a certified NFL hero, the
popular version of his college debut had six quarterbacks ahead of
him.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't start for the Irish until the fourth game of his
junior year. Coming off the bench in six games, playing less than a
total of 40 minutes, he brought the Irish from 88 points behind and
won them all.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Joe proved more than his greatness. He was
modest and brave and normal, a hero but not without flaws. Marriage
threw him for losses twice, but the third time he got it right.
</P>
<P>
   After the 49ers swamped Miami and Dan Marino in Super Bowl XIX,
he married Jennifer Wallace, an actress-model who filmed a
commercial with him for Schick razors. Jennifer said she had to
pinch Joe's bottom to get him to loosen up enough to complete the
spot. The script ended with Joe asking, ``What am I wanted for now,
Sheriff?''
</P>
<P>
   Her reply was prophetic: ``To take me to the dance, Joe
Montana.'' Quarterbacks and singing cowboys usually get the girl,
but not many marry the Schick sheriff. Mostly, he took the risks
and made his own luck.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in his last college game _ the Siberia Bowl _ he beat
Houston in the snow in Dallas, passing for a touchdown and a
two-point conversion as time ran out, with no one able to see the
line of scrimmage. And his view was blocked when Dwight Clark made
The Catch that beat the Cowboys, sending the 49ers to their first
Super Bowl and a victory over the Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   So many big plays, so many big games. After Montana had back
surgery in 1986, his doctors doubted he would play again that year,
or any other year. Eight weeks later, he led the 49ers to a rout of
the Cardinals. Decked while throwing a touchdown pass to Jerry
Rice, Montana looked up to see a defensive end standing over him.
``You're a hell of a man,'' said Bubba Baker, who then turned and
walked away.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro Football Hall of Fame moves to Houston on Sunday _ at
least its newest attraction does. Montana will sign autographs at a
collectors show, and you will find him unchanged by immortality.
``I go to the store, buy milk and forget the bread. I try to hammer
a nail and hit my thumb,'' he says. ``Do legends do that?''

Houston owner wants expansion team in AFC Central
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN McCLAIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ Houston owner Bob McNair wants the NFL to place
his expansion franchise in the AFC Central with Pittsburgh,
Cleveland and Cincinnati when the league is realigned into eight
divisions of four teams each for the 2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the history of the rivalries between Houston and those
three cities,'' McNair said. ``It just seems like such a natural
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Realignment is shaping up as perhaps the league's most
controversial issue since the merger between the NFL and AFL in
1970. Although nothing is for certain, and everything is subject to
change, it appears Tennessee definitely will leave the AFC Central
and probably will be placed in a newly created southern division in
the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   In many of the realignment proposals disclosed so far, Houston
has been included in a new southern division with Tennessee,
Jacksonville and Indianapolis, even though the Colts aren't a
natural fit.
</P>
<P>
   The realignment controversy won't explode until the league's
spring meetings in March, but owners and front-office executives
are taking sides.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland wants Houston rather than Baltimore in the AFC
Central. Pittsburgh wants Baltimore. Cincinnati wants Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The new Browns want the old Browns, the Ravens, out of the
division to sever the historical ties.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh wants to keep Baltimore in the AFC Central for the
same reason Cleveland wants the Ravens out _ because of the natural
rivalry between the old Browns and new Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati wants Indianapolis because of the close proximity of
the two teams and the possibility of building a rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   McNair has Cleveland owner Al Lerner and Browns president Carmen
Policy as allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel Houston would be an outstanding addition to our
division,'' says Policy, who is one of the league's most
influential executives. ``Cleveland has history with Houston. In
this part of the country, history means something when it comes to
professional football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competitively, having Houston in our division would be great.
Think about the great memories of Browns-Oilers games and
Steelers-Oilers games. When you think your way through it, it's
very, very appealing to Al Lerner and myself.''
</P>
<P>
   As the owner of the NFL's newest franchise, McNair doesn't have
a vote. Neither does Ravens owner Art Modell. He surrendered his
vote when the league agreed to let him move to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   McNair, Lerner and Policy have to work on Steelers owner Dan
Rooney. No owner is more powerful and influential than Rooney, who
was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe that with the proper sales approach, we
might be able to get Dan Rooney to see some of the benefits we
see,'' Policy said.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney has said numerous times how much he likes Houston and how
much respect he has for the city and the team. His belief that the
Ravens should remain in the AFC Central has nothing to do with
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's (Browns-Ravens) such a great natural rivalry,'' Rooney
said. ``I don't know why you'd want to break it up. I'm not saying
it (his opinion) is etched in stone. I'm trying to be open-minded
about it. Over time, just think about what kind of rivalry that
could become.''
</P>
<P>
   For the same reason he believes the Browns and Ravens should be
in the same division, Rooney thinks Houston would be a natural fit
in a division with Tennessee. Former Steelers defensive tackle Joe
Greene agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who was Rooney's presenter in Canton and is also a
member of the Hall, played on four Super Bowl champions, including
the two that beat the Oilers in AFC Championship Games during the
Luv Ya Blue era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Steelers and Oilers had a great rivalry and some great
games, but if you're talking geographically, it makes more sense to
keep Baltimore in the division,'' Greene said. ``Because of what
happened with the Oilers moving, Houston and Tennessee would have
the makings of a great rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   Although so much can change in two or three years because of the
salary cap and free agency, Houston would appear to have a chance
to be competitive sooner by playing in the AFC Central with the
Steelers, Browns and Bengals rather than in a new division with the
Titans, Jaguars and Colts.
</P>
<P>
   In the AFC Central, Houston, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and
Cincinnati would be playing in new stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, McNair will have Policy and Lerner on
his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bob's going to build a great organization,'' Policy
said. ``I don't know what the odds are that Houston will end up in
the AFC Central, but I think we can inject some real juice into the
issue and make a compelling argument for it.''
</P>
<P>
   An example of how difficult it is going to be can be found in a
comment by commissioner Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to look beyond geography,'' Tagliabue said. ``We've
got to look at a mix of things. I really think that when we get the
scheduling formula done in October, it's really going to open up
some possibilities because everyone will be playing everyone in the
league on a rotating basis. And you'll be guaranteed of playing
everyone home and away over a relatively short period. I think
that's really going to help us with realignment.''

   Glavine beats Astros for 200th win
</P>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fate was in attendance Sunday at Turner Field, and it
might as well have been toting a tomahawk.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves pitcher Tom Glavine chopped up the Astros en
route to the 200th victory of his stellar career. Glavine scattered
seven hits over eight innings, and the Braves played highlight-reel
defense in a 6-3 victory over the backpedaling Astros.
</P>
<P>
   After winning a season-high five consecutive games, the Astros
have dropped three in a row, and they open a four-game series
tonight in Florida, where their all-time record is 14-21.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine became the 96th pitcher in major-league history to reach
200 victories, and he joined Roger Clemens and Greg Maddux as the
only active pitchers to accomplish the feat.
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional day for the veteran lefthander, who left to
a standing ovation from the crowd of 40,613, which included his
parents and other family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always get nervous before I pitch,'' said Glavine, who needs
26 victories to tie Hall of Famer Phil Niekro's franchise record
for the most victories since the team moved to Atlanta. ``Today it
was more excitement than nervousness, though. It felt like a
playoff game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros didn't need the reminder. With memories of Walt
Weiss' defensive gem from last year's Division Series still fresh,
the Astros could have done without all of the hit-stealing that
occurred Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it looked as though the Braves had two or three extra
fielders on the diamond. Then again, center fielder Andruw Jones
and rookie shortstop Rafael Furcal often exhibit the range of two
men each. Meanwhile, the Astros remained in their defensive slump,
committing two errors and allowing a pair of unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a stark contrast in the fielding,'' Astros manager
Larry Dierker said. ``We made a lot of errors, and they made some
nice plays. . . . But don't get me wrong. Glavine is a tough guy to
beat. He doesn't throw that many pitches over the middle of the
plate, and he makes pitches where guys can't really drive the ball.
That's why he's won the Cy Young Award, been an All-Star and is on
his way to the Hall of Fame maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (13-5) allowed all three Astros runs, and lefthander
Mike Remlinger bailed him out of a ninth-inning jam to notch his
ninth save.
</P>
<P>
   Astros starter Chris Holt (4-12) lost for the sixth time in his
last seven decisions. He allowed six runs (four earned) on nine
hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wasn't able to pitch out of trouble,'' said Holt. ``It
seems like funny things happen when I'm out there. I don't know
what I can do except to keep battling. Hopefully, things will
change, because this is getting old. I'd like to finish strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine surrendered only two hits over the first five innings _
back-to-back singles to lead off the second. He retired 14 of the
first 17 batters he faced, including 11 in a row at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Braves did all of their scoring during the first
five innings. Included were two unearned runs in the second, when
Jeff Bagwell's error on a bad-hop grounder kept the inning alive
long enough for the Braves to take an early lead.
</P>
<P>
   Braves second baseman Keith Lockhart doubled home a run in the
fourth, and the Braves scored three more runs in a fifth-inning
spurt highlighted by Javy Lopez's two-run double. Astros relievers
Doug Henry and Joe Slusarski combined for three innings of
scoreless relief after Holt's exit.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell drove in the Astros' first run with a two-out single in
the sixth, and RBI singles by Moises Alou and Tony Eusebio gave the
Astros hopes of a comeback in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The potential tying run was in the on-deck circle when pinch
hitter Bill Spiers sent a grounder toward the middle of the
infield. It looked like a base hit until Lockhart made a diving
stop and flipped the ball to second base for a game-ending
forceout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys made a lot of great plays,'' Astros second baseman
Craig Biggio said. ``When a team plays defense the way they did,
there's not much you can do.''

ANGELS GIVE IT AWAY
</HEADLINE>

By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels got the bat they needed in
the trade for Ron Gant, but Gant's bat would not have helped Sunday
the way the Angels played defense in an ugly, 11-7, 10-inning loss
to the Chicago White Sox before 27,513 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels made a season-worst five errors, including two by
third baseman Troy Glaus, but still came within one strike of
winning the game in nine innings. Closer Troy Percival gave up
three runs in the ninth inning, turning a 6-4 lead into a 7-6
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   After the Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth on a
sacrifice fly by Garret Anderson, the White Sox scored four more in
the top of the 10th to put the game away and salvage a split in the
four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the few real poor games we've played
defensively,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``Errors are part
of the game but we didn't get it done in a lot of ways.
Cutoff-relay, bunt plays, routine plays. Those were just not there
today. We'll get it together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long before Percy was in the game, we left a crack in the door
open too far. You can't do that with a club as talented as that.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-run triple by Tim Salmon gave the Angels what seemed was a
comfortable 6-2 lead in the seventh inning. After all, the Angels
began the night 45-3 in games when leading after the seventh
inning. But in the eighth, everything fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox got two important runs in the eighth inning, and
both were unearned. With runners on second and third and two out,
Jose Valentin hit a grounder to third, but it went under Glaus'
glove for an error, allowing one run to score. After Mark Petkovsek
replaced Mike Holtz, Frank Thomas' RBI single cut the Angels lead
to 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for the ninth when Percival let the lead slip
away.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox had a runner on first with two out and Percival
was one strike away from finishing it. But Greg Norton fouled off
five pitches from Percival and eventually drew a walk.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up No. 9 hitter Mark Johnson, who began the game
hitting .223. Johnson lined a 95-mph fastball into the right-center
field gap to score two runs and tie the game at 6. Ray Durham, who
was 0 for 5 at that point, followed with an RBI double to give the
White Sox a 7-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew going into the game I had no off-speed pitch,'' said
Percival, who was pitching in his third consecutive game. ``Tonight
I just didn't throw the ball very good. I was trying to get the
ball down and left it up and out over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels rallied in their half of the ninth. Two walks
sandwiched around a single loaded the bases with one out for
Anderson, who hit a line drive to left field that Carlos Lee
snared. Scott Spiezio tagged from third and scored to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   With a chance to win it, Glaus hit a scorching line drive, but
it went right at third baseman Herbert Perry for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox got their four-run rally in the 10th started on a
broken- bat single by Frank Thomas and a ground ball that hit
second base for another hit. Later in the inning, Jeff Abbott and
Lee had two-run singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's baseball,'' Scioscia said. ``Hopefully you're going to
get some breaks, but we can't say we didn't get a break here or a
break there. We let this game slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the trade of Kent Bottenfield, Angels starter Seth
Etherton might have had the added pressure of representing all of
the Angels' young starters Sunday. But he responded with one of his
best starts of the season, giving up two runs and nine hits in 6
innings.
</P>
<P>
   He finished strong, getting Perry on a short fly to center
field, keeping Thomas on third while getting the second out of the
inning and holding an Angels' 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take a 3-2 lead anytime,'' Etherton said. ``Our relievers
have done a great job all year. I'll give the ball to them every
time.''

THERE'S NO QUESTIONING GAMBILL'S HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jan-Michael Gambill retired on Sunday? Say it
isn't so! He's too young to call it quits.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill turned 23 last month; goodness knows Jimmy Connors has
grudges older than that. If Gambill is gone, can the Backstreet
Boys be long for the pop charts? Can men's tennis in the U.S. be
long for prosperity?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, wait. What's that you say? Gambill merely retired from the
Mercedes-Benz Cup final after splitting the first two sets with
Michael Chang?
</P>
<P>
   Whew! What a relief to know Gambill has a gimpy left knee and a
gimpy right ankle but nothing that will permanently sideline
America's Gladiator. Because this much was obvious just watching
the wunderkind from Washington state limp through a week of singles
and doubles matches here hard on the heels of taking eventual
champion Pete Sampras to four spandex-tight sets in the
quarterfinals at Wimbledon and going down with the ship, USS Mayday
in a Davis Cup semifinal in Spain:
</P>
<P>
   Professional tennis needs Gambill even more than did the
organizers of the 2000 Tour stop at the L.A. Tennis Center; more
than Hollywood or ``Tiger Beat'' magazine or the baby tigers
Gambill helps care for in his hometown of Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   As he showed Sunday, Gambill is a gamer. That alone makes him a
rarer bird than a finesse player on the ATP Tour, where the only
thing more egregious than the egos are the excuses. We're talking
about a climate so polluted that no one blinked twice earlier this
year when Marcelo Rios, a one-time No. 1, retired from a
first-round match against Tommy Haas with what appeared to be
nothing more serious than a bruised ego after losing the first two
sets in lackluster fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with crying ``Ow'' is that after a while no one
believes it when a player really is hurt. So it was some people
wondered aloud how it could be that Andre Agassi suffered a back
injury in a car accident in his hometown of Las Vegas that was bad
enough to keep him out of this tournament but not bad enough to
warrant filing a police report.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, blame Rios. As long as a single player tanks, the whole
Tour will suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gambill had his share of second-guessers Sunday.
Everybody but his brother wanted to know why he hadn't defaulted
his semifinals doubles match with partner Scott Humphries. Gambill
and Humphries defeated Wayne Ferreira and Kevin Ullyett 6-4, 6-7
(3-7), 6-3 in a match that didn't end until Saturday had given way
to Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Gambill's tender knees needed another three-set
match like actor George Hamilton needs more sun. And yet he never
seriously considered pulling out of the match. What comes as second
nature to some players is anathema to this athlete.
</P>
<P>
   As Gambill's younger brother Torrey explained, ``He wasn't going
to screw up his doubles partner. He was worried about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that, a tennis player ranked in the world's top-100
(with a bullet) who recognizes that other players have feelings
too, who puts someone else's well-being above his own. If Gambill
represents the next breed of superstars, we say hooray for men's
tennis!
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great effort on his part the whole week,'' said
Humphries, who worried that his doubles partner was over-extending
himself even as the pair was prolonging its run in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always in the back of your mind,'' Humphries said. ``But
then if you know Jan-Michael you know if it's at all possible for
him to play, he will. If Jan-Michael has 10 percent to give, he
going to go out and give 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's L.A. Tour stop would have had more star power if
more players had been willing to give whatever they've got, like
Gambill. If the tournament failed to stir the sportsman in you,
blame Rios (and Co.), not the beleaguered tournament officials.
</P>
<P>
   The most terrible transgression Gambill was guilty of on this
week came later rather than sooner. After walking out to the court
to accept his runners-up trophy with a limp more pronounced than
Lakers coach Phil Jackson's, Gambill thanked, among others, the car
dealer who loaned him a Jaguar to drive around L.A. for the week.
Never mind that Mercedes-Benz had spent good money to lend their
regal name to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   So Gambill isn't perfect, just perfect for professional tennis.

PRIDE GOT IN THE WAY OF REASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I supported the idea of giving Julio Cesar Chavez
one last shot at glory. I believed he deserved the right to go out
on his own terms after all he's given boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I was wrong: No one deserves what we saw Saturday night
from Phoenix - not Chavez, not the sport, not the fans.
</P>
<P>
   We wince when we think of Muhammad Ali's second-to-last fight,
one for which he worked himself into good shape yet was pummeled by
Larry Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   We wince when we think of Sugar Ray Leonard's last two fights,
pathetic knockout losses to Terry Norris and Hector Camacho.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we'll wince when we think of Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, like Ali, had whipped himself into reasonably good
condition. He was near the 140-pound weight limit a month before
the fight and it showed: His body hadn't looked as tight as it was
Saturday in years.
</P>
<P>
   However, he's 38 years old and no amount of preparation could
change that. He no longer has the tools to compete at this level.
He said as much in a television interview immediately after the
fight: ``The body just doesn't have the strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Many had the foresight to say: ``No, this isn't right. This is
what's wrong with boxing.'' For example, Arizona senator John
McCain, a boxing reformer and devoted fan, lobbied against staging
the fight in his state.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope the rest of us learned a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   The motives of WBC head Jose Sulaiman are suspect. He named
Chavez his No. 1 140-pound contender even though the former
six-time champion was beaten silly in a 10-round loss to journeyman
Willy Wise in October and hadn't faced a decent opponent since he
lost to Oscar De La Hoya in September of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sulaiman and Don King, Chavez's promoter, undoubtedly
anticipated a few more big paydays out of Chavez had he somehow
beaten Kostya Tszyu.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, that's not how Chavez should've received his final
opportunity to fight for a world championship. That he was the No.
1 contender in the most respected of boxing's sanctioning bodies is
an indication of how corrupt the sport remains.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Athletic Commission was more misguided than
sinister. That group would probably say it had no choice: Chavez
passed all the physical tests required for licensing and he still
has some skills.
</P>
<P>
   However, on Saturday, it was never more clear that a
commission's duties go beyond such elementary criteria. It must
determine - based on the testimony of experts - whether its
matchups are likely to be reasonably competitive to protect the
fighters and the fans. One would think this would be a particularly
high priority in a championship fight.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Saturday's bout was anything but competitive. Tszyu
is one of the most talented fighters in the world, Chavez just
another junior welterweight - if that.
</P>
<P>
   Again, some of us had genuine motives. Chavez wanted to go out
with ``pride and dignity'' and we wanted to give him that chance.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that Chavez hardly looked proud and dignified
when he was on all fours after he was knocked down by Tszyu in an
ugly sixth round. Chavez, who simply grew tired and was unable to
defend himself, was as much embarrassed as he was hurt and we were
embarrassed for him.
</P>
<P>
   No one did him any favors by allowing him to fight Tszyu. Had
those who supported his right to give it one more shot really been
looking out for his best interests, they would've demanded: ``Don't
let this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The only good that came out of a sad night was Chavez's
proclamation that he has had enough and plans to retire. If only it
could've happened one fight sooner.

   Ayala-Campas: What are we to think of Tony Ayala after his
eighth-round loss to Yory Campas on Friday?
</P>
<P>
   If Ayala did break his hand in the second round as he and his
handlers claim - and we'll assume he did - then he gave a
remarkable performance and he shouldn't be dismissed as a contender
at 37 and after 16 years in prison for rape.
</P>
<P>
   If the injury was exaggerated, if that was the best Ayala has to
offer, then he'll probably never be among the elite fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, he doesn't have much time to rebuild after his first
defeat. His best opportunity to spring-board himself to a title
shot might be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal: No one is going to get too excited about heavyweight
Tye Fields of Des Moines, Iowa, until he faces a legitimate
heavyweight, but he sure is intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   Fields, who is 6-foot-9, 285 pounds, has knocked out each of 11
overmatched opponents in the first round. That's the kind of
statistic that piques the interest of money-hungry promoters and
blood-thirsty fans.
</P>
<P>
   Fields apparently is a bit crude but has the physical strength
to overwhelm the type of opponents he meets in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for a quality opponent for Tye's next fight,''
said his manager, Ed Lahart. ``With more training and ring
experience behind him, he will be a contender to be reckoned with
among heavyweight fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll see.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Hasim Rahman faces Frankie Swindell in a
10-round heavyweight bout on Friday in Las Vegas on ESPN2. ...
</P>
<P>
   Zab Judah, who hopes to fight Tszyu before the end of the year,
defend his IBF junior welterweight title against Terronn Millett in
Connecticut on Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Rising lightweight prospect Juan Lazcano faces James Leija in a
10- round lightweight bout on that card. ...
</P>

   Also on Saturday, WBA flyweight champion Sornpichai Pisnurachank
(19-0,16 KOs) defends his title against U.S. Olympian Eric Morel
(26-0, 16 KOs) on Saturday in Madison, Wisc., on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   And, in one more Saturday bout, hot prospect Alex Trujillo
(17-0, 14 KOs) faces Mark Suarez (17-0, 6 KOs) in a 10-round junior
welterweight bout on Saturday in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   A tape of that fight, along with a heavyweight bout between
Jorge Luis Gonzalez and Cliff Couser, will be televised Sunday on
Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo, a very aggressive fighter with power in both hands,
came from Puerto Rico to work with Joe Goossen in Van Nuys.

NETWORKS RESIST THE GOP'S PHILADELPHIA STORY
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN DIAZ 
c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when the television networks still saw
political conventions as a prime-time showcase for their reporting
talent and dazzling new technologies, NBC's Tom Brokaw cut a bold
fashion statement at Detroit's Joe Louis Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The network's fastest-rising star wore jogging shoes with his
suit to cover the floor action on opening night of the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, it seemed that half the reporters on the floor
had tossed aside their wingtips and loafers to follow Brokaw's
lead. After all, the Big Three networks _ with upstart CNN making
its debut in an arena skybox _ set the tone for convention coverage
in every way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the biggest development of that convention came not from
the floor or the podium, but from the skybox booths, where Gerald
Ford openly speculated about the prospect of ``a co-presidency.''
His interviews with Walter Cronkite and Barbara Walters caused
delegates and reporters to scramble to find a TV, and ultimately
prompted nominee Ronald Reagan to make a dramatic trip to the
convention hall to announce that George Bush, not Ford, would be
his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first live convention I covered, and I came away
wondering if the real front-row seats belonged to the millions of
Americans parked in front of the TV.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. The parties got smart and drained all remaining
risks of drama out of their convention schedules. By 1980, the
Reagan strategists knew better than to allow the sort of
freewheeling platform debate and 39 vice presidential nominations
(Archie Bunker, Mao Zedong included) that left George McGovern
making his 1972 acceptance speech at 3 a.m. eastern time. These
days, even the vice presidential selections are locked up before
the first thump of the gavel.
</P>
<P>
   Neither George W. Bush nor Al Gore would dare allow any such
substance or frivolity to crash four days of orchestrated pablum.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem odd that anyone would complain about lack of
coverage of an event that has drawn 15,000 credentialed
journalists, but that is exactly what is happening in Philadelphia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a hand-wringing session Sunday at Philadelphia's historic
City Hall, Republican Chairman Jim Nicholson and Democratic
Chairman Edward Rendell bemoaned the cost to democracy of the
networks' diminishing convention coverage. The three major networks
averaged more than 40 hours of live telecasts at the 1980
conventions; this year, NBC and CBS are planning on 10 hours at
each convention. ABC will show just five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything doesn't have to be news,'' Nicholson protested at
the session sponsored by Harvard University's Joan Shorenstein
Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy. He called the GOP
convention a ``national town hall meeting'' with ``important
information'' to convey.
</P>
<P>
   When, in the name of our Founding Fathers, have town hall
meetings become one-way dialogues? A real ``town hall meeting''
among Republicans might _ just might _ generate some discussion of
a platform that opposes civil rights for gays and would outlaw
abortion even in cases of rape and incest. Attention party leaders:
Of all the facts and figures that were tossed about, one of the
most surprising was a study that showed nominees received equally
strong ``bounces'' in the polls from conventions where the
delegates aired their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the proliferation of news-oriented cable channels and
Internet sites that will generate an unprecedented level of readily
available information about this convention, there is still reason
to be concerned about the lack of attention on network airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson pointed out that 25 percent of U.S. households do not
subscribe to cable TV, and there is a very real ``digital divide''
when it comes to access to the Internet _ and it falls, he
correctly noted, along racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of the digital divide, however, go well beyond
Nicholson's concern that low-income minorities will not be able to
see gavel-to-gavel coverage of the GOP convention. The issue cuts
to the core of how early and how extensively young people are
exposed to the marvelous learning tools available online. It is
inseparable from the larger question of how to help those who have
been left behind in the economic boom. These matters do not lend
themselves to easy answers or soft-focus speeches, but this society
ignores them at its long-term peril.
</P>
<P>
   These are the types of difficult issues the parties should be
debating openly and making hard, specific commitments to address.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? If they did, the networks would cover them.

 &HT;    A MODEL POLLUTION PROGRAM(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BRUNO J. NAVARRO(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - The idea was simple: Intel would voluntarily add
pollution controls at its computer chip plant in Chandler in
exchange for less regulatory red tape.
</P>
<P>
   That was four years ago. Now, company officials, government
representatives and at least one environmentalist praise the
federal program as a model that benefits businesses and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the program, Intel has published information on
the Web about its air emissions, has exceeded wastewater treatment
standards and recycled wooden crates used to transport equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we're fully built out, the microchip plant will be
the largest in the world, and we're still a minor source for air
emissions,'' said Jim Larsen, manager of strategic programs for
Intel. ``It's phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the program relies too heavily on the honor
system and leaves open the potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody actually goes out there and does testing,'' said Dave
Matusow, a member of Intel's citizens advisory group. ``Even though
there's technology to do that, it's not actually utilized.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which is building the $2 billion Fab-22 computer chip
manufacturing plant in Chandler, was among the first to sign up
with Project XL in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton touted the federal program as a way to boost
environmental protections while reducing regulatory burdens on big
business.
</P>
<P>
   Watchdog groups criticized the program before it was
implemented, arguing that it gave too much freedom to large
companies without providing equal benefits to the communities that
would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's Larsen said Project XL has led to increased
accountability because the company publishes on its Web site
detailed environmental information, ranging from chemical recycling
to emissions of air pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Company resources, Larsen said, are available to do that because
Intel doesn't constantly have to file paperwork that can climb into
the tens of thousands of pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money's going into environmental performance instead of
meeting regulations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what concerns Matusow, a software programmer who
volunteered to join the Project XL advisory group.
</P>
<P>
   Intel will be allowed to build its 360,000-square-foot facility
- among the world's largest - without seeking any additional
environmental permits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Matusow acknowledges that Intel's willingness to publish its
environmental information is ``superior to what had been
required.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Crumbaker of the Maricopa County Environmental Services
Department said this was one of the program's highlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the strongest benefits {hellip} was the presentation of
information in a form the local community can understand,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has published on the Web vast amounts of detailed
information each quarter about its emissions, making it available
to anyone with access to the Internet. The site is at
www.intel.com/intel/oth er/ehs/projectxl/.
</P>
<P>
   However, Crumbaker joined Matusow in saying the project demanded
a heavy time commitment in its early stages, sometimes involving
four meetings a week, each lasting up to six hours. Plus, Matusow
said, the technical nature of the information provided was
overwhelming before experts were hired.
</P>
<P>
   That aspect limited public input, argued Ted Smith, executive
director of the San Jose-based Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition .
</P>
<P>
   Smith also claimed that Project XL benefited Intel far more than
Valley residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got the grand slam of regulatory relief,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The group helped organize more than 100 labor and environmental
leaders voicing concerns over Project XL when it was introduced.
But it became difficult to rally lawmakers to its cause, he said,
so their concerns were never fully addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental community in Arizona is pretty small to
begin with and pretty demoralized,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, another member of the Project XL citizens group who is also
an environmentalist said Intel and the program have worked to
increase public accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the industries in the Valley followed their example,
they'd pollute less,'' said Steve Brittle, president of Don't Waste
Arizona. ``These people at Intel are refreshingly different.''
</P>
<P>
   One example Brittle offered and Chandler city officials have
cited is Intel's processing of wastewater to near drinking-quality
purity before returning it to the aquifer.

 &HT;    HAYWORTH'S PAC LUCKY IN GAMING CASH(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By REPORTER NAME(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Three years ago, Rep. J.D. Hayworth orchestrated the
defeat of a $1.9billion tax on Indian gaming.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's cashing in on that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth has raised more than $60,000 from Indian gaming
interests for his political action committee, including donations
from 15 Indian nations with gambling, according to federal campaign
finance records.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottsdale congressman's committee, called TEAM PAC, raised
about $80,000 through May. And most of that cash is being funneled
to Republican House and Senate candidates who might not know much
of the money comes from gaming interests.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, calls the situation ``fascinating'' and compares it to
attempts by the tobacco industry to camouflage campaign
contributions by donating through subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the potentials of leadership PACs is to act as money
laundries - to take money from radioactive sources that might be
embarrassing and filter it to candidates,'' Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think it's quite extraordinary to have two-thirds of the
money of a leadership PAC coming from one industry. That's very
unusual. And particularly since he's giving to conservative
candidates who might have real problems taking money from gambling
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   OTHER INTERESTS
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP lawmaker downplays the gaming ties, pointing out
that Indian nations have many economic interests besides gambling.
Hayworth, like many conservatives, opposes gambling. But he says he
recognizes it is legal and that tribal sovereignty must be
respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``For better or worse, when Congress passed the Indian Gaming
Act in 1986, that offered another avenue that perhaps I would not
advocate for economic opportunity. Yet it is what is part and
parcel of a free people,'' Hayworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth points to Gila River Farms and high-tech businesses on
the Navajo Reservation as examples of other businesses that are
thriving on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think across Indian country as tribes move toward economic
empowerment, what we're finding is a commonality of interests:
lower taxes, more jobs, more opportunity and no taxation in
tribally owned enterprises,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just so happens that one out of every four of my
constituents is Native American. I take a look at the big picture.
And yes, to a certain degree it does involve economic enterprises
that involve gaming. But that's not the totality of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all of the Indian nations that donated to TEAM PAC
operate gaming businesses. The committee is a leadership PAC, a
legal tool used by members of political parties to funnel thousands
of dollars into tightly contested congressional races. The
committees also are a way for ambitious officeholders seeking to
build support for leadership posts and establish national networks
they can tap to help their own election bids down the line.
</P>
<P>
   Makinson said Indian nations and gaming interests are rapidly
increasing donations to political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've exploded,'' he said. ``The casino and gaming industry
is the fastest growing industry that there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bohnee, a spokesman for the Gila River Indian Community,
said political involvement is a natural outgrowth of Indian
nations' growing economic success. He pointed out that Hayworth has
supported a number of other issues besides gaming, including water
rights and tribal sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's $4,000 donation to TEAM PAC, Bohnee said, was to
support Hayworth's efforts in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is fortunate to be in the position to offer
assistance in that regard,'' Bohnee said, adding that Indian tribes
have discovered what many groups have known for years about the
power of campaign money in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to get in the door. It's fair to say that a lot of
the actions happen in Congress come from the relationships that are
developed with members.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kate Spilde, director of research for the National Indian
Gaming Association, says the infusion of money from gaming has
given tribes much more power at the national level. But she says
that comes not from campaign donations, but from the solidarity
that pursuing the issue creates.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Indian nations traditionally lean Democratic,
Spilde said tribes are branching out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling creates strange bedfellows,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   NO PROBLEM WITH SOURCE
</P>
<P>
   Several of the more than 20 campaigns that have accepted
donations from TEAM PAC were contacted for this story. Only two,
Reps. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., and Merrill Cook, R-Utah, responded.
</P>
<P>
   Both said they had no problem taking the money.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Humphrey, Cook's chief of staff, pointed out there's
little gambling in Utah, where most voters oppose it. She said Cook
didn't know that the $1,000 TEAM PAC donation to his campaign
contained money from gaming interests. But she added he probably
would have accepted the money anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And Bilbray's chief of staff, John Woodard, said the only two
groups Bilbray refuses to accept money from are the tobacco
industry and the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not seen as a negative,''' Woodard said. ``A lot of the
tribes are using the money to improve local communities, and that's
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth says he isn't surprised to see his colleagues accept
the donations. He vows to continue to build connections between
conservatives and Indian nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no permanent adversaries,'' Hayworth said. ``There
are, instead, when it comes to the first Americans, only permanent
interests. And to the extent that our majority can find a common
interest with Native Americans across the broad spectrum of
economic endeavors, I welcome that.''

 &HT;    MCCAIN RELEASES HIS DELEGATES(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By JEFF BARKER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHILADELPHIA) - An encounter with hecklers during a speech
Sunday demonstrated for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the difficulty
of trying to straddle two political worlds.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bizarre day - one that only an unorthodox politician
like McCain could have.
</P>
<P>
   On the day before the opening of the Republican National
Convention, McCain found himself being booed and hissed inside a
college auditorium during a ``Shadow Convention'' intended to offer
a hip alternative to the button-down GOP version. Almost all the
other prominent Republicans in town stayed away.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, McCain was basking in the glow of a tribute to his
aborted presidential campaign by his former delegates and campaign
staff. Confetti rained from a ballroom ceiling, and McCain choked
back tears as he freed the delegates to vote for soon-to-be nominee
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good fight, my friends,'' McCain said. ``I release
all of these delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   The day's highs and lows grew out of the dual agenda that McCain
is pursuing here.
</P>
<P>
   As a senior GOP leader, he is dutifully trying to rally
independent voters to back Bush, and will address the convention in
that regard Tuesday night. But he is also playing a second role
here: a government reform crusader who seems to stand outside his
party and at times is even disdainful of it.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, McCain's worlds clashed.
</P>
<P>
   He was shouted down, and nearly walked out, as he addressed a
rowdy audience at the Shadow Convention, which is across town from
the real one.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing McCain, syndicated columnist Arianna Huffington
foreshadowed the heckling when she said he is engaged in ``a
special high-wire act'' and is trying to be a reformer ``within the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shadow Convention will spend the next five days mocking
politicians for catering to wealthy special interests, and
criticizing the gap between rich and poor and ``the failed war on
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   A noisy segment of the predominantly college-age crowd couldn't
handle McCain's blend of party loyalist and reform crusader. They
whooped and applauded when he spoke of shaking up the political
system, but some booed and hissed when he said he ``would urge all
Americans to support my party's nominee, Gov. George Bush of
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain hesitated, then resumed his praise of Bush as ``the
candidate who offers change.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School
auditorium soon interrupted again with shouts of ``Wrong!'' and
``This isn't why we're here!''
</P>
<P>
   McCain paused, then said, ``If you like, I do not need to
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Huffington implored the crowd to be respectful. More catcalls
followed, though McCain was able to finish his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, McCain said the interruptions were simply part of
politics. ``We can't shut them out of the political process, and
I'm glad they're in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the experience pointed to a critical question facing
McCain: Can he keep faith with the GOP without abandoning those who
see him as an independent voice?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a balancing act,'' said Rick Davis, McCain's former
campaign manager. ``John McCain looks at the field and you get two
choices, and who is closer to getting through his reform agenda?
It's George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain offered a lukewarm endorsement of Bush after the
primaries, and says he'll set aside time to campaign for him before
November. Senior Bush campaign officials joined McCain on Sunday
when he formally released his delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans also believe McCain breached etiquette by
not retiring his campaign bus, the ``Straight Talk Express,'' which
he rode to Philadelphia with scores of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, John McCain is a crusade, and he is a crusade
that transcends this process that's under way whereby each party
picks its nominee,'' said Terry Madonna, a political expert at
Pennsylvania's Millersville University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate is not filled with giants anymore, and McCain has
become a movement,'' Madonna said.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna also said the Bush campaign may have mixed feelings
about McCain. On the one hand, McCain can help Bush by attracting
swing voters - independents and Democrats. On the other, McCain
could siphon away interest from Bush if he is not deferential to
the party nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think being deferential is a role that anybody ought
to play,'' said former Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., a McCain ally
now backing Bush. ``Respectful, yes. Deferential, no. And he is
very respectful of Gov. Bush.''

 &HT;    A MODEL POLLUTION PROGRAM(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BRUNO J. NAVARRO(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - The idea was simple: Intel would voluntarily add
pollution controls at its computer chip plant in Chandler in
exchange for less regulatory red tape.
</P>
<P>
   That was four years ago. Now, company officials, government
representatives and at least one environmentalist praise the
federal program as a model that benefits businesses and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the program, Intel has published information on
the Web about its air emissions, has exceeded wastewater treatment
standards and recycled wooden crates used to transport equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we're fully built out, the microchip plant will be
the largest in the world, and we're still a minor source for air
emissions,'' said Jim Larsen, manager of strategic programs for
Intel. ``It's phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the program relies too heavily on the honor
system and leaves open the potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody actually goes out there and does testing,'' said Dave
Matusow, a member of Intel's citizens advisory group. ``Even though
there's technology to do that, it's not actually utilized.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which is building the $2 billion Fab-22 computer chip
manufacturing plant in Chandler, was among the first to sign up
with Project XL in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton touted the federal program as a way to boost
environmental protections while reducing regulatory burdens on big
business.
</P>
<P>
   Watchdog groups criticized the program before it was
implemented, arguing that it gave too much freedom to large
companies without providing equal benefits to the communities that
would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's Larsen said Project XL has led to increased
accountability because the company publishes on its Web site
detailed environmental information, ranging from chemical recycling
to emissions of air pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Company resources, Larsen said, are available to do that because
Intel doesn't constantly have to file paperwork that can climb into
the tens of thousands of pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money's going into environmental performance instead of
meeting regulations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what concerns Matusow, a software programmer who
volunteered to join the Project XL advisory group.
</P>
<P>
   Intel will be allowed to build its 360,000-square-foot facility
- among the world's largest - without seeking any additional
environmental permits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Matusow acknowledges that Intel's willingness to publish its
environmental information is ``superior to what had been
required.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Crumbaker of the Maricopa County Environmental Services
Department said this was one of the program's highlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the strongest benefits {hellip} was the presentation of
information in a form the local community can understand,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has published on the Web vast amounts of detailed
information each quarter about its emissions, making it available
to anyone with access to the Internet. The site is at
www.intel.com/intel/oth er/ehs/projectxl/.
</P>
<P>
   However, Crumbaker joined Matusow in saying the project demanded
a heavy time commitment in its early stages, sometimes involving
four meetings a week, each lasting up to six hours. Plus, Matusow
said, the technical nature of the information provided was
overwhelming before experts were hired.
</P>
<P>
   That aspect limited public input, argued Ted Smith, executive
director of the San Jose-based Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition .
</P>
<P>
   Smith also claimed that Project XL benefited Intel far more than
Valley residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got the grand slam of regulatory relief,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The group helped organize more than 100 labor and environmental
leaders voicing concerns over Project XL when it was introduced.
But it became difficult to rally lawmakers to its cause, he said,
so their concerns were never fully addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental community in Arizona is pretty small to
begin with and pretty demoralized,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, another member of the Project XL citizens group who is also
an environmentalist said Intel and the program have worked to
increase public accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the industries in the Valley followed their example,
they'd pollute less,'' said Steve Brittle, president of Don't Waste
Arizona. ``These people at Intel are refreshingly different.''
</P>
<P>
   One example Brittle offered and Chandler city officials have
cited is Intel's processing of wastewater to near drinking-quality
purity before returning it to the aquifer.

 &HT;    HAYWORTH'S PAC LUCKY IN GAMING CASH(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By REPORTER NAME(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Three years ago, Rep. J.D. Hayworth orchestrated the
defeat of a $1.9billion tax on Indian gaming.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's cashing in on that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth has raised more than $60,000 from Indian gaming
interests for his political action committee, including donations
from 15 Indian nations with gambling, according to federal campaign
finance records.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottsdale congressman's committee, called TEAM PAC, raised
about $80,000 through May. And most of that cash is being funneled
to Republican House and Senate candidates who might not know much
of the money comes from gaming interests.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, calls the situation ``fascinating'' and compares it to
attempts by the tobacco industry to camouflage campaign
contributions by donating through subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the potentials of leadership PACs is to act as money
laundries - to take money from radioactive sources that might be
embarrassing and filter it to candidates,'' Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think it's quite extraordinary to have two-thirds of the
money of a leadership PAC coming from one industry. That's very
unusual. And particularly since he's giving to conservative
candidates who might have real problems taking money from gambling
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   OTHER INTERESTS
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP lawmaker downplays the gaming ties, pointing out
that Indian nations have many economic interests besides gambling.
Hayworth, like many conservatives, opposes gambling. But he says he
recognizes it is legal and that tribal sovereignty must be
respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``For better or worse, when Congress passed the Indian Gaming
Act in 1986, that offered another avenue that perhaps I would not
advocate for economic opportunity. Yet it is what is part and
parcel of a free people,'' Hayworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth points to Gila River Farms and high-tech businesses on
the Navajo Reservation as examples of other businesses that are
thriving on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think across Indian country as tribes move toward economic
empowerment, what we're finding is a commonality of interests:
lower taxes, more jobs, more opportunity and no taxation in
tribally owned enterprises,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just so happens that one out of every four of my
constituents is Native American. I take a look at the big picture.
And yes, to a certain degree it does involve economic enterprises
that involve gaming. But that's not the totality of the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all of the Indian nations that donated to TEAM PAC
operate gaming businesses. The committee is a leadership PAC, a
legal tool used by members of political parties to funnel thousands
of dollars into tightly contested congressional races. The
committees also are a way for ambitious officeholders seeking to
build support for leadership posts and establish national networks
they can tap to help their own election bids down the line.
</P>
<P>
   Makinson said Indian nations and gaming interests are rapidly
increasing donations to political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've exploded,'' he said. ``The casino and gaming industry
is the fastest growing industry that there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bohnee, a spokesman for the Gila River Indian Community,
said political involvement is a natural outgrowth of Indian
nations' growing economic success. He pointed out that Hayworth has
supported a number of other issues besides gaming, including water
rights and tribal sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's $4,000 donation to TEAM PAC, Bohnee said, was to
support Hayworth's efforts in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is fortunate to be in the position to offer
assistance in that regard,'' Bohnee said, adding that Indian tribes
have discovered what many groups have known for years about the
power of campaign money in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to get in the door. It's fair to say that a lot of
the actions happen in Congress come from the relationships that are
developed with members.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kate Spilde, director of research for the National Indian
Gaming Association, says the infusion of money from gaming has
given tribes much more power at the national level. But she says
that comes not from campaign donations, but from the solidarity
that pursuing the issue creates.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Indian nations traditionally lean Democratic,
Spilde said tribes are branching out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling creates strange bedfellows,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   NO PROBLEM WITH SOURCE
</P>
<P>
   Several of the more than 20 campaigns that have accepted
donations from TEAM PAC were contacted for this story. Only two,
Reps. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., and Merrill Cook, R-Utah, responded.
</P>
<P>
   Both said they had no problem taking the money.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Humphrey, Cook's chief of staff, pointed out there's
little gambling in Utah, where most voters oppose it. She said Cook
didn't know that the $1,000 TEAM PAC donation to his campaign
contained money from gaming interests. But she added he probably
would have accepted the money anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And Bilbray's chief of staff, John Woodard, said the only two
groups Bilbray refuses to accept money from are the tobacco
industry and the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not seen as a negative,''' Woodard said. ``A lot of the
tribes are using the money to improve local communities, and that's
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth says he isn't surprised to see his colleagues accept
the donations. He vows to continue to build connections between
conservatives and Indian nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no permanent adversaries,'' Hayworth said. ``There
are, instead, when it comes to the first Americans, only permanent
interests. And to the extent that our majority can find a common
interest with Native Americans across the broad spectrum of
economic endeavors, I welcome that.''

 &HT;    `BLOOD SIMPLE' STAR TALKS(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Coen brothers scored a coup when they recruited M. Emmet
Walsh to star in their 1984 low-budget thriller, (beginitalic)Blood
Simple.
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)After all, he was veteran actor. And he really knew
how to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did six movies one year, and they killed me in five of
them,'' Walsh said in an interview. ``I said, `Are they hiring me
because I'm talented, or because I give them a wide target?'''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, 65, passed along his sage advice to another actor in
(beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), which is being re-released on
the big screen Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (him) to die in a comfortable position,'' Walsh said.
``You're going to be there for three days. If you die in an awkward
position, they're going to have to keep going back to it, and
you're going to cramp.''
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen more than a few American movies, you've probably
seen Walsh, a noted character actor who has played a variety of
roles, from the deranged, can-shooting sniper in (beginitalic)The
Jerk (enditalic)to Harrison Ford's laconic boss in
(beginitalic)Blade Runner(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who got his big break opposite Dustin Hoffman in
(beginitalic)Straight Time(enditalic), said he's always amazed at
how people remember his lines, like his graphic description of a
car accident in (beginitalic)Raising Arizona(enditalic), another
Coen brothers' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this spherical object in the road,'' Walsh's
character opines. ``And it wasn't a part of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   For (beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), Walsh gave some
personal touches to his character, a seedy private detective who
favored yellow leisure suits and straw cowboy hats.
</P>
<P>
   As a metaphor, Walsh kept acting even as flies landed on him.
That was especially hard in one scene, which included some not so
freshly caught fish among the props.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your instinct is to swat (the flies). It just drove you
crazy,'' Walsh said. But rather than lose a take, ``I just let them
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh didn't have much of a take on (beginitalic)Blood Simple
(enditalic)when the Coen brothers first called his agent in the
early '80s. Joel and Ethan Coen were green rookies. They couldn't
even pay him. Eventually, he agreed to do the movie for a small
percentage of the gross, not that he thought there would be any.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character was kind of fun,'' Walsh said. ``I thought, I'll
flesh this guy out, this Sydney Greenstreet type of thing, and in
seven or eight years somebody's going to offer me the character in
a real movie, and I'll have an idea how to play him.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who was filming the Meryl Streep movie
(beginitalic)Silkwood (enditalic)in Dallas at the time, made the
trek back and forth to Austin, where (beginitalic)Blood Simple
(enditalic)was shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said the set was a riot. The director of photography,
Barry Sonnenfeld (who would go on to direct (beginitalic)Get Shorty
(enditalic)and (beginitalic)Men in Black(enditalic)) had never used
a 35mm camera before. Much of the prop and special effects work was
done by volunteers from the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you turned around, they were reinventing the
wheel,'' Walsh said. ``It was like, how do you put rain on a
windshield?''
</P>
<P>
   The Coens were stumped when it came time for Walsh's character
to blow smoke rings. Walsh, a non-smoker, tried without success.
The Coens brought in a machine, but it also failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, the assistant prop girl, this little Texas farm girl
says, `Give me that cigar. I grew up with five brothers, and we
spent all our time behind the barn.' She takes the cigar and blam,
she knocks out a smoke ring{hellip}I thought isn't this wonderful,
this is the way movies get made.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who won an independent film award for his part in
(beginitalic)Blood Simple, (enditalic)admits he never expected the
movie to take off. At the time, he placed its chances as ``slim and
nil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't lucky, but they were lucky,'' he said of the
Coens. ``You can't be 27 and 29 years old and make a movie that
good.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it worked out better than Walsh ever expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time the Coen brothers do a new movie, they talk about
(beginitalic)Blood Simple (enditalic)again and they talk about
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So what do they ask?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he dead?''

 &HT;    IT'S `BLOOD SIMPLE' TO KNOW YOUR NOIR(a)  &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Audiences didn't know what to make of (beginitalic)Blood Simple
(enditalic)when it first popped up in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In the era of (beginitalic)E.T. (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Raiders of the Lost Ark(enditalic), here was a dark,
claustrophobic movie made on a tiny budget, with no big names in
the cast. The film's creators were two rookies: Joel and Ethan
Coen. The ``star'' was character actor M. Emmet Walsh, backed up by
an unknown actress named Frances McDormand.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way to tell the good guys from the bad guys. Every
time you thought you felt solid ground, a plot twist knocked you
off your feet. The whole thing just smacked of originality.
</P>
<P>
   But the style only seemed new. (beginitalic)Blood
Simple(enditalic), which was being re-released as a ``director's
cut'' in theaters Friday, was actually an homage to film noir, a
term coined by the French to describe American films released near
the end and in the aftermath of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hallmark of film noir is its sense of people trapped,''
Robert Sklar writes in (beginitalic)Movie-Made America,
(enditalic)''trapped in webs of paranoia and fear, unable to tell
guilt from innocence, true identity from false.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its villains are attractive and sympathetic, masking greed,
misanthropy, malevolence. Its heroes and heroines are weak,
confused, susceptible to false impressions.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly Steven Spielberg, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the titles are familiar: (beginitalic)The
Killers(enditalic) (1946), (beginitalic)Double Indemnity
(enditalic)(1944), (beginitalic)Out of the Past (enditalic)(1947).
They are gritty, atmospheric films with reluctant heroes, scheming
females and ambiguous endings. They were underproduced, perhaps as
Hollywood's reaction to its own excesses.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), which touches all the
bases, gained a cult following through video rentals and gradually
became known as a classic. After the now-famous Coens opened the
door, Hollywood walked through it, cranking out more noir-type
movies, such as (beginitalic)The Last Seduction, Red Rock West
(enditalic)and the popular (beginitalic)L.A. Confidential.
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)Some were faithful to the noir style, while others
were simply made to look like noir while copping out in the end. So
as you watch (beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), here's a
checklist of what makes good noir:
</P>
<P>
   1) Low production values - These are not high-budget
productions, at least in terms of lighting and sets. For the
perfect template, take a look at (beginitalic)Detour
(enditalic)(1945), about a hitchhiker who takes a fatal wrong turn.
</P>
<P>
   2) The anti-hero - The main characters have to be slow on the
uptake (Burt Lancaster in (beginitalic)The Killers(enditalic)) or
at least disillusioned (Robert Mitchum in (beginitalic)Out of the
Past(enditalic)). They're not motivated by honor or duty, but by
greed or simply self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   3) The femme fatale - Here's where (beginitalic)L.A.
Confidential (enditalic)loses it, with Kim Basinger as the hooker
with the heart of gold. Noir women are almost universally evil,
from the vicious Peggy Cummins in (beginitalic)Gun Crazy
(enditalic)to the diabolical Linda Fiorentino in (beginitalic)The
Last Seduction(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   4) Plenty of double-crosses - You can't trust anybody in a noir
film, especially the people you're sleeping with. Just ask Fred
MacMurray, who was charmed by Barbara Stanwyck's anklet in
(beginitalic)Double Indemnity(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   5) A strong crime element - Most of the best noir movies involve
private detectives or cops. There are some ((beginitalic)Sunset
Blvd., Lost Weekend(enditalic)) that stray more toward the
psychological, but trench coats and guns really help set the mood.
</P>
<P>
   6) No happy ending - The hero doesn't live, or at least doesn't
escape jail. Despite Hollywood's penchant for pat endings, the noir
hero rarely survives the film, either because he doesn't tumble to
the bushwhack or he turns out to be a stand-up guy after all.
</P>
<P>
   7) Snappy dialogue - Edward G. Robinson to MacMurray in
(beginitalic)Double Indemnity(enditalic): ``Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter. You're just a little taller.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. So head for the video store, and then
(beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), and you'll know your noir for
sure.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Journalist Elizabeth Taylor's history professor once told her
that the perfect subject for a biography should be a scoundrel.
</P>
<P>
   A dead one.
</P>
<P>
   She took that advice to heart when she began her biography of
one-time Chicago Mayor Richard Daley. Daley fit Taylor's criteria:
dead since 1976 and known for the strong-arm tactics with which he
ruled the Windy City for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)American Pharaoh: Mayor Richard J. Daley: His
Battle for Chicago and the Nation(enditalic) is just one of the new
biographies being published this year that probe the lives of
famous people from football great Walter Payton to the late
Japanese emperor Hirohito to American newspaper luminary William
Randolph Hearst to Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Though novels dominate the book trade, biographies are a steady
source of revenue, one of the staple items in the bookseller's
pantry. Even Edmund Morris' offbeat 1999 biography of Ronald Reagan
couldn't kill the genre, though no other author has been inspired
to imitate Morris' controversial style of inserting himself
fictionally into his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fascination with people's lives and the time in
which they lived,'' says Terry Adams, an editor at Little, Brown &AMP;
Co., which published (beginitalic)American Pharaoh(enditalic).
``It's a genre that's of perennial interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the nascent biographical genre created by Plutarch
(A.D. 46-119) in (beginitalic)Parallel Lives(enditalic), the
tradition began in earnest during the second century with the
creation of hagiography, in which monks penned the lives of
Christian saints as role models for their congregations.
</P>
<P>
   Today's biographies glorify both the mighty and the lowly. They
fall into two categories: serious, historical works (Carl
Sandburg's (beginitalic)Abraham Lincoln(enditalic), James Boswell's
(beginitalic)The Life of Samuel Johnson(enditalic)) and Kitty
Kelly-style pop-culture treatments ((beginitalic)Jackie
Oh!(enditalic), (beginitalic)The Unauthorized Biography of Frank
Sinatra(enditalic), countless volumes on Princess Diana).
</P>
<P>
   Though most subjects are well known, ordinary people can also
make for fascinating reading - if their story is compelling and
well written or if they rose to fame from humble beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really curious about the famous, how they went from
obscurity to re- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   known,'' says Gayle Shanks, book buyer for Changing Hands
bookstore in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   And, says Adams, ``It has to be a life that resonates today.''
</P>
<P>
   When America needs heroes, he notes, it embraces stories about
people like Charles Lindberg in such works as A. Scott Berg's 1998
(beginitalic)Lindberg(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   As author Taylor learned, however, biographical subjects need
not be heroic. The Library of Congress lists 351 biographies of
Adolf Hitler, including 1999's (beginitalic)Explaining Hitler: The
Search for the Origins of His Evil (enditalic)by Ron Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, literary and Sunday magazine editor of the
(beginitalic)Chicago Tribune(enditalic), first considered writing a
biography of Mayor Daley when she moved to Chicago in 1984 from New
York, where she had been a correspondent for (beginitalic)Time
(enditalic)magazine. As she pored over public records and archives
to acquaint herself with her new city, she gleaned the importance
of Daley's legacy and saw him not only as a local politician but
also as someone whose influence spread beyond the city he embodied.
</P>
<P>
   ``All roads led to Daley,'' she discovered.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, she sums up his importance with one of Daley's own
quotes: ``This is Chicago. This is America.''
</P>
<P>
   Although legendary Chicago journalist Mike Royko had authored
(beginitalic)Boss: Richard J. Daley of Chicago(enditalic) in 1971,
Taylor and co-author Adam Cohen believed the definitive work had
not been written. Royko's book violated her tenet of publishing a
biography only after the subject's death and reportedly so offended
Daley's wife that she would walk into stores and turn copies of the
book to face the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and Cohen enjoyed the cooperation of a member of the
Daley family but did not write a whitewashed profile. Nor is it the
standard born-in-a-log-cabin time line of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a `what he had for breakfast' kind of biography.
This is not about his personal life,'' she says. ``What's
interesting is how he intersected with the world and with the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Good biographies put their subjects into that kind of historical
context, says Sarah Gold, editor of forecasts for(beginitalic)
Publishers Weekly,(enditalic) the book industry news magazine.
Analysis helps acquaint the reader with the subject.
</P>
<P>
   An interest in famous people is more than just a penchant for
gossip, Gold says. Some readers gravitate to biographies as a
history lesson, making historical figures popular subjects -
Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   And new information can rekindle interest in an old subject.
When stories about Thomas Jefferson's slave mistress, Sally
Hemings, recently became public, Jefferson was suddenly a hot topic
two centuries after his death. In 1998, Joseph J. Ellis published
(beginitalic)American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas
Jefferson(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   While biographical subjects need not be paragons of virtue, they
must have led interesting lives. A new biography of Cy Young, the
famed 19th-century baseball player who lent his name to a pitching
award, got a lukewarm review from (beginitalic)Publishers
Weekly(enditalic). Young might have been a great pitcher, Gold
says, but his personal life was never major league.
</P>
<P>
   Still, sports figures are always reader favorites. Last
September, David Maraniss published the acclaimed (beginitalic)When
Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi(enditalic). Cyclist
Lance Armstrong, who beat cancer and then won the Tour de France,
has just published his autobiography, (beginitalic)It's Not About
the Bike: My Journey Back to Life.
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic) And just out: (beginitalic)Payne Stewart: The
Authorized Biography(enditalic), the saga of the golf champion who
died in a freak plane journey last October.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic) (enditalic) Lives of celebrated writers also
provide rich fodder for literature. In April, no fewer than two
books on Marcel Proust were published: (beginitalic)Marcel Proust:
A Life(enditalic) by William C. Carter and(beginitalic) Proust's
Way: A Field Guide to In Search of Lost
Time(enditalic)(beginitalic) (enditalic)by Roger Shattuck.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most talked-about books of last fall was
(beginitalic)Secrets of the Flesh: A Life of Colette(enditalic),
Judith Thurman's engrossing tale of the great French writer.
</P>
<P>
   Literary biographies can be a means of interpreting an author's
work, says Judith Sensibar, professor of English at Arizona State
University. Sensibar, a William Faulkner scholar, is writing a
biography that explores Faulkner's relationship with the three most
important women in his life: his mother, Maud; his nanny and former
slave Caroline Barr; and his wife, Estelle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is compelling,'' Sensibar says. ``My objective is to
illuminate the reading of his art.''
</P>
<P>
   Using biographies to illuminate an author's art has gone in and
out of favor, says Sensibar's colleague, ASU English Professor
Randel Helms. During the 1930s and '40s, that approach was dubbed
the ``biographical heresy.'' When Helms was in college in the
1960s, professors taught that biographical information was
irrelevant to the study of an author's work.
</P>
<P>
   But when the so-called New Criticism emerged a decade later,
biography was reborn as a means to understanding literature.
</P>
<P>
   Now Helms embraces literary biography. When teaching the poetry
of William Butler Yeats, for example, he notes that many of Yeats'
poems cannot be understood unless the reader is aware of the poet's
fascination with 19th-century Irish activist Maude Gonne, who
snubbed his repeated marriage proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know that story, those poems don't make sense,''
Helms says. ``You'd be reading them in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Also edifying, he says, is the life of poet Philip Larkin, whose
sweet, romantic poems belied his sexist and racist views.
</P>
<P>
   Biography will remain one of the standards of literature, Shanks
believes. Nearly two millenniums after monks invented the genre,
readers still enjoy snooping into people's lives, whether the
subjects are saints or sinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that changing,'' she says.

<P>
   A peaceful revolution rumbled across Mexico on July 2, driven by
a charismatic reformer, a Mexican original who somehow combines the
cowboy self-confidence of a John Wayne with the Latin man-from-the
country earnestness of a Juan Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   With his thundering victory at the ballot box, Vicente Fox
Quesada , who will take office Dec. 1, defied not only six months
of political polls that had shown him in a tight race with the
candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. He also
broke the spell of seven decades of Mexican history that had seen
the party dominate the political and psychological landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa said the PRI had erected
``the perfect dictatorship.'' Until Fox's stunning victory, power
was handed down by presidents who named their successors. an
imperial gesture that made elections empty rituals. Party boss and
labor leader Fidel Velasquez once said that the PRI was so strong
that only bullets could drive it from Los Pinos, the Mexican White
House.
</P>
<P>
   After a night of celebration in town squares across the country,
Mexico awoke July 3 to a new political era. The Fox landslide had
broken the PRI spell. Almost giddy with delight, many are calling
the election their equivalent of the fall of the Berlin Wall or the
storming of the Bastille in revolutionary France.
</P>
<P>
   ``By making that old and corrupt system of power recognize for
the first time the triumph of an opposition presidential candidate,
we have achieved not just a new government but something much more
important,'' proclaimed historian Lorenzo Meyer. ``We have
accomplished a change in the very nature of our politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was fundamentally the singular achievement of a
remarkable man in black cowboy boots. Vicente Fox captured the
hearts and votes of his countrymen by making himself the defiant
champion of change in a country that was primed to repudiate the
PRI. With his relentless determination and unshakable confidence,
he inspired Mexicans to imagine what many had thought was
inconceivable: life without the PRI in the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's triumph, on his 58th birthday, culminated a long political
journey that was propelled by his father's appetite for hard work,
his spirit of social engagement instilled by the Jesuits, his
growing fury with PRI arrogance and corruption and his powerful
sense of destiny as an agent of change.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the grandson of an Irish-American from Ohio, was born in
1942, the second of nine children in a family that owned a ranch
and farm in the central Mexican state of Guanajato. He recalls his
father as an intense, joyful man with a determined appetite for
work. ``It didn't matter what time the party ended, at 6 o'clock in
the morning - in the days before Alka-Seltzer - he was up and
working.'' Fox wrote in his autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   After completing his studies at the Jesuit-operated Universidad
Iberoamericana in Mexico City, Fox began work in 1964 for
Coca-Cola. He advanced steadily from his earliest days as a route
driver, becoming the company's marketing director in Mexico and
ultimately the head of its operations in that country. Coke sent
him to Harvard for a graduate education in business.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox always felt himself drawn to a life of social
engagement. When he was not helping Coke overtake Pepsi as the top
seller of soft drinks in Mexico, he was helping found
rehabilitation centers for alcoholics and addicts. He and his
then-wife, who adopted their four children, would later help to
found an orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a big company like Coca-Cola, there isn't much that one can
accomplish in terms of personal satisfaction,'' Fox said. In 1974,
at a college reunion, one of the Jesuits who taught at the
university fortified Fox's resolve to leave Coca-Cola. The Rev.
Xavier Scheifler stunned the group when he angrily chastised them
for ignoring social responsibilities in their quest for individual
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an experience that solidified my conviction that I
should work with others, for others,'' Fox wrote. Five years later,
he turned down a promotion that would have made him Coke's top man
for all of Latin America. He decided to return home to the state of
Guanajuato, where his family was branching out from farming into
pigs, stables and cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for boots exploded after John Travolta's
(beginitalic)Urban Cowboy(enditalic) movie made Western fashion a
fad across the United States. But after bringing the Fox craftsmen
a brief flood of orders from around the world, the boom quickly
faded, leaving them stuck with merchandise they couldn't sell. Fox
recalls that the downturn cost the family about $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval that Travolta brought to the Fox family was nothing
compared to the influence of a brashly self-confident vegetable
farmer from the state of Sinaloa who in 1988 ran for the presidency
under the banner of the conservative National Action Party, or PAN.
Big, bearded and blunt, he was Manuel Clouthier, one of the
so-called broncos who were determined to buck the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   This was a time of seismic rumblings in the political terrain, a
shaking that would eventually produce the Fox earthquake of 2000.
The Mexico City newspaper (beginitalic)El
(enditalic)(beginitalic)Universal (enditalic)was reporting on a
``democratic awakening'' to challenge the political order. Octavio
Paz, the writer and intellectual and unofficial conscience of
Mexico, declared that the country had begun ``a gradual,
irreversible change toward modern democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The most determined revolt against the PRI was under way in
Chihuahua, where furious Panistas had begun taking to the streets
in 1986 to protest a massive PRI steal-the-vote campaign that had
hijacked the governor's election. They seized bridges connecting
Juarez to El Paso, drawing international attention as they mocked
the PRI's claim to have won through elections that were ``clean and
transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Clouthier became the passionate leader of Mexican outrage. With
a bold fury that astonished Mexico, he denounced the PRI and
proclaimed his determination to ``return national sovereignty to
where it must reside, in the people themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the fresh troops whom Clouthier summoned to political
battle was Vicente Fox, who recalls a call he received from the big
Sinaloan, urging that Fox get involved politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Listen, Fox, we're always complaining about the
system, about the dishonesty, the corruption,''' Fox recalls, ``But
we don't do anything to change it. Let's do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clouthier, who died in a 1989 traffic wreck that his family
believes was a PRI-sponsored assassination, became Fox's political
patron. Clouthier inspired Fox to undertake a 1988 run for the
Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the federal legislature.
One of Fox's first acts there was to ridicule as fraudulent the
election of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
</P>
<P>
   Fox took two allegedly bogus ballots, rolled them into cones,
then taped them to the sides of his head in mockery of Salinas'
oversized ears. Then, acting as if he was Salinas, he offered an
explanation of the electoral trickery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've felt obligated to ask many of my friends to set aside
moral scruples to help me achieve this victory, which I had to do
because Mexico isn't ready for democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's show reportedly infuriated Salinas and likely sparked the
all-out PRI effort to challenge Fox in his 1991 bid to become
governor of Guanajuato. When the PRI-dominated electoral commission
reported a PRI victory, Fox led thousands of supporters into the
streets and offered evidence of well-practiced PRI tactics of
ballot box stuffing and voter intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government is a criminal organization that used Mafia
tactics of electoral engineering,'' Fox said in a thundering voice.
``They bought votes; they threatened to throw people out of their
jobs if they didn't vote for the official party. They told taxi
drivers they would lose their licenses. They annulled our votes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fox-led protests threw the state into turmoil and forced
Salinas to ask his machine candidate to resign. But rather than
concede to Fox, Salinas arranged for the PRI-dominated state
legislature to appoint another Panista as governor. Fox would run
again three years later and win an overwhelming victory.
</P>
<P>
   He was, by all accounts, a successful governor, who attacked
unemployment by promoting business development and attracting
investment. He also showed a spirit of inclusiveness and
reconciliation by naming a PRI member to be the state's minister of
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is, above all, a pragmatist. He avoids being backed into
ideological corners and works to build consensus. On the evening of
July 2, when it had become clear that he would be Mexico's next
president, he made a magnanimous statement, promising that his
administration would be ``inclusive and pluralistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox remains the crusading idealist. He has vowed to take on
corrupt cops and judges, to build the economy from the bottom up by
providing loans to small businesses that have long been denied bank
credits. He vows that he will appoint ministers because of their
competence rather than their political capital
</P>
<P>
   Said Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, one of the Mexican liberals who
rallied to Fox's banner, ``He is going to breathe new life into a
country that for too long was politically demoralized by the PRI.''

July 2, when it had become clear that he would be Mexico's next
president, he made a magnanimous statement, promising that his
administration would be ``inclusive and pluralistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox remains the crusading idealist. He has vowed to take on
corrupt cops and judges, to build the economy from the bottom up by
providing loans to small businesses that have long been denied bank
credits. He vows that he will appoint ministers because of their
competence rather than their political capital
</P>
<P>
   Said Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, one of the Mexican liberals who
rallied to Fox's banner, ``He is going to breathe new life into a
country that for too long was politically demoralized by the PRI.''

   ``AMERICAN RHAPSODY''
</P>
<P>
   ByJoe Eszterhas

<P>
   (Knopf, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   We'll say right upfront that we felt as if we earned our salary
for the next five years as we struggled through this book, a
quagmire of gonzo posturing and other strange liberties to which
Eszterhas believes he's entitled. The former (beginitalic)Rolling

such scintillating films as (beginitalic)Showgirls(enditalic) and
(beginitalic)Basic Instinct(enditalic)(beginitalic), (enditalic)
now shows us the real Bill Clinton or, as Eszterhas' friend, Jann
Wenner, called him, ``the first rock and roll president in American
history.'' Eszterhas was mesmerized by the Monica Lewinsky sex
scandal. He devoured the Starr report, watched it on television,
read about it in magazines. Maybe they are his sources for the
garish ``non-fiction'' sections here, but he never really makes
that clear (there are fictional parts too, including a chapter
narrated by ``Willard,'' the most famous part of Clinton's
anatomy). Read this at your own risk. And remember: No one's paying

</P>
<P>
   Lizards, Cherry notes, predate dinosaurs, continents, even -
gasp! - (beginitalic)S(enditalic)(beginitalic)trom
Thurmond(enditalic). If that doesn't leave you hungry for more, you
are a hard sell. This brief, well-illustrated book tells you
everything you always wanted to know about lizards and a lot you
could have done without but aren't troubled to hear, such as the
fact that a monitor lizard can run 10 mph to catch the wild pigs it
likes for supper or that its mouth is so full of bacteria that its
bite will kill its victim within a day or two even if it gets away.
Cherry also includes general information on lizards in myth, art
and advertising and in film (we were delighted to see not just
(beginitalic)Godzilla(enditalic) and (beginitalic)Journey to the

Freshman(enditalic), Andrew Bergman's comedy in which a Komodo

   ``POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK''
</P>
<P>
   By Benjamin Franklin
</P>
<P>
   (Modern Library, $10.95)
</P>
<P>
   Early to bed and early to rise makes a man miss pretty much
everything good on TV. That's Ben Franklin updated by Dave Barry in
his introduction to this new edition. Barry is hilarious, in fact,
as he questions the wisdom of a few of Franklin's statements -
particularly ``if your head is wax, don't walk in the sun'' - and
heartily endorses others. ``Poor Richard advocates diligence,
self-reliance, frugality and honesty,'' writes Barry. ``He disdains
laziness, extravagance, pretense and immodesty. It goes without
saying that he hates lawyers.'' This is one of the first four books
in the Modern Library Humor and Wit series. Others are
(beginitalic)Mark Twain's Library of Humor(enditalic), with an
introduction by Roy Blount, Jr.; (beginitalic)Most of the Most of
S.J. Perelman(enditalic); and (beginitalic)Crazy Salad: Some Things
About (enditalic)(beginitalic)Women(enditalic) by Nora Ephron. The
series is edited by Steve Martin, who insists that Perelman stole

<P>
   ``BE THE ONE''
</P>
<P>
   By April Smith
</P>
<P>
   (Knopf, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy Sanderson is a formidable woman - tall, blond, athletic
and savvy enough to be a baseball scout for the Dodgers, the only
female scout in the major leagues. The competition to find new
players is stiff, and when she gets a call from an old friend in
the Dominican Republic, she quickly flies down to see the ``pure
hitter'' he has discovered. Alberto Cruz does have talent so
Cassidy signs him and brings him back to Los Angeles, but soon
Alberto begins receiving mysterious blackmail notes. Flashbacks
throughout this novel reveal that the notes are tied to a
mysterious night in the Dominican Republic when Cassidy, Alberto
and a wealthy American businessman drove drunkenly through a
hurricane just before their return to the United States. The novel
is suspenseful and well characterized although longer than it needs
to be. Smith will appear at the Poisoned Pen bookstore. See Book
Signings for details.
</P>
<P>
   ``AN INVISIBLE SIGN OF MY OWN''
</P>
<P>
   By Aimee Bender
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   Bender's odd but very effective first novel is narrated by
20-year-old Mona Gray, a troubled young woman who struggles with
psychological scars and obsessions even as she forms attachments to
some very strange second-graders at her hometown elementary school,
where she has been hired to teach mathematics. Emotionally affected
by her father's poor health since she was 10, Mona is the ultimate
unreliable narrator, her sanity seemingly so fragile that for a
long time we don't know what to make of her. She finds comfort in
numbers - they are the constant force in her mind, her only
reliable port in life's storm. In a voice that is both witty and
spooky, Mona tells us about her students, her family and her inner
life, hinting at potential violence even as she embarks on a sweet
romance with a fellow teacher. It's a mark of Bender's subtle
virtuosity that such a surreal story is ultimately so appealing.
She's a writer to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE DAY JOHN DIED''
</P>
<P>
   By Christopher Andersen
</P>
<P>
   (Morrow, $26)
</P>
<P>
   Andersen opens this book by trying to justify it, alluding to
the ``ocean of grief'' into which we all allegedly plunged upon
hearing of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s death and pointing out Kennedy's
similarities to Princess Diana (which amount to little more than
that both were ``lit from within,'' and we were obsessed with
them). You'll forgive us if we tell you that books like this make
us feel squirrelly as if we're watching a bank heist in progress
and doing nothing to stop it. But Andersen has cased this joint
before (he wrote not only (beginitalic)The Day
(enditalic)(beginitalic)John Died (enditalic)but also
(beginitalic)Jack and Jackie (enditalic)and Jackie After Jack), and
he knows where the money is. Happily, Kennedy comes off well. His
marriage was doing better; his rebellious youth was spent; and he
was, to all appearances, a good man. And we defy you to remain
unmoved at the description of the funeral service, marked by a
stunned and battered family's grief over another gone too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``FROM OUR HOUSE: A MEMOIR''
</P>
<P>
   By Lee Martin
</P>
<P>
   (Dutton, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   This memoir begins with a ghoulish tragedy but becomes the oddly
uplifting story of the author's determination to understand the
dynamics of his own family. In 1956, when Martin was a baby, his
father, Roy, lost both hands in an accident with a harvesting
machine on their 80-acre farm in Illinois. Roy Martin was already a
coarse, difficult man, but his misfortune instilled in him a new
level of anger. Over the years, he beat and berated his son while
Lee's mother looked on. ``I was too young to know then,'' Martin
writes, ``that she was as helpless in my father's house as I.'' But
to dismiss Roy as a villain is to deny the complexities that exist
in unhappy families. Martin explores his own responses to his
father, and so takes his story beyond self-pity and makes it an act
of salvation. His book is an unflinching look at the bonds between
a wounded man and his son and at the stoic perseverance of the
woman who loved them both.
</P>
<P>
   ``WHY WE HURT''
</P>
<P>
   By Frank T. Vertosick
</P>
<P>
   (Harcourt, $24)
</P>
<P>
   It's unsettling, reading about pain. We suspect that any amount
of discourse on specific pain would be easier to take - you have a
migraine, you have a bad back, you're looking for solutions. But
this book, subtitled (beginitalic)The Natural History of
Pain(enditalic), covers the whole gamut of discomfort, and it made
us squirm. Cancer pain, spinal pain, migraine pain, the pain of
childbirth, of carpal tunnel syndrome, of kidney stones or worse.
Vertosick, who is a neurosurgeon, eases the way with his friendly,
nonchalant tone, and he reminds us often that in the grand scheme
of things, pain has a purpose. It is, he says, ``a teacher, the
headmaster of nature's survival school.'' He discusses some of his
own patients and how he alleviated their pain and gives lots of
time, bless him, to the miracle of anesthesia, which he ranks as
one of the great achievements of our age. So do we, but right now
we're going to take some aspirin. We're not sure why.

where she has been hired to teach mathematics. Emotionally affected
by her father's poor health since she was 10, Mona is the ultimate
unreliable narrator, her sanity seemingly so fragile that for a
long time we don't know what to make of her. She finds comfort in
numbers - they are the constant force in her mind, her only
reliable port in life's storm. In a voice that is both witty and
spooky, Mona tells us about her students, her family and her inner
life, hinting at potential violence even as she embarks on a sweet
romance with a fellow teacher. It's a mark of Bender's subtle
virtuosity that such a surreal story is ultimately so appealing.
She's a writer to watch.

   ``THE DAY JOHN DIED''
</P>
<P>
   By Christopher Andersen
</P>
<P>
   (Morrow, $26)
</P>
<P>
   Andersen opens this book by trying to justify it, alluding to
the ``ocean of grief'' into which we all allegedly plunged upon
hearing of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s death and pointing out Kennedy's
similarities to Princess Diana (which amount to little more than
that both were ``lit from within,'' and we were obsessed with
them). You'll forgive us if we tell you that books like this make
us feel squirrelly as if we're watching a bank heist in progress
and doing nothing to stop it. But Andersen has cased this joint
before (he wrote not only (beginitalic)The Day
(enditalic)(beginitalic)John Died (enditalic)but also
(beginitalic)Jack and Jackie (enditalic)and Jackie After Jack), and
he knows where the money is. Happily, Kennedy comes off well. His
marriage was doing better; his rebellious youth was spent; and he
was, to all appearances, a good man. And we defy you to remain
unmoved at the description of the funeral service, marked by a
stunned and battered family's grief over another gone too soon.

<P>
   ``FROM OUR HOUSE: A MEMOIR''
</P>
<P>
   By Lee Martin
</P>
<P>
   (Dutton, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   This memoir begins with a ghoulish tragedy but becomes the oddly
uplifting story of the author's determination to understand the
dynamics of his own family. In 1956, when Martin was a baby, his
father, Roy, lost both hands in an accident with a harvesting
machine on their 80-acre farm in Illinois. Roy Martin was already a
coarse, difficult man, but his misfortune instilled in him a new
level of anger. Over the years, he beat and berated his son while
Lee's mother looked on. ``I was too young to know then,'' Martin
writes, ``that she was as helpless in my father's house as I.'' But
to dismiss Roy as a villain is to deny the complexities that exist
in unhappy families. Martin explores his own responses to his
father, and so takes his story beyond self-pity and makes it an act
of salvation. His book is an unflinching look at the bonds between
a wounded man and his son and at the stoic perseverance of the
woman who loved them both.

<P>
   ``WHY WE HURT''
</P>
<P>
   By Frank T. Vertosick
</P>
<P>
   (Harcourt, $24)
</P>
<P>
   It's unsettling, reading about pain. We suspect that any amount
of discourse on specific pain would be easier to take - you have a
migraine, you have a bad back, you're looking for solutions. But
this book, subtitled (beginitalic)The Natural History of
Pain(enditalic), covers the whole gamut of discomfort, and it made
us squirm. Cancer pain, spinal pain, migraine pain, the pain of
childbirth, of carpal tunnel syndrome, of kidney stones or worse.
Vertosick, who is a neurosurgeon, eases the way with his friendly,
nonchalant tone, and he reminds us often that in the grand scheme
of things, pain has a purpose. It is, he says, ``a teacher, the
headmaster of nature's survival school.'' He discusses some of his
own patients and how he alleviated their pain and gives lots of
time, bless him, to the miracle of anesthesia, which he ranks as
one of the great achievements of our age. So do we, but right now
we're going to take some aspirin. We're not sure why.

MICHIGAN DELEGATES PREDICT BUSH VICTORY IN FALL &HT;    By ERIC ROSENBERG
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Michigan State Sen. Bill Schuette, one of the
state's 58 delegates to the Republican National Convention,
predicted Sunday that Texas Gov. George W. Bush will carry the
state in November, despite an unpredictable and fiercely
independent electorate that voted for Bill Clinton in 1996 and
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Schuette, a former congressman who represents the Midland
region, said Bush has broad enough appeal to attract
independent-minded Republicans, Democrats and union members of both
parties, who helped tip the Feb. 22 GOP primary in favor of Ariz.
Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a lot of hard work and effort, yes, Bush will win
Michigan,'' Schuette said in an interview. ``It will be a tough and
bare-knuckled campaign, but Bush will pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuette added that Bush, with his message of tax cuts and
education reform, ``will be a big draw for a lot of Michigan's
swing Democrats and independent voters.''
</P>
<P>
   An ardent Bush supporter, Schuette, a McCain delegate, had been
bound by party rules to vote for the senator here on the first
ballot this week during the Republican National Convention. But
McCain, who won seven primaries and had 231 delegates before he
ended his presidential bid in March, on Sunday urged those
delegates to support Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan's open primary, McCain won 51 percent of the vote to
43 percent for Bush, mainly because of independent and Democratic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to heal party rifts, McCain gave Bush six delegates
to add to the six the Texas governor had won, leaving the Arizona
senator with 46 of the state's 58 delegates coming in to this
week's convention.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, which has 18 electoral votes, is a key battleground
state that both major parties are aggressively targeting.
</P>
<P>
   A July 18-22 poll of 500 registered state voters showed Bush and
Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential
nominee, in a dead heat, each with 37 percent, while Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader got 8 percent and Reform Party candidate
Patrick Buchanan, 2 percent. Twelve percent were undecided. The
poll was conducted by Marketing Resource Group of Lansing, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   But among the registered voters likely to vote, 41 percent
supported Bush, 35 percent backed Gore, 7 percent went for Nader
and 2 percent favored Buchanan. Fifteen percent were undecided. The
poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating the importance Republicans place on Michigan, Bush
plans to make four campaign stops in the state immediately
following the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Michigan Gov. John Engler called the state
``competitive'' in the fall election. Engler said Bush will be
targeting the state's labor vote in particular. Roughly 30 percent
of Michigan households include a union member. ``That's a big swing
vote,'' Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if George Bush will get half of the union vote,
but he is going to compete for a big share of it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   While Michigan supported Clinton in 1992, 19 percent of voters
backed Texas billionaire Ross Perot. Clinton carried the state
again in 1996 and Perot got 9 percent. The state went Republican in
1984, voting to re-elect Ronald Reagan, and in 1988, voting for
George Bush, the Texas governor's father.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., said the Republican Party
platform, which once again has an unwavering anti-abortion plank,
will not hurt the GOP's chances of winning the state and taking
back the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean that everybody in the party thinks that way,''
said Camp, a five-term representative from Michigan's fourth
district and an adviser to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
Camp added that ``voters may not agree with every candidate on
every issue. I have people who vote for me who don't agree with
me.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It all began in Paris 100 years ago. The final preparations for
the Universal Exhibition were under way; the construction of the
``underground'' and the Alexander III Bridge were making news. At
the same time, with much less fanfare, automobile-tire impresarios
Edouard and Andre Michelin decided to promote their products by
offering their motorist-clients a book of practical travel
information. After all, the pneumatic tire had been invented only
five years earlier, and traveling by automobile in France was still
a rather daring adventure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to approximately 50 pages devoted to tires _
frequently the victims of nails in this era of horse-drawn vehicles
_ and such vital information as lists of spare parts to be carried
in the vehicle and where to have it repaired, the guide contained
the first allusions to touring for pleasure, indicating picturesque
roads and sights worth visiting and offering hotel recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The Michelin brothers introduced their book at the World's Fair
and distributed it free. The cover was red _ and thus was born the
``Red Guide to France.'' Over the next century, the French guide
would be joined by those of 11 other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Guides to countries such as Belgium, Germany and Switzerland
quickly followed the initial one, but it wasn't until 1920 that
restaurants were included. At the same time, it was decided that
advertisements would no longer be accepted, thus ensuring
impartiality.
</P>
<P>
   In 1926, the ``star'' rating system was introduced _ one star
denoting a ``very good restaurant in its category.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later came the first designation of two- and
three-star restaurants _ ``worth a detour'' and ``worth a special
journey,'' respectively. (The bestowers of these stars were the
Michelin inspectors _ professionals who generally had backgrounds
in hotel and restaurant management and who performed their jobs
unannounced in complete, and legendary, anonymity.)
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely that anyone in those early years could have
imagined the future power of the Michelin stars _ so coveted that
restaurant owners would spend enormous sums of money redecorating
their establishments in the desperate hope of getting that elusive
third star. Nor certainly could they have foreseen that the removal
of a star could be so devastating that in 1966, demotion from two
stars to one would cause a Parisian chef to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The star system was also employed in a new group of guides that
were established in 1926 to give travelers all manner of
information about their chosen destinations. Contents included
suggested itineraries, detailed historical background, ratings for
major attractions _ both natural and manmade _ and suggestions for
nighttime activities. Famous places were pointed out as well as
lesser-known places of interest: quaint markets, trendy bistros and
hip nightspots. The cover of THIS book was green _ as are the more
than 200 titles that are part of this series today.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of these volumes was indicated in a 1978 article
in ``Gourmet'' magazine that stated, somewhat tongue in cheek:
``After an existence of some consequence lasting two thousand
years, London has at last arrived. It has been given a Michelin
'Green Guide' of its own.''
</P>
<P>
   In that first London guide, 15 sites were deemed worthy of three
stars, compared with 10 in New York, 9 in Paris and 29 in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Writers of the ``Green Guides'' are also anonymous, although the
``Gourmet'' sleuth was able to ascertain that that year's London
expert was a native Londoner of Scottish and French parentage who
had been educated at Oxford and had written several other guide
books.
</P>
<P>
   In his preface to the 1900 ``Guide Rouge,'' Andre Michelin
wrote, ``This volume was created at the turn of the century and
will last at least as long.'' Time has proven him to be correct.
</P>

magazine.)

18th-century Frenchman Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin. And how
fitting that the great author and gastronome lived in the heart of
Burgundy, then as now, one of the most celebrated wine regions of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The visitor to Burgundy today will find delectable local
specialties to accompany the great reds and whites. These include
boeuf bourguignon (a rich braise of beef and vegetables)and
coq-au-vin (a savory stew of chicken in red wine), best made with
the snow-white chickens of Bresse, the most southerly part of
Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   These birds are so prized that they're sold with a special label
guaranteeing their origin and quality and are known throughout
France. Another gastronomic product of the region is known
worldwide: intensely flavorful mustard, manufactured in Dijon and
often sold there in charming, handpainted pots.
</P>
<P>
   What better place to sample this condiment than the city for
which it's named? But those willing to put off gastronomic
gratification for awhile will find that Dijon has other treasures
as well. It has been an influential cultural and architectural
center since its heyday in the 14th and 15th centuries, and much
remains from that time to intrigue the visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost is the magnificent Palace of the Dukes of Burgundy
which now houses the Museum of Fine Arts. Reach it via a stroll
through the surrounding old district of beautiful, stone mansions
and half-timbered 15th- and l6th-century houses.
</P>
<P>
   Many cafes with outdoor seating will beckon temptingly, but head
straight for the Palace. Here you'll find the original ducal
kitchens built in 1435, with six huge chimneys that were barely
sufficient for the preparation of feasts worthy of the Burgundian
court, then the wealthiest and most influential in France.
</P>
<P>
   Art treasures include the tomb of Philip the Bold, the first of
the four dukes of Burgundy to secure the services of the finest
artisans in Europe. Three artists, including Claus Sluter, one of
the greatest sculptors of the 14th century, worked successively for
25 years on the ducal tomb. Philip's effigy, watched over by two
angels, reclines on a dais supported by a procession of amazingly
realistic mourners.
</P>
<P>
   Hours could be spent among this museum's wonders: medieval gold-
and silverware; carved ivory; Renaissance furniture and paintings;
weapons and armor dating from the 13th to the 18th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors ready to turn their attention to matters gastronomic
might try Mulot and Petitjean where the turn-of-the-century decor
is richly scented with the aroma of the Burgundian specialty, pain
d'epices, a spicy gingerbread cake.
</P>
<P>
   For something to bring home, keep an eye out for the Auger
shops. Here you'll find local products such as candies, mustards
mixed with all manner of herbs and spices, and creme de cassis.
This black currant liqueur is the flavoring for the popular
white-wine-based aperitif named Kir after a former mayor of Dijon
who would serve it tirelessly to guests at the town hall.
</P>
<P>
   The fame of Dijon mustard and boeuf bourguignon notwithstanding,
what most people surely think of when they hear the word Burgundy
is ...wine.
</P>
<P>
   The cultivation of the vine was introduced by the Romans who
conquered the region in 52 BC. The young, fruity reds of
Beaujolais, the crisp, dry whites of Chablis, the truly great crus
of the Cote-d'Or such as Chambertin and Pomerol (red) and
Corton-Charlemagne and Meursault (white) _ these are Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   A few days devoted to touring the region's vineyards can be
delightful. The celebrated ones of the Cote-d'Or (Golden Hillside)
stretch from Dijon 37 miles south to Santenay. For the true wine
lover, it's thrilling just to drive along this ``Road of the Great
Wines'' and to read, one after another, the signs bearing the
magical names: Clos Vougeot, Savigny-les-Beaune, Romanee-Conti.
</P>
<P>
   Many vineyards are open to the public for guided tours and most
have tastings _ the wine perhaps accompanied by the region's savory
gougere cheese pastry _ with the opportunity to buy bottles or
cases at prices well below what you'd pay back home.
</P>
<P>
   The road south from Dijon leads to Beaune where a wine auction
each November draws connoisseurs from all over the world. Beaune is
known, too, for its architectural treasures. The most famous is the
Hotel-Dieu, which was founded in 1443 as a hospital for the care of
the poor and used as a general hospital until 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The building, with its distinctive roof line covered in
multicolored tiles, was built as an act of penance by Nicholas
Rolin, chancellor to the last of the great dukes of Burgundy.
Miraculously, considering more than five centuries of constant use,
it has survived intact.
</P>
<P>
   It contains an immense hall spanned by carved and painted
timbers where nuns cared for the sick, who lay, sometimes two or
three to a bed, in 28 beds covered in red and white bedcloths.
</P>
<P>
   With little hope for recovery, the poor could look at a painting
of ``The Last Judgment'' by the Flemish master, Rogier van der
Weyden, that dominated an altar at the end of the room. Today, this
formidable polyptych with its graphic depiction of hell is
displayed in a room designed specifically for this purpose. A
mobile magnifying glass enables visitors to study the smallest
details of the highly expressive faces in this masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   End your cultural experiences in Beaune (as opposed to your
eating, drinking and shopping ones) with a visit to the Burgundy
Wine Museum, housed in the former mansion of the Dukes of Burgundy.
Here, a comprehensive exhibit explains the entire history of
Burgundian vineyards and the cultivation of the vine.
</P>
<P>
   All this talk of wine, but what about cheese, considered by many
its ultimate pairing? Good cheeses abound in Burgundy (try the
sinfully rich Epoisses). It should be no surprise that
Brillat-Savarin had something to say on this subject as well.
</P>
<P>
   His comment? ``A dessert without cheese is like a beautiful
woman with only one eye.'' There can be no doubt that a glass of
fine red Burgundy would have accompanied this epicure's cheese. &QL;

 &HT;    Marcus still charming the masses with the message of Home Depot
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At a recent parking lot powwow, the buzz is building
as a throng of Home Depot employees rub elbows on the asphalt at
the corporate compound.
</P>
<P>
   Secretaries clutch the retailer's ``Homer'' mascot dolls.
Accountants and techies alike keep an eye on the empty podium.
About a thousand cubicle dwellers press closer to the makeshift
stage, their new aprons adding an orange splash to the sea of
khaki.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the crowd lets out a piercing round of whistles and
whoops, the kind you hear at ballgames, not Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the microphone is Chairman and co-founder Bernard Marcus.
Around here, he's known as Bernie, the head honcho of hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank you all for voting for me,'' jokes Marcus,
waving each hand with the victory sign. As with any Home Depot
event, the crowd kicks it off with a rousing H-O-M-E D-E-P-O-T
cheer.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Marcus, who usually rallies the troops in the
stores, has herded the support staff at headquarters for a taste of
the Home Depot gusto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to recognize all of you for the work you do, the
advertising, the behind-the-scenes roles,'' Marcus says. ``We talk
a lot about the stores, but we haven't thanked you for your role.''
</P>
<P>
   In five minutes the speech is over, and the employees start
lining up for what they were really waiting for: an autograph, a
wisecrack, a one-on-one with the guy who's helping set them up for
comfy retirement.
</P>
<P>
   People shove orange aprons, T-shirts and the company's
biography, ``Built from Scratch'' at Marcus for an autograph. One
woman presents Homer's rear end for a signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at him _ he's like a rock star,'' says Dennis Carey,
executive vice president and chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   This is classic Bernie. In recent years, Marcus, 71, and partner
Arthur Blank, 57, chief executive and president, have gotten a lot
of attention for creating a nation of do-it-yourselfers with their
incredibly successful warehouse concept. But from the start, Marcus
was the one who took the limelight with his wit and charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Blank, an accountant by training, honed the financial side of
the business (which was nearly called ``Bad Bernies Buildall'').
Marcus was the extroverted visionary who duked it out with
investment bankers and won over skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   That charisma has drawn a loyal following over the years. Much
of what he tells employees today is age-old retail wisdom _ the
customer comes first, don't point, etc. _ but he delivers it in
such a convincing way that it seems bigger than life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bernie comes around, it's like this whoosh,'' says
Cumberland store manager Steve Moody, balling his fist as if he's
grabbing something. ``Whatever he says, I want a piece of it
because it gets me in the gut.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody, a former construction worker, reaches in his apron pocket
and pulls out a cloth wheel embroidered with the company's values.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this simple: let's build some strong relationships, let's
take care of the customer, let's have an entrepreneurial spirit. .
.,'' says Moody, pointing out several other directives on the
wheel. ``If you really think about it, you do this at home. And
that's all he's asking, just be a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   As hokey as it sounds, the company's founders were determined to
build a workplace that made people feel good about their jobs after
Marcus and Blank were canned midway into their former careers.
</P>
<P>
   The pair met 26 years ago when both worked for Handy Dan
Improvement Centers, a hardware store chain in Los Angeles. They
both got fired after a run-in with their boss and decided the best
revenge was to create a bigger and better Handy Dan, picking
Atlanta as their testing ground.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus filled yellow legal pads with ideas for giant warehouse
stores while Blank tried to make the numbers work.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the duo seemed to hit one dead-end after the next,
Marcus was stubborn about certain principles. No matter how
desperate he felt, he seemed determined to stay in control. More
than that, Marcus refused to change his convictions for anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot included.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, founder and then-chairman of Electronic Data Systems, was
on the verge of investing $2 million in Home Depot at a point when
the founders were begging for financing to open the first stores,
Marcus says.
</P>
<P>
   The fiesty Texan nearly became the majority owner of Home Depot
_ until he clashed with Marcus. During final negotiations, Marcus
was increasingly uneasy about the ``military'' style at EDS.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus says he was bothered by the corporate uniform of white
shirts and ties, the security guards and a general battle over who
was in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Perot declined to comment, but according to Marcus' account, the
fallout came when Marcus asked to be reimbursed for a used
Cadillac, his old company car that he was going to buy from Handy
Dan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people don't drive Cadillacs,'' Marcus recalls Perot
saying. ``My guys. . .drive Chevrolets.''
</P>
<P>
   When Perot repeated it two more times, Marcus got up and walked
out on the $2 million. As Marcus saw it, if there was a conflict
over a used car, how much was in store over big business decisions?
According to Marcus, Perot was already throwing his weight around,
and Marcus didn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody controls my life but me,'' he recalls thinking.
</P>
<P>
   LEARNING OPTIMISM
</P>
<P>
   Marcus showed a tenacious side early on. He grew up in a
fourth-floor tenement in a predominantly black neighborhood in
Newark, N.J., during the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   As a preteen, he became a favorite target for a group of kids in
a neighborhood gang. After getting beaten up repeatedly, Marcus
impressed the gang leader with his nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me to join,'' Marcus recalls. At 11 years old, he was
second in command of 30 hoodlums who found other boys to beat up.
``I was in charge of strategy and expansion,'' Marcus quips.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Marcus says he was learning the values of optimism
and sharing from his parents, poor Russian immigrants who met in
America. He remembers his mother taking ice cream money away from
him and giving it to charities. ``Her belief was the more you give
the more you get,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Now worth more than $3 billion in direct Home Depot holdings
alone, Marcus has given away more than $120 million to date. His
pet project is the Marcus Institute, a treatment center for
children with brain and behavioral disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus and his wife, Billi, founded the center in 1990 and
supported it with $25 million in personal donations. Marcus
recently gave another $45 million to expand and merge the center
with the Kennedy Krieger Institute, a research center in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his charities focus on children, health care, education
and Jewish causes.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Marcus has worked to strengthen economic ties to
Israel. In addition to Home Depot's commitment to work with Israeli
suppliers, Marcus has led several trade missions on behalf of
Georgia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he traveled to Israel with Gov. Roy Barnes to
recruit high-tech companies to Georgia. Marcus is also
international chairman of the Israel Democracy Institute, a
political think tank in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ALWAYS THE COMIC
</P>
<P>
   Marcus says he grew up in a fairly observant Jewish home and
went to synagogue with his father, a skilled cabinetmaker but
``terrible businessman'' who worked nonstop and still couldn't make
ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Young Marcus wanted to become a doctor but couldn't afford
medical school. Instead, he settled for pharmacy school at Rutgers
University and paid his college expenses by testing the skills that
would pay off big later in life.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, he worked as a stand-up comic in the Catskill
Mountains. And Marcus said he frequently cut classes to sell Amana
freezers to homeowners in the flatlands of central and south New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   After Rutgers, Marcus worked at drugstores and cosmetics
companies before landing at Handy Dan. At that point, Marcus had
racked up quite a bit of retail know-how but was still punching
someone else's clock.
</P>
<P>
   The man who fired Marcus at Handy Dan, Sanford Sigoloff, later
told a Bloomberg News reporter that he had no regrets. Sigoloff
said that Marcus clearly didn't fit the corporate mold and was so
self-assured that he was ``just shy of being pompous.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, it was clear to Marcus that he needed to
start his own business.
</P>
<P>
   TOUGH EARLY DAYS
</P>
<P>
   Through the persistence of longtime friend and investment banker
Ken Langone, Home Depot got the money to open four stores in
Atlanta in 1979, but the early days were tough. Managers used empty
boxes to make the store look packed with products because the
company couldn't afford to buy enough inventory. Marcus dispatched
his three children to hand out $1 bills in the parking lots to try
and lure people into the store.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle formed a brotherly bond between Marcus and Blank
and led to a camaraderie among employees as they continually
revamped the stores to find the right formula. Even when Home Depot
became a hit with customers, the founders encouraged employees to
keep speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   At shareholder meetings and on store tours, both men get an
earful from the rank-and-file on what's wrong at the stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie and Arthur want you to talk to them,'' says Sandy
Owenby, a store employee who has been with the company less than a
year. ``They may be worth billions, but they know you're out here
busting your butt to make money for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The pioneering spirit among employees in the early days has
evolved into a respect for what Marcus and Blank have accomplished
at Home Depot, longtime employees say. Some employee loyalty now is
tied to the prospects of early retirement. By Marcus' estimates,
the retailer has created about 2,000 millionaires, including
secretaries and store managers, through Home Depot's stock options
plan.
</P>
<P>
   THE PIED PIPER
</P>
<P>
   Keeping that gung-ho spirit alive is Marcus' priority as
chairman these days.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus handed the chief executive reins to Blank three years
ago. Since then, Marcus has concentrated on teaching training
classes.
</P>
<P>
   And he still visits stores, fielding questions and generally
hamming it up in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   He used to personally tour each Home Depot store, but that's
impossible now. With 1,000 stores today and a new one opening on
the average of every 43 hours, the only way some employees will see
Marcus is on satellite TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to touch people the way I have in the past.
There's no question about that,'' Marcus says.
</P>
<P>
   ``All store managers and every officer will get exposure to
Arthur and myself. And hopefully they'll take the things we teach
them down to every level.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus hosts interactive ``Welcome aboard'' shows to some new
stores so that employees have a chance to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one recent (broadcast) we had people from Atlanta to
California and Saskatchewan,'' Marcus says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where they're from, employees ask him the same thing:
How is Home Depot going to maintain its ``bleeding orange'' culture
if the company plans to double in size?
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is, we will if everyone works at it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to managers and other officers to get the message
out to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie is the original Pied Piper . . . but we're too big for
any one person to carry the banner,'' says Faye Wilson, senior vice
president of value initiatives and a board member.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Blank began building up the bench of officers
at Home Depot. Although Marcus has said for years that they'd have
to carry him out before he'd retire, he recently said his focus had
changed a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do whatever Arthur needs me to do, although I'm slowing down
at Home Depot and picking up my (charitable) work,'' Marcus says.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the guy best known as Bernie seems to have a
grip on a new generation of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I'm supposed to do anything for the customer, even
if it's outrageous,'' says Acworth, Ga. store manager Stephanie
Wargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a customer can't find a product, I'll go out and buy it and
bring it their house if I have to,'' says Wargo, a former social
worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of other (employees) feel the same way because Bernie is
so passionate about this place,'' she says. ``It's like he's your
dad, and you don't want to disappoint him.''

<P>
   In the world of financial advice, the HP-12C is a classic.
Planners swear by it, MBAs flaunt it, Web tools are modeled after
it, and savvy investors struggle to understand it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things Hewlett-Packard's ubiquitous financial
calculator does is forecast how much a pool of money is likely to
be worth in the future. If you start with X amount and add Y
dollars for Z number of years, the palm-size machine can tell you
how much money _ down to the penny _ you'll end up with.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the pitch generations of investors have
heard. But a growing number of professional advisers are
questioning the wisdom of relying on such one-dimensional ``time
value of money'' calculations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a major limitation to any straight-line compounding
of money,'' said Ray Ferrara, a national director of the
29,000-member Financial Planning Association. ``The number you get
is one of many possible outcomes, and it's not any more or less
likely than thousands of other outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, pinning your financial future on the belief that
your investment dollars will grow to a specific amount by a
specific date is a sucker's bet. Maybe they will, but more likely
they won't. And the difference could be big.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the example of a 60-year-old man planning to retire in
five years. He has $1 million set aside, and wants to know how much
it will grow to on retirement day.
</P>
<P>
   Most advisers would simply plug the numbers into their HP-12C,
or one of the numerous Web sites or computer programs that do
essentially the same calculation. Assuming annual returns of 11
percent on his investments, the man would end up with $1.69 million
five years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   But assume that instead of earning exactly 11 percent each year,
the man's portfolio lost 15 percent the first year and 26 percent
the second (roughly the performance of the S&AMP;P 500 in 1972 and
1973). It might then post gains of 46 percent, 30 percent, and 20
percent the next three years to bring the overall average to 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the man's pot of money would grow to $1.43
million over five years _ $252,000 less than under the flat-line
assumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that the timing of returns is critical,'' Ferrara
said. ``It's not enough to say that a client's money is likely to
earn 11 percent per year without giving them a sense that the way
those returns are generated could make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   To deal with that uncertainty, some advisers and at least one
financial-services company are turning to Monte Carlo analysis. And
like most trends, Monte Carlo is rapidly moving online.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether it's on the Internet or in software, Monte
Carlo analysis uses hundreds or even thousands of calculations
rather than a single one. It takes a list of potential market
returns, which in the case of our example might be plotted like a
bell curve around 11 percent, and runs the projection over and over
again using returns pulled at random from the list.
</P>
<P>
   Done enough times, the results form a pattern that can tell you
the probability of achieving your goals.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the 60-year-old man, for example, Monte Carlo
analysis might tell him that he has a 48 percent chance of actually
having at least $1.69 million by retirement. If he needs that much
money but isn't comfortable with a probability less than 50-50, he
can adjust variables in the calculation _ years until retirement,
for example _ until the likelihood increases to, say, 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced that Monte Carlo analysis will take
the financial-planning industry by storm.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar research director John Rekenthaler wrote this week
on his firm's Web site that ``Monte Carlo simulations aren't
intrinsically better than conventional mathematics,'' and he
ridiculed advisers and journalists for jumping on the bandwagon.
Morningstar's ClearFuture service, which gives 401(k) advice to
paying clients, uses a different mathematical approach to
calculating probabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, though, Monte Carlo analysis has the makings of
a fairly important trend. Dozens of services use it to guide
professional investors and pension-fund managers these days, and a
couple of Internet sites provide it directly to the Web-surfing
public. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   --www.financialengines.com is far and away the early leader in
Web-based Monte Carlo analysis, and for good reason. The site was
founded by William Sharpe, inventor of the Sharpe Ratio and
recipient of the 1990 Nobel Prize in economics.
</P>
<P>
   The site takes your income and investment information, then
shows your odds of reaching retirement goals with a weather
forecast _ bright sunshine (you'll make it easily) to thunderstorms
ahead (not so fortunate). It allows you to put specific mutual
funds or stocks into the equation, and it runs probability analysis
not only on their individual returns but on factors such as
inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis is free, but you'll have to cough up $14.95 to
$39.95 quarterly if you want personalized advice about how to bring
more sunshine to the forecast.
</P>
<P>
   --www.financeware.com unveiled its WealthSimulator service just
this week. It's a little more geeky and complicated than Financial
Engines, but not enough to scare serious investors from giving it a
try.
</P>
<P>
   In the place of sunny and cloudy skies, WealthSimulator offers
plain, old-fashioned bar charts and line graphs. Another
difference: It uses historical market returns for various asset
classes (from 1926 to 1999) to create its list of possible returns,
from which the Monte Carlo analysis pulls random scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   As with Financial Engines, you'll have to dig deep if you want
professional advice from the site. It costs $149 per year if you
sign on as an individual, but it's free if you sign up jointly with
your financial planner.
</P>
<P>
   --www.troweprice.com/
</P>
<P>
   retirement (then click on ``retirement income'') has embraced
Monte Carlo analysis, but not without an adviser's hand-holding.
Mutual fund company T. Rowe Price offers information about its
Retirement Income Manager service at the Web site, but forces you
to talk to an adviser over the phone to actually participate.
</P>
<P>
   Three years in the making, T. Rowe's service will run 500
financial scenarios on your retirement accounts, then provide a
30-page report outlining the probability of reaching your goals.
From beginning to end, including at least three conversations with
an adviser, the process can take 30 days or more.
</P>
<P>
   The service is comprehensive but not cheap. Total cost: $500.

VACATION LUNACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Ah, the vacation purchase _ the silly hat, the ugly shirt, the
20-pound clay pot shaped like a frog, the etching from the Orient
that will never quite blend with plain vanilla decor, the tie rack
with the hand-carved mermaids, the taffy-in-a-tub, and the $15,000
Turkish rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``An impulse purchase,'' Christine Cimino, communications
supervisor at Collette Tours in Pawtucket, R.I., says of the rug.
She was there when a seemingly sensible human being fell under the
spell of the magic carpet, deep into what might be called ``The
Vacation Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything can happen out there. A person who is the soul of
thrift at home, who has contributed to the 401(k) since its
inception, who has savings account contributions automatically
deducted from the paycheck every week, and who rolls pennies on the
weekends, suddenly breaks out in Istanbul, or London, or Miami or
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   It's the old ``Hey, hey, hey, this is vacation and we're having
some fun now'' mentality that wipes clean the logic tape and makes
a Leaning Tower of Pisa lamp look like a work of art.
</P>
<P>
   There was never any talk of Pisa lamps at home. Nobody said:
``Boy, when I get to Italy, the first thing I do is head for the
tacky lamp emporium.'' These things just come upon tourists, sort
of like food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something possesses them,'' says Mona Strick, director of
sales and marketing at Garber Travel. ``People who would never buy
a Gucci pocketbook get on a cruise ship and drop $500 on a bag.''
</P>
<P>
   They also go for the $200 bottles of wine at dinner, says Bob
Dickinson, president of Carnival Cruise Lines in Miami. Why?
Because it's there, and so are they, and restaurants on land mark
it up to $600. So in The Vacation Zone it looks like a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry does too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any serious vacation destination has jewelry stores,'' says
Dickinson. ``They're on the ships, in Cancun, in Paris, and in
Branson, Mo. You've got a couple traveling with no worries and no
work and things are going great. So after two or three days the
husband wants to show his appreciation. He says `Thank you' with
jewelry. If nothing is happening, he buys jewelry to say, `Please.'
''
</P>
<P>
   What's the wildest thing he ever saw a tourist buy?
</P>
<P>
   ``An 8-foot totem with seven faces,'' says Dickinson, recalling
a tour to Alaska. ``A guy carried it in two four-foot pieces, had
it wrapped in paper and string, and put it in the overhead bin on
the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Osborne, president of Insight Vacations in Boston, offers
this maxim for the person who would schlep too much: ``If it's
bigger than you are, ship it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has seen people trying to bring home huge Buddhist carvings
from China, or weighing down their suitcases with horseshoes,
souvenirs from his company's Grand National race tour to Great
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vacation is intangible,'' he observes. ``You can't touch it.
You can only experience it. But people want to bring back the feel
and smell of the trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may explain the tourist who bought a $600 sheepskin coat
in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was huge,'' says Cimino at Collette Tours. ``It took up
three feet in her suitcase. It looked like one of those flying
monkeys in `The Wizard of Oz.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the woman didn't know that until she got home. In The
Vacation Zone she looked like Julie Christie in ``Dr. Zhivago.''
</P>
<P>
   A person comes back from Dallas with boots and a ten-gallon hat
that are worn maybe once in Massachusetts. They don't even pass for
the Saturday-morning trip to the dump _ much too
west-of-Springfield for the flannel-shirt crowd shaking hands with
the pols running for the open selectman seat.
</P>
<P>
   So the cowboy gear goes into the back of the closet, saved for
Halloween _ maybe, depending on who's throwing the party. The stuff
joins the moccasins, straw bags, Hawaiian shirts, and other ``have
to have it'' treasures now turned into ``can't throw it out''
albatrosses.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly, unusable, redundant, or outrageously priced though these
things may be, they are still loved for where they once were, and
where the buyers once were, when an impulse purchase made fools of
their budgets and themselves. Being there is always worth it.

AS RETIREMENT NEARS, SHIFT FROM EMPLOYER'S STOCK TO FIXED-INCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I work for PPG Industries. Its stock has not moved upward
much in the past six months, as with most stocks, and I wonder if I
should consider moving some of my money in that stock into a
fixed-income offering that's one of the options within my 401(k)
plan. Also, I feel I need to find a company outside PPG to handle
my money when I retire. My budget of $4,000 a month upon retirement
would be financed by my pension, Social Security, and returns from
the 401(k). What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   M.G., Sulphur, La. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Without entering a discussion of the relative merits of PPG
Industries, it's a good idea to reduce your reliance upon that
single security, simply because it is now playing much too big a
part in your portfolio. And when you combine the current high state
of the stock market in general with the fact that you are about
five years away from retirement, it is indeed a good idea to begin
to build a fixed-income side to your portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   I would move about half of the money now in PPG Industries
common stock into the fixed-income fund, and then direct that
future contributions to the plan be divided evenly between the S&AMP;P
Index 500 fund and the fixed-income fund.
</P>
<P>
   Since you don't specify the level of your contributions, I can't
make a good projection of the balance by the time you retire.
</P>
<P>
   If there were no contributions at all and if you achieved
average 8 percent average annual portfolio returns, you would
accumulate $536,295 over five years. If we estimate Social Security
benefits at $1,000 per month, you would need to draw about $900 a
month from your savings to meet your projected budget.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to build a fixed-income portfolio designed to
produce that income, you would need roughly $170,000 there. That
would allow you to leave most of your savings in growth investments
that would protect you against inflation during retirement. In
short, you are sitting pretty.
</P>
<P>
   As for what to do after you retire, you can easily move your
money from your 401(k) to an IRA by rolling it over. Any major
brokerage or mutual fund company can do this for you, and if the
rollover is done correctly, you will not have any tax obligations
until you withdraw funds from the accounts. (But you will be
required to make mandatory minimum withdrawals after you attain age
70 1/2.)
</P>
<P>
   If it were my 401(k), I would have the rollover handled by the
Vanguard Group of funds _ simply because their fund offerings are
wide, conservatively managed, and the fees and expenses are very
low relative to most fund families.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard is a mutually owned company and there are no hungry
stockholders calling for profits from the operation. The assets of
the Vanguard Group are owned by the various mutual funds within the
group, and the funds, of course, are owned by the shareholders.
That's how they can come up with expense ratios that run as low as
less than 18 cents a year for every $100 under management.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am trying to calculate the historical value of amounts of
money in terms of today's buying power. What would the current
buying power of $85 in 1938 money be? How about $600 in 1943, or
$150 in 1937?
</P>
<P>
   P.G., Wellesley Hills, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you base the calculations on the consumer price index, the
answer is that $85 in 1937 had the same buying power as $1,004 in
1999 (the latest year for which statistics are available). If you
had $600 in 1943, it would have had the same buying power as $5,788
in 1999, and $150 in 1937 had the buying power of $1,735 in today's
money.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a computer and use the Internet, you can make
similar calculations, going back as far as 1913, by visiting
www.jsc.nasa.gov/bu2/inflateCPI.html and plugging in the variables.
You can also determine values between any dates within the years
1913 to 1999, such as what the buying power of $10 of 1913 money
was equivalent to in 1950. (It was only $24.34; you have to
remember that the many years of the Great Depression saw deflation
rather than inflation.)
</P>
<P>
   Calculators such as these are excellent tools to inflame your
wrath when facing capital gains tax payments. Suppose that you
bought stock in 1960 for $1,000 and sold it last year for $20,000.
You would face taxes on a $19,000 capital gain. But in fact, that
$1,000 in 1960 dollars had the buying power of $5,628 in 1999
dollars, and your real gain in buying power was less than $15,000.
The government is in charge of controlling inflation, but when it
fails, we are taxed for its failure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In your column you frequently caution savers to consider
inflation when they plan for their retirement. Do you take into
consideration that a retired person has a reduced need for many of
the items that are included in the consumer price index? The index
includes food and beverages, housing (including heating and
furniture costs), apparel, transportation, medical care,
recreation, education, and communication, and other goods and
services. For retirees, there are a number of possible reductions:
If a person owns his or her home and it's paid off, most of that
cost becomes unimportant. There is less need for new clothing.
There is reduced cost of transportation once one is not going to
work. There is probably a lower expense for recreation. Education
costs are reduced or eliminated. And the need for many other goods
and services should be reduced drastically.
</P>
<P>
   J.W., El Cajon, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. What you say is probably by and large true, although I would
argue that for many retirees, the cost of medical care might
eventually escalate well beyond the level reflected in the CPI,
perhaps even to the point of crossing out all of the other
reductions that retirees may see in living costs.
</P>
<P>
   You also might consider that for some people, money spent on
travel and entertainment increases dramatically once they quit
working.
</P>
<P>
   But the real problem is that dealing with inflation involves a
lot of guesswork, starting with the assumption of the future rate.
I have been using a 3.5 percent estimate, which is probably low
when viewed over a very long term.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty involving the rate of future inflation is far
more important than the makeup of the consumer price index. Suppose
we project inflation at 3.5 percent, and calculate that you will
need $99,489 in 20 years to support a lifestyle that costs $50,000
in today's money.
</P>
<P>
   If that projection were low and actual inflation averaged 4
percent, we would be more than $10,000 behind the eight ball, with
the actual cost running $109,550. Such a miscalculation would
probably far outweigh the difference between retirees' requirements
of the items within the CPI and those of society at large.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if it went the other way and inflation averaged just
3 percent over 20 years, the retiree would need only $90,305 to
maintain the equivalent of a current $50,000 lifestyle, and that
difference again would likely dwarf the effect of different buying
habits of retirees and younger people.
</P>
<P>
   In this and many other approaches to dealing with the problems
of retirement, I try to be very conservative. I'd rather not lead
people to believe that they will have a rosier retirement than
seems likely.
</P>
<P>
   I can remember some years back trying to help my mother in her
view of her finances. At the time the markets had been wobbly, and
she was worried that her money wouldn't last her out. I finally
calmed her by working out a long spreadsheet that showed she would
indeed be in trouble eventually _ around about age 113. That put an
end to her worries. Like most elderly people, she wanted a lot of
elbow room in her finances, and she wanted it on the high side.
</P>
<P>
   But I do agree that if a person followed my typical advice, the
odds are that he or she will be a little better off than I have
projected _ and that's the way I have designed it.

TILL MONEY DO US PART

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Couples and money _ it doesn't get much hotter than that.
</P>
<P>
   He spends. She doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   She manages the finances. He thinks she's a control freak.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to buy the kid a car. She says the kid should work for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Money is what they fight about, but the real problem is they've
never learned to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one cause of divorce is money _ sex is a distant
second,'' says George Kinder, who runs Kinder Financial Services in
Cambridge, Mass., a financial planning firm that helps people work
out their psychological attitudes toward money, along with their
budgets. ``Money is about identity, and identities clash. People
need to learn how to listen to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Carter, who runs MoneySense, a financial counseling
service in Newburyport, Mass. that often works with couple, says
she has a client who lost his shirt in the stock market but was
afraid to tell his wife. Another man, who was in charge of the
family finances, ran up $60,000 on his credit cards, and never told
his wife because he didn't want to worry her or deny her anything.
</P>
<P>
   Carter says when a spouse learns about such secrets, it's ``like
having a partner coming in and telling you that he was having an
affair. The first question you ask is, `Is it over?' If a person is
willing to recognize the seriousness of the breach, then you can
talk and start to work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   She notes that not only do people have trouble talking about
money, but they may be attracted to the very spending attitude that
will eventually drive them crazy. ``We are attracted to people who
give us permission to do what we want to do, and who take care of
us,'' says Carter. She described a couple who got together because
the man was loose and fun with money, which made the woman carefree
and happy. But she was a worrier at heart and couldn't sustain the
joie de vivre after they were married. Carter describes her as
``borderline obsessive'' about saving.
</P>
<P>
   Carter helped them work out a budget, and they signed a contract
with each other, agreeing to pay the bills on time and to set so
much aside for fun _ $400 a year for dining out, a manageable
country-club membership, and a cap on discretionary spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed to give each other latitude so that one person
wasn't feeling controlled by the other,'' Carter says.
</P>
<P>
   That issue of control is often the cracking point in a
relationship, and sends couples to a divorce lawyer or mediator to
guide them through a split.
</P>
<P>
   And if money is incendiary during a marriage, it's a nuclear
bomb in a divorce. Every dollar sign or attempted discussion of who
gets what can fuel the anger, disappointment, and pain that the
relationship has become. The more money a couple has, the nastier
and more public the battle can become. Hollywood is full of these
clashes. So is the business world.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the former wife of entrepreneur Kenan Sahin petitioned
a probate court asking that the couple's 1996 divorce settlement be
reopened after the businessman sold his company, Kenan Systems, to
Lucent Technologies Inc. for $1.48 billion. In the original divorce
settlement, a judge had estimated that the company was worth only
$4.9 million and had awarded Mrs. Sahin $1.5 million. The court
dismissed the case this year.
</P>
<P>
   Most divorces do not deal in such stratospheric numbers, do not
go to trial, and never make headlines, but the emotional pain is
just about universal and the battleground for those emotions is
often financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if an affair breaks up the marriage, the divorce is about
money,'' says Diane Neumann, founder of Divorce Mediation Services
in Newton, Mass. ``The jilted spouse almost always says, `I know
they're hiding money.' Everything feeds the distrust. Say a man
makes $140,000 a year and the numbers are all there in his tax
returns and investment accounts because people leave plenty of
trails. The wife will still say, `He's hiding money.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Neumann works to defuse the emotions and to ``demystify the
finances'' as she gets ``all the pieces on the table'' and helps
the couple discuss them as rationally as possible. ``A couple comes
in with a narrow focus,'' she says. ``I widen the range to a more
cooperative framework.''
</P>
<P>
   The key word is ``cooperative,'' which for some couples is
impossible. Choosing a mediator to help hammer out a divorce
agreement can be less costly than hiring an attorney, with
mediation fees running from around $120 per couple per hour to $300
_ Neumann is on the high end. But the process requires the couple
to be on speaking terms and willing to spend the time it takes to
forge the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Many mediators, Neumann included, also recommend that each
spouse hire his or her own attorney to review the agreement and act
as a legal coach, which can add to the cost, even though the
lawyers don't participate in the mediation sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest and least expensive route for a breakup is for the
couple to file for divorce themselves without attorneys or
mediators, although that's recommended only if the relationship is
amicable, and the marriage was short with no children and few
assets.
</P>
<P>
   If a couple wants something in between mediation and the
traditional confrontation between opposing attorneys, they might
consider a collaborative law agreement. Like mediation, it requires
that the separating spouses be able to sit in the same room. Used
in a half-dozen states, including Massachusetts, the process is
gaining popularity for its emphasis on civility and its contractual
commitment not to go to trial. The husband and wife and their
respective attorneys work more like a committee rather than
opposing armies, hiring one accountant and sharing information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is present for every meeting,'' says Rita Pollak,
attorney at Goldenberg, Walters, Lipson, Pollak and Popkewitz in
Brookline, Mass. She and David Hoffman of Hill &AMP; Barlow founded the
Collaborative Law Council this year, and 40 Boston-area attorneys
are participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one party abuses the process or won't participate, then the
attorneys disappear. The product you have generated disappears. The
experts you have jointly hired cannot be used. You have to start
over with new counsel and recreate all the information. So there's
a lot of incentive to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Divorce attorneys, often portrayed in go-for-the-jugular
stereotypes, say that the traditional divorce negotiation, if
handled by responsible professionals, also works at ``getting to
yes,'' rather than getting to court. They say their job is to try
to cool the hostility rather than promising to ``make the crumbball
pay.'' But that's exactly what a lot of clients want, even though
Massachusetts is an equitable distribution state and most attorneys
can tell about where the case is going to come out at the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Divorce is not about revenge,'' says Boston attorney Ann Baum.
``This is a business process. It's dollars and sense. It's breaking
down a partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   That means thinking rationally about the house instead of
emotionally _ sometimes keeping it costs too much. The ``business
process'' means not fighting over pots and pans, but looking at the
hard-core stuff of pensions, stock options, child support, college
educations, and health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't waste money on the fight just to fight,'' says Fern
Frolin, a divorce attorney at Sooho and Frolin LLP in Newton, who
also does mediation law and is a member of the Collaborative Law
Council. ``Focus on what's worth fighting for. People get married
to the litigation. It replaces the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Weinstein, director and cofounder of Divorce Resource and
Mediation Service in Newtonville, knows of a couple that was in
litigation for nine years. ``They came to me and settled in five
hours,'' says the 72-year-old Weinstein, who began practicing
mediation in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wait out the anger,'' Baum says. ``I've had cases
that go on and on. Then all of a sudden the client calls and says
`I'll take that deal.' And it was offered 1 1/2 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The anger and hurt can boil like waves in ``The Perfect Storm,''
and linger even after things are supposedly settled.
</P>
<P>
   A 43-year-old computer executive says he swallowed his fury when
his wife left him for someone else because ``I had to think about
what's best for my son.''
</P>
<P>
   He chose mediation, paying Diane Neumann $5,000 for her
services, because he felt that as the sole wage earner ``it was the
only way I could come out of this alive,'' and be able to negotiate
more liberal visitation rights with his son. ``I didn't want to be
a weekend dad,'' he says, noting that typically fathers get the
kids every other weekend. His 8-year-old son is now with him three
nights a week.
</P>
<P>
   But the money still rankles, for he pays nearly half of his
take-home pay in child support, and gave his wife 40 percent of his
pension and one-third of his stock options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the black,'' he says. ``But I'm living in an apartment
my parents own and paying cheap rent. My ex and her fiance just
bought a $250,000 home and they're buying a business. Is that
right?''
</P>
<P>
   Another man, who spent $15,000 in attorney fees to fight with
his wife over visitation rights, wound up with the standard
every-other-weekend plan and wishes now that he'd put that money
into a custody fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like death,'' says a 60-year-old computer programmer
whose husband became involved with someone else. The couple had
been married 32 years. ``I couldn't function. It took me six months
to get my head out of the sand. I'd be in a store, pick up an item,
and wander around for 20 minutes because I couldn't make up my mind
to buy it. I could make no decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to educate yourself,'' says the woman, who tired of
support groups where ``people keep crying and wringing their
hands.'' She found more practical guidance at The Divorce Center
Inc. in Framingham, Mass. The organization, founded in 1983, is a
nonprofit educational and referral service that gives weekly
lectures on all aspects of divorce as well as providing names of
attorneys, mediators, therapists, and financial experts.
</P>
<P>
   Like most people having to adjust to life on one salary instead
of two, she learned to put herself on a strict budget _ no more
golf, not as many haircuts, cheaper cosmetics, and nothing but the
basics at the supermarket. Her annual household income went from
$100,000 to $36,500 after the divorce _ her husband now pays $1,100
a month in alimony, which all goes toward her mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   The woman paid $3,000 in attorneys fees _ a relatively low-cost
divorce. Breaking up can run from $7,000 to $20,000 or higher. Ted
Orenstein, president of The Divorce Center, has seen bitterly
fought divorces costing $40,000 to $50,000, and had a client who
spent $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job of a good lawyer is to try to tone down the anger and
give perspective, but sometimes people don't want to listen,'' says
Orenstein, noting that The Divorce Center works to ``give people
knowledge so they're less desperate. They'll get through this. They
will be happy again and they will love again.''

TV HOPES FOR UNCONVENTIONAL CONVENTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1996, Ted Koppel stalked out of the Republican National
Convention in San Diego, declaring that ``nothing surprising has
happened. Nothing surprising is anticipated.'' Since then, nothing
has happened to alter the perception that the carefully scripted
modern political convention has lost its value as a television
draw.
</P>
<P>
   A new Pew Research Center survey reveals that only 13 percent of
the nation plans to watch a large chunk of the convention coverage.
And broadcast news is passing the story on to its cable cousins,
turning what was once ``a public service (into) just another
programming choice for the demographic that's interested in it,''
said a TV historian, Robert Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the tumultuous 1968 Democratic convention that glued
him to the TV as a college student, MSNBC ``Hardball'' host Chris
Matthews says such events provided ``a real sense of the
zeitgeist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those days are probably gone,'' he adds somberly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with the diminished expectations for any
ready-for-prime-time news bombshells, many analysts think
conventions get a bad rap. From the dominant themes to the
subliminal squabbles, they say, conventions provide viewers with a
crash course in political science and often play a big role in
determining the outcome of the race.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC anchor Brian Williams says that despite their best efforts
at stage-managing conventions, ``both parties have a chance to
screw this up mightily.'' And even if there is no 2000 version of
Pat Buchanan's ideological hijacking of the 1992 GOP convention, he
notes that up to a quarter of the voters make up their minds on a
president during this period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to viewers, `Ignore this at your informational peril,'
'' Williams said. If that doesn't have the resonant ring of ``Must
See TV,'' it does have the ring of truth.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News political director Mark Halperin, who said, ``We are
not scaling back our coverage one moment from the two previous
cycles,'' says the conventions are especially telling in this
year's unusual campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the declining interest in politics, the Olympics, and
the World Series, and a pair of major party nominees who aren't all
that compelling, of course the big events are going to matter
more,'' he said. ``For the vast majority of the country, this is
the only time other than the debates,'' to really focus on George
Bush and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News executive producer and special events director Al Ortiz
says conventions try to set a tone and a mood that will carry
through Election Day. ``The most important thing you'll be able to
discern very quickly is the message and strategy for the campaign,'
he said. The Republicans are ``going to come out of the box as a
middle of the road, broad spectrum, big tent operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Such convention images are paramount, adds CNN senior political
analyst William Schneider. After eight years of White House exile,
Republicans want to model themselves after the 1992 Democratic
confab when ``Clinton successfully created the impression that this
was a new Democratic Party. They had shed the baggage of the past _
Mondale and Dukakis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The metaphor they want to use is conservatism with a happy
face,'' Schneider continues. ``We're not monsters . . . There ain't
gonna be any angry white men. No Newts. No Pats.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of observers believe that conventions are newsworthy
simply because the key speeches can make or break a candidate.
Analyst Andrew Tyndall said, ``Oratory is always the thing that at
the end of the day has saved the event.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's 1988 ``Read my lips. No new taxes,'' speech ``won him
that election, but lost him the next,'' said Tyndall, adding
Buchanan's divisive prime-time 1992 culture war speech to the list
of pivotal moments.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the months-long media coverage on the younger Bush _ an
effort that has failed to galvanize widespread public interest in
the campaign _ the convention speech Thursday will mark his formal
introduction to much of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all seen him in blue jeans being a good old boy,'' Ortiz
said. ``I think there'll be a great deal of interest in George
Bush's acceptance speech.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is a very unfamiliar quantity to Americans,'' echoes
Schneider. ``This is his only chance to make a first impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider also illustrates how the television screen may convey
a much different portrait of a candidate to viewers than the one
painted by the media pundits. The 1988 Republican convention, with
the press preoccupied with the shortcomings of vice presidential
nominee Dan Quayle, ``was the most misreported event in (political)
history,'' he said. Bush's willingness to defend Quayle, and a
tough speech in which he buried the ``wimp'' factor, ``turned his
whole campaign around,'' and connected with voters even as the
media missed the story.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating conventions in which the parties will strive to
stifle conflict and project unity, TV journalists are preparing to
focus on the subtler undercurrents. Or as Ortiz puts it, to spend
time ``talking about why you're seeing what you're seeing and what
you're not seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being shown, if you will, a very dramatic press
release,'' said an MSNBC executive producer, Steve Capus. ``It's
all scripted and it's all controlled. But you've got to read the
tea leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, those tea leaves will likely reveal a careful
balancing act between Bush's brand of compassionate conservatism
and an appeal to the party's more ideological activists. And that
may make for good television.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the threshold obvious question as to how well each
party will showcase itself,'' said Fox News anchor Brit Hume. ``As
long as they're attractive and reasonable in their presentation of
themselves, conservative policies work. They have a story to tell
and they don't have to hide from their agenda. (But) there are some
things about the conduct of other Republicans and Republicans in
Congress that people don't like. And they have to mute that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are pitching their message to a general public and
putting a veneer on it,'' said Craig Crawford, editor-in-chief of
the Hotline political newsletter. ``But these conventions are also
about preaching to the choir and energizing the base. I believe you
get a more honest view of what they'll really do in office than you
will in a TV ad.''
</P>
<P>
   An unabashed convention fan, Crawford is aware of declining
viewer interest. But he said that ``if people sat down and watched
these things as much as they watched `Frazier,' the networks would
be all over them.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thompson said a wider audience is possible, given that
traditional convention coverage has ``totally missed . . . its
potential entertainment value.''
</P>
<P>
   In a period of political scandal and intrigue, Thompson favors
what he calls ``the `West Wing'-ing of convention coverage,''
trying scrutiny that dramatizes the main convention players by
delving into their lives and backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   That view might seem a bit extreme. But MSNBC's Williams vividly
remembers the moment during the 1996 Democratic convention when
someone first brandished a copy of the Star tabloid detailing the
relationship with a prostitute that forced the resignation of
Clinton aide Dick Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any story can break at any time,'' Williams said. ``There are
journalists holding their stories'' for just the right moment, he
adds. ``Don't kid yourself.''

BUSH'S RECORD REVEALS A CONSERVATIVE DEALER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As he read the big, shrill advertisement in his
hometown newspaper one spring day in 1997, state Representative
Paul Sadler had the feeling that he had been stabbed in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, an important Democratic committee chairman, thought he
had reached an understanding with Governor George W. Bush on a plan
to reform the state's creaky tax structure. But then the Texas
Republican Party launched a barrage of ads accusing Sadler of
plotting to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next, Sadler said, gave him a window on Bush's
political soul. The governor enlisted a group of eminent
Republicans to run ads of their own, hailing Sadler and urging the
voters in his conservative East Texas district to ignore the state
party's screed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``understood the political consequences of that kind of
behavior at a time when we had entered into negotiations,'' Sadler
said. But more importantly, the governor displayed ``a sense of
fairness'' and ``a willingness to buck his own party structure,''
Sadler said.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed by the governor's savvy and loyalty, Sadler
collaborated with Bush on taxation and education, helping him to
score key victories in the Texas Legislature. He is proud, he said,
to call Bush ``my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   And the GOP state chairman who ran the offending ad? He ran for
attorney general in 1998, and was defeated by a candidate whom Bush
promoted for the job.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remarkable gesture of comity and political pluck marked
the rough midpoint, and captures much of the spirit, of his 5 1/2
years as governor.
</P>
<P>
   It is a slender public record by the standards of most modern
presidents, too brief perhaps to support a definitive portrait of
Bush's talents as a leader. Yet his record as governor, from the
day he won his first election in November 1994 to his decision to
launch a presidential campaign last year, does provide broad hints
of how he might function as president.
</P>
<P>
   Should he govern in Washington as he has governed in Austin,
Bush will be conservative, but not reactionary. He will favor
corporate America, but will not turn his back on the plight of the
needy. He will be cautious, but capable of surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Given the opportunity, Bush is likely to reach across party
lines and work with moderate Democrats in Congress. He will be
willing to compromise, happy to claim less than total victory if it
moves him toward his goal and if it maintains or replenishes his
political capital.
</P>
<P>
   On many key issues he will be an orthodox Republican president:
against gun controls; against abortion; ; anti-abortion and
reflexively tough on criminals, welfare cheats, and juvenile
offenders. He will display a disdain for Ivy League experts despite
his Ivy League education, and also will scorn liberal elites,
teachers' unions, and trial lawyers. He will support voluntary
measures to preserve the environment, rein in government
regulators, lend a sympathetic ear to American business, and
support free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ronald Reagan, Bush will set his administration's
priorities, chart a general philosophical course, and delegate
authority to his staff and Cabinet secretaries. He will be
colorblind when sizing up potential friend or foe, and when
carrying out his will to do away with traditional forms of
affirmative action. He will demand loyalty from his lieutenants,
reward his contributors, flatter the White House press corps.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will be cocky, likeable, a bit of a wise-ass, and sometimes
cruel. He may, at some point in his first term as president, roll
the dice with a daring initiative, heedless of the political risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does emerge from Bush's record is that he has real
political skills, and those are not to be despised,'' writes Molly
Ivins, the liberal columnist for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and
no great fan of the man she dubbed ``Dubya.''
</P>
<P>
   Caveats must accompany such predictions. A president can grow
into, or be crushed by, the Oval Office. The Democratic barons on
Capitol Hill may prove far more determinedly partisan than the
moderates whom Bush wooed in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most important, a future war or recession may offer
sterner tests than the prosperity that has buffered all the choices
Bush has made as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is his record in Texas that the man who will be nominated
by the Republican Party for president this week cites as the
rationale for his candidacy. And it is Bush's record that will give
many voters, as it did for Sadler, a window on the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush was elected in 1994 as an orthodox Republican whose
campaign was summed up in its slogan: ``Take a Stand for Texas
Values.'' The young man with the famous name and daddy, the
managing general partner and part-owner of the Texas Rangers, beat
the Democratic governor, Ann Richards, by 54 percent to 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, it was a Republican year, as the GOP took
control of the US House of Representatives for the first time in
four decades and elected Newt Gingrich speaker. Bush also cashed in
on the lingering sympathy in the state for his father, who had been
deposed (despite carrying Texas) by Bill Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush had had a front-row seat to learn from his party's
triumphs and defeats during the Reagan-Bush years in Washington.
Like Reagan, he chose a few well-defined priorities, which he
pursued single-mindedly. Like his father, Bush sought to put a
``kinder, gentler'' face on conservativism's themes of individual
self-reliance and governmental restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is going to be a hybrid'' of the two former
Republican presidents, said the Texas secretary of state, Elton
Bomer, a former Democratic legislator who served as insurance
commissioner under Bush. ``He will chart his own course. He will
listen; he's a good listener. He is a conservative, but he does
have compassion, and I don't think that is a hollow phrase he uses.
I've seen him operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush promised the voters to focus on four problems in his first
year as governor: to cut the welfare rolls, to crack down on crime,
to improve the state's schools, and to make it harder for people to
file and win big lawsuits. He was no innovator: The
Democratic-controlled Legislature had been working on these issues
for months.
</P>
<P>
   But if he did not make his mark as an innovator in his first
year in office, Bush would impress as an implementer.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature meets for 140 days every two years, giving
governors two narrow windows in each four-year term to get their
programs enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's challenge was compounded by the Legislature's status as a
powerful institution that writes the state's budget, that approves
or rejects the governor's appointees, and that sets its own agenda.
A Texas governor can veto bills, but otherwise must rely on popular
appeal or personal persuasion to work his will.
</P>
<P>
   To fulfill his campaign promises, Bush had to reach a
rapprochement with his lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock, a
Democrat, and the speaker, J. E. ``Pete'' Laney, the Democrat in
charge of the Texas House.
</P>
<P>
   Laney was a shrewd West Texas cotton farmer. Bullock was a Texas
legend, a larger-than-life figure in the mold of Lyndon Johnson.
``The lieutenant governor is the most powerful elected official in
the state, or at least was when Bullock was alive,'' said Suzy
Woodford, the executive director of Common Cause of Texas. ``He
controlled the flow of legislation to the floor of the Senate.''
Bullock died in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush's pragmatism, and individual touch, reaped dividends. He
made the most of his personality, adopting a relaxed style,
schmoozing with the legislators on their own turf, having regular
breakfast meetings with Bullock, whom he nicknamed ``Bully,'' and
with Laney, and showing a willingness to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock and Bush became particularly close. Bullock endorsed
Bush over the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Garry Mauro, in
1998, even though the lieutenant governor was godfather to Mauro's
daughter. Bush ``had an outstanding relationship with Lieutenant
Governor Bullock,'' Bomer said. ``They were fast friends. In fact,
Bush gave the eulogy at his funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1995 session the headlines gauging the new
governor's performance read, ``Four for Four.'' Bush didn't get all
he wanted, but with his support the Legislature increased school
accountability, cut the amounts awarded in lawsuits, demanded more
work from welfare recipients, and changed the juvenile justice
system, lowering the age a youth could be charged with serious
felonies from 15 to 14.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to say if Bush could repeat the performance of his
freshman term should he get to the White House. Because the Texas
Legislature meets for such short periods, said Margaret LaMontagne,
a top Bush adviser, the state's elected officials cannot afford to
indulge in contentious partisan gridlock. ``We have to get our work
done down here. . . . There is a sense of purpose. Things don't get
put off,'' she said.

   TAKE-BOS  
 AUSTIN, Texas: ... she said.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bush was aided by Bullock's and Laney's conservative Democratic
views. He may discover that a style well-suited for Austin does not
translate to Washington, where the partisan forces play a much
tougher game.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``has the ability to reach across party lines and build a
consensus, but the ability to do that depends on the willingness of
all the parties to try to build something, to be successful,''
Sadler said. ``The viewpoint in Washington is not to be successful,
but to destroy the other party and shape election politics as
opposed to taking an issue and trying to resolve it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 session of the Texas Legislature gave Texans a look at
a different side of their governor, when Bush stunned the state by
announcing that he was wagering his political capital on a sweeping
tax overhaul plan.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the Bush who, in 1995, had stepped out to lead an
ongoing parade. The tax bill was his baby, a bid to help low- and
middle-income families with their property tax bills while
improving the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe you have to spend political capital or it withers
and dies,'' Bush has said. This time Bullock was on the other side,
taunting him in public that the idea was ``dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem in Texas, as in other states, was one of
equalization. The state's public school system was largely
supported by property taxes, so that students in wealthy districts
got a better education than those in poorer areas. As the costs of
improving the state's schools rose, so did the hardship on working
families paying property tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   `We're doing it backward in Texas _ funding our schools locally
but governing them centrally,'' Bush told the voters.
</P>
<P>
   The state had been sued by representatives of the poorer
districts, and had been ordered in the courts to put a fiscal patch
in place: a ``Robin Hood'' plan that shifted money from the
wealthier to poorer school districts. The makeshift fix offered
near-term relief, but did not address long-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's solution was daring. He proposed that the Legislature
shift most of the burden of financing education from local school
districts to the state government, and that the Legislature make up
for the resultant $3 billion cut in local property taxes by
increasing the state sales tax and enacting a new and expansive
``Texas Business Tax.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan had winners and losers. Middle-class
homeowners and poor school districts would find relief, but so
would giant oil companies with sizable property holdings. Lawyers,
doctors, engineers, and many small-business partnerships would find
themselves paying a business tax for the first time. Democrats
griped that the poorest Texans, who generally rent their homes,
would face higher sales taxes with no guarantee that landlords
would share the property tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   The aggrieved interests let their views be known in Austin, and
the governor's plan was chewed on and spat out. The Texas House
dumped Bush's business tax. To finance its own proposed $4 billion
cut in property taxes, the House passed a package of sin taxes on
cigarettes, alcohol, and other items.
</P>
<P>
   Bush endorsed the House plan, largely because it preserved his
goal of shifting the school financing burden from local school
boards to the state. But his own Republican senators, griping about
the tax hikes and responding to the complaints of small-business
owners and professionals, joined with Bullock and enough
conservative Democrats to kill the plan in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   None of the governor's schmoozing and grins and personal appeals
could save his tax plan. As a sop, the legislative leaders offered
him a $1 billion cut in property taxes by increasing the homestead
exemption _ the amount of each home that is exempt from taxation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is respected by the Legislature and can get things done.
He has worked with both sides of the aisle effectively, and used
his limited powers and power of persuasion to do so,'' said William
Stouffer, a political science professor at Southwest Texas State
University. ``But in this case he could not get it past the leaders
of his own right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had lost his bet, revealing the limits of his ``aw,
shucks'' brand of leadership. Yet he emerged, remarkably, as strong
and popular as ever. The voters and legislators respected Bush's
gumption and vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it speaks volumes about his character,'' said Sadler,
the Democratic representative, who chaired the special House
committee that dealt with the issue. ``He was extremely successful
in his first session, riding high in the popular opinion polls, and
so chose,'' in his second legislative session, ``to take on the
most controversial tax and school issues in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you combine the property tax and schools,'' Sadler went
on, ``you reach everybody. Everyone had a stake. And he didn't have
to do it, but he recognized we had a problem and chose to deal with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, when all attempts at compromise had failed, Sadler
and Bush had a private meeting to discuss their options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you trying to help?'' Sadler asked Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to help the poorest of Texas homeowners,'' the
governor answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then pass the homestead exemption. . . . It will mean the most
to them,'' Sadler said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Sadler said, ``I would have passed anything he
asked. We had been through a war _ I would have done it for him.
But when given that choice I thought his response, immediate and
personal to me, said a lot about the person.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to say that Bush is unable to dish out red meat
to his right-wing constituents when he must, or that Democrats will
not complain that he is long on conservativism and short on
compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bills Bush has signed into law are measures to require
that parents be notified before a daughter, 18 years old or
younger, can get an abortion, to limit the liability of gun
manufacturers, and to allow Texans to carry concealed handguns in
public.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a favorite of the National Rifle Association. As has
been widely noted, he has presided over more executions than any
other American governor in the modern era. He has pushed,
unsuccessfully, for a Texas school voucher plan, in which parents
would be reimbursed for sending children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has supported a measure that banned gay couples
from becoming foster parents or from adopting foster children. He
vetoed a bill that would have boosted patients' rights in their
dealings with HMOs. He has fought to limit the number of poor
children eligible for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush took a walk when, in the aftermath of the 1998 murder
of James Byrd Jr., a black man who was dragged behind the pickup
truck of three white racists in Jasper, Texas, he was asked to
endorse a law against hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All crime is hate,'' Bush said, explaining his reluctance to
endorse the legislation. One of his objections, Bush said, was the
sponsors' inclusion of homosexuals as a group that would be
protected by the law. It failed to pass the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the governor's critics acknowledge that Bush's success
with ``compassionate conservativism'' shows a master politician at
work. His most masterful ``straddle,'' the columnist Ivins said,
``has been keeping a moderate face on the Texas Republican Party
while keeping the Christian Right happy.''
</P>
<P>
   LaMontagne, the Bush aide, a specialist in education policy,
sees it differently. Bush may have pushed for measures like the
voucher program, she says, but that was a matter of the governor's
personal philosophy, not a sop to the Right.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has never satisfied the social conservatives on the Texas
Board of Education, she says, a group with whom he has feuded for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had conservative experts helping us write our state
curriculum, but many of the archconservatives on the state board
refused to support us,'' LaMontagne said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush's final tug of war with the Texas Legislature took place in
1999, as he organized his presidential candidacy and began to build
a phenomenal war chest, with huge contributions from industries
regulated by the Texas state government.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's task was made somewhat easier by his landslide
victory over the Democrat Mauro in the 1998 gubernatorial race,
which helped to carry a host of Republican commissioners and
legislators into office. The state Senate went Republican, and a
GOP lieutenant governor replaced Bullock, who was dying.
</P>
<P>
   On issues that were important to Republican primary voters, Bush
had mixed results. He scored when the Legislature passed another
billion-dollar cut in property taxes, cut hundreds of millions of
dollars in sales, oil, and business taxes, imposed tougher
requirements on schoolchildren for promotion to the next grade, and
approved his bill requiring parental notification for minors
seeking abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was unable to get the Legislature to pass more
stringent limits for welfare recipients, and he lost one of his top
priorities: the school voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's maneuvering on one major issue, air pollution, was
particularly revealing. It offered a glimpse of how he attempts to
balance principle and ambition.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of a loophole in the state's Clean Air Act, the
smokestacks of the Houston-Galveston petrochemical corridor have
joined the booming number of cars in the growing metropolitan areas
of Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, and San Antonio to give Texas what,
by some standards, is the nation's dirtiest air.
</P>
<P>
   The US Environmental Protection Agency and Texas
environmentalists have demanded that the state crack down on
polluters. But many of the governor's top campaign contributors
represent industries that pollute the air.
</P>
<P>
   Like most politicians, Bush has been solicitous toward those who
finance his career. He has appointed big contributors to the state
boards and commissions that regulate business and the environment
in Texas, and to the entities that make investment decisions for
the huge state employee pension funds and university endowments.
</P>
<P>
   So Bush's solution to the air pollution problem was to call in
the state's major industrial interests and ask them to draft a
voluntary compliance program. At the same time, he endorsed a plan,
also requested by big contributors, to deregulate the Texas energy
and power industry.
</P>
<P>
   The clean-air forces in the Texas Legislature saw an opportunity
and did what Bush would not: They offered energy deregulation as a
tradeoff to industry in return for cleaner air and higher fines on
polluters.
</P>
<P>
   The bargaining went down to the session's final hours. The final
legislation was far tougher than Bush had proposed, but earned the
governor's support, and passed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got to have it both ways: He had kept the voluntary system
alive, but he was able to claim on the campaign trail that he had
signed a law that cleaned up Texas' air. It is an approach to
governing he will bring to Washington, should the voters elect him
in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's style is to move the ball down the field,''
LaMontagne said. ``There are outliers on both sides that don't
join. But we have been able to assemble a consensus.''

SHIPPING COMPANIES' DISPUTE SETS CANADA WAR GEAR ADRIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ A Soviet-built, American-owned cargo ship
steaming under the flag of a tiny Caribbean nation and manned by a
Ukrainian crew is holding hostage hundreds of Canadian battle
tanks, along with huge quantities of munitions and other war gear,
in a bizarre deep sea standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The maritime drama underway in the cold waters of the North
Atlantic was sparked by a financial feud between two private
shipping companies but is threatening to become a national
humiliation for Canada, whose leaders seem reluctant to use
military force to storm to the rescue of the military.
</P>
<P>
   The superfreighter GTS Katie is carrying 10 percent of Canada's
entire force of armored vehicles, including 580 battle tanks,
personnel carriers, and reconnaissance vehicles, plus 390 giant sea
containers of weapons, sophisticated electronics warfare gear, and
three hapless Canadian soldiers escorting the equipment home from
peacekeeping operations in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our information is that they are being well-treated,''
Canadian military spokesman Captain Thomas St. Denis said Sunday,
referring to the soldiers. ``But there is no resolution of the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Katie was supposed to have unloaded the military cargo in
Montreal on July 16. Instead, the rogue ship is maneuvering in
circles 600 miles east of Halifax while Canada's Minister for
Defense fusses, fumes, and issues tough statements to the media.
For all the bluster, however, the government has thus far been
unwilling to take stern steps to rescue its arsenal from the
unarmed freighter and its merchant crew.
</P>
<P>
   The Katie has been chugging in a holding pattern beyond Canada's
maritime boundary since July 18. The ship's owner, Third Ocean
Marine Navigation Co. of Annapolis, Md., acknowledges that it has
instructed the captain to remain in international waters until
legions of lawyers and diplomats sort out a complex dispute
involving subcontractors and fine points of maritime law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ship has plenty of fuel,'' said Peter Margan, president of
Third Ocean. ``If I have to, I can sit out there for 50-plus
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Art Eggleton warned over the weekend that
Canada may take ``robust'' measures to retrieve its tanks and
munitions. Canadian news reports, quoting unidentified officials,
said the government is seriously considering a ``show of naval
strength'' to force the Katie into port.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday a Canadian military spokesman, Capt. Bruce Poulin,
said an Aurora surveillance aircraft had conducted ``overflights''
of the vessel, and raised the possibility that the ship would
``resume a course'' for Canadian waters, although he stressed that
``negotiations are continuing.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far, despite a growing public clamor, Ottawa has refused
to dispatch warships to bring the wayward vessel to bay. ``We're
not looking at a Rambo situation,'' said Randy Mylyk, spokesman for
the Defense Ministry. ``All diplomatic and other means are being
used to bring an end to the impasse.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however: ``No option has been excluded.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Canadian politicians are furious at a situation in which an
American company is, in effect, thumbing its nose at the Canadian
military to resolve a financial dispute with a third party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lack of sea-lift capability threatens to create an
international incident of national embarrassment,'' said Art
Hanger, a member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Hanger was referring to military cuts that have left Canada
incapable of moving its forces around the world. Instead, the
military has to hitch rides with American or British forces, or _
as in this case _ hire civilian firms to carry its equipment and
fighters to distant peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
   None of the parties involved would discuss details of the
dispute, but the Canadian government said it originally contracted
with a Montreal firm, Andromeda Navigation, to transport the
equipment. Andromeda, in turn, hired Third Ocean Marine to provide
ship and crew. The disagreement involves those two cargo companies,
not the Canadian government directly. The Maryland company is
refusing to relinquish the military gear or the three soldiers
until Andromeda makes payments on alleged debts.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are higher than in ordinary shipping disputes because
the cargo is not simply bananas or steel ingots, but a substantial
portion of a NATO nation's military might. But to seize Katie on
the high seas would technically represent a Canadian act of war
against the nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, under whose
flag of convenience the ship is registered.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the three Canadian soldiers caught on the Katie
describe their ordeal as not especially harrowing, although they
are getting sick of watching Russian-language videos, the only
entertainment aboard the cargo vessel, which served as a Soviet
military transport before the 1991 collapse of the Communist state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being treated fine,'' Master Corporal Dan Daly told CTV
News in a satellite phone interview Saturday. ``We're waiting to
let the situation play out.''

 &HT;    Napster's end won't stop the e-music
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ It was early in the a.m. and something
woke me. A sound. The faint plastic-on-plastic tap of computer
keys.
</P>
<P>
   I squinted toward the sound and saw it was just my daughter
reacting to a federal court order.
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting she had only a day left to use Napster, she was up
late downloading the last few songs. She was joined by hundreds of
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Marilyn Patel granted an injunction
Wednesday closing Napster. She agreed with the Recording Industry
Association of America that Napster is a copyright-infringement
machine.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court, however, stayed the injunction hours
before the ordered shut-down. The sleep loss was unnecessary.
Napster probably will keep going at least another six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Napster came to my attention when my teen-aged son loaded it on
my computer. Every time I boot up, there's a surprise waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The program connects your computer with the Napster server. This
allows you to search for music files on the hard drives of everyone
else connected to Napster's server.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody likes two-handed columnists, but I can see points in both
sides of this fight.
</P>
<P>
   Recording companies don't want their world to change. They want
to keep issuing music on overpriced CDs. Whatever its faults, this
system pays the people who play the tunes.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who writes things for a living, I think that paying
people for creative work is A Good Thing. It allows us to live in
houses.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the music industry has a history of opposing
every technology that comes down the pike _ player-piano rolls,
radio broadcasting and recording tape. Despite their cries of
certain doom, each became a blessing in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   Napster means you can listen to something before buying it. It
means that if you only like one song on an album you don't need to
pay big bucks for the whole CD. It means you that if you want to
hear something new you are not at the mercy of formula radio
stations and obnoxious, trash-mouthed DJs. It means you need to
depend on record stores with no jazz or classical bins and cool
clerks who consider anyone over 25 as a possible nursing-home
escapee.
</P>
<P>
   Napster was a gift from the techno gods to new bands,
underground music and garage bands desperate to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Believing the jig was up, I used the same evening to download
Cheap Trick's ``I Want You to Want Me.'' Cheap Trick is a guilty
pleasure. If a CD by the group were found around my house, I would
be ridiculed by my children, shunned by my peers and growled at by
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   But when you have something like this hidden away in the
magnetic coating of a hard drive, nobody can guess how bad your
taste really is.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we return to the original question: who's going to pay
the piper? How will keep lead singers in hair spray?
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of anyone's concern for starving musicians, this case
is not the end of the story. Even if the record companies
ultimately win.
</P>
<P>
   Technology does not die off by court decree. There are at least
a half dozen programs that do something similar to Napster, but do
it in hard-to-prosecute ways.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's 20 million users aren't going to slink away in defeat.
They have tasted a more flexible way to find more varied music.
They aren't going back.
</P>
<P>
   E-music is here to stay. The industry needs find a way to peddle
tracks on the Internet that would be cheaper but still allow people
to make a living playing music. A tall order, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   But if they can't pull it off, the black market for sound may
overwhelm the above-ground star-making machinery of the popular
song. Short of establishing a Music Police Squad, it can't be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   And if they come to my door, I'll deny everything.

 &HT;    Superwoman on an off day
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``I AM NOT SUPERWOMAN!? Gail yells into the
phone plastered against my ear. ``A pox upon Martha Stewart!''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than ask what has tilted her day into a spell of the
nasties, I join in. ``YEAH! And Helen Trent and Our Gal Sunday,
too!'' The Cape Cod end of the connection falls silent for a just a
second while she thinks that one over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's that?'' she asks. I knew she would. Gail's 12 years
younger than I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio soaps my mother listened to,'' I explain. ``They'd be on
every day when I came home from school for lunch. Helen Trent was
the '40s idea of superwoman. She was unmarried, made her own
living, kept everybody happy including Gil Whitney, her rich
boyfriend who spent most of his dialogue on proposals of marriage _
and she never raised her voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Silence. Then, ``You're kidding. They really had stuff like that
on the radio back then?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can a girl from a little mining town in the west find
happiness as the wife of a wealthy and titled Englishman? And now,
Our Gal Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   More silence, then, ``You're putting me on, right? You can't
even memorize your social security number and I'm supposed to
believe you have total recall of a 60-year-old soap opera?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep. His name was Lord Henry Brinthrop and she was his Lady,
Sunday. Naturally, Sunday was sweet, and Lord Henry was a wise and
adoring husband. Just your everyday perfect people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail is astounded that anyone would have committed so much
useless stuff to memory and asks how it happened. It's like
anything else, I explain. If you hear it enough when you're young,
you never forget it, and I was a captive
</P>
<P>
   audience, listening to Mother's soaps over meat patties and
Campbell's soup, five days a week until I went off to a junior high
school that was too far away to walk home for lunch. ``It's kind of
like, why do I remember 12 times 12 is
</P>
<P>
   146.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you remember that?'' Gail asks. ``It's not right.'' I
tell her it's probably close enough unless it's one thousand and
forty-six. She sighs and gets on with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years I did superwoman,'' she groans. ``I had three kids
running around the house, all shorter than the counter where I was
kneading bread dough. All day long I was in the kitchen baking
rolls, cookies, desserts _ everything
</P>
<P>
   from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``And don't forget the garden,'' she adds in a flash of memory.
``I grew all of our own vegetables so I could kill myself canning
stuff, making pickles and jellies, just like perfect wives and
mothers should. Where did I find the time?
</P>
<P>
   And who ever told me I had to do all that?''
</P>
<P>
   Out of curiosity I ask if she's feeling guilty because she blew
off the day. She asks how I guessed. I tell her it happens to me
all the time. ``I'm lucky to have one normal day a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us to another of our ``what's normal?'' discussions.
Forget the psychological baloney about normal being an arbitrary
idea that varies according to the unwell mind that's determining
its parameters. We're beyond
</P>
<P>
   the ``feel good'' stuff. We want some answers here.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we'd be ``normal'' if we had husbands, we decide. Maybe
we've lived alone too long. ``Just think,'' Gail begins in a
``nyah, nyah, I told you so'' singsong, ``if you had a husband
you'd probably have to stop sleeping outside in a
</P>
<P>
   hammock all summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, I chime in: ``Oh yeah'' Well, if you had a
husband you'd have to stop digging up your woods and moving all the
trees around every couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   We fall silent for a moment, apparently rethinking our quest for
normality. Maybe it's not what we really want. Trouble is,
somewhere in the back of our minds is the irresistible urge to put
on an apron and dust the knickknacks
</P>
<P>
   while the pot roast cooks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a generation thing _ but we're fighting it.

 &HT;    InterAct accessory puts Sega to shame
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Reconfirming Sega's ineptitude in designing
interface devices for the Dreamcast console, InterAct Accessories
offers the TremorPak Plus ($20; www.interact-acc.com), an
all-in-one memory card and tactile feedback device that takes up
half the space in the controller (one slot for both functions)
while boasting the same amount of memory (200 blocks). More
importantly, the TremorPak Plus requires no batteries. It also has
no LCD screen, not that anyone seems to miss that private function.
It rumbles harder _ or ``jumps'' higher than Sega's equivalent, the
``Jump Pack'' _ and combines for $20 what Sega's two units do less
effectively for $50.

 &HT;    Oxygen.com a halfway fresh concept
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Oxygen cable channel for women never lets you
forget for a minute that there is also an Oxygen Web site.
</P>
<P>
   A black strip with Web site addresses runs continuously across
the Oxygen channel. While it's not as annoying or depressing as the
CNBC all-day Nasdaq ticker, it does bring a new dimension to
television viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has seen the Oxygen channel knows there's not a whole
lot to see. Typically it's nothing more than several very hip, very
trendy ``Sex and the City'' wannabes sitting around in sweater sets
and stilettos talking about nothing much deeper than how they like
their boyfriends to dress or asking makeup experts whether it's all
right to wear blue eye shadow to board meetings. (Just so you know,
it's not.)
</P>
<P>
   PBS this is not, and the average female viewer probably has
deeper and more interesting conversations with the counter help at
Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   But while the hosts babble on about the topic of the day, keep a
close eye on the Web sites running across the bottom of the screen.
Get a pen and notepad and keep them on the coffee table. You might
find some nifty stuff here. During a segment about buying art
online, several interesting Web sites popped up that offered great
resources for buying prints as well as tips on getting exactly what
you pay for. Last week, a segment on cowgirl chic featured all
kinds of links to Web sites for real cowgirls as well as a neat
board game with a cowgirl theme.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you think you can remember this endless swirl of Web
sites, guess again.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Web site is flashed on the screen over and over
again, as is the Web site for advertiser Kraft (www
</P>
<P>
   .kraftfoods.com), remembering which Web site had the tips for
planning a hiking trip or those neat art-deco clocks they were
showing is tough.
</P>
<P>
   If you have Web access, as Oxygen is betting you do, you can log
onto the Web site www.oxygen.com and find a list of links featured
on the latest installment of whatever ``show'' you were watching.
Even though it looks as if it's just people sitting around talking,
these shows really do have titles.
</P>
<P>
   When you head to the Oxygen Web site, you'll be in for a
pleasant surprise and great disappointment. It's a rare Web site
that can be both brilliant and awful at the same time, but somehow
Oxygen seems to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Oxygen site hoping to find the same list of
sites they saw on TV or to find out some other information related
to the cable network get the added bonus of wandering through some
of Oxygen's online content. The content is a lot richer in depth
and intelligence than its TV counterpart. (Its recent salute to
novelist Judy Blume was beautifully designed and had lots of
intelligent input from Oxygen readers.)
</P>
<P>
   However, when you leave the interesting and beautiful original
content area and head for the TV tie-in area, you will be reminded
of leaving democratic West Berlin and crossing over to Communist
East Berlin before the wall came down. There's a distinct
difference, and that's a real shame.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to find the cowgirl game was an impossible mission. The
``She-Commerce'' area listed six Web sites related to ``cowgirl
fashion.'' I am positive many more sites flashed across the bottom
of the screen than the paltry few listed on the site. And the
cowgirl-themed board game that looked like so much fun when the
hosts were playing it on the air was nowhere to be found. It was a
miserable letdown and at least one online sale lost.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxygen Web site works when it does its own thing. It falls
to pieces when it tries to mesh with the cable channel. To really
separate Oxygen from the pack of still obscure cable channels and
so-called women's Web sites, Oxygen.com needs to pay more attention
to its poor relation, the cable channel, and make the tie-in as
interesting to visit and as easy to navigate as the rest of the
site. There's no doubt the staff at Oxygen.com is up to the task,
and making the Web site more interesting than the cable channel
certainly won't take that much work.

 &HT;    Can't live without 'em
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some people are in love with their pets. Others spend
hours lovingly attending to their cars or boats. And then there are
those special people who are deeply attached to technology.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a Palm Pilot or the latest in paging or e-mail
gadgets, these Internet executives, come heaven or high water,
won't leave home without them.
</P>
<P>
   Erika Jolly, EarthLink's vice president of portal product
management, doesn't go anywhere without her PalmV hand-held
personal digital assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I got hooked on my Palm is because I am on the road
so much, and I can see my schedule at a quick glance,'' she says.
``I'm always on my phone if I'm not in meetings, and I can get my
contacts whether they are advertisers, content partners or members
of my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolly commutes between EarthLink's offices in Atlanta and
Pasadena, Calif., at least every other week. The Palm helps her
keep track of where she's going and what she's doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many features on the Palm that are so cool, like
the MapQuest feature, which lets you download maps,'' she says.
``It's so much better than having a pile of paper to drag around
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolly uses the PalmV. ``It's the latest one,'' she says, ``and
it's got all the mega-stuff. I did try the PalmVII, and I went back
to the PalmV. The VII was too big, and it didn't fit into the
pocket of my Tumi backpack real well.''
</P>
<P>
   (Jolly bought the Tumi backpack because it had a special
compartment to hold her Palm Pilot. ``It's so cool,'' she says.)
</P>
<P>
   However, Jolly says her love affair with the Palm may soon be at
an end.
</P>
<P>
   She just bought a new silver Motorola Timeport cellular phone
from Sprint PCS. (Sprint PCS has a relationship with EarthLink.)
</P>
<P>
   She's waiting for a clip-on mobile organizer add-on for her cell
phone that her boss got her hooked on. ``The basic idea is it fits
right on the back of your phone. It has a touch-screen user
interface, so you can scroll through your address book, find the
person you want to call, then your phone calls that person. It's
got an address book, a calendar and a to-do list,'' she says. ``How
cool is that? I ask you, how cool is that? I just have to have
it.''
</P>
<P>
   INSTANT COMMUNICATION
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lanzone, co-founder and marketing vice president of eTour
(www.etour.com) doesn't go anywhere without his Blackberry Rim.
</P>
<P>
   Lanzone, a former Palm Pilot devotee, is a fairly recent convert
to the Blackberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this Palm III I hadn't been using, and I keep
attributing it to the fact that it was too big and bulky and I
didn't like using the stylus thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He got the PalmV for Christmas and vowed he'd use it. But then
fate stepped in. In January, someone from eTour's technology
department came up to Lanzone and said, ``Here's your Blackberry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know anything about it,'' Lanzone says. ``I said,
`Have you got the right person?' ''
</P>
<P>
   He was still unconvinced until he discovered that the Blackberry
would enable him to send e-mail to anybody in the country, from his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did Lanzone log on than he was hooked. He and eTour
marketing director Sam Howe traded as many as 18 e-mails a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get an e-mail from Sam saying he's just about to get on a
plane to San Francisco, and I'd send one back saying, `Hey, I'm in
my car.' Then we'd be at meetings and we'd send them from one end
of the table to another. That's how bad it was,'' he says. ``We all
went through this `Blackberry euphoria.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lanzone hasn't used his PalmV since the day he got his
Blackberry. ``It also has a calendar, a contact list, a task list.
The only thing I can do on my Palm that I can't do on the
Blackberry is play chess, and that's not enough of a reason to
carry that big thing around with me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As much fun as the Blackberry can be, it's also a useful tool
for staying in touch with co-workers strewn around town and around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Lanzone estimates he gets between 200 and 300 e-mails a day.
With his heavy travel schedule, having the Blackberry with him
means he can respond to important messages without having to lug
his laptop computer around and wait until he had someplace to plug
in to check messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to talk to me, or they have to show me a document
right away,'' he says, ``And I can get all of that, and I can get
it real time. When I'm not at my desk, it's the easiest way to
reach me. It's one of the essential tools.'' He uses it regularly
to communicate instantly with his ad agency, public relations firm
and radio media buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also has curbed my cell phone use drastically. I used to
have by far the highest cell phone bills in the company. It was
almost absurd. Now it's about a quarter of what I used to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanzone's wife, Shannon, is also learning to live with her
husband's passion for his Blackberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife loves it and she hates it,'' he says, laughing. ``My
dad named this thing the bumble, because it buzzes when it goes
off. Everyone loves to tease me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanzone says another great feature of the Blackberry is that you
can be a computer geek without anyone ever knowing. ``I wear it in
the office. But when I step out into the real world, I put it in my
pocket so I won't be laughed at in the street by small children.''
</P>
<P>
   PAGES, PAGES EVERYWHERE
</P>
<P>
   The halls of BellSouth are unusually quiet, but it's not because
the people are unfriendly. In the halls, the offices and even in
the elevator, nearly everyone is in his or her own private world,
busily typing away on BellSouth Interactive pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Yeatts, vice president of Internet portal services for
BellSouth.net, was one of the first to have his own pager. When he
got it, he was working in another department and used it to stay in
touch with his very busy boss. ``We'd see each other in person
about once a month, and this was a great way to stay in touch.''
</P>
<P>
   The BellSouth pager can do a variety of things. Each user has a
specific pager Internet address, so it's also possible to use a PC
to send e-mail directly to the pager. Pager users can also send
e-mail to other pager owners and other computers, or even send a
message that can be delivered by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cool thing about this is that it's always on,'' Yeatts
says. ``You get immediate feedback. You know when the message is
sent. You know when it's been read. With our BellSouth crowd, the
only reason somebody didn't get the message is if their battery
died or they are on an airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   The always-on pager also came in handy during a big meeting with
corporate officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a new person in the meeting, and somebody was giving
a very technical presentation,'' he says. ``This person didn't know
all the acronyms flying around the room, so they were messaging me,
and I could explain what everything was without disrupting the
meeting. Otherwise it would have been a mystical, strange
experience for the new employee.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the pager has dozens of useful office applications,
Yeatts says it can be a lot of fun around the house, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that applies to the workplace applies to your life,''
he says. ``I was at Turner Field waiting to meet someone, and I
knew that person had a pager. So I sent a page out that said `Where
are you?' And we found each other like radar.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeatts also has his pager with him when he's working in his
garden. He says he wears ear protection headphones when he's using
a large, noisy lawn mower. ``So I'm out there mowing the lawn and
my wife needs me, so she sends me a message saying `Could you come
in the house?' '' Yeatts says his wife also uses the PC to send
e-mail that appears almost instantly on his pager.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yeatts knows even the silent act of sending an e-mail
under a restaurant table can be a little annoying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that a lot of people are irritated by this stuff.
... It's a subtler version of the cell phone problem. You try not
to answer the page when someone is in the middle of a very
interesting conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeatts says he has macros set on his pager that let the sender
know he's busy and he'll get back to them later. If something is
urgent, he tells them to send it again and mark it urgent and he
will read it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about it is you can always stay connected,''
he says. ``It's about real-time, wireless communication.''

 &HT;    Computer ideas for ending kids' late-summer boredom
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the heat becomes unbearable, the kids come inside
to play. If boredom sets in and your imagination thins to
suggesting soap operas to the little ones, turn instead to the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of new programs and Web sites that offer fun
stuff for kids to do, with a little education thrown in to boot.
</P>
<P>
   If the youngsters are between 3 and 8, take a look at
``Putt-Putt Joins the Circus,'' a delightful romp for both the
Windows and Macintosh platforms.
</P>
<P>
   It's from Humongous Entertainment, which has put out a number of
terrific programs for younger children.
</P>
<P>
   Putt-Putt is an animated purple car who, accompanied by his dog,
Pep, solves memory and logic puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth adventure for Putt-Putt, who first appeared in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest outing, Putt-Putt arrives at the circus only to
discover that there's trouble with the five main acts.
</P>
<P>
   Phillipe the Flea doesn't like his quarters, and Honko the Clown
speaks only in Honkish. Then there are the Flying Porkowskies,
who'll perform without a safety net only when pigs fly, Ivan the
Semi-Strong Man and Reginald the Lion.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Putt-Putt meets other characters and helps them
solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
   The suggested retail price for ``Putt-Putt Joins the Circus'' is
$24.99.
</P>
<P>
   Humongous is within a select circle of children's software
publishers that create enduring animated characters.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has introduced Freddi Fish, Pajama Sam and SPY
Fox into kids' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Humongous products are widely available at retail, on the Web
(www.humongous.com) and by calling 1-800-499-8363.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site also offers activities for children, as well as
tips and tricks. For older kids, log on to Mirriam-Webster's Web
site for kids at www.wordcentral.com to find out what a
``clickaholic'' is. You may be one.
</P>
<P>
   What's a clickaholic?
</P>
<P>
   Why, an enticon, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Created by young wordsmiths, these words are some of the entries
in the ``Build Your Own Dictionary'' section of the site.
</P>
<P>
   Clickaholic means ``someone who is on the computer constantly,
or someone who clicks the mouse constantly,'' while enticon
appropriately means ``a fabricated word.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind ``Build Your Own Dictionary'' is for children to
e-mail their creations to their friends and become excited about
words, says Merriam-Webster publicist Arthur J. Bicknell.
</P>
<P>
   Set up like a school, the Web site takes the user through a
hallway of options, from a science lab where kids can conduct word
experiments to a teacher's lounge where users can learn how a word
gets into the dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a daily buzzword so kids can astound relatives with
unusual words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word Central gets 5 million hits a month, and it's growing,''
Bicknell said.
</P>
<P>
   The site won a Parents' Choice Award from the Parents'
Foundation and a 2000 Webby award for the best educational Web site
from the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences. A
couple more sites for good measure:
</P>
<P>
   stats.bls.gov/k12/html/eduover.htm _ Here kids can start
thinking about what they'd like to do when they grow up. The Web
site has information on a variety of careers, such as architect,
politician, dancer, computer repairman and 30 others. The
professions are arranged by academic area, so a youngster can find
a job that might suit him or her by clicking on a favorite subject
in school. Read about what the career is like, how to prepare for
it, the salary range and more. The site also includes links and
snail mail addresses to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/kindergarden/kinder.htm _ Here kids
can learn about starting a vegetable garden in a park, at school or
in the back yard. This site, operated by Texas A&AMP;M University,
offers tips for kids and parents on gardening as a family. It
includes a list of fun project ideas, such as making a scarecrow,
drying flowers or keeping a garden journal.

 &HT;    Home version of `Millionaire' takes leap from computer to TV
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sony has brought the video game ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' back to the living room.
</P>
<P>
   The first version, modeled after the wildly popular ABC-TV game
show, was for computers only. It sold more than 1.7 million copies,
becoming one of the most popular PC games in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: 2nd Edition'' is for the Sony
PlayStation console. It allows buyers of the game to play it
together with family and friends on the living room TV screen
rather than huddled in front of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   You can now play this $39.95 game in the group environment, like
non-video games such as ``Pictionary'' and ``Trivial Pursuit.''
Divide into the teams and put the PlayStation control in the hands
of your smartest teammate.
</P>
<P>
   A virtual Regis Philbin is your host, complete with his charming
wit and sometimes bratty attitude. The two-player game starts off
with the ``fastest finger'' mode, in which you have to put four
items in chronological order quicker than your opponent to earn the
right to play for money.
</P>
<P>
   The questions in the ``fastest finger'' round can sometimes be
ridiculously hard, forcing both teams to guess repeatedly. It can
test Philbin's temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we have a bunch of Mensa candidates in there,''
Philbin says sarcastically. ``I guess you know I'm just kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Another stinger from Philbin: ``Hey, hey _ what's the IQ in this
room? I'm getting concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   If both teams fail every attempt, then the game starts over. But
not without some final words from our host.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, guys, how many times can we do this?'' Philbin says.
``You are pathetic. The game is over. I'm getting out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you're in the money seat, ``Millionaire'' becomes much more
enjoyable. Just like on TV, you have access to three lifelines:
phone a friend, ask the audience and 50/50.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing in the PlayStation game is more impressive than
the phone-a-friend option. It is an available option for each of
the 600 questions. Choose the phone alternative, and you have
access to one of the virtual game show host's wacky friends,
ranging from a snooty doctor to a person with ESP who leaves advice
on the greetings of his answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   With a limited number of questions, you will start seeing
repeats as early as the 10th time you play. But it doesn't
necessarily make it much easier.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: 2nd Edition,'' the $100
question can be just as challenging as the one for $8,000. Or they
can be exactly the same, just 15 to 20 games apart.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the assistance of friends, it is tough to make it to
the $64,000 mark. If you are able to win $1 million, then you are
either very intelligent or have a superb photographic memory. Just
remember, it's only a virtual $1 million.

 &HT;    Photo e-mail isn't difficult
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Can you tell me how to e-mail a photo? I can get the photo on my
monitor, but the recipient can't call it up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tom Sholtis, Jupiter, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You scanned the photo onto your hard drive. Half the battle
is won. Check some things before sending. First is file type. Some
photo file types include JPEG, TIFF, and EPSF. We suggest JPEG,
which compresses your photo.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Next is file size. Make sure it isn't huge. Some e-mail
systems don't accept large files (depends on the ISP), or your
e-mail system may strip a large file as it leaves the mail server.
It's best to use a compression program before sending. PC users can
use PKWare's PKZip or WinZip. For Mac users, DropStuff. Find the
shareware programs at www.zdnet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Once you check file type and file size, you're ready to
send. Start an e-mail message. Pop in the recipient's address.
Depending on your e-mail program, you should have an attachment
button on the message interface. If not, look for the word
``Attach'' under one of the pull-down menus. A window will pop up
asking where the item is you want to attach. Navigate to your photo
and double-click. The photo attaches to the e-mail. Write a message
and click Send.

   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I plan to buy a Zip drive. I can't decide if I should buy an
external or internal model. Help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ronald Harrison, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You obviously need more storage space, a backup strategy
or a way to transfer data. Maybe all three. Ask the question, ``Is
portability important?''
</P>
<P>
   Sue: If it is, an external Zip storage drive is attractive
because it's easy to tote around, slick and easy to install.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Zip drives are popular, and they've been around.
Compatibility won't be an issue. You shouldn't have trouble
swapping disks for work or play.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Find out how your computer would interface with an external
storage drive. Like everything now, drives come in all flavors.
Interface terms such as USB, SCSI and parallel port may sound like
a string of Greek, but they are important. A tool called zip
configurator at www.iomega.com/zip/configurator/index.html can help
you match your computer with a compatible drive.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Also, think about what and how much you'll be storing.
Are you interested in a 100-MB drive? A 250-MB drive?
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Costs for external Zip drives range from $87 to $135 at
CNet Shopper (shopper.cnet.com/).
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If drive portability isn't an issue, then an internal Zip
may fit the bill. At www.dealtime.com you'll see internal Zip
drives for $85 to $180. If you're not a do-it-your-selfer, plan on
an installation fee.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd write for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Freeware program SoomSoom a unique way to keep track of files
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Behold SoomSoom.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not another panda, nor is it a menu item at your local
Thai pad.
</P>
<P>
   What it is, is software. Free software.
</P>
<P>
   Free software is often more expensive than the price would
indicate, but SoomSoom does a little better than that. It has an
interesting premise and fulfills it fairly well, although not as
magically as its advance notice would have you think.
</P>
<P>
   SoomSoom's publicity billed it as the ``first-ever
name-recognition software,'' whatever that might mean, but it
doesn't recognize anything without instructions.
</P>
<P>
   It's intended for those of us who are forever losing files,
forgetting what we called them, unable even to remember a single
unusual word in them for which to search.
</P>
<P>
   SoomSoom serves as an interface between the user and Microsoft
Word, NotePad, WordPad Excel and other major applications installed
in the computer, as well as the Internet. It has its own e-mail
program and a Web browser based on Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   It's also an address book, which one uses to make sure SoomSoom
can locate files. Let's say you correspond with a fellow named
Otto. First thing you do is set up an address book page for Otto.
It can be quite extensive, but all it really needs is his name.
</P>
<P>
   When you want to write a letter to him or write something about
him, you select the New Document from the menu bar. This gives you
a dialogue box from which you choose the program you'll use to
create the file, name the file and put down the subject, which in
this case would be ``Otto.''
</P>
<P>
   Then whatever program you have selected comes up full screen,
you complete the document and save it wherever you wish. Returning
to SoomSoom's screen, you'll see the document listed when you
select Otto.
</P>
<P>
   One could, of course, accomplish the same thingon vacation this
week. As a high-profile sort of a guy, my vacations are probably
different from yours. It goes with the territory of being a public
figure and living in the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   This year for vacation I bought some tires for my 1991 Nissan.
But I didn't stop there. I also tried something new. After all,
vacations are the time to step outside the usual.
</P>
<P>
   So I tried Webvan. I used the online service that lets you order
groceries over the Web and then have them delivered to your door.
</P>
<P>
   I'll pause for a second and let your thumping heart get its
rhythm back and then tell you what that was like.
</P>
<P>
   My friends and co-workers will tell you that I am not wildly
experimental (I still find ATMs slightly frightening, but I believe
they will catch on) and _ maybe because I've worked for newspapers
for many years _ I can be a little cynical.
</P>
<P>
   So despite all the glowing press reports about the service and
even the praise I'd heard from some friends, I did not go into this
with a glad heart.
</P>
<P>
   But I was determined to try it, so I logged on at www.webvan
.com to set up an account. It was actually pretty easy, but I
figured that the real test would be in the ordering.
</P>
<P>
   The whole notion of Webvan makes me dizzy. Here you have a
company that sells groceries for about the same price as you'd pay
at the store, throws in free delivery and also gives you (for now
at least) $15 off on your first order.
</P>
<P>
   It either has to be run by the tooth fairy or a bunch of guys
with black shirts and white ties. So I was looking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, I didn't find any. Ordering was fairly easy, and I'm
pretty sure it will get easier in the future now that I understand
more about how it works. You use a series of menus to find your
items. The menus start with broad categories. For instance, there's
one called produce, another for meat and seafood, still another for
prepared food _ and they get progressively more specific. For
instance, if you click on the meat and seafood category, you get
new categories that include beef, ham, pork, etc. Click on those
subcategories, and things get even more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, as is my habit, I'd get confused and search for an
item in the wrong category. (Hey, I'm a guy.) That's when the
search feature came in handy. You can type in a specific product _
say garlic _ and find it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Once you find your item, you simply indicate how many of the
item you want and continue shopping. I finished ordering $100 worth
of groceries in about 10 minutes. Then I proceeded to check out.
Unlike at the regular grocery, I did not have to stand in line and
wait while the cashier told the customer ahead of me about the
first three decades of her life. Instead, you give a credit card
number and select a delivery time.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike scheduling the time for the cable guy to come to your
house, these are scheduled in 30-minute increments and _ both in my
experience and that of my friends _ that's when the Webvan folks
actually show up.
</P>
<P>
   My groceries arrived right on time the next day. The vegetables
and fruit looked like they should be on the cover of a food
catalog. The steaks were terrific. And it all _ including the
20-pound bag of cat litter _ was carried right into my kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't technology grand?
</P>
<P>
   What a terrific vacation. Maybe next year I'll do something
really wild and get the carpets steam-cleaned.

 &HT;    `Virtua Tennis' a grand slam of authenticity
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playing ``Virtua Tennis'' is the next best thing to being on the
court with a racket in your hand.
</P>
<P>
   This Dreamcast title _ in my opinion _ is the best yet by Sega
Sports, which is saying a lot considering this is the same crew
that produced highly acclaimed titles such as ``NFL2K'' and
``NBA2K.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe never has a sport been captured and reproduced as well
as with ``Virtua Tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   This is as realistic as it gets on the TV screen. In fact, this
game looks so good that a passerby asked me if I was watching
Wimbledon when I was playing a grass-court match against the
computer opponent.
</P>
<P>
   You have your choice of 16 players, including eight that are
nationally ranked, with American Jim Courier being the most
well-known. Picking a player is strategic, as you must choose an
athlete who fits your own playing style and excels on the selected
tennis surfaces of grass, clay or hard court.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Thomas Johansson of Sweden is known as a ``fast
runner,'' being able to chase down about every ball on the court.
However, Johansson's regular swing and power are average, at best.
Australian Mark Philippoussis is a ``big server'' but may have
problems at times with moving around the court.
</P>
<P>
   The player movements in ``Virtua Tennis'' are as lifelike as a
developer can make them. They are so good in this game that you can
actually use it as a study tool to work on your own serve and
volley.
</P>
<P>
   On a scale of 1-10, I award ``Virtua Tennis'' a 9.99. My wish
for the sequel is for bigger names, such as Pete Sampras or Andre
Agassi, or top women's players.
</P>
<P>
   You'll enjoy the game even if you aren't a terror on the court
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I think I'm going to have to agree with Mr. Carvell on
this one. ``Virtua Tennis'' is on my list of the best games to have
for your Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the realistic animation, character modeling and
television-style camera work, the game play is very simple and
solid. Sure, the eye candy is nice, but what good is it if it
doesn't play well? My knowledge of tennis would barely fill a
thimble, but I had no problem adapting to the game immediately.
</P>
<P>
   After I finally got the basics down, I was able to fine-tune my
shot control thanks to the training stages interlaced throughout
the World Circuit mode. From knocking over bowling pins with a
single serve to dashing back and forth across the court to take out
a series of tennis ball machines, I was able to increase my skill
level with a variety of exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Most of my playing took place in the brilliant World Circuit
mode. By taking a player from competition to competition all over
the globe, I was able to sample a little of everything in the
tennis world. From singles matches to doubles matches, clay courts
to grass courts, I played a good variety of scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   As I completed the various competitions, I won money to buy new
outfits, equipment and partners for doubles competitions. It's a
nice little feature that Sega provides to reward your efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtua Tennis'' also allows up to four players to play
simultaneously. This is another great aspect of the game. No more
swapping controllers back and forth and taking turns. Everyone can
get in there and play. Although there are other four-player titles
out there, I don't think I've had as much multiplayer fun with
those as I've had with ``Virtua Tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one little smudge on this gem of a game, however, and
that is the absence of female players. I wonder how many more units
Sega would have sold if Anna Kournikova were selectable. As Michael
mentioned earlier, perhaps the sequel will have the selection.
</P>
<P>
   If you Dreamcast owners get a chance to buy this game, get it.
``Virtua Tennis'' is in very high demand and after playing it, it's
easy to understand how the initial 50,000 copies sold out so
quickly.

 &HT;    InterAct accessory puts Sega to shame
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Reconfirming Sega's ineptitude in designing
interface devices for the Dreamcast console, InterAct Accessories
offers the TremorPak Plus ($20; www.interact-acc.com), an
all-in-one memory card and tactile feedback device that takes up
half the space in the controller (one slot for both functions)
while boasting the same amount of memory (200 blocks). More
importantly, the TremorPak Plus requires no batteries. It also has
no LCD screen, not that anyone seems to miss that private function.
It rumbles harder _ or ``jumps'' higher than Sega's equivalent, the
``Jump Pack'' _ and combines for $20 what Sega's two units do less
effectively for $50.

   One could, of course, accomplish the same thing in other ways,
such as creating a separate subdirectory named Otto. But that's so
pedestSoomSoom's mail program runs well enough, although it's not
nearly as fast at bringing in the mail as Eudora Pro.
</P>
<P>
   Considering its price, SoomSoom works well. It has the silly
rough edges that seem almost obligatory in freeware _ aggravating
misspellings on its screen, awkward phrases or usages that bespeak
an origin outside English and little mechanical things that don't
work as expected.
</P>
<P>
   In the e-mail program, for instance, you cannot delete an entire
batch of messages; it has to be done one at a time. When you get a
couple of hundred a day, that's not an option.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions are all on-board, festooned with exclamation
marks and not at all extensive.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, what's this SoomSoom name? Knowing that inquiring
minds would want to know, I asked. The answer was that SoomSoom is
the result of ``name-oriented computing, in which everything begins
and ends with a name.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. You can go to www.soomsoom.com, download the program
and try it out for yourself.

 &HT;    Oxygen.com a halfway fresh concept
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Oxygen cable channel for women never lets you
forget for a minute that there is also an Oxygen Web site.
</P>
<P>
   A black strip with Web site addresses runs continuously across
the Oxygen channel. While it's not as annoying or depressing as the
CNBC all-day Nasdaq ticker, it does bring a new dimension to
television viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has seen the Oxygen channel knows there's not a whole
lot to see. Typically it's nothing more than several very hip, very
trendy ``Sex and the City'' wannabes sitting around in sweater sets
and stilettos talking about nothing much deeper than how they like
their boyfriends to dress or asking makeup experts whether it's all
right to wear blue eye shadow to board meetings. (Just so you know,
it's not.)
</P>
<P>
   PBS this is not, and the average female viewer probably has
deeper and more interesting conversations with the counter help at
Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   But while the hosts babble on about the topic of the day, keep a
close eye on the Web sites running across the bottom of the screen.
Get a pen and notepad and keep them on the coffee table. You might
find some nifty stuff here. During a segment about buying art
online, several interesting Web sites popped up that offered great
resources for buying prints as well as tips on getting exactly what
you pay for. Last week, a segment on cowgirl chic featured all
kinds of links to Web sites for real cowgirls as well as a neat
board game with a cowgirl theme.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you think you can remember this endless swirl of Web
sites, guess again.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Web site is flashed on the screen over and over
again, as is the Web site for advertiser Kraft (www
</P>
<P>
   .kraftfoods.com), remembering which Web site had the tips for
planning a hiking trip or those neat art-deco clocks they were
showing is tough.
</P>
<P>
   If you have Web access, as Oxygen is betting you do, you can log
onto the Web site www.oxygen.com and find a list of links featured
on the latest installment of whatever ``show'' you were watching.
Even though it looks as if it's just people sitting around talking,
these shows really do have titles.
</P>
<P>
   When you head to the Oxygen Web site, you'll be in for a
pleasant surprise and great disappointment. It's a rare Web site
that can be both brilliant and awful at the same time, but somehow
Oxygen seems to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Oxygen site hoping to find the same list of
sites they saw on TV or to find out some other information related
to the cable network get the added bonus of wandering through some
of Oxygen's online content. The content is a lot richer in depth
and intelligence than its TV counterpart. (Its recent salute to
novelist Judy Blume was beautifully designed and had lots of
intelligent input from Oxygen readers.)
</P>
<P>
   However, when you leave the interesting and beautiful original
content area and head for the TV tie-in area, you will be reminded
of leaving democratic West Berlin and crossing over to Communist
East Berlin before the wall came down. There's a distinct
difference, and that's a real shame.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to find the cowgirl game was an impossible mission. The
``She-Commerce'' area listed six Web sites related to ``cowgirl
fashion.'' I am positive many more sites flashed across the bottom
of the screen than the paltry few listed on the site. And the
cowgirl-themed board game that looked like so much fun when the
hosts were playing it on the air was nowhere to be found. It was a
miserable letdown and at least one online sale lost.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxygen Web site works when it does its own thing. It falls
to pieces when it tries to mesh with the cable channel. To really
separate Oxygen from the pack of still obscure cable channels and
so-called women's Web sites, Oxygen.com needs to pay more attention
to its poor relation, the cable channel, and make the tie-in as
interesting to visit and as easy to navigate as the rest of the
site. There's no doubt the staff at Oxygen.com is up to the task,
and making the Web site more interesting than the cable channel
certainly won't take that much work.

 &HT;    New senator takes seat
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Zell Miller, Georgia's former governor, is now a U.S.
senator. The Georgia Democrat took the oath of office on Thursday.
Gov. Roy Barnes appointed Miller to fill the seat left empty by
Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell's death. In his first Senate speech,
Miller pledged to serve all Georgians, not just one political
party. He then cast a few votes before all senators returned to
their home states for the Senate's August break.
</P>
<P>
   Miller must run in a special election Nov. 7 to keep his seat in
the Senate. It appears none of Georgia's Republican congressmen
will challenge the Democrat in that election. Some other Republican
politicians in the state are considering the race.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH PICKS RUNNING MATE
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush broke with
tradition last week by announcing his vice presidential choice
early. He chose former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to run as
his vice president. Normally, presidential nominees make those
announcements at their party's national convention. The Republican
convention begins today and will run through Thursday. Cheney, who
is 59, was a congressman from Wyoming during the 1980s. He was
later secretary of defense when Bush's father was president.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST LEADERS GO HOME
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat abandoned peace talks last week. But they remained hopeful
that the two sides could reach an agreement later. At Camp David in
Maryland, the leaders couldn't agree on who would control certain
parts of the city of Jerusalem. Palestinians want control of the
Arab parts of the city, so they can make it the capital of a new
Palestinian state. Israel claims Jerusalem as its own capital.

 &HT;    During the next few weeks, Republicans and Democrats will meet
for their national conventions
 &HT;    By Keith Still
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Surf your TV channels this week, and you'll have
trouble ignoring the political shindig going on in Philadelphia.
It's called the Republican National Convention, and you'll see a
bunch of people waving flags, flapping campaign posters and wearing
funny hats.
</P>
<P>
   What really goes on at political conventions?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans _ their party's nickname is the ``Grand Old Party''
_ and Democrats each hold a national convention every four years.
Right now it's the GOP's turn to party. Democrats will wait till
mid-August, when they meet in Los Angeles. Traditionally, the party
that controls the White House _ in this case, the Democrats _ holds
its convention last. But with political conventions, being last is
not a bad thing. Candidates like to go last because attention is
focused on their campaign closer to the election, which this year
is Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   DID YOU KNOW?
</P>
<P>
   Conventions didn't come along until the 1830s. Until then,
members of Congress would get together to choose a presidential
nominee for their parties.
</P>
<P>
   CONVENTIONAL WISDOM
</P>
<P>
   Nominating a presidential candidate was once the major goal of
political conventions, says University of Georgia political science
professor Charles Bullock. Delegates to the convention would gather
and cast their votes for the candidate they wanted to appear on the
ballot in November.
</P>
<P>
   The process was often heated and full of suspense, Bullock says.
If a candidate failed to win a majority of votes, delegates would
be asked to vote again ... and again ... until someone won. Some
candidates would drop out between the ballots, or deals would be
cut to change delegates' votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite common to go through several ballots,'' Bullock
said. ``If a convention deadlocked, they might often adjourn. Party
leaders would retreat to smoke-filled rooms to work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   DID YOU KNOW
</P>
<P>
   In 1924, it took 102 ballots before Democrat John W. Davis
finally received the nomination at the convention. He lost to
Republican Calvin Coolidge in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   MODERN-DAY CONVENTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Nominating a presidential candidate is still part of today's
conventions, but the drama is long-gone. Before 1972, most
delegates were hand-picked by their states' governors, mayors or
other big leaders. They weren't bound to support any candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when you vote for a candidate in the primaries or
caucuses, you're actually voting to send delegates to the
convention who will support your choice. Presidential wannabes
often lock in enough delegates to win the nomination months before
the conventions. Both Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W.
Bush secured their nominations in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   So, why hold conventions at all?
</P>
<P>
   ``If conventions have a function today, it's to mobilize the
troops ... the committed,'' Bullock said. ``They rub shoulders with
their party leaders and see their nominees speak. That energizes
them to go home and campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also what's called the post-convention ``bump,'' which
is a temporary boost in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't watch the conventions, but they do see the
news,'' Bullock said. ``And that's dominated by mostly positive
news from the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short run, voters are attracted to the party holding
the convention because of that media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU SHOULD LOOK FOR . . .
</P>
<P>
   The four-day conventions are about more than just nominating a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, committees will meet to draft each party's
official ``platform,'' or statement of beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Each night, party leaders and big names will give rousing,
televised speeches.
</P>
<P>
   After the nominee is officially selected, he will go on
television, formally introduce the person he has chosen to run as
his vice president and make a big speech. The speech usually
focuses on his campaign themes and is designed to rally the party
faithful. If you choose just one night to watch the conventions,
then Thursday would be the night, Bullock says.
</P>
<P>
   CNN, C-Span, MSNBC and Fox News will offer extended coverage.
Check the daily TV listings for times of events.

 &HT;    Can't live without 'em
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some people are in love with their pets. Others spend
hours lovingly attending to their cars or boats. And then there are
those special people who are deeply attached to technology.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a Palm Pilot or the latest in paging or e-mail
gadgets, these Internet executives, come heaven or high water,
won't leave home without them.
</P>
<P>
   Erika Jolly, EarthLink's vice president of portal product
management, doesn't go anywhere without her PalmV hand-held
personal digital assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I got hooked on my Palm is because I am on the road
so much, and I can see my schedule at a quick glance,'' she says.
``I'm always on my phone if I'm not in meetings, and I can get my
contacts whether they are advertisers, content partners or members
of my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolly commutes between EarthLink's offices in Atlanta and
Pasadena, Calif., at least every other week. The Palm helps her
keep track of where she's going and what she's doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many features on the Palm that are so cool, like
the MapQuest feature, which lets you download maps,'' she says.
``It's so much better than having a pile of paper to drag around
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolly uses the PalmV. ``It's the latest one,'' she says, ``and
it's got all the mega-stuff. I did try the PalmVII, and I went back
to the PalmV. The VII was too big, and it didn't fit into the
pocket of my Tumi backpack real well.''
</P>
<P>
   (Jolly bought the Tumi backpack because it had a special
compartment to hold her Palm Pilot. ``It's so cool,'' she says.)
</P>
<P>
   However, Jolly says her love affair with the Palm may soon be at
an end.
</P>
<P>
   She just bought a new silver Motorola Timeport cellular phone
from Sprint PCS. (Sprint PCS has a relationship with EarthLink.)
</P>
<P>
   She's waiting for a clip-on mobile organizer add-on for her cell
phone that her boss got her hooked on. ``The basic idea is it fits
right on the back of your phone. It has a touch-screen user
interface, so you can scroll through your address book, find the
person you want to call, then your phone calls that person. It's
got an address book, a calendar and a to-do list,'' she says. ``How
cool is that? I ask you, how cool is that? I just have to have
it.''
</P>
<P>
   INSTANT COMMUNICATION
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lanzone, co-founder and marketing vice president of eTour
(www.etour.com) doesn't go anywhere without his Blackberry Rim.
</P>
<P>
   a reason to carry that big thing around with me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As much fun as the Blackberry can be, it's also a useful tool
for staying in touch with co-workers strewn around town and around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Lanzone estimates he gets between 200 and 300 e-mails a day.
With his heavy travel schedule, having the Blackberry with him
means he can respond to important messages without having to lug
his laptop computer around and wait until he had someplace to plug
in to check messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to talk to me, or they have to show me a document
right away,'' he says, ``And I can get all of that, and I can get
it real time. When I'm not at my desk, it's the easiest way to
reach me. It's one of the essential tools.'' He uses it regularly
to communicate instantly with his ad agency, public relations firm
and radio media buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also has curbed my cell phone use drastically. I used to
have by far the highest cell phone bills in the company. It was
almost absurd. Now it's about a quarter of what I used to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanzone's wife, Shannon, is also learning to live with her
husband's passion for his Blackberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife loves it and she hates it,'' he says, laughing. ``My
dad named this thing the bumble, because it buzzes when it goes
off. Everyone loves to tease me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanzone says another great feature of the Blackberry is that you
can be a computer geek without anyone ever knowing. ``I wear it in
the office. But when I step out into the real world, I put it in my
pocket so I won't be laughed at in the street by small children.''
</P>
<P>
   PAGES, PAGES EVERYWHERE
</P>
<P>
   The halls of BellSouth are unusually quiet, but it's not because
the people are unfriendly. In the halls, the offices and even in
the elevator, nearly everyone is in his or her own private world,
busily typing away on BellSouth Interactive pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Yeatts, vice president of Internet portal services for
BellSouth.net, was one of the first to have his own pager. When he
got it, he was working in another department and used it to stay in
touch with his very busy boss. ``We'd see each other in person
about once a month, and this was a great way to stay in touch.''
</P>
<P>
   The BellSouth pager can do a variety of things. Each user has a
specific pager Internet address, so it's also possible to use a PC
to send e-mail directly to the pager. Pager users can also send
e-mail to other pager owners and other computers, or even send a
message that can be delivered by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cool thing about this is that it's always on,'' Yeatts
says. ``You get immediate feedback. You know when the message is
sent. You know when it's been read. With our BellSouth crowd, the
only reason somebody didn't get the message is if their battery
died or they are on an airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   The always-on pager also came in handy during a big meeting with
corporate officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a new person in the meeting, and someb' '' Yeatts
says his wife also uses the PC to send e-mail that appears almost
instantly on his pager.
</P>
<P>
   However, Yeatts knows even the silent act of sending an e-mail
under a restaurant table can be a little annoying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that a lot of people are irritated by this stuff.
... It's a subtler version of the cell phone problem. You try not
to answer the page when someone is in the middle of a very
interesting conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeatts says he has macros set on his pager that let the sender
know he's busy and he'll get back to them later. If something is
urgent, he tells them to send it again and mark it urgent and he
will read it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about it is you can always stay connected,''
he says. ``It's about real-time, wireless communication.''

 &HT;    Computer ideas for ending kids' late-summer boredom
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the heat becomes unbearable, the kids come inside
to play. If boredom sets in and your imagination thins to
suggesting soap operas to the little ones, turn instead to the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of new programs and Web sites that offer fun
stuff for kids to do, with a little education thrown in to boot.
</P>
<P>
   If the youngsters are between 3 and 8, take a look at
``Putt-Putt Joins the Circus,'' a delightful romp for both the
Windows and Macintosh platforms.
</P>
<P>
   It's from Humongous Entertainment, which has put out a number of
terrific programs for younger children.
</P>
<P>
   Putt-Putt is an animated purple car who, accompanied by his dog,
Pep, solves memory and logic puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth adventure for Putt-Putt, who first appeared in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest outing, Putt-Putt arrives at the circus only to
discover that there's trouble with the five main acts.
</P>
<P>
   Phillipe the Flea doesn't like his quarters, and Honko the Clown
speaks only in Honkish. Then there are the Flying Porkowskies,
who'll perform without a safety net only when pigs fly, Ivan the
Semi-Strong Man and Reginald the Lion.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Putt-Putt meets other characters and helps them
solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
   The suggested retail price for ``Putt-Putt Joins the Circus'' is
$24.99.
</P>
<P>
   Humongous is within a select circle of children's software
publishers that create enduring animated characters.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has introduced Freddi Fish, Pajama Sam and SPY
Fox into kids' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Humongous products are widely available at retail, on the Web
(www.humongous.com) and by calling 1-800-499-8363.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site also offers activities for children, as well as
tips and tricks. For older kids, log on to Mirriam-Webster's Web
site for kids at www.wordcentral.com to find out what a
``clickaholic'' is. You may be one.
</P>
<P>
   What's a clickaholic?
</P>
<P>
   Why, an enticon, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Created by young wordsmiths, these words are some of the entries
in the ``Build Your Own Dictionary'' section of the site.
</P>
<P>
   Clickaholic means ``someone who is on the computer constantly,
or someone who clicks the mouse constantly,'' while enticon
appropriately means ``a fabricated word.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind ``Build Your Own Dictionary'' is for children to
e-mail their creations to their friends and become excited about
words, says Merriam-Webster publicist Arthur J. Bicknell.
</P>
<P>
   Set up like a school, the Web site takes the user through a
hallway of options, from a science lab where kids can conduct word
experiments to a teacher's lounge where users can learn how a word
gets into the dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a daily buzzword so kids can astound relatives with
unusual words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word Central gets 5 million hits a month, and it's growing,''
Bicknell said.
</P>
<P>
   The site won a Parents' Choice Award from the Parents'
Foundation and a 2000 Webby award for the best educational Web site
from the International Academ allows buyers of the game to play it
together with family and friends on the living room TV screen
rather than huddled in front of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   You can now play this $39.95 game in the group environment, like
non-video games such as ``Pictionary'' and ``Trivial Pursuit.''
Divide into the teams and put the PlayStation control in the hands
of your smartest teammate.
</P>
<P>
   A virtual Regis Philbin is your host, complete with his charming
wit and sometimes bratty attitude. The two-player game starts off
with the ``fastest finger'' mode, in which you have to put four
items in chronological order quicker than your opponent to earn the
right to play for money.
</P>
<P>
   The questions in the ``fastest finger'' round can sometimes be
ridiculously hard, forcing both teams to guess repeatedly. It can
test Philbin's temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we have a bunch of Mensa candidates in there,''
Philbin says sarcastically. ``I guess you know I'm just kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Another stinger from Philbin: ``Hey, hey _ what's the IQ in this
room? I'm getting concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   If both teams fail every attempt, then the game starts over. But
not without some final words from our host.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, guys, how many times can we do this?'' Philbin says.
``You are pathetic. The game is over. I'm getting out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you're in the money seat, ``Millionaire'' becomes much more
enjoyable. Just like on TV, you have access to three lifelines:
phone a friend, ask the audience and 50/50.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing in the PlayStation game is more impressive than
the phone-a-friend option. It is an available option for each of
the 600 questions. Choose the phone alternative, and you have
access to one of the virtual game show host's wacky friends,
ranging from a snooty doctor to a person with ESP who leaves advice
on the greetings of his answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   With a limited number of questions, you will start seeing
repeats as early as the 10th time you play. But it doesn't
necessarily make it much easier.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: 2nd Edition,'' the $100
question can be just as challenging as the one for $8,000. Or they
can be exactly the same, just 15 to 20 games apart.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the assistance of friends, it is tough to make it to
the $64,000 mark. If you are able to win $1 million, then you are
either very intelligent or have a superb photographic memory. Just
remember, it's only a virtual $1 million.

 &HT;    Photo e-mail isn't difficult
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Can you tell me how to e-mail a photo? I can get the photo on my
monitor, but the recipient can't call it up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tom Sholtis, Jupiter, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You scanned the photo onto your hard drive. Half the battle
is won. Check some things before sending. First is file type. Some
photo file types include JPEG, TIFF, and EPSF. We suggest JPEG,
which compresses your photo.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Next is file size. Make sure it isn't huge. Some e-mail
systems don't accept large files (depends on the ISP), or your
e-mail system may strip a large file as it leaves the mail server.
It's best to use a compression program before sending. PC users can
use PKWare's PKZip or WinZip. For Mac users, DropStuff. Find the
shareware programs at www.zdnet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Once you check file type and file size, you're ready to
send. Start an e-mail message. Pop in the recipient's address.
Depending on your e-mail program, you should have an attachment
button on the message interface. If not, look for the word
``Attach'' under one of the pull-down menus. A window will pop up
asking where the item is you want to attach. Navigate to your photo
and double-click. The photo attaches to the e-mail. Write a message
and click Send.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I plan to buy a Zip drive. I can't decide if I should buy an
external or internal model. Help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ronald Harrison, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You obviously need more storage space, a backup strategy
or a way to transfer data. Maybe all three. Ask the question, ``Is
portability important?''
</P>
<P>
   Sue: If it is, an external Zip storage drive is attractive
because it's easy to tote around, slick and easy to install.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Zip drives are popular, and they've been around.
Compatibility won't be an issue. You shouldn't have trouble
swapping disks for work or play.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Find out how your computer would interface with an external
storage drive. Like everything now, drives come in all flavors.
Interface terms such as USB, SCSI and parallel port may sound like
a string of Greek, but they are important. A tool called zip
configurator at www.iomega.com/zip/configurator/index.html can help
you match your computer with a compatible drive.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Also, think about what and how much you'll be storing.
Are you interested in a 100-MB drive? A 250-MB drive?
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Costs for external Zip drives range from $87 to $135 at
CNet Shopper (shopper.cnet.com/).
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If drive portability isn't an issue, then an internal Zip
may fit the bill. At www.dealtime.com you'll see internal Zip
drives for $85 to $180. If you're not a do-it-your-selfer, plan on
an installation fee.

 &HT;    Daring vacationer enjoys initial experience with Webvan
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I'm on vacation this week. As a high-profile sort of a
guy, my vacations are probably different from yours. It goes with
the territory of being a public figure and living in the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   This year for vacation I bought some tires for my 1991 Nissan.
But I didn't stop there. I also tried something new. After all,
vacations are the time to step outside the usual.
</P>
<P>
   So I tried Webvan. I used the online service that lets you order
groceries over the Web and then have them delivered to your door.
</P>
<P>
   I'll pause for a second and let your thumping heart get its
rhythm back and then tell you what that was like.
</P>
<P>
   My friends and co-workers will tell you that I am not wildly
experimental (I still find ATMs slightly frightening, but I believe
they will catch on) and _ maybe because I've worked for newspapers
for many years _ I can be a little cynical.
</P>
<P>
   So despite all the glowing press reports about the service and
even the praise I'd heard from some friends, I did not go into this
with a glad heart.
</P>
<P>
   But I was determined to try it, so I logged on at www.webvan
.com to set up an account. It was actually pretty easy, but I
figured that the real test would be in the ordering.
</P>
<P>
   The whole notion of Webvan makes me dizzy. Here you have a
company that sells groceries for about the same price as you'd pay
at the store, throws in free delivery and also gives you (for now
at least) $15 off on your first order.
</P>
<P>
   It either has to be run by the tooth fairy or a bunch of guys
with black shirts and white ties. So I was looking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, I didn't find any. Ordering was fairly easy, and I'm
pretty sure it will get easier in the future now that I understand
more about how it works. You use a series of menus to find your
items. The menus start with broad categories. For instance, there's
one called produce, another for meat and seafood, still another for
prepared food _ and they get progressively more specific. For
instance, if you click on the meat and seafood category, you get
new categories that include beef, ham, pork, etc. Click on those
subcategories, and things get even more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, as is my habit, I'd get confused and search for an
item in the wrong category. (Hey, I'm a guy.) That's when the
search feature came in handy. You can type in a specific product _
say garlic _ and find it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Once you find your item, you simply indicate how many of the
item you want and continue shopping. I finished ordering $100 worth
of groceries in about 10 minutes. Then I proceeded to check out.
Unlike at the regular grocery, I did not have to stand in line and
wait while the cashier told the customer ahead of me about the
first three decades of her life. Instead, you give a credit card
number and select a delivery time.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike scheduling the time for the cable guy to come to your
house, these are scheduled in 30-minute increments and _ both in my
experience and that of my friends _ that's when the Webvan folks
actually show up.
</P>
<P>
   My groceries arrived right on time the next day. The vegetables
and fruit looked like they should be on the cover of a food
catalog. The steaks were terrific. And it all _ including the
20-pound bag of cat litter _ was carried right into my kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't technology grand?
</P>
<P>
   What a terrific vacation. Maybe next year I'll do something
really wild and get the carpets steam-cleaned.

TV HOPES FOR UNCONVENTIONAL CONVENTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1996, Ted Koppel stalked out of the Republican National
Convention in San Diego, declaring that ``nothing surprising has
happened. Nothing surprising is anticipated.'' Since then, nothing
has happened to alter the perception that the carefully scripted
modern political convention has lost its value as a television
draw.
</P>
<P>
   A new Pew Research Center survey reveals that only 13 percent of
the nation plans to watch a large chunk of the convention coverage.
And broadcast news is passing the story on to its cable cousins,
turning what was once ``a public service (into) just another
programming choice for the demographic that's interested in it,''
said a TV historian, Robert Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the tumultuous 1968 Democratic convention that glued
him to the TV as a college student, MSNBC ``Hardball'' host Chris
Matthews says such events provided ``a real sense of the
zeitgeist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those days are probably gone,'' he adds somberly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with the diminished expectations for any
ready-for-prime-time news bombshells, many analysts think
conventions get a bad rap. From the dominant themes to the
subliminal squabbles, they say, conventions provide viewers with a
crash course in political science and often play a big role in
determining the outcome of the race.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC anchor Brian Williams says that despite their best efforts
at stage-managing conventions, ``both parties have a chance to
screw this up mightily.'' And even if there is no 2000 version of
Pat Buchanan's ideological hijacking of the 1992 GOP convention, he
notes that up to a quarter of the voters make up their minds on a
president during this period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to viewers, `Ignore this at your informational peril,'
'' Williams said. If that doesn't have the resonant ring of ``Must
See TV,'' it does have the ring of truth.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News political director Mark Halperin, who said, ``We are
not scaling back our coverage one moment from the two previous
cycles,'' says the conventions are especially telling in this
year's unusual campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the declining interest in politics, the Olympics, and
the World Series, and a pair of major party nominees who aren't all
that compelling, of course the big events are going to matter
more,'' he said. ``For the vast majority of the country, this is
the only time other than the debates,'' to really focus on George
Bush and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News executive producer and special events director Al Ortiz
says conventions try to set a tone and a mood that will carry
through Election Day. ``The most important thing you'll be able to
discern very quickly is the message and strategy for the campaign,'
he said. The Republicans are ``going to come out of the box as a
middle of the road, broad spectrum, big tent operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Such convention images are paramount, adds CNN senior political
analyst William Schneider. After eight years of White House exile,
Republicans want to model themselves after the 1992 Democratic
confab when ``Clinton successfully created the impression that this
was a new Democratic Party. They had shed the baggage of the past _
Mondale and Dukakis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The metaphor they want to use is conservatism with a happy
face,'' Schneider continues. ``We're not monsters . . . There ain't
gonna be any angry white men. No Newts. No Pats.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of observers believe that conventions are newsworthy
simply because the key speeches can make or break a candidate.
Analyst Andrew Tyndall said, ``Oratory is always the thing that at
the end of the day has saved the event.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's 1988 ``Read my lips. No new taxes,'' speech ``won him
that election, but lost him the next,'' said Tyndall, adding
Buchanan's divisive prime-time 1992 culture war speech to the list
of pivotal moments.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the months-long media coverage on the younger Bush _ an
effort that has failed to galvanize widespread public interest in
the campaign _ the convention speech Thursday will mark his formal
introduction to much of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all seen him in blue jeans being a good old boy,'' Ortiz
said. ``I think there'll be a great deal of interest in George
Bush's acceptance speech.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is a very unfamiliar quantity to Americans,'' echoes
Schneider. ``This is his only chance to make a first impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider also illustrates how the television screen may convey
a much different portrait of a candidate to viewers than the one
painted by the media pundits. The 1988 Republican convention, with
the press preoccupied with the shortcomings of vice presidential
nominee Dan Quayle, ``was the most misreported event in (political)
history,'' he said. Bush's willingness to defend Quayle, and a
tough speech in which he buried the ``wimp'' factor, ``turned his
whole campaign around,'' and connected with voters even as the
media missed the story.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating conventions in which the parties will strive to
stifle conflict and project unity, TV journalists are preparing to
focus on the subtler undercurrents. Or as Ortiz puts it, to spend
time ``talking about why you're seeing what you're seeing and what
you're not seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being shown, if you will, a very dramatic press
release,'' said an MSNBC executive producer, Steve Capus. ``It's
all scripted and it's all controlled. But you've got to read the
tea leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, those tea leaves will likely reveal a careful
balancing act between Bush's brand of compassionate conservatism
and an appeal to the party's more ideological activists. And that
may make for good television.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the threshold obvious question as to how well each
party will showcase itself,'' said Fox News anchor Brit Hume. ``As
long as they're attractive and reasonable in their presentation of
themselves, conservative policies work. They have a story to tell
and they don't have to hide from their agenda. (But) there are some
things about the conduct of other Republicans and Republicans in
Congress that people don't like. And they have to mute that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are pitching their message to a general public and
putting a veneer on it,'' said Craig Crawford, editor-in-chief of
the Hotline political newsletter. ``But these conventions are also
about preaching to the choir and energizing the base. I believe you
get a more honest view of what they'll really do in office than you
will in a TV ad.''
</P>
<P>
   An unabashed convention fan, Crawford is aware of declining
viewer interest. But he said that ``if people sat down and watched
these things as much as they watched `Frazier,' the networks would
be all over them.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thompson said a wider audience is possible, given that
traditional convention coverage has ``totally missed . . . its
potential entertainment value.''
</P>
<P>
   In a period of political scandal and intrigue, Thompson favors
what he calls ``the `West Wing'-ing of convention coverage,''
trying scrutiny that dramatizes the main convention players by
delving into their lives and backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   That view might seem a bit extreme. But MSNBC's Williams vividly
remembers the moment during the 1996 Democratic convention when
someone first brandished a copy of the Star tabloid detailing the
relationship with a prostitute that forced the resignation of
Clinton aide Dick Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any story can break at any time,'' Williams said. ``There are
journalists holding their stories'' for just the right moment, he
adds. ``Don't kid yourself.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: My astronomy class would like to know why a spring tide is
called that. Could you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Gina Crouchet
</P>
<P>
   A: These tides rise or ``spring'' up, hence the name. Spring
tides have nothing to do with the spring season. Spring tides,
which are higher than other tides, occur during the new and the
full moons. The moon's and the sun's gravities combine to pull sea
water along the same line, reports Brad Armosky, science educator
at the McDonald Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Neap tides, on the other hand, are those in which the water
rises and falls the least. These tides occur near the first and
last quarter phases of the moon when the Earth, moon and sun form a
triangle. Q: I am looking for a clothes steamer like the ones
clothing stores have. I do not want a hand-held one. I want the
kind that has the water tank on the floor with the hose and nozzle
attached.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gayle F. Young
</P>
<P>
   A: Jiffy Steamers are sold in several catalogs, or pick up one
from the Jiffy Steam company at (800) J2-JIFFY. Steamers are made
in three sizes: travel (hand-held), residential and commercial. The
residential model ($189) works for everything _ drapes to suits. It
even temporarily turns off if it runs out of water. Not an
attractive item, but it does the job. Worth the investment _ about
the price of several steam irons. Q: I have several POW bracelets
that were popular during the Vietnam War. How can I find out if the
people whose names are on the bracelets made it back home or died
in captivity, and how they are doing now?
</P>
<P>
   _Teresa Brawner
</P>
<P>
   A: The National League of Families of American Prisoners and
Missing in Southeast Asia at (202) 223-6846 can help you with the
names on your bracelets. As of June 29, the number of Americans
still missing and unaccounted for from the Vietnam War is 2,014.
This nonprofit maintains lists of all those unaccounted for in
Southeast Asia as well as the latest statistics provided by the
Department of Defense POW/MIA office Q: I recently heard about a
Web site where you could receive a free credit report,
www.freecreditreport.com. I understand the requirement for personal
information such as full name, address, and Social Security number.
However, when they ask for a credit card number I exited the Web
site. Why would they need a credit card number?
</P>
<P>
   It makes me wonder if this is a legitimate Web site or another
scam?
</P>
<P>
   _ Gary L. Robinson Sr.
</P>
<P>
   A: Legit. The credit card number is information used to
authenticate that the person requesting the report is the same as
the subject of the report, says Laurie Edwards of iPlace, site
sponsor. On this site, the card number is also used to pay for a
credit monitoring service (30 days free, then a charge). Not really
``free'' if it is tied to receiving this service. Using a credit
card also allows you to cancel the service or challenge the charge
if the card is used improperly. A no-strings-attached site such as
iPlace.com, a site delivering everything from credit reports to
neighborhood information in exchange for your profile, asks for a
credit card number as identification also. Want to bypass all this?
Pay $8 to a credit reporting company and skip the ``free'' offers.
Q: Do you know the address for Deborah Yates, who was nominated for
a Tony Award for the musical ``Contact''? I went to high school
with her here in Austin, but had lost touch until I saw her on the
Tony Awards._ Susan Lewis
</P>
<P>
   A: The Southern Methodist University student landed a job as a
Rockette when she moved to New York in 1994. ``Contact'' was her
breakthrough role. Send your lauds to her in care of Peter
Sherwood, Sames &AMP; Rollnick Associates, 250 W. 57th St., Room 703,
New York, NY 10107.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our son is 17 and is interested in joining the Marines once
he graduates. He has taken Ritalin for Attention Deficit Disorder
on and off for the last 10 years. He only takes it sporadically
recently. His has always been a mild to moderate case. I hear that
the Marines will not accept anyone who has ever taken Ritalin.
Could you please find out?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.G.

   A: What you heard is correct. Generally, having taken Ritalin
would keep a candidate from qualifying for the Marines. However,
Marine spokesman Patrick Gibbons notes this road block is waivable.
Your son's use of Ritalin will be reviewed by the Bureau of
Medicine. It's worth a try if he is serious about serving in the
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have just returned from a trip to San Miguel, where we
bought Talavara pottery. We were told by several vendors that it
would be safe to use the plates and bowls that are not lead-free as
long as they were not heated in the oven or microwave. Can you
confirm the safety of using the pottery?
</P>
<P>
   _ Kay T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Not exactly. Pick up a lead test kit at area hardware stores
which will tell you if there is lead in the glaze (not the amount
of lead, just its existence). The Poison Control Center notes heat
(and acidic foods) exacerbate the problem, but lead can leach from
pottery glaze whether it is heated or not. Want to be safe? Use the
pieces for decoration only. Remember, children are more at risk.
For more information, call the center at (800) 764-7661.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If each couple is allowed two children only, the population
on Earth will stay the same or decrease. My husband thinks it will
grow. I think I am right, and my husband thinks he is right. Can
you settle this?
</P>
<P>
   _ Kyoung Chung
</P>
<P>
   A: No, but statistician and demographer Thomas Pullum from the
University of Texas can. Replacement fertility rate would have to
be slightly more than two children in the United States (2.1 to be
exact). The excess (.1) is needed to compensate for mortality.
Pullum reports the worldwide fertility rate is 2.9 per couple, so
the world population is increasing about 1.8 percent per year.
``Even if the average number of births dropped to replacement level
immediately, world population would continue to grow for several
decades,'' concludes Pullum. The population boom means many couples
are in prime child bearing ages, so replacement fertility would
result in more births than deaths. Given this population momentum,
even if fertility dropped to 2.1 immediately, by 2025 the world
wcontainers with the 1 or 2 recycle marking, but I'm curious what
the other numbers mean. Some are stamped with a 5, for example.
Also, I noticed on a bottle of Kiss My Face lotion marked with a 2
symbol the statement ``do not recycle this container.'' What's that
all about?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jim Noel A: Approximately 80 percent of recycled plastic
bottles are marked No. 1 or No. 2 (such as milk jugs). Plastic
bottles marked No. 3 (polyvinyl chloride), 4 (low density
polyethylene) and No. 5 (polypropylene) are locally nonrecyclable.
For more details, contact Ecology Action's executive director,
Michael Risden, at 322-0000 or visit ecology-action.org. The Kiss
My Face lotion bottle should state ``do recycle this bottle,''
according to spokeswoman Donna Myer. Perhaps you misread it.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: My astronomy class would like to know why a spring tide is
called that. Could you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Gina Crouchet
</P>
<P>
   A: These tides rise or ``spring'' up, hence the name. Spring
tides have nothing to do with the spring season. Spring tides,
which are higher than other tides, occur during the new and the
full moons. The moon's and the sun's gravities combine to pull sea
water along the same line, reports Brad Armosky, science educator
at the McDonald Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Neap tides, on the other hand, are those in which the water
rises and falls the least. These tides occur near the first and
last quarter phases of the moon when the Earth, moon and sun form a
triangle. Q: I am looking for a clothes steamer like the ones
clothing stores have. I do not want a hand-held one. I want the
kind that has the water tank on the floor with the hose and nozzle
attached.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gayle F. Young
</P>
<P>
   A: Jiffy Steamers are sold in several catalogs, or pick up one
from the Jiffy Steam company at (800) J2-JIFFY. Steamers are made
in three sizes: travel (hand-held), residential and commercial. The
residential model ($189) works for everything _ drapes to suits. It
even temporarily turns off if it runs out of water. Not an
attractive item, but it does the job. Worth the investment _ about
the price of several steam irons. Q: I have several POW bracelets
that were popular during the Vietnam War. How can I find out if the
people whose names are on the bracelets made it back home or died
in captivity, and how they are doing now?
</P>
<P>
   _Teresa Brawner
</P>
<P>
   A: The National League of Families of American Prisoners and
Missing in Southeast Asia at (202) 223-6846 can help you with the
names on your bracelets. As of June 29, the number of Americans
still missing and unaccounted for from the Vietnam War is 2,014.
This nonprofit maintains lists of all those unaccounted for in
Southeast Asia as well as the latest statistics provided by the
Department of Defense POW/MIA office Q: I recently heard about a
Web site where you could receive a free credit report,
www.freecreditreport.com. I understand the requirement for personal
information such as full name, address, and Social Security number.
However, when they ask for a credit card number I exited the Web
site. Why would they need a credit card number?
</P>
<P>
   It makes me wonder if this is a legitimate Web site or another
scam?
</P>
<P>
   _ Gary L. Robinson Sr.
</P>
<P>
   A: Legit. The credit card number is information used to
authenticate that the person requesting the report is the same as
the subject of the report, says Laurie Edwards of iPlace, site
sponsor. On this site, the card number is also used to pay for a
credit monitorel the service or challenge the charge if the card is
used improperly. A no-strings-attached site such as iPlace.com, a
site delivering everything from credit reports to neighborhood
information in exchange for your profile, asks for a credit card
number as identification also. Want to bypass all this? Pay $8 to a
credit reporting company and skip the ``free'' offers. Q: Do you
know the address for Deborah Yates, who was nominated for a Tony
Award for the musical ``Contact''? I went to high school with her
here in Austin, but had lost touch until I saw her on the Tony
Awards._ Susan Lewis
</P>
<P>
   A: The Southern Methodist University student landed a job as a
Rockette when she moved to New York in 1994. ``Contact'' was her
breakthrough role. Send your lauds to her in care of Peter
Sherwood, Sames &AMP; Rollnick Associates, 250 W. 57th St., Room 703,
New York, NY 10107.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our son is 17 and is interested in joining the Marines once
he graduates. He has taken Ritalin for Attention Deficit Disorder
on and off for the last 10 years. He only takes it sporadically
recently. His has always been a mild to moderate case. I hear that
the Marines will not accept anyone who has ever taken Ritalin.
Could you please find out?

 By THE EDITORS OF DISCOVER MAGAZINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 FEARS FOR EARS  
 &HT;    American farmers have planted 20 million acres of genetically
modified corn, engineered to repel predatory insects without using
noxious chemicals.
 &HT;    If farmers are not careful, a new report warns, the scheme could
backfire and breed even more troublesome strains of pests.
 &HT;    The modified crops pump out Bt toxin, a natural insecticide
created by bacteria. Some insects, in turn, carry genes that
protect them from the toxin. To check the spread of those genes,
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires that farmers
intersperse fields of genetically modified crops with islands of
non-modified plants.
 &HT;    The idea is that insects in the refuges would remain vulnerable
to Bt toxin, and the bugs would interbreed to keep the whole
population susceptible.
 &HT;    For the first time, scientists have proof the tactic works.
Entomologist Anthony Shelton of Cornell University and his
colleagues sowed fields of altered broccoli and then unleashed
broccoli-eating diamondback moths.
 &HT;    In fields containing refuges of non-modified plants, resistance
genes were less likely to be spread through the moth population.
 &HT;    But there is a big caveat. Spraying the refuges with pesticides
_ a common practice among farmers, and one permitted by EPA
regulations _ sped the appearance of toxin-resistant moths.
 &HT;    ``Any time you spray insects on a plant, you are never going to
get 100 percent mortality,'' Shelton says. ``You end up putting a
mosaic of doses on the plants-some high, and some low. Where the
doses are low, you won't kill all the insects, and those that
survive will be more likely to develop resistance.''
 &HT;    
 STAR TREK SYRINGE  
 &HT;    The doctors keep saying it won't hurt a bit, and it keeps
hurting. There's got to be a better way to get drugs into the body
than a brutal needle and syringe.
 &HT;    Chemist Terry Burkoth and his collaborators at PowderJect
Pharmaceuticals in Oxford, England, agree. They have replaced the
needle with a flashlight-size tube that uses a jet of helium to
accelerate powdered drugs to supersonic speeds.
 &HT;    Just press it against the skin, and the PowderJect system shoots
a dose directly into the underlying cells. The drug particles are
so small that the patient hardly feels a thing.
 &HT;    And the supersonic shot could make it easier for doctors to
deliver precise dosages of drugs to hard-to-reach regions just
below the skin's upper layer.
 &HT;    
 PICTURE-PERFECT PLASTIC  
 &HT;    Because of a rogue speck of dust floating around Stephen Chou's
lab at Princeton University, your next computer monitor may display
a much sharper image.
 &HT;    An electrical engineer, Chou was working on a better way to
configure polymer plastics used to make light-emitting diodes, or
LEDs, and other electronics.

beautiful, highly regular microscopic pillars had sprung up where
the mask did not lie flush on the surface.

of LED video displays, which have better resolution than
cathode-ray tubes but are expensive to build.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    On desolate mountaintops in Hawaii, Arizona and Chile, a group
of billion-dollar super-telescopes is about to expand the
boundaries of what we can see in space.
 &HT;    The language used to express these accomplishments may seem like
hieroglyphics. How many people will understand the technical
meanings of ``magnitude'' and ``arc second''?
 &HT;    But what really matters is that we'll be able to spot fainter
stars and galaxies, and they'll appear sharper than ever before.
 &HT;    Despite the boasts of ``500-power'' used by manufacturers of
cheap toy-store telescopes, the truest measure of an instrument's
worth is the diameter of its main lens or mirror, not its
magnifying power.
 &HT;    The Hale Telescope on Mount Palomar, which was the world's
largest for half a century, has a mirror 200 inches, or 5 meters,
across.
 &HT;    The just-completed Japanese Subaru Telescope is 8.2 meters
across, the twin Kecks are 10 meters each, the two Gemini 'scopes
are 8.1 meters, the upcoming Large Binocular Telescope sports dual
8.4-meter mirrors, and the European Very Large Telescope will be an
amazing 16.4 meters when completed in 2003.
 &HT;    The amount of light a telescope collects depends on the surface
area of its main lens or mirror. Each Keck mirror, twice as wide as
the one on Mount Palomar, can detect objects four times as faint.
 &HT;    Astronomers quantify the brightness of celestial objects with a
confusing term: magnitude. Higher numbers indicate fainter things;
each magnitude is about 2.5 times dimmer than the one before, so an
increase of five magnitudes denotes a hundredfold brightness drop.
 &HT;    White Vega and orange Arcturus, the bright stars now high in the
sky, are zero magnitude. The human eye can barely pick out
sixth-magnitude stars, some 250 times fainter.
 &HT;    Amateurs' telescopes collect enough light to make out stars of
magnitude 14. Keck dips down to the 29th magnitude. Hubble's
smallish mirror _ 2.4 meters across _ can detect 30th-magnitude
objects because it orbits above Earth's blurry atmosphere, so it
can concentrate starlight more precisely.
 &HT;    Thirtieth-magnitude objects shed as much light as the glow of a
cigarette in Hawaii as seen from Boston. The Very Large Telescope
will do even better, despite being earthbound.
 &HT;    Bigger mirrors also produce sharper images. Here the standard
scientific measure is the arc second, an angle 1/3,600 of a degree.
The sun and moon appear just under 2,000 arc seconds across.
 &HT;    A good backyard telescope reveals Jupiter's moons as little
disks, a 1-arc-second resolution. Hubble can resolve features as
small as 1/20 arc second. That is equivalent to standing in
Brooklyn and distinguishing the two headlamps of a taxicab in
Paris.
 &HT;    Although the new telescopic giants must peer through layers of
turbulent air, novel de-smudging techniques should allow them to
surpass even Hubble in sharpness.
 &HT;    Declassified adaptive-optics technology will allow them to
compensate for atmospheric distortion using deformable mirrors
attached to motorized pistons.
 &HT;    The Kecks and the Very Large Telescope will eventually combine
light from several telescopes, improving their resolution to
once-unimaginable levels. They may get down below 1/1,000 arc
second, good enough to pick out those headlights on a taxi driving
across the moon, 235,000 miles away _ a feat as astonishing as what
the cab's meter would be reading.

STORAGE TECHNOLOGY SURPASSES ESTIMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, stock price does not reflect market close)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Storage Technology (STK:NYSE), which has wrestled with the loss
of several executives in recent months, returned to profitability
in the latest quarter and surpassed Wall Street's earnings
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of information storage devices said its second-quarter
profit reached $8.7 million, or 9 cents a share, before
restructuring charges, beating analysts' forecast of 5 cents a
share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisville, Colo.-based company attributed the results in
part to an improvement in gross margins and better control of
operating expenses. Storage Technology also predicted that revenue
will increase in the second half of this year as new products are
introduced, and the company's chief, Patrick J. Martin, said the
promising signs are ``only the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking into account the restructuring move, which cut the
company's work force by 1,250 jobs and led to a pretax charge in
the latest quarter of $12.4 million, the company reported earnings
of $651,000, or one penny a share. Those figures contrast with a
net loss of $38.5 million, or 38 cents a share, including one-time
charges, in the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue in the second quarter, however, fell 22 percent to $513
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my first three weeks as CEO, I have seen great technology,
dedicated people and solid customer relationships,'' Martin said in
a statement. ``However, it is clear we must make further progress
in our overall execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Storage Technology named Martin, a former Xerox executive, its
new chairman, president and chief executive earlier this month.
Martin replaced David E. Weiss, who had occupied those positions
for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss stepped down with the company's chief operating officer,
Victor Perez, after the company warned in February that it would
post a fourth-quarter 1999 loss. The company had struggled through
a string of lackluster quarters and lost an alliance with IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Storage Technology rose 1 7/16, or 14 percent, to 11
9/16 in morning trading.

TIME WARNER, JUNO IN INTERNET ACCESS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, prices do not reflect market close)  
 By TIM ARANGO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time Warner (TWX:NYSE) said Monday that it reached a deal to
allow Juno Online Services (JWEB:Nasdaq) to offer high-speed
Internet access over its cable network.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes as Time Warner faces pressure from regulators
scrutinizing its merger plans with America Online (AOL:NYSE) to
open its cable network to Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the first between New York-based Time Warner and an
ISP not affiliated with the media company. It will allow Juno to
offer Internet access and content to Time Warner Cable customers.
Juno will offer its existing dial-up customers in Time Warner
Cable's service area the ability to upgrade to Juno's high-speed
service, Juno Express.
</P>
<P>
   Juno and Time Warner will conduct a trial in Columbus, Ohio,
before announcing when the new service will be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juno is committed to being a leader in the area of high-speed
Internet access, and this relationship is a major step in our plan
to offer subscribers nationwide a wide range of options,'' said
Charles Ardai, Juno's president and chief executive officer, in a
statement. ``We believe this relationship with Time Warner will
allow us to offer an attractive new option for Juno subscribers who
are ready to make the move to broadband.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, both New York-based Juno and Time Warner
Cable will market Juno Express to their customers and are able to
price and package the service independently.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the first between a cable company and an Internet
service provider, cooperation made possible by the pending AOL-Time
Warner deal, said Frederick Moran, an analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co.
who covers both Time Warner and Juno. For the deal to meet
regulatory muster, it is widely acknowledged that Time Warner will
have to open its cable network to independent Internet service
providers. At a Federal Communications Commission hearing on
Thursday, regulators questioned AOL and Time Warner executives
about opening up their cable network to ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulators on the AOL-Time Warner deal will look at a number
of issues,'' Moran said. ``This is a step in the right direction of
promoting competition. It has to catch regulators' eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Glenn Britt, president of Time Warner Cable,
alluded to the competitive concerns of regulators. ``This
groundbreaking agreement underscores Time Warner Cable's commitment
to offer its cable customers a choice of Internet Service Providers
and will help expand the number of high-speed data subscribers on
our cable systems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to reaching agreements with other ISPs as
quickly as possible and to offering our customers a broadening
array of choices in how they experience the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran said Time Warner will likely re-examine the terms of its
Internet joint venture with AT&AMP;T (T:NYSE), called Road Runner.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is seen as a test case for cooperation between the two
industries -- cable and ISPs, he said. ``Historically, cable has
maintained exclusive access,'' he said. ``Now they've become much
more amenable to cooperation.'' Moran has a buy on Time Warner and
a hold on Juno, partly because of the difficulty Internet companies
have accessing capital in the current market climate. His firm has
acted as an underwriter for Juno.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner has over 12.6 million cable customers, with 11.5
million homes capable of receiving high-speed Internet service.
Juno has about 3 million active subscribers, making it the
third-largest Internet service provider, after AOL and EarthLink
(ELNK:Nasdaq).
</P>
<P>
   Juno stock soared on the news, up 1 15/16, or 24 percent, at 9
15/16 in morning trading. Time Warner shares were up 1 13/16, or 2
percent, to 77 3/16.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 FEARS FOR EARS  
 &HT;    American farmers have planted 20 million acres of genetically
modified corn, engineered to repel predatory insects without using
noxious chemicals.
 &HT;    If farmers are not careful, a new report warns, the scheme could
backfire and breed even more troublesome strains of pests.
 &HT;    The modified crops pump out Bt toxin, a natural insecticide
created by bacteria. Some insects, in turn, carry genes that
protect them from the toxin. To check the spread of those genes,
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires that farmers
intersperse fields of genetically modified crops with islands of
non-modified plants.
 &HT;    The idea is that insects in the refuges would remain vulnerable
to Bt toxin, and the bugs would interbreed to keep the whole
population susceptible.
 &HT;    For the first time, scientists have proof the tactic works.
Entomologist Anthony Shelton of Cornell University and his
colleagues sowed fields of altered broccoli and then unleashed
broccoli-eating diamondback moths.
 &HT;    In fields containing refuges of non-modified plants, resistance
genes were less likely to be spread through the moth population.
 &HT;    But there is a big caveat. Spraying the refuges with pesticides
_ a common practice among farmers, and one permitted by EPA
regulations _ sped the appearance of toxin-resistant moths.
 &HT;    ``Any time you spray insects on a plant, you are never going to
get 100 percent mortality,'' Shelton says. ``You end up putting a
mosaic of doses on the plants-some high, and some low. Where the
doses are low, you won't kill all the insects, and those that
survive will be more likely to develop resistance.''
 &HT;    
 STAR TREK SYRINGE  
 &HT;    The doctors keep saying it won't hurt a bit, and it keeps
hurting. There's got to be a better way to get drugs into the body
than a brutal needle and syringe.
 &HT;    Chemist Terry Burkoth and his collaborators at PowderJect
Pharmaceuticals in Oxford, England, agree. They have replaced the
needle with a flashlight-size tube that uses a jet of helium to
accelerate powdered drugs to supersonic speeds.
 &HT;    Just press it against the skin, and the PowderJect system shoots
a dose directly into the underlying cells. The drug particles are
so small that the patient hardly feels a thing.
 &HT;    And the supersonic shot could make it easier for doctors to
deliver precise dosages of drugs to hard-to-reach regions just
below the skin's upper layer.
 &HT;    
 PICTURE-PERFECT PLASTIC  
 &HT;    Because of a rogue speck of dust floating around Stephen Chou's
lab at Princeton University, your next computer monitor may display
a much sharper image.
 &HT;    An electrical engineer, Chou was working on a better way to
configure polymer plastics used to make light-emitting diodes, or
LEDs, and other electronics.
 &HT;    One of his graduate students pressed a mask into a layer of
plastic, preparing to transform the material into a pattern of
electrical circuits. By a fluke, bits of dust got behind the mask.
When Chou removed it, he was startled to see that an array of
beautiful, highly regular microscopic pillars had sprung up where
the mask did not lie flush on the surface.
 &HT;    Chou thinks his polymer pillars will simplify the manufacturing
of LED video displays, which have better resolution than
cathode-ray tubes but are expensive to build.
 &HT;    Color LED screens usually contain three different materials to
display the red, blue and green parts of the picture.
 &HT;    ``In the old technology, you had to fabricate each color
separately,'' Chou says. ``With this process, you can fabricate all
the colors at the same time, using the pillar height and size to
control the color.''
 &HT;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 FEARS FOR EARS  
 &HT;    American farmers have planted 20 million acres of genetically
modified corn, engineered to repel predatory insects without using
noxious chemicals.
 &HT;    If farmers are not careful, a new report warns, the scheme could
backfire and breed even more troublesome strains of pests.
 &HT;    The modified crops pump out Bt toxin, a natural insecticide
created by bacteria. Some insects, in turn, carry genes that
protect them from the toxin. To check the spread of those genes,
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires that farmers
intersperse fields of genetically modified crops with islands of
non-modified plants.
 &HT;    The idea is that insects in the refuges would remain vulnerable
to Bt toxin, and the bugs would interbreed to keep the whole
population susceptible.
 &HT;    For the first time, scientists have proof the tactic works.
Entomologist Anthony Shelton of Cornell University and his
colleagues sowed fields of altered broccoli and then unleashed
broccoli-eating diamondback moths.
 &HT;    In fields containing refuges of non-modified plants, resistance
genes were less likely to be spread through the moth population.
 &HT;    But there is a big caveat. Spraying the refuges with pesticides
_ a common practice among farmers, and one permitted by EPA
regulations _ sped the appearance of toxin-resistant moths.
 &HT;    ``Any time you spray insects on a plant, you are never going to
get 100 percent mortality,'' Shelton says. ``You end up putting a
mosaic of doses on the plants-some high, and some low. Where the
doses are low, you won't kill all the insects, and those that
survive will be more likely to develop resistance.''
 &HT;    
 STAR TREK SYRINGE  
 &HT;    The doctors keep saying it won't hurt a bit, and it keeps
hurting. There's got to be a better way to get drugs into the body
than a brutal needle and syringe.
 &HT;    Chemist Terry Burkoth and his collaborators at PowderJect
Pharmaceuticals in Oxford, England, agree. They have replaced the
needle with a flashlight-size tube that uses a jet of helium to
accelerate powdered drugs to supersonic speeds.
 &HT;    Just press it against the skin, and the PowderJect system shoots
a dose directly into the underlying cells. The drug particles are
so small that the patient hardly feels a thing.
 &HT;    And the supersonic shot could make it easier for doctors to
deliver precise dosages of drugs to hard-to-reach regions just
below the skin's upper layer.
 &HT;    
 PICTURE-PERFECT PLASTIC  
 &HT;    Because of a rogue speck of dust floating around Stephen Chou's
lab at Princeton University, your next computer monitor may display
a much sharper image.
 &HT;    An electrical engineer, Chou was working on a better way to
configure polymer plastics used to make light-emitting diodes, or
LEDs, and other electronics.
 &HT;    One of his graduate students pressed a mask into a layer of
plastic, preparing to transform the material into a pattern of
electrical circuits. By a fluke, bits of dust got behind the mask.
When Chou removed it, he was startled to see that an array of
beautiful, highly regular microscopic pillars had sprung up where
the mask did not lie flush on the surface.
 &HT;    Chou thinks his polymer pillars will simplify the manufacturing
of LED video displays, which have better resolution than
cathode-ray tubes but are expensive to build.
 &HT;    Color LED screens usually contain three different materials to
display the red, blue and green parts of the picture.
 &HT;    ``In the old technology, you had to fabricate each color
separately,'' Chou says. ``With this process, you can fabricate all
the colors at the same time, using the pillar height and size to
control the color.''
 &HT;    
 MODERN SWINGER  
 &HT;    In the robotics laboratory at Japan's Nagoya University, a
strange machine swings from bar to bar like a gibbon.
 &HT;    Toshio Fukuda and Jun Nakanishi, along with Dan Koditschek at
the University of Michigan, recognized that the primate's
arm-to-arm movement is a very complex form of locomotion and set
out to build a robot that could master it.
 &HT;    They demonstrated that a simple double joint _ essentially a
pendulum linked to another pendulum _ could perform the key
swinging motion.
 &HT;    Then the Nagoya group built the Brachiator III, which has legs
to generate initial momentum and a computer vision system to figure
out where to place its handlike grippers.
 &HT;    Nakanishi believes that lessons learned from building the
swinging robots will aid the design of future walking, hopping, or
jumping automatons.

 By BOB BERMAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    On desolate mountaintops in Hawaii, Arizona and Chile, a group
of billion-dollar super-telescopes is about to expand the
boundaries of what we can see in space.
 &HT;    The language used to express these accomplishments may seem like
hieroglyphics. How many people will understand the technical
meanings of ``magnitude'' and ``arc second''?
 &HT;    But what really matters is that we'll be able to spot fainter
stars and galaxies, and they'll appear sharper than ever before.
 &HT;    Despite the boasts of ``500-power'' used by manufacturers of
cheap toy-store telescopes, the truest measure of an instrument's
worth is the diameter of its main lens or mirror, not its
magnifying power.
 &HT;    The Hale Telescope on Mount Palomar, which was the world's
largest for half a century, has a mirror 200 inches, or 5 meters,
across.
 &HT;    The just-completed Japanese Subaru Telescope is 8.2 meters
across, the twin Kecks are 10 meters each, the two Gemini 'scopes
are 8.1 meters, the upcoming Large Binocular Telescope sports dual
8.4-meter mirrors, and the European Very Large Telescope will be an
amazing 16.4 meters when completed in 2003.
 &HT;    The amount of light a telescope collects depends on the surface
area of its main lens or mirror. Each Keck mirror, twice as wide as
the one on Mount Palomar, can detect objects four times as faint.
 &HT;    Astronomers quantify the brightness of celestial objects with a
confusing term: magnitude. Higher numbers indicate fainter things;
each magnitude is about 2.5 times dimmer than the one before, so an
increase of five magnitudes denotes a hundredfold brightness drop.
 &HT;    White Vega and orange Arcturus, the bright stars now high in the
sky, are zero magnitude. The human eye can barely pick out
sixth-magnitude stars, some 250 times fainter.
 &HT;    Amateurs' telescopes collect enough light to make out stars of
magnitude 14. Keck dips down to the 29th magnitude. Hubble's
smallish mirror _ 2.4 meters across _ can detect 30th-magnitude
objects because it orbits above Earth's blurry atmosphere, so it
can concentrate starlight more precisely.
 &HT;    Thirtieth-magnitude objects shed as much light as the glow of a
cigarette in Hawaii as seen from Boston. The Very Large Telescope
will do even better, despite being earthbound.
 &HT;    Bigger mirrors also produce sharper images. Here the standard
scientific measure is the arc second, an angle 1/3,600 of a degree.
The sun and moon appear just under 2,000 arc seconds across.
 &HT;    A good backyard telescope reveals Jupiter's moons as little
disks, a 1-arc-second resolution. Hubble can resolve features as
small as 1/20 arc second. That is equivalent to standing in
Brooklyn and distinguishing the two headlamps of a taxicab in
Paris.
 &HT;    Although the new telescopic giants must peer through layers of
turbulent air, novel de-smudging techniques should allow them to
surpass even Hubble in sharpness.
 &HT;    Declassified adaptive-optics technology will allow them to
compensate for atmospheric distortion using deformable mirrors
attached to motorized pistons.
 &HT;    The Kecks and the Very Large Telescope will eventually combine
light from several telescopes, improving their resolution to
once-unimaginable levels. They may get down below 1/1,000 arc
second, good enough to pick out those headlights on a taxi driving
across the moon, 235,000 miles away _ a feat as astonishing as what
the cab's meter would be reading.

 &HT;    
 FEARS FOR EARS  
 &HT;    American farmers have planted 20 million acres of genetically
modified corn, engineered to repel predatory insects without using
noxious chemicals.
 &HT;    If farmers are not careful, a new report warns, the scheme could
backfire and breed even more troublesome strains of pests.
 &HT;    The modified crops pump out Bt toxin, a natural insecticide
created by bacteria. Some insects, in turn, carry genes that
protect them from the toxin. To check the spread of those genes,
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires that farmers
intersperse fields of genetically modified crops with islands of
non-modified plants.
 &HT;    The idea is that insects in the refuges would remain vulnerable
to Bt toxin, and the bugs would interbreed to keep the whole
population susceptible.
 &HT;    For the first time, scientists have proof the tactic works.
Entomologist Anthony Shelton of Cornell University and his
colleagues sowed fields of altered broccoli and then unleashed
broccoli-eating diamondback moths.
 &HT;    In fields containing refuges of non-modified plants, resistance
genes were less likely to be spread through the moth population.
 &HT;    But there is a big caveat. Spraying the refuges with pesticides
_ a common practice among farmers, and one permitted by EPA
regulations _ sped the appearance of toxin-resistant moths.
 &HT;    ``Any time you spray insects on a plant, you are never going to
get 100 percent mortality,'' Shelton says. ``You end up putting a
mosaic of doses on the plants-some high, and some low. Where the
doses are low, you won't kill all the insects, and those that
survive will be more likely to develop resistance.''
 &HT;    
 STAR TREK SYRINGE  
 &HT;    The doctors keep saying it won't hurt a bit, and it keeps
hurting. There's got to be a better way to get drugs into the body
than a brutal needle and syringe.
 &HT;    Chemist Terry Burkoth and his collaborators at PowderJect
Pharmaceuticals in Oxford, England, agree. They have replaced the
needle with a flashlight-size tube that uses a jet of helium to
accelerate powdered drugs to supersonic speeds.
 &HT;    Just press it against the skin, and the PowderJect system shoots
a dose directly into the underlying cells. The drug particles are
so small that the patient hardly feels a thing.
 &HT;    And the supersonic shot could make it easier for doctors to
deliver precise dosages of drugs to hard-to-reach regions just
below the skin's upper layer.
 &HT;    
 PICTURE-PERFECT PLASTIC  
 &HT;    Because of a rogue speck of dust floating around Stephen Chou's
lab at Princeton University, your next computer monitor may display
a much sharper image.
 &HT;    An electrical engineer, Chou was working on a better way to
configure polymer plastics used to make light-emitting diodes, or
LEDs, and other electronics.
 &HT;    One of his graduate students pressed a mask into a layer of
plastic, preparing to transform the material into a pattern of
electrical circuits. By a fluke, bits of dust got behind the mask.
When Chou removed it, he was startled to see that an array of
beautiful, highly regular microscopic pillars had sprung up where
the mask did not lie flush on the surface.
 &HT;    Chou thinks his polymer pillars will simplify the manufacturing
of LED video displays, which have better resolution than
cathode-ray tubes but are expensive to build.
 &HT;    Color LED screens usually contain three different materials to
display the red, blue and green parts of the picture.
 &HT;    ``In the old technology, you had to fabricate each color
separately,'' Chou says. ``With this process, you can fabricate all
the colors at the same time, using the pillar height and size to
control the color.''
 &HT;    
 MODERN SWINGER  
 &HT;    In the robotics laboratory at Japan's Nagoya University, a
strange machine swings from bar to bar like a gibbon.
 &HT;    Toshio Fukuda and Jun Nakanishi, along with Dan Koditschek at
the University of Michigan, recognized that the primate's
arm-to-arm movement is a very complex form of locomotion and set
out to build a robot that could master it.
 &HT;    They demonstrated that a simple double joint _ essentially a
pendulum linked to another pendulum _ could perform the key
swinging motion.
 &HT;    Then the Nagoya group built the Brachiator III, which has legs
to generate initial momentum and a computer vision system to figure
out where to place its handlike grippers.
 &HT;    Nakanishi believes that lessons learned from building the
swinging robots will aid the design of future walking, hopping, or
jumping automatons.

 By BOB BERMAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    On desolate mountaintops in Hawaii, Arizona and Chile, a group
of billion-dollar super-telescopes is about to expand the
boundaries of what we can see in space.
 &HT;    The language used to express these accomplishments may seem like
hieroglyphics. How many people will understand the technical
meanings of ``magnitude'' and ``arc second''?
 &HT;    But what really matters is that we'll be able to spot fainter
stars and galaxies, and they'll appear sharper than ever before.
 &HT;    Despite the boasts of ``500-power'' used by manufacturers of
cheap toy-store telescopes, the truest measure of an instrument's
worth is the diameter of its main lens or mirror, not its
magnifying power.
 &HT;    The Hale Telescope on Mount Palomar, which was the world's
largest for half a century, has a mirror 200 inches, or 5 meters,
across.
 &HT;    The just-completed Japanese Subaru Telescope is 8.2 meters
across, the twin Kecks are 10 meters each, the two Gemini 'scopes
are 8.1 meters, the upcoming Large Binocular Telescope sports dual
8.4-meter mirrors, and the European Very Large Telescope will be an
amazing 16.4 meters when completed in 2003.
 &HT;    The amount of light a telescope collects depends on the surface
area of its main lens or mirror. Each Keck mirror, twice as wide as
the one on Mount Palomar, can detect objects four times as faint.
 &HT;    Astronomers quantify the brightness of celestial objects with a
confusing term: magnitude. Higher numbers indicate fainter things;
each magnitude is about 2.5 times dimmer than the one before, so an
increase of five magnitudes denotes a hundredfold brightness drop.
 &HT;    White Vega and orange Arcturus, the bright stars now high in the
sky, are zero magnitude. The human eye can barely pick out
sixth-magnitude stars, some 250 times fainter.
 &HT;    Amateurs' telescopes collect enough light to make out stars of
magnitude 14. Keck dips down to the 29th magnitude. Hubble's
smallish mirror _ 2.4 meters across _ can detect 30th-magnitude
objects because it orbits above Earth's blurry atmosphere, so it
can concentrate starlight more precisely.
 &HT;    Thirtieth-magnitude objects shed as much light as the glow of a
cigarette in Hawaii as seen from Boston. The Very Large Telescope
will do even better, despite being earthbound.
 &HT;    Bigger mirrors also produce sharper images. Here the standard
scientific measure is the arc second, an angle 1/3,600 of a degree.
The sun and moon appear just under 2,000 arc seconds across.
 &HT;    A good backyard telescope reveals Jupiter's moons as little
disks, a 1-arc-second resolution. Hubble can resolve features as
small as 1/20 arc second. That is equivalent to standing in
Brooklyn and distinguishing the two headlamps of a taxicab in
Paris.
 &HT;    Although the new telescopic giants must peer through layers of
turbulent air, novel de-smudging techniques should allow them to
surpass even Hubble in sharpness.
 &HT;    Declassified adaptive-optics technology will allow them to
compensate for atmospheric distortion using deformable mirrors
attached to motorized pistons.
 &HT;    The Kecks and the Very Large Telescope will eventually combine
light from several telescopes, improving their resolution to
once-unimaginable levels. They may get down below 1/1,000 arc
second, good enough to pick out those headlights on a taxi driving
across the moon, 235,000 miles away _ a feat as astonishing as what
the cab's meter would be reading.

 By MERLE GINSBERG 
 (One color slide is available.) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If hair is destiny, then Natasha Lyonne's future is going to be
huge. Not to mention wild and out of control.
 &HT;    Of course, hair isn't really destiny (unless you're Kirsty
Hume). But Lyonne, who grew up in Manhattan and went to an
exclusive private school with a bunch of what she calls ``total,
like, icy snobs,'' has her own idiosyncratic notions about the
world _ and one of them is that her mammoth strawberry-blond mane
has sealed her fate. And not necessarily in a good way.
 &HT;    ``I guess it depends on how you feel about Medusa,'' sighs the
diminutive Lyonne, 21. (As she speaks, her hair _ even after a
marathon blowdry _ is expanding a little in the New York humidity.)
 &HT;    ``I'm so fed up with being the kooky funny girl,'' she says.
``And I know it all starts with the hair. I'm not that funny. I'm
fairly antisocial, and I live in my head _ I'm always analyzing
everything. But having crazy hair always makes people think I'm
wild and funny.''
 &HT;    Then there are Lyonne's numerous other quirks: the
chain-smoking, the exaggerated New York accent (which, in
combination with her gravelly voice, makes her sound like a female
Harvey Fierstein), the hipster vocabulary and the long list of
outre interests, including a passion for slasher films.
 &HT;    Most wacky of all, however, is Lyonne's taste in film roles,
which seems to get even wackier as she gets older. Although she's
starred in a couple of studio films (most recently ``Slums of
Beverly Hills'' and ``American Pie''), she's much more likely to be
found in offbeat, semi-obscure indies such as the campy comedy
``But I'm a Cheerleader.''
 &HT;    In the film, Lyonne plays a girl who's sent away to a
conservative cheerleading camp after her parents and would-be
boyfriend begin to suspect she's gay. Naturally, while doing
splits, she falls for a girl (Clea Duvall). Following
``Cheerleader,'' Lyonne will appear this fall in something called
``Confessions of a Trickbaby.''
 &HT;    ``I'm still turning down mainstream movies all the time,'' the
actress says between constant puffs on a cigarette. ``I just keep
turning down that boring stuff.''
 &HT;    She adds that she's not always in the running for big Hollywood
projects, such as the upcoming ``Charlie's Angels.'' ``No one asked
me to be the third angel,'' she says with mock disappointment.
 &HT;    Actually, playing a tough-but-glamorous detective wouldn't be
much of a stretch for Lyonne, who's been standing up for herself
since she was a young girl. When her snooty Manhattan schoolmates
made fun of her hair, she beat them up. So independent was she as a
teen-ager that her mother let her get her own apartment.
 &HT;    ``Can you imagine an 18-year-old getting by a co-op board?''
Lyonne says with a snicker.
 &HT;    Lately, Lyonne says, she's been behaving more and more like a
true adult, much to her surprise.
 &HT;    ``I'm starting to realize that cashmere is more comfortable than
fishnets,'' she says, proud to have moved beyond the rock-chick
look. ``I'm starting to kind of like the idea of being a female.''
 &HT;    Much of her newfound maturity may stem from her very grown-up
relationship with 22-year-old actor Edward Furlong (``American
History X,'' ``Terminator 2''), whom she met on ``Detroit Rock
City'' more than a year ago.
 &HT;    ``We got the L.A. house, we got the dog, we got the DVDs,'' she
says. ``I even cook! Low carb.''
 &HT;    Lyonne suggests that no one but Furlong could have lured her
from New York to the West Coast.
 &HT;    ``I mean, I just spent a year and a half in L.A. just to be with
this dude!'' she says. ``He's one of the real ones _ true hot
stuff. But I was so based in New York and not willing to change
that. I was the big tough-ass New Yorker. Now he says he saw
through that at the very beginning, and that was what was so silly
and endearing about me _ putting on this tough act when I'm just
this little girl.''
 &HT;    Furlong and Lyonne are so devoted to each other that he became
fiercely jealous of her kissing scenes in ``Cheerleader'' _ even
though they were with a woman.
 &HT;    ``And Clea and I were already friends long before the movie,''
Lyonne says. ``The last thing we were going to do, since neither of
us is into girls, is go for each other.''
 &HT;    Lyonne played another gay character earlier this year _ a '70s
activist in HBO's ``If These Walls Could Talk II'' _ but she's not
too worried that the public will misconstrue her sexuality.
 &HT;    ``Everyone in high school thought I was gay, because they never
saw me with a guy,'' she says. ``Truth was, I couldn't get a date.
So I was happy they thought I was gay. At least that meant I wasn't
a loser.'' c.2000 Fairchild Publications

 &HT;    
 PARTY PALACE  
 &HT;    Prince Ernst-August of Hanover and his wife, Caroline of Monaco,
didn't really need an excuse to throw their first ball together at
Marienbourg, Ernst's 19th-century castle outside Hanover, Germany.
 &HT;    But Ernst reportedly told some of the 700 guests, who arrived in
a swarm of private jets, that the occasion was to celebrate the
appearance of their daughter Alexandra's first baby tooth. Security
was tight, and all the invitees _ with the sole exception of
Caroline's old friend Francois-Marie Banier _ were warned not to
bring cameras.
 &HT;    Everyone had to give a secret password to book a room at one of
the hotels Ernst had reserved in advance, although many guests
never actually made it back to their rooms on the night of the
party.
 &HT;    The festivities roared along until 8 a.m. as revelers guzzled
wine, table-hopped and danced to six orchestras _ which played
everything from waltzes to salsa _ through Marienbourg's endless
rooms. (Oversize television monitors allowed diners to keep an eye
on the action elsewhere in the castle.)
 &HT;    The crowd included plenty of nobles, such as Pierre d'Arenberg
and Michael of Greece, as well as the German families of
Furstenberg, Bismarck and Saxe-Weimar.
 &HT;    Then there was Karl Lagerfeld (who designed Caroline's dress and
the one worn by her daughter Charlotte), along with Valentino,
Hubert de Givenchy, Robert and Chantal Miller, Mick Flick, Philip
and Spyros Niarchos, Susan Gutfreund, Judy Taubman and Lynn Wyatt.
A send-off lunch had been scheduled for the next day, but nobody
made it.
 &HT;    ``They were too hungover,'' one guest explained.
 &HT;    
 UNDIE ACHIEVERS  
 &HT;    Having snubbed New York as ``too uptight'' to be the site of
Agent Provocateur's first U.S. store, the creators of London's
infamous naughty-lingerie-for-rich-girls line have decided to open
up shop this September on L.A.'s Melrose Avenue.
 &HT;    And word is that the company's first fragrance will make its
debut at the shop soon thereafter.
 &HT;    ``I think people like to look sexier in L.A.,'' says
designer/owner Serena Rees, whose peephole bras and sheer culotte
panties have found fans in Gwyneth Paltrow, Nicole Kidman and
Madonna. ``I mean, just look at how much they care about breasts
here.''
 &HT;    
 KRAVIS IN PARIS  
 &HT;    Paris is quietly whispering that Henry and Marie-Josee Kravis,
New York's billionaire Francophiles, are coming to town.
 &HT;    The Kravises, whose palatial New York spread is crammed with
major 18th-century furniture assembled with the help of decorator
Francois Joseph Graf, are said to have bought an apartment on
discreet rue de l'Universite.
 &HT;    Although it's reportedly a small pied-a-terre, the Kravises have
again enlisted the services of Graf, who's known as ``the emperor''
for his grand personality and grander work for such clients as
David and Olympia de Rothschild.
 &HT;    
 SILICON ICON  
 &HT;    He was the first designer to dress Hollywood, and now Giorgio
Armani has moved upstate to Silicon Valley.
 &HT;    The designer has positioned a particularly proactive manager in
his San Francisco store to help transform sartorially challenged
dot-com nerds.
 &HT;    ``We're talking about women who show up for an event dressed in
dresses and ... Nikes,'' said one fashion observer.
 &HT;    An Armani spokesman put it another way: ``These are people who
want to evolve from a very casual look to something easy but
elegant.''
 &HT;    
 JERSEY JON  
 &HT;    Guess who's no longer wearing head-to-toe Versace? Jon Bon Jovi.
 &HT;    The rocker/actor was spotted at a recent party in Monte Carlo
wearing a suit by a little-known L.A.-based company called Lords.
 &HT;    ``I'm breaking out of my mold,'' said Bon Jovi, showing off the
big-shouldered dark blue suit. ``But I still wear Italian suits:
Lords is designed by two Italian guys from Jersey.''

 By SHARON EDELSON 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``When Are You Entitled to New Underwear and Other Major
Financial Decisions'' ... ``Prince Charming Isn't Coming: How Women
Get Smart About Money'' ... ``A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge
of Your Financial Life.''
 &HT;    Judging by the titles of these recent financial self-help books
for women, you'd think that the fairer sex was positively clueless
about matters of money.
 &HT;    That common perception may help to explain the plethora of
candy-colored book covers and financial seminars packaged with
girlish pursuits.
 &HT;    Henri Bendel recently hosted an event called ``Make Over Your
Financial Future'' which paired the Laura Mercier team of makeup
artists with a Merrill Lynch financial adviser.
 &HT;    Then there's the marketing blurb for the personal-finance book
``Girls Just Want to Have Funds,'' which begins, ``If you know how
to deal with a bad hair day, you have what it takes to be a smart
investor.''
 &HT;    Jennifer Lang, an editor at Hyperion Press, which published
``Girls Just Want to Have Funds,'' says the title and marketing had
a lighthearted approach because ``a lot of the people who are going
to buy this book are younger women.''
 &HT;    But not everyone in the business of offering financial advice
thinks female equals flighty.
 &HT;    ``Publishers and authors sometimes underestimate women,'' says
Sue Herera, the co-anchor of CNBC's ``Business Center.'' ``More
women than ever are managing their portfolios or their family's
portfolios. Women are becoming a huge force in controlling wealth
in this country.''
 &HT;    And there is some evidence that authors and publishers are
catching on.
 &HT;    ``Some titles are a bit patronizing to women, and so are the
books,'' says Fred Hills, a Simon &AMP; Schuster vice president. ``They
presume that women are ignoramuses, when in fact, there are more
women entrepreneurs running small businesses than men.''
 &HT;    When Mary Farrell, a senior investment strategist at
PaineWebber, wrote her latest book, ``Beyond the Basics,'' she
included plenty of hard information on index funds, mutual funds
and identifying future financial trends.
 &HT;    ``There's nothing cutesy about Mary or the title or tone of the
book,'' says Hills, who edited ``Beyond the Basics.'' ``She is the
intelligent spokesperson for female investors, as opposed to the
dumb-blonde approach.''
 &HT;    Farrell, in fact, claims her book isn't specifically designed
for women (though book editors say the picture of her on the cover
is aimed at a female audience).
 &HT;    ``I did some research when I was trying to decide whether to
write a book,'' Farrell says. ``I was very surprised and angry at
how many feel-good books there are but not many books with hard
knowledge. So many of the books were like crisis management. They
just presented one anecdote after another of women as victims.''
 &HT;    Best-selling financial guru Suze Orman's ``9 Steps to Financial
Freedom,'' for example, offers more anecdotes than advice on stocks
and bonds.
 &HT;    Orman takes a psychological approach based on her belief that
women need to overcome their money fears _ about having it and not
having it. While many experts say women have made great strides,
Orman, who travels the country giving seminars, begs to differ.
 &HT;    ``It all depends on where the women live,'' she says. ``In
middle America, a lot of women still are clueless and have this
belief that their husbands know what they're doing with the
money.''
 &HT;    Maybe Orman has an audience among beginners, but financial
experts point out that female-only investment clubs regularly beat
the returns of men-only or mixed clubs.
 &HT;    Judith Briles Ph.D., author of ``10 Smart Money Moves for
Women,'' says men act on hot tips while women do more homework, and
a study by the University of California, Davis, found that men
trade more frequently than women _ and often earn lower returns as
a result.
 &HT;    The need for gender-specific financial advice may be a matter of
style more than substance.
 &HT;    ``Women like communicating with other women,'' says Jennifer
Openshaw, who founded wfn.com (Women's Financial Network). ``They
face different issues. They live longer than men, so they need to
save more in their lifetimes.''
 &HT;    Of course, the latest battleground for the hearts and wallets of
women is the Internet, where female-oriented Web sites such as
msmoney.com offer a no-nonsense approach, dispensing with feel-good
psychobabble and providing investment strategies for different
stages in a woman's life.
 &HT;    ``One of the big pluses for women is that there's never an issue
of being patronized or ignored on the Internet,'' says Briles, who
is also a spokeswoman for wingspanbank.com.
 &HT;    But even some New Economy entrepreneurs believe investment sites
need bells and whistles in order to be compelling to women.
 &HT;    Openshaw, for one, hired Sela Ward _ the actress who plays Lily,
a financially awkward single mom on ABC's ``Once and Again'' _ to
promote wfn.com.
 &HT;    ``Sela could be the poster child for everywoman,'' Openshaw
says. ``She says, 'Finances make my eyes glaze over.''' c.2000

 By MERLE GINSBERG 
 (One color slide is available.) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If hair is destiny, then Natasha Lyonne's future is going to be
huge. Not to mention wild and out of control.
 &HT;    Of course, hair isn't really destiny (unless you're Kirsty
Hume). But Lyonne, who grew up in Manhattan and went to an
exclusive private school with a bunch of what she calls ``total,
like, icy snobs,'' has her own idiosyncratic notions about the
world _ and one of them is that her mammoth strawberry-blond mane
has sealed her fate. And not necessarily in a good way.
 &HT;    ``I guess it depends on how you feel about Medusa,'' sighs the
diminutive Lyonne, 21. (As she speaks, her hair _ even after a
marathon blowdry _ is expanding a little in the New York humidity.)
 &HT;    ``I'm so fed up with being the kooky funny girl,'' she says.
``And I know it all starts with the hair. I'm not that funny. I'm
fairly antisocial, and I live in my head _ I'm always analyzing
everything. But having crazy hair always makes people think I'm
wild and funny.''
 &HT;    Then there are Lyonne's numerous other quirks: the
chain-smoking, the exaggerated New York accent (which, in
combination with her gravelly voice, makes her sound like a female
Harvey Fierstein), the hipster vocabulary and the long list of
outre interests, including a passion for slasher films.
 &HT;    Most wacky of all, however, is Lyonne's taste in film roles,
which seems to get even wackier as she gets older. Although she's
starred in a couple of studio films (most recently ``Slums of
Beverly Hills'' and ``American Pie''), she's much more likely to be
found in offbeat, semi-obscure indies such as the campy comedy
``But I'm a Cheerleader.''
 &HT;    In the film, Lyonne plays a girl who's sent away to a
conservative cheerleading camp after her parents and would-be
boyfriend begin to suspect she's gay. Naturally, while doing
splits, she falls for a girl (Clea Duvall). Following
``Cheerleader,'' Lyonne will appear this fall in something called
``Confessions of a Trickbaby.''
 &HT;    ``I'm still turning down mainstream movies all the time,'' the
actress says between constant puffs on a cigarette. ``I just keep
turning down that boring stuff.''
 &HT;    She adds that she's not always in the running for big Hollywood
projects, such as the upcoming ``Charlie's Angels.'' ``No one asked
me to be the third angel,'' she says with mock disappointment.
 &HT;    Actually, playing a tough-but-glamorous detective wouldn't be
much of a stretch for Lyonne, who's been standing up for herself
since she was a young girl. When her snooty Manhattan schoolmates
made fun of her hair, she beat them up. So independent was she as a
teen-ager that her mother let her get her own apartment.
 &HT;    ``Can you imagine an 18-year-old getting by a co-op board?''
Lyonne says with a snicker.
 &HT;    Lately, Lyonne says, she's been behaving more and more like a
true adult, much to her surprise.
 &HT;    ``I'm starting to realize that cashmere is more comfortable than
fishnets,'' she says, proud to have moved beyond the rock-chick
look. ``I'm starting to kind of like the idea of being a female.''
 &HT;    Much of her newfound maturity may stem from her very grown-up
relationship with 22-year-old actor Edward Furlong (``American
History X,'' ``Terminator 2''), whom she met on ``Detroit Rock
City'' more than a year ago.
 &HT;    ``We got the L.A. house, we got the dog, we got the DVDs,'' she
says. ``I even cook! Low carb.''
 &HT;    Lyonne suggests that no one but Furlong could have lured her
from New York to the West Coast.
 &HT;    ``I mean, I just spent a year and a half in L.A. just to be with
this dude!'' she says. ``He's one of the real ones _ true hot
stuff. But I was so based in New York and not willing to change
that. I was the big tough-ass New Yorker. Now he says he saw
through that at the very beginning, and that was what was so silly
and endearing about me _ putting on this tough act when I'm just
this little girl.''
 &HT;    Furlong and Lyonne are so devoted to each other that he became
fiercely jealous of her kissing scenes in ``Cheerleader'' _ even
though they were with a woman.
 &HT;    ``And Clea and I were already friends long before the movie,''
Lyonne says. ``The last thing we were going to do, since neither of
us is into girls, is go for each other.''
 &HT;    Lyonne played another gay character earlier this year _ a '70s
activist in HBO's ``If These Walls Could Talk II'' _ but she's not
too worried that the public will misconstrue her sexuality.
 &HT;    ``Everyone in high school thought I was gay, because they never
saw me with a guy,'' she says. ``Truth was, I couldn't get a date.
So I was happy they thought I was gay. At least that meant I wasn't
a loser.'' c.2000 Fairchild Publications

 &HT;    
 PARTY PALACE  
 &HT;    Prince Ernst-August of Hanover and his wife, Caroline of Monaco,
didn't really need an excuse to throw their first ball together at
Marienbourg, Ernst's 19th-century castle outside Hanover, Germany.
 &HT;    But Ernst reportedly told some of the 700 guests, who arrived in
a swarm of private jets, that the occasion was to celebrate the
appearance of their daughter Alexandra's first baby tooth. Security
was tight, and all the invitees _ with the sole exception of
Caroline's old friend Francois-Marie Banier _ were warned not to
bring cameras.
 &HT;    Everyone had to give a secret password to book a room at one of
the hotels Ernst had reserved in advance, although many guests
never actually made it back to their rooms on the night of the
party.
 &HT;    The festivities roared along until 8 a.m. as revelers guzzled
wine, table-hopped and danced to six orchestras _ which played
everything from waltzes to salsa _ through Marienbourg's endless
rooms. (Oversize television monitors allowed diners to keep an eye
on the action elsewhere in the castle.)
 &HT;    The crowd included plenty of nobles, such as Pierre d'Arenberg
and Michael of Greece, as well as the German families of
Furstenberg, Bismarck and Saxe-Weimar.
 &HT;    Then there was Karl Lagerfeld (who designed Caroline's dress and
the one worn by her daughter Charlotte), along with Valentino,
Hubert de Givenchy, Robert and Chantal Miller, Mick Flick, Philip
and Spyros Niarchos, Susan Gutfreund, Judy Taubman and Lynn Wyatt.
A send-off lunch had been scheduled for the next day, but nobody
made it.
 &HT;    ``They were too hungover,'' one guest explained.
 &HT;    
 UNDIE ACHIEVERS  
 &HT;    Having snubbed New York as ``too uptight'' to be the site of
Agent Provocateur's first U.S. store, the creators of London's
infamous naughty-lingerie-for-rich-girls line have decided to open
up shop this September on L.A.'s Melrose Avenue.
 &HT;    And word is that the company's first fragrance will make its
debut at the shop soon thereafter.
 &HT;    ``I think people like to look sexier in L.A.,'' says
designer/owner Serena Rees, whose peephole bras and sheer culotte
panties have found fans in Gwyneth Paltrow, Nicole Kidman and
Madonna. ``I mean, just look at how much they care about breasts
here.''
 &HT;    
 KRAVIS IN PARIS  
 &HT;    Paris is quietly whispering that Henry and Marie-Josee Kravis,
New York's billionaire Francophiles, are coming to town.
 &HT;    The Kravises, whose palatial New York spread is crammed with
major 18th-century furniture assembled with the help of decorator
Francois Joseph Graf, are said to have bought an apartment on
discreet rue de l'Universite.
 &HT;    Although it's reportedly a small pied-a-terre, the Kravises have
again enlisted the services of Graf, who's known as ``the emperor''
for his grand personality and grander work for such clients as
David and Olympia de Rothschild.
 &HT;    
 SILICON ICON  
 &HT;    He was the first designer to dress Hollywood, and now Giorgio
Armani has moved upstate to Silicon Valley.
 &HT;    The designer has positioned a particularly proactive manager in
his San Francisco store to help transform sartorially challenged
dot-com nerds.
 &HT;    ``We're talking about women who show up for an event dressed in
dresses and ... Nikes,'' said one fashion observer.
 &HT;    An Armani spokesman put it another way: ``These are people who
want to evolve from a very casual look to something easy but
elegant.''
 &HT;    
 JERSEY JON  
 &HT;    Guess who's no longer wearing head-to-toe Versace? Jon Bon Jovi.
 &HT;    The rocker/actor was spotted at a recent party in Monte Carlo
wearing a suit by a little-known L.A.-based company called Lords.
 &HT;    ``I'm breaking out of my mold,'' said Bon Jovi, showing off the
big-shouldered dark blue suit. ``But I still wear Italian suits:
Lords is designed by two Italian guys from Jersey.''

elements of that period are back _ with a ladylike slant.

 By SHARON EDELSON 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``When Are You Entitled to New Underwear and Other Major
Financial Decisions'' ... ``Prince Charming Isn't Coming: How Women
Get Smart About Money'' ... ``A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge
of Your Financial Life.''
 &HT;    Judging by the titles of these recent financial self-help books
for women, you'd think that the fairer sex was positively clueless
about matters of money.
 &HT;    That common perception may help to explain the plethora of
candy-colored book covers and financial seminars packaged with
girlish pursuits.
 &HT;    Henri Bendel recently hosted an event called ``Make Over Your
Financial Future'' which paired the Laura Mercier team of makeup
artists with a Merrill Lynch financial adviser.
 &HT;    Then there's the marketing blurb for the personal-finance book
``Girls Just Want to Have Funds,'' which begins, ``If you know how
to deal with a bad hair day, you have what it takes to be a smart
investor.''
 &HT;    Jennifer Lang, an editor at Hyperion Press, which published
``Girls Just Want to Have Funds,'' says the title and marketing had
a lighthearted approach because ``a lot of the people who are going
to buy this book are younger women.''
 &HT;    But not everyone in the business of offering financial advice
thinks female equals flighty.
 &HT;    ``Publishers and authors sometimes underestimate women,'' says
Sue Herera, the co-anchor of CNBC's ``Business Center.'' ``More
women than ever are managing their portfolios or their family's
portfolios. Women are becoming a huge force in controlling wealth
in this country.''
 &HT;    And there is some evidence that authors and publishers are
catching on.
 &HT;    ``Some titles are a bit patronizing to women, and so are the
books,'' says Fred Hills, a Simon &AMP; Schuster vice president. ``They
presume that women are ignoramuses, when in fact, there are more
women entrepreneurs running small businesses than men.''
 &HT;    When Mary Farrell, a senior investment strategist at
PaineWebber, wrote her latest book, ``Beyond the Basics,'' she
included plenty of hard information on index funds, mutual funds
and identifying future financial trends.
 &HT;    ``There's nothing cutesy about Mary or the title or tone of the
book,'' says Hills, who edited ``Beyond the Basics.'' ``She is the
intelligent spokesperson for female investors, as opposed to the
dumb-blonde approach.''
 &HT;    Farrell, in fact, claims her book isn't specifically designed
for women (though book editors say the picture of her on the cover
is aimed at a female audience).
 &HT;    ``I did some research when I was trying to decide whether to
write a book,'' Farrell says. ``I was very surprised and angry at
how many feel-good books there are but not many books with hard
knowledge. So many of the books were like crisis management. They
just presented one anecdote after another of women as victims.''
 &HT;    Best-selling financial guru Suze Orman's ``9 Steps to Financial
Freedom,'' for example, offers more anecdotes than advice on stocks
and bonds.
 &HT;    Orman takes a psychological approach based on her belief that
women need to overcome their money fears _ about having it and not
having it. While many experts say women have made great strides,
Orman, who travels the country giving seminars, begs to differ.
 &HT;    ``It all depends on where the women live,'' she says. ``In
middle America, a lot of women still are clueless and have this
belief that their husbands know what they're doing with the
money.''
 &HT;    Maybe Orman has an audience among beginners, but financial
experts point out that female-only investment clubs regularly beat
the returns of men-only or mixed clubs.
 &HT;    Judith Briles Ph.D., author of ``10 Smart Money Moves for
Women,'' says men act on hot tips while women do more homework, and
a study by the University of California, Davis, found that men
trade more frequently than women _ and often earn lower returns as
a result.
 &HT;    The need for gender-specific financial advice may be a matter of
style more than substance.
 &HT;    ``Women like communicating with other women,'' says Jennifer
Openshaw, who founded wfn.com (Women's Financial Network). ``They
face different issues. They live longer than men, so they need to
save more in their lifetimes.''
 &HT;    Of course, the latest battleground for the hearts and wallets of
women is the Internet, where female-oriented Web sites such as
msmoney.com offer a no-nonsense approach, dispensing with feel-good
psychobabble and providing investment strategies for different
stages in a woman's life.
 &HT;    ``One of the big pluses for women is that there's never an issue
of being patronized or ignored on the Internet,'' says Briles, who
is also a spokeswoman for wingspanbank.com.
 &HT;    But even some New Economy entrepreneurs believe investment sites
need bells and whistles in order to be compelling to women.
 &HT;    Openshaw, for one, hired Sela Ward _ the actress who plays Lily,
a financially awkward single mom on ABC's ``Once and Again'' _ to
promote wfn.com.
 &HT;    ``Sela could be the poster child for everywoman,'' Openshaw
says. ``She says, 'Finances make my eyes glaze over.''' c.2000

&HT;     GETTYS SUED OVER EFFACING MURAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Garth Benton says that if Ann and Gordon Getty
didn't want his mural in their San Francisco mansion any more, it
would have been easy to detach it from the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he claims, the local philanthropists and socialites
painted over the $327,000 mural, violating a rarely used California
law barring the destruction of fine art.
</P>
<P>
   Benton responded by filing a lawsuit in San Francisco Superior
Court. A Getty family spokesman said experts are working to restore
the painting.
</P>
<P>
   The world-renowned artist, who reportedly has painted for the
homes of such luminaries as Bob Hope and former President Gerald
Ford, wants $327,000 in damages, plus his attorneys fees paid.
</P>
<P>
   Benton also wants punitive damages, which by state law would go
to a California charitable or educational activity involving fine
arts.
</P>
<P>
   Getty family spokesman Larry Kamer confirmed that Benton's mural
had been painted over with ``some other kind of paint,'' not by a
commissioned artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Mrs. Getty has dedicated much of her life to the
restoration and preservation of fine art, she is now working with
experts to remove the paint from the mural and restore it to its
original condition,'' Kamer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Getty was out of the country and Gordon Getty could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The garden-style mural was created in Pebble Beach, and it was
installed in the Gettys' mansion in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Benton, who lives in Alabama, says the mural, which measures 15
feet tall and 40 feet wide, was painted on canvas, then attached to
the wall of the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of the mural accompanying the complaint shows a
painting of a balcony overlooking a field, with a monkey in the
corner being fed by a young girl.
</P>
<P>
   Benton says he knows the painting was on the wall in the early
1990s, but the lawsuit does not say when it was painted over.
</P>
<P>
   Benton claims he called the Gettys in March, hoping to get a
photograph of the work for listing in his upcoming catalogue
raisonn.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit states: ``Within the following week, Benton was
advised by an assistant to the Gettys that the work had been
painted over.''
</P>
<P>
   Benton also could not be reached for comment, and his lawyers
did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama arts and tourism magazines say Benton's clients have
included not only Hope and Ford, but also Barbra Streisand,
Danielle Steel, Carol Burnett and producer Aaron Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   He also painted a 1983 mural that was featured at the J. Paul
Getty Museum in Malibu, which is closed for renovations until next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Gettys are fixtures in San Francisco high society. Getty's
father once was believed to be the richest man in the United
States. Born in Los Angeles, Gordon Getty has split his time
between being a composer and a philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Ann Getty were married in Las Vegas in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Before Texaco Inc.'s takeover of Getty Oil in 1984, Gordon
Getty's share of the trust income was about $30 million per year,
according to a New York Times article.

<P>
   &UR; BY DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Hefner, who is too harmless to offend anyone these days, is
surely giddy about the recent Playboy Mansion party brouhaha.
During the Democratic Convention, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif.,
will host a fund-raiser at Hef's Los Angeles castle for her
Hispanic Unity USA political action committee, which promotes
Latino voter registration.
</P>
<P>
   Hef, who will spend $75,000-$150,000 to throw the bash, has
supported Sanchez since she challenged and defeated Playboy nemesis
Robert Dornan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The event has turned into a Democratic debacle. Republicans are
gleefully mocking the Democratic-Playmate alliance. Democratic
leaders are appalled at the idea of Hef, resplendent in a silk
bathrobe, his young girlfriends by his side, emerging from the
Grotto to bless the party.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's spokesman sternly declared that the vice president did
not ``condone'' Sanchez's party and won't attend it.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez and her aides, perhaps embarrassed by the Playboy
connection, wooldn't return phone calls about the dinner. Hef and
his deputies, on the other hand, have worked themselves into
delightful indignation about their martyrdom to American prudery.
They are loving being bad boys again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised at the Democrats. We have supported them over
the years. This really shows the Puritanism in this country,''
waxes Playboy Executive Vice President Richard Rosenzweig. The
dinner will be a ``classy'' _ and bunny-free _ formal affair, he
insists. ``I don't know what people think goes on at the mansion _
(oh yes you do, Richard) _ but it is a stately setting and we have
the most elegant parties,'' Rosenzweig declares.
</P>
<P>
   This squabble marks another step forward in Hef's bizarre
renaissance. In 1998, Hef separated from his wife, discovered
Viagra, hooked up with his concubine quartet, and began waging a
relentless campaign for attention. The glossy media obliged.
</P>
<P>
   Vanity Fair, Details, and Esquire have slobbered over the
74-year-old hedonist. A major biopic about Hefner is planned.
Harper's Bazaar crowned the Playboy Mansion the coolest spot in the
United States. Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz won't miss Hef's
parties. They schmooze among the peacocks with old mansion
stalwarts like James Caan and Jack Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Hef is unabashedly joyful at the attention. With no more taste
for self-criticism than for middle-aged women, he doesn't see the
poignancy in his return. He doesn't seem to recognize that he has
been revived not because he is cool, but because he's not.
</P>
<P>
   He is the human bellbottom, an ancient artifact unearthed for
giggles, soon to be discarded. Hef's current popularity does not
signify a resurgence of the Playboy Philosophy. It is mere retro.
The culture that valorizes Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack is
reveling in Playboy nostalgia, looking back _ winkingly _ to the
days when men were men and women were girls.
</P>
<P>
   Hef plays his role perfectly, because he has not changed. He is
Unfrozen Caveman Swinger, cryogenically preserved since the '70s.
His face is strangely unlined: He looks the same now as he did at
45. He is still wearing pajamas. There's still a mirror on his
bedroom ceiling and soft lighting in the Grotto. He peppers his
speech with phrases that haven't been uttered since 1975: He's
``back on the scene'' and playing ``the mating game.''
</P>
<P>
   His girlfriends are the same pneumatic twentysomethings he used
to frolic with 20 years ago, or 30, or 40.
</P>
<P>
   Hef is the living incarnation of the lech in ``Dazed and
Confused:'' ``That's what I like about these high-school girls. I
keep getting older, they stay the same age.'' He brags incessantly
that he is living every American man's dream, a half-century
bacchanal of blondes and Diet Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, this life was shocking. Now it is simply goofy:
an old man who couldn't stay married, flinging himself on girls and
bragging about his sexual prowess. History is repeating itself _
the first time as nudity, the second as farce.
</P>
<P>
   This is too bad, because Hef's current life makes it easy to
forget that he once mattered. He launched Playboy in 1953 into a
United States split between the conformity of ``Leave It to
Beaver'' and the dark rebellion of the Beats. Hefner straddled
these worlds: He stripped the girl next door to her birthday suit
but made sure she still looked like the girl next door.
</P>
<P>
   Arm-in-arm with its female cousin Cosmopolitan, Playboy made sex
a proper subject of conversation and made the single life
glamorous. Playboy kick-started the endless sexualization of
everyday American life. From Playboy sprang the dubious glories of
R-movies, swimsuit issues, high-class strip joints and, most of
all, the right _ no, the obligation _ to discuss sex around the
dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   Hef was deadly serious about his task. He was liberating America
from corseted oppression. In the early '60s, he issued the 26-part,
250,000-word ``Playboy Philosophy,'' his disquisition on the evils
of inhibition and prudery and the glory of sexual experience. His
adventures in the skin trade were not simply pleasure _ though with
1,000-odd sexual partners, he certainly had his share of that _
they were a calling.
</P>
<P>
   He regarded himself as a prophet of freedom. (Hugh 36:24:36.)
</P>
<P>
   But the Playboy empire crumbled in the '80s. The 1980 murder of
Playmate Dorothy Stratten shook Hef and the company. The Playboy
Clubs folded as singles bars stole their business. Playboy lost its
casino licenses. Profits withered, and so did Hef. He had a stroke
in 1985. He passed control of Playboy's business operations to his
daughter Christine several years later. In 1989, he ended a 30-year
bachelor party, got married, and holed up in the Playboy Mansion,
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Hef blamed Playboy's decline on his favorite boogeyman: the
puritan. He believed that Playboy was being crippled by the
nation's growing conservatism. President Reagan's Commission on
Pornography roughed up Playboy, AIDS doused the sexual hedonism of
the '70s, and the women's movement lost patience with Hefner's
retrograde style.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy, however, faded not because it was too threatening to a
conservative country, but because it's too tame for a wild one.
Hard-core pornography stole a huge number of Playboy subscribers _
the men who had never read the magazine for the articles. Magazines
such as Penthouse and Hustler (and worse) were willing to be
gynecological where Playboy was blurry. (Different strokes for
different folks.) Playboy's readership got older and smaller: Paid
readership plunged from more than 7 million a month to barely 3
million today.
</P>
<P>
   Hef's current blip of fame hasn't altered this grim reality.
Hard-core porn still owns the more onanistic segment of Playboy's
old market. Magazines such as Maxim, which publish shorter, crasser
articles, are attracting the boys who once snuck a peek at Dad's
Playboy. While porn and publishing are banking record profits,
Playboy Enterprises lost $5 million last year and another $6
million in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy still outsells other men's mags, claims the top spots on
video sales charts, and runs a busy Internet site, but its staid,
Vaseline-on-the-lens style has no obvious future. The girl next
door is still cute, but it's no great thrill to see her naked.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy occupies an awkward no man's land: It's blue enough that
you don't want your mom or girlfriend to see it, but it's not
raunchy enough to qualify as porn.
</P>
<P>
   Hef, seeking some kind of entree, desperately promotes Playboy
as the Cadillac of skin mags: ``We're a class act with a history, a
heritage, a continuity of accomplishment. Entire generations have
grown up with Playboy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hef and Playboy have not grown up. That's why Hef is no more
than a diverting museum piece, and why his company is floundering.

JACKSON'S TOO-LOW PROFILE A MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this stage of the presidential marathon, George W. Bush
appears able and ready for the final three-month stretch, and Al
Gore does not.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the last several days' scrutiny of running mate Dick
Cheney's extremely conservative voting record, Bush still got a
boost in the polls as he heads into this week's GOP convention.
Gore, meanwhile, was struggling to find a solid campaign strategy
before the Democratic National Convention opens Aug. 14 in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   An important part of Gore's strategy, of course, is picking a
running mate who strengthens the ticket. But if he is to win this
election, he is going to need more than a good running mate. He is
going to need the active support of a man who has been relatively
quiet during this campaign season: the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Since he entered the presidential primary race in 1984 _ the
first African-American to make a serious run for the White House _
Jackson has been deeply involved in virtually every presidential
election, until this year. Indeed, in 1988, if nominee Michael
Dukakis had offered him the vice-presidential spot, Jackson would
have taken it. When Dukakis did not, Jackson campaigned for him
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 and 1996, Jackson backed Bill Clinton in the weeks
before each of those Democratic National Convention. He focused on
getting black, liberal, and low-income voters to the polls _
something crucial to Clinton's two successful presidential
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the weeks leading up to this year's convention, Jackson
has kept a far lower profile, even considering his recent tour in
Chicago with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, say some analysts, Jackson's relative
absence on the campaign trail is not helping Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's scheduled convention speech will no doubt be stirring.
But if he had been actively campaigning with high visibility across
the country in recent weeks, he might have made a larger impact at
the convention, and energized more of Gore's core Democratic base.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Jackson becomes more active in the Gore campaign during
the next two weeks, it will not equal what he could have done to
energize blacks and other traditional Democratic voters to work for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Jackson's distancing has come at Gore's request. Perhaps
he did not want to be linked to some of Clinton's close friends and
advisers during the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. Jackson, as
well-publicized in the media, was Clinton's spiritual adviser in
the White House during the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has cost himself support by failing to embrace Jackson as
an asset, just as he is able to embrace Clinton's successful
policies. With Jackson's high-profile support, Gore could win more
support from the nation's 20 million eligible black voters.
</P>
<P>
   And Jackson has the ability to move not just black voters, but
Hispanics, liberals, farmers, union workers, and other groups that
make up Gore's political base. Gore needs the edge those voters
could give him.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson could also be the key to bringing back disenchanted
voters, especially African-Americans, who were turned off by Gore's
support of the Cuban-Americans' efforts to keep Elian Gonzalez in
the United States. They asserted that the issue should be resolved
in a US family court rather than return the boy to Cuba with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore had called on Jackson to convene a summit of black
leaders earlier this summer to win back the turned-off voters, Gore
could be going into the Democratic convention with a stronger
political base _ and come out of it better-positioned to surpass
Bush in the campaign's final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be too late for Gore to tap what Jackson has to
offer. But Gore must do something dramatic that will give Jackson's
supporters a reason to watch him at the convention, without
reducing Gore's own presence.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jackson, there is no reason for him to resist a bigger
role in the Gore campaign. Despite differences with Clinton, he
campaigned on his behalf in the weeks leading up to the
conventions. There is no reason why he would not do the same for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to Jackson, Gore, and his campaign team to work out
an approach. As Gore focuses on making his choice for vice
president, he should also focus on making Jackson a key member of
his team. Gore's choice may help his candidacy. But even a good
choice for vice president may not be enough for Gore to win the
November election without giving a choice role in his campaign to
Jesse L. Jackson.

TRACKING THE PATH OF THE WEST NILE VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crow was just lying there.
</P>
<P>
   Its eyes were open. It was breathing. But there was no movement
in its greasy black wings.
</P>
<P>
   Park ranger Jennifer Grant walked up to it cautiously. She
stamped her foot. The crow struggled to its feet, unfurling its
wings to fly. Instead, it keeled over, falling back into the dirt
next to Willow Pond in Boston's Jamaica Plain section, its wings
quivering.
</P>
<P>
   Grant put on plastic gloves and scooped the ailing bird into a
cardboard box. ``Ever since last summer, we were told to keep an
eye out for that sort of thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer an outbreak of the West Nile virus killed seven
people in Queens, N.Y., and sickened more than 60 others. Hundreds
of crows died as well. Every park ranger and public health
specialist on the East Coast has been on alert since.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, Grant trucked specimen No. ZL00036 to a laboratory,
unaware she had stumbled onto the first sign the virus had come to
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Another virus-positive crow found in Hopkinton, Mass. was later
identified. But no people have been reported infected. The
encephalitis virus usually produces flu-like symptoms but
occasionally causes quick and fatal brain inflammation, especially
in the elderly. It is spread to people by mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   The virus has turned up in mosquitoes in several New York
counties and in Stamford, Conn. About 40 infected crows were found
in the New York City region. Officials from Maine to Miami are
frantically testing birds, mammals, and mosquitoes for signs of the
virus. Boston health officials are certain that mosquitoes here are
carriers. They just don't know how many.
</P>
<P>
   But they do know this: the local population of the Culex pipiens
mosquito, the primary carrier of West Nile virus, is in the midst
of its annual explosion. It is also the time when people maximize
their time outdoors. If there are human infections, they will
probably turn up in the next few weeks. The Queens outbreak
occurred in late August.
</P>
<P>
   But West Nile could also be a blip. Either way, scientists are
watching.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile has been something of a wayward virus. It first
appeared in Uganda, on the western bank of the Nile River, in 1937
and has since popped up here and there in Eastern Europe, Africa,
and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But 1999 was different.
</P>
<P>
   That year the virus sickened 1,000 and killed at least 40 on the
Volga Delta in southern Russia, in a little-reported outbreak. It
also killed an elderly couple and hundreds of geese in Israel. That
puzzled scientists: The virus had never been so fatal to birds.
</P>
<P>
   Then it made its jump to the Western Hemisphere _ Queens. The
genetic fingerprint of that strain was almost identical to the one
in Israel. Researchers theorized how the virus might have made its
move: an infected Israeli airline passenger? An infected bird blown
across the Atlantic? They still don't know. And they are unsure of
the deadliness of the American strain.
</P>
<P>
   At an international meeting of infectious disease researchers in
Atlanta two weeks ago, there seemed to be a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has happened to this virus,'' said Sharone Green, an
associate professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts
Medical School who attended. ``I think we're seeing a new virus,
but we're not sure exactly how it has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention's West Nile specialists, said: ``The
fact is West Nile does kill. We're looking and watching it closely
to see if it's more virulent than we see in other parts of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the curiosity and excitement, scientists are realizing that
the virus will probably be a feature of Eastern Seaboard summers
for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should get used to this,'' said Andrew Spielman, a
professor of tropical public health at the Harvard School of Public
Health.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Ralph Timperi was used to examining sick birds by last Monday
when specimen No. ZL00036 landed in his lab in Boston. It was his
42d sick animal since June 1.
</P>
<P>
   His eight-person crew peeled back the dead crow's scalp and
extracted brain tissue. They treated the sample with different
enzymes, chemicals, and dyes to read its genetic fingerprint. They
had a CDC sample of West Nile virus to compare with it.
</P>
<P>
   The mixture formed a gel and an electric current was run through
it. Then it was injected with an ethidium bromide stain. The team
of researchers watched the stained crow brain sample form into
white bands on the black sample of gel. When they saw the results,
the researchers ran downstairs to their boss's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran up to the lab to take a look at the photo they'd taken
of the sample,'' said Timperi.
</P>
<P>
   He saw the tell-tale white stripes on the gel dish and turned to
his staff: ``Let's get moving.''
</P>
<P>
   There were more tests to be done to confirm West Nile but
Timperi was sure _ even though the CDC would soon dispute him _
that he had found the virus. He started a chain of phone calls on
Tuesday that ended at the residence of Boston Mayor Thomas M.
Menino.
</P>
<P>
   But the series of events that brought the virus here is far
murkier. Scientists agree that the Queens outbreak was the virus's
entry into the United States but are unsure how it got from Queens
to Boston and from the Eastern to the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus found in Queens is genetically very similar
to the strain that turned up in Israel. There it killed an elderly
couple from Moscow who had immigrated to Tel Aviv. Also, a
34-year-old woman from England was sickened, but not fatally, in
the southern part of the country. The Israelis had not even noticed
the outbreak until the publicity around the Queens case spread.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the virus has surfaced several times in Israel since
1957. This will be the case in the United States for years to come,
scientists suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have four theories on how the virus traveled. The
theories illustrate the ways a virus can nation-hop.
</P>
<P>
   The first, and most likely, said scientists, is that the virus
boarded a commercial airline flight to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``An infected mosquito bit a guy in the Middle East, he hops on
a plane and lands in New York, where he is bitten by another
mosquito. That mosquito spreads it,'' said Spielman of Harvard.
``And the guy may have never known he was sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy air traffic has allowed viruses to spread much more
quickly, said scientists. They can now go to any country where they
can find warm temperatures and hosts to infect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air travel has decreased the size of the world effectively,''
said Richard Pollack, a public health entomologist at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   The second theory is that an infected bird from western Africa
was blown here. Most birds could not make the flight on their own,
but a cyclone or heavy winds could have dropped them here. In 1998,
researchers found that several million locusts had been blown from
West Africa to the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Thirdly, scientists theorize that an infected bird was brought,
perhaps illegally, to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York.
According to the US Customs Service, 2,770 birds entered the United
States that way in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The final theory returns to mosquitoes: a bunch of infected
insects somehow got transported here via airplane. This, too, is
possible. Researchers recently transported live mosquitoes across
the Atlantic Ocean by placing them in the wheel carriage of a 747
jet.
</P>
<P>
   Most scientists agree the West Nile virus's journey from New
York to Boston occurred in birds. Infected mosquitoes bite New York
birds, then the birds migrate to different parts of the East Coast,
where more mosquitoes bite them and spread the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Corvus brachyrhynchos, or American crow, has a migratory pattern
that takes it from New England, New York, and Canada in the summer
to Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Florida in the winter, according
to a recent study by researchers at the National Zoo in Washington.
Almost all of the New England routes pass near New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials were expecting West Nile to show up in a
city south of New York because birds are headed that way in late
summer. Last year one dead crow infected with the virus turned up
in Baltimore. But crows roam widely, and it is possible that an
infected crow simply flew here this summer from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Dr. Anita Barry, director of the Boston Health
Commission's communicable disease program, convened a meeting of
local officials at Timperi's lab. The CDC was disputing Timperi's
West Nile diagnosis but it was decided the public should be warned
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most important thing we wanted to do is get
accurate information out to people that the risk of getting the
virus is quite low and that you can make it even lower by taking
some precautions,'' said Barry.
</P>
<P>
   They went before TV cameras at 3 p.m. and announced the
discovery of the infected crow. The mayor repeated the announcement
several hours later. And in what became almost an afterthought,
hours after Menino's speech, the CDC called to tell Timperi he was
right.
</P>
<P>
   The drill was handy in one sense: Officials say they will
probably have to do it many times again.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Nile is living here now,'' said Green of the UMass
Medical School. ``And there's no way we can get rid of it.''

WHY IS THE OUTLOOK FOR INTERACTIVE TV SO FUZZY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first interactive TV show debuted back in the 1950s, long
before anyone had ever dreamed of the Internet. It was a cartoon
called ``Winky Dink,'' which allowed the boys and girls at home to
participate by drawing onto a sheet of plastic attached to the set.
The only problem was, you had to have the ``Winky Dink'' kit, which
cost50 cents; more than a few youngsters ended up coloring directly
on the screen, which didn't endear the show to Mom and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the concept died a fast death.
</P>
<P>
   But now, nearly a half-century later, interactive television is
the talk of the industry. This month, America Online is launching
AOLTV, a service that enables users to send instant messages and
conduct real-time chats on their television screens while watching
their favorite programs. Likewise, Microsoft has announced plans to
update its existing WebTV service to include such functions as
instant replay in addition to its combined television programming
and Internet access. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commercial possibilities alone are enough to make the folks
on Madison Avenue salivate. If interactive television fulfills its
potential, viewers could click on a character's sweater, for
instance, and purchase it online. Sports fans could shift the
camera angles of the game or order pizza without having to pick up
the phone. Viewers of an educational documentary about, say,
African elephants could put the program on hold while they surfed
the Net for more information on a particular game preserve. The
ultimate application would be video on demand, signaling the end of
``appointment television.''
</P>
<P>
   All those futuristic features aside, the consensus is this:
Interactive television is an interesting experiment, and it's going
to fail, at least in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Simply put, we like to watch. Period. Over the years,
viewers have developed a seductively passive relationship with the
small screen. They're couch potatoes for a reason; they sit, they
click, they veg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television was the ultimate relationship,'' says Robert
Thompson, professor of film and television at Syracuse University.
``It gave and gave and gave and asked nothing in return.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the folks behind WebTV admit that getting viewers to
abandon such pleasant passivity has been a difficult challenge.
Launched in 1996, the service was touted as the wave of the future;
in four years, just more than 1 million units have been sold,
hardly a critical mass. ``The average American household watches
television seven and a half hours a day, and it's a big challenge
to get them to change their habits,'' says Joe Poletto, vice
president of Microsoft's network media group. ``The biggest change
people have made is to move the refrigerator closer to the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, every experiment with interactivity since the early
days of ``Winky Dink'' has failed or fizzled. In the mid-'90s, Time
Warner Inc. launched something called the Full Service Network in
Orlando, Fla., an ambitious attempt to offer video on demand,
online shopping, and games via a set-top box. The service flopped.
Likewise, other attempts at so-called ``convergence'' of the
Internet and the television have been less than spectacular.
``Homicide'' offered a Web site that complemented the on-air story
line, a clever application but hardly groundbreaking. ``The Drew
Carey Show'' enhanced one episode with a ``live'' Webcast that was
little more than a marketing gimmick. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Trying, trying again &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So why does AOL think it can succeed where others have failed?
``You simply can't discount our 23 million members,'' says Carlos
Silva, vice president of AOL's product studio.
</P>
<P>
   The new television service, which is being offered in a handful
of pilot markets including Phoenix, Sacramento, and Baltimore (but
not Boston), is part of the company's ``AOL Anywhere'' strategy.
Some of the features are pretty nifty _ particularly for
15-year-olds accustomed to talking on the telephone while drooling
over the latest episode of ``Dawson's Creek.'' Viewers can reduce
the television program to a small window on one side of the screen
while sending e-mail, participating in online chats, or surfing the
Web. AOL members have access to their Internet mail accounts and
buddy lists on the television set. Unlike WebTV, which has a
keyboard with commands that are not all that intuitive, AOLTV is
easy to navigate, with simple pull-down menus that fade away when
they are not being used.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging, of course, is the big draw. But is it enough
to justify the cost? ``Can you imagine a teenager going to a parent
and saying, `I want you to pay $14.95 a month, plus $249 for the
box, so that I can tie up a phone line and chat during my favorite
television program'?'' asks Josh Bernoff, a senior analyst with the
Cambridge-based Forrester Research Inc. ``I don't think the
parent's response would be printable in a family newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for those prices, you ought to be offering more than
that cheerful fellow proclaiming, ``Welcome, you've got mail.''
Both AOLTV and WebTV have a paucity of original content. Granted,
WebTV users can play along with ``Jeopardy'' or ``Wheel of
Fortune,'' but that's pretty much the whole enchilada. And AOLTV
has its own unique channels, but there didn't seem to be much on
them, at least during a recent demonstration at the company's
headquarters in Dulles, Va. The service currently offers
personalized programming from the Weather Channel, enabling viewers
to check the forecast in their own backyard, but that same service
is already available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the chicken-and-egg dilemma. Why should the
networks and cable stations produce expensive interactive
programming for a service that has yet to capture an audience?
WebTV's Silva insists that deals are in the works. ``We are in the
midst of doing all of the brainstorming with our broadcast partners
and coming up with the ideas for the fall,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But think about it. One episode of a half-hour sitcom can cost
more than $10 million to produce; an enhanced version would cost
significantly more, for an uncertain payback and a small potential
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, AOL and Microsoft (along with most major cable
companies) are betting that interactive television will replace the
tube as we know it someday. The current offerings _ the Web sites
that do little more than sell coffee mugs and T-shirts _ are hardly
reinventing the medium, but then again, television originally
mimicked radio before it evolved into a new genre. ``When they
invented television, they literally filmed radio broadcasts, and it
was horrible,'' notes David Card, a senior analyst with Jupiter
Research in New York. ``Milton Berle invented the new form. Well,
we are waiting around for interactive television's Milton Berle.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Coming to a screen near you &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the almost universal criticism of current services, some
analysts predict that the wait won't be that long. According to
Forrester Research, consumers will be spending $9 billion to $10
billion on digital and interactive television services by 2004. And
Jupiter Communications predicts that 15 percent of all US
households will have access to some sort of interactive television
by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But just what form that interactive television will take is
still uncertain; it will probably be some hybrid that combines
video on demand with selective Internet access as well as the same
kind of passive programming available today. ``There is going to be
a middle ground between the futuristic utopia and the reality of
what people want from their leisure time,'' says Thompson. ``I
don't want to be a Luddite and say we're all going to sit around
and watch reruns of `Mr. Ed.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, who is going to fork out the money to be the
guinea pigs for Microsoft, AOL, and the cable companies? To begin,
there are the gadget geeks, the early adopters who simply have to
have every new electronics device that comes on the market. The
irony with AOLTV, though, is that the service is designed for the
company's middle-of-the-road users; it's not sophisticated enough
to satisfy the folks who now own better global positioning systems
than the federal government does.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company has a vested interest in improving
the product. When its planned merger with Time Warner goes through,
the communications conglomerate will own the pipes that bring both
the Internet and cable television into millions of households. It
makes sense for the two services to merge.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the folks at AOL are crowing about a feature called
``You've Got Pictures,'' which allows users to run a personal slide
show on their television set. That hardly qualifies as a
revolutionary innovation, and it sure isn't worth $14.95 a month
for existing AOL members (or $24.95 a month for nonmembers).
</P>
<P>
   Back in the day, low-tech interactive programs such as ``Winky
Dink'' had a simple set of challenges; the producers simply had to
get the kids to buy the kits. Today, AOL and other companies have
to overcome long-entrenched beliefs about the medium itself. At the
same time, AOL has a distinct advantage that cannot be ignored _
its enormous user base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Videophones were tough because you had to buy two,'' says
Silva. ``If you only bought one, there was no one to talk to. But
if we sell one AOLTV box, there are 23 million people to talk to. I
can't stress that enough.''

GOING AFTER GRANDPARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa. _ As it turns out, Al Gore is a tad on the
old side of typical.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is going to be a lot less typical.
</P>
<P>
   As a grandparent, that is _ as dynamic a segment of American
society as you can find these rapidly changing days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The typical way of thinking about grandparents is by age, and
it is upside-down wrong,'' says Steve Barsh, at 35 the CEO of the
most highly regarded of the new Web businesses (iGrandparents.com)
devoted to the their concerns. ``The truth is that this is a new
life stage for maturing baby boomers who are in their prime, who
travel more, are more wealthy, healthier, and are going to live
longer than their own grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   As the grossly scripted nominating convention phase of the
presidential campaign begins, the more revealing glimpses of this
election are of action away from the podiums: the rules and
platform committees, the hype and partisanship of issue pandering.
</P>
<P>
   To each campaign, the mention of age brings out instinctive
responses about Social Security benefits, long-term care, medicare,
and nursing homes. Call it Viagra politics. But new thinking
focuses elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the average age at which Americans become
grandparents turns out to be 47, not exactly Geezerhood. That's
five or so years younger than Gore was when daughter Karenna made
him and his wife, Tipper, grandparents last year. With his twin
girls barely out of high school, George and Laura Bush will be
waiting a lot longer than most Americans do. Today's
demographically typical grandparent is just 62 years old.
</P>
<P>
   With their nearly paid-off homes and rising investment
portfolios, grandparents already hold nearly half the country's
household wealth, a chunk that is going to explode to about 60
percent during this decade. Right now, grandparents are spending
$30 billion a year on their grandchildren; during this decade, that
number should explode above $100 billion, growing at twice the
anticipated rate of overall economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   This is about far more than toys and savings bonds.
Increasingly, grandparents are the most important source of
financial aid for two almost out-of-reach expenses for their own
kids' families: getting in the front door of a first home and
financing higher education. On top of that, more than 6 million
kids are being raised solely by their grandparents. And the roughly
one-third of all grandparents who live in the same metropolitan
area with their grandkids are likely to be an important source of
child care.
</P>
<P>
   The company Barsh is running from this middle-class suburb a
dozen miles removed from the GOP convention in Philadelphia is way
ahead of the politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see ourselves as driving the interactivity between
grandparents and grandkids, monetizing it,'' he says in New
Economy-speak. ``We want to be a one-stop shop for this
relationship, as grandparents not only play but seek a bigger role
in their grandchildren's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the company's founders, Lawrence Chimerine, puts it,
the two most important things to know about grandparents is that
they are not old and that they are passionate about the welfare of
their grandchildren. If the politicians in both parties are
inclined to think Social Security first, Chimerine knows that a
grandparent is as likely to be concerned with the quality of the
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Chimerine is well known in the business world as one of the
country's leading economists. But, as he puts it, he's also a
60-year-old delighted to have 1.3 grandchildren. His company was
founded to aggregate grandparents around something better than junk
news and mindless chat.
</P>
<P>
   The first venture capital placement was just completed. There is
already revenue from advertising and partnering _ mutual fund
empires and credit card companies. The e-business starts next
month.
</P>
<P>
   As run by Barsh, iGrandparents is acutely conscious of
post-Nasdaq crash, post-shakeout reality. If the precrash obscenity
was gazillions for meaningless, 30-second spots on the Super Bowl,
postcrash means carefully building a customer base that actually
makes money, though membership is free.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what they see is the liberating effect of prosperity, a
key element of Bush Think. Confidence in the economy give many
people the time and the money to worry about other things: the
culture, role models, their grandkids' school and living
environments. And wealth brings issues into play that may enable
Bush to break off chunks of older voters concerned about estate
taxes and other high-end taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The natural landscape favoring the ``out'' party competing for
an open White House at this early point favors Bush among the
three-quarters of all Americans over 50 who are grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   That reflects a growing group that complains the business here
is ignoring them.
</P>
<P>
   They're called great-grandparents.

GOP HOPING TO SPOTLIGHT PARTY DIVERSITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB RAY SANDERS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Back in the days when television was broadcast
mostly in black and white, the National Broadcasting Co. created a
stylized peacock to remind viewers that it had more color than any
other network.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the GOP will begin displaying its own peacock image,
hoping to prove that it, too, can present programs ``in living
color.'' After Thursday, Republicans hope to be known as the ``full
color'' party.
</P>
<P>
   At least from the stage of the Republican National Convention _
and, of course, in front of prime-time TV audiences _ there will be
more color than I can ever remember in the GOP. The party will
parade its high-profile minorities across the huge platform for the
next four days to reinforce Gov. George W. Bush's message of
inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to judge it only from what you will see on the TV
screen this week, you might think the Republican Party has spent
the whole year in a tanning salon, attending diversity workshops
and spending a lot of time in sensitivity sessions.
</P>
<P>
   With NBC, there was truth in advertising; it was the color
leader in television 35 to 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP, some people are joking that there will be more
black and brown people on the convention stage than there will be
in the entire audience at First Union Center, for still more than
90 percent of the 4,132 delegates and alternates is white.
</P>
<P>
   Among 116 of the 124 Republican delegates from Texas, The
Associated Press reports that 8 percent are Hispanic, 2 percent
black, 1 percent mixed race and 1 percent Asian. So although the
Anglo population constitutes only 55 percent of the Lone Star State
(and is predicted to be less than 50 percent by 2008), whites make
up 88 percent of the Republican delegation from the state.
</P>
<P>
   The ``presentation of the colors'' will take on fresh meaning
during this convention. You will see all those Republican people of
color you know, and many whom you've never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Colin Powell, who's being talked about as secretary
of state in a Bush administration, will be on display, as well as
the highest-ranking Hispanic state officeholder in Texas, Railroad
Commissioner Tony Garza. The latter was one of Bush's first
appointments, being named Texas' secretary of state during the
governor's first term in office.
</P>
<P>
   Garza and Dallas native Alphonso Jackson, a black businessman
and longtime Republican who's the former head of the Dallas Housing
Authority, have been named assistant secretaries of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Also featured in high-profile spots will be Condoleezza Rice, an
African-American who is one of Bush's foreign policy advisers, and
U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, perhaps the Republicans'
fastest-rising (if not brightest) African-American stars.
</P>
<P>
   There will be other Hispanics and blacks _ ``regular folks''
such as a teacher, businessman, community worker _ who will get to
tell their stories before the convention crowd and the national TV
audience.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, and especially the credit of Bush, this
Republican convention will not look like those from the past, and
that's exactly what the governor wants.
</P>
<P>
   As technicians and performers went through rehearsals yesterday,
it was also evident that there will be a different feel to this
one.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from what I heard of the convention orchestra, and a
run-through with the Philadelphia Boys Choir, even the music will
be diverse. I heard a little funk. Someone was rehearsing a Stevie
Wonder song, and the boys choir added a touch of African rhythm
with a rendition of ``Circle of Life'' from the movie ``The Lion
King.''

A DETROIT VOICE TO RIVAL PARKER, AND A PLOT TO MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN W. WINKS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many writers who have tried to capture the patterns of
speech that make so many readers admire Raymond Chandler. By far
the most successful has been Robert B. Parker. In turn, Parker has
had many imitators. There may have been a time when Loren D.
Estleman began by tracing the hands of Chandler and Parker on
sheets of paper and putting them up on his refrigerator, but long
since he has become a powerful, compassionate voice of his own. ``A
Smile on the Face of the Tiger'' (Mysterious Press, $24.95) may
well be his best book _ which is saying something, since it is his
14th Amos Walker novel and he has written 30 other books as well,
including six ``Detroit novels'' that unfold the history of that
weird and often unhappy city, a city Estleman clearly loves from
time to time. ``Smile'' is also part of the Detroit story, for it
turns on a book about the 1943 race riot.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, a private eye with a sharp tongue and a quick wit, is
hired to locate the author of a tawdry paperback novel written many
years before. Finding the writer proves surprisingly difficult, and
Walker meets the usual cast of characters who show up in a search
story, though Estleman makes them far more interesting than most
writers do. The novel becomes an act of homage to all those
paperback-original crime novels, from Fawcett and Pocket Books and
Dell and Signet, that launched so many writers and even more
readers. It ends up a nice illustration of how fact and fiction
become confused, and I recommend it all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Muller does not write quite as well as Estleman does, but
she plots beautifully, and having grown up near Detroit, she has
some of the Motor City's grit. ``Listen to the Silence''
(Mysterious Press, $23.95), though, is set in various locales well
to the west. Her series figure, Sharon McCone, learns when her
father dies that he has left some legal papers concerning the
adoption of a Baby Girl Smith, who is to be known as Sharon McCone.
Shocked, she sets out to learn about her past, and the road is
hard, especially when it becomes clear that few want her to solve
her own mystery. Several writers have turned to the search for
self-knowledge to gird up mystery novels recently, and Muller
handles this theme with a sure hand, with nice little vignettes of
Missoula, Mont., Boise, Ida., and other fast-growing cities of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Samuel also tells a good story, but his prose is
remarkably wooden. In ``Rock, Paper, Scissors'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
$25), we meet Hank Savage, who ``strode into the office, his dark
eyes scouring the room for any objective cause for his boss's
aberrant behavior. Standing six feet, three inches tall, and
weighing just under 210 pounds, his rock-hard frame carried less
than 8 percent body fat.'' Perhaps I'm just jealous, but I find a
little of this goes a long way. The story, however, is as
intriguing as it is improbable: The US secretary of state organizes
the kidnapping of the pregnant daughter of a tycoon in order to
force the tycoon into giving up a plot to kill Saddam Hussein. The
only person who can stop these haywire machinations is Sarah
Peterson of the Secret Service, who is assigned to guard the
secretary and who was traumatized by the murder of her father
before her eyes when she was 3. This is the kind of thing one likes
if this is the kind of thing one likes, as someone once said.
</P>
<P>
   Normally Gerald Seymour would be a hard-nosed antidote to such
nonsense, but ``A Line in the Sand'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25) is
less than the best work from the author of so good a book as
``Harry's Game.'' Still, Seymour is always a compelling writer, and
this often sad tale of how Frank Perry spied for the British
government and betrayed his Iranian colleagues, only to be turned
adrift by those who had suborned him, moves steadily toward the
kind of shocking conclusion one has learned to expect. A
professional assassin is hunting for Perry, who is moved to a small
Suffolk coastal town where almost everyone turns upon him when they
realize he has brought danger to them. Perry is not very likable,
but Seymour makes us care for him and his family nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Paul Lindsay's ``The Fuehrer's Reserve'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $25) provides a rousing page-turner that makes sense. The
``reserve'' of the title is the artwork amassed by Adolf Hitler and
Hermann Goering. Taz Fallon of the FBI is at work on a kidnapping
when he is drawn into the search for this cache of art treasures,
which are going to be used to finance a band of neo-Nazis. The
prose crackles, as the saying goes, and Lindsay brings us happily
back to the sharp lines of Estleman, reminding us just how
enjoyable such popular fiction can be in the hands of someone who
knows the language well.

CRY `BLOODY MURDER': FIGHTING BACK TO SAVE YOUR LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a nagging fear of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   The knife-wielding thug who leaps into your car at a light.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-toting hoodlum who steps from the shadows on a darkened
street.
</P>
<P>
   The wild-eyed psychopath who charges into a fast-food restaurant
brandishing an assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Your life may depend on how you react in a few short seconds.
What do you do?
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely as the average person is to face such peril, that's
still a question worth contemplating as the Massachusetts homicide
rate, though low, edges higher.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter made vivid by recent abductions and murders in the
region, including a carjacking in Providence that ended in the
slaying of Jason Burgeson, 20, of Lakeville and Amy Shute, 21, of
Coventry, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it'sis even worth a family discussion in a summer marked
by the conviction of a Falmouth man for the July 1999 murder of
27-year-old Melissa Gosule of Boston, who had been stranded by a
breakdown, growing fear about the fate of 16-year-old lifeguard
Molly Ann Bish of Warren, who disappeared on June 27, and an
attempted hijacking Friday at New York's Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, police tended to counsel crime victims to stay
calm, to be compliant, to accede to the demands of the criminal, in
the hope that they would be released unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   These days, law enforcement professionals shy away from giving
concrete advice. ``There is no hard and fast rule,'' says William
Bratton, former New York City police commissioner and now a private
consultant. ``It really is situational.''
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent Chris Whitcomb, of the FBI's Critical Incident
Response Group, acknowledges the bureau's reluctance to give a
specific answer. ``Every situation is different,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But a former San Diego SWAT team mission leader and ex-Marine is
now rushing in where the FBI fears to tread. And his advice is
drawing attention.
</P>
<P>
   The situations may be different, says Sanford Strong, but the
rules should be clear: ``The bottom line is that when men and women
are faced with a violent crime or terrorists taking hostages, they
must act immediately, when control over them by deranged minds is
at its least. They must be able to break through paralyzing fear
and concentrate on survival decisions they have previously made.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong, whose views have been featured on ``Good Morning
America'' and ``The Today Show,'' has taught his techniques to
business executives and their families in 18 countries. He minces
no words about one key mental hurdle a person must clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to get injured,'' says Strong. ``Accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   A failure to accept that possibility makes people accede to
demands that put their lives at progressively greater danger as
criminals consolidate their control over them.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Strong isn't advocating resisting a holdup.
Surrender your belongings as fast as you can, he counsels. But in
circumstances where a criminal tries to make you his captive, you
must react rapidly and forcefully, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Some Strong advice:
</P>
<P>
   In a hostage situation, make a break for freedom even if that
means crashing through a window and potentially drawing gunfire.
(There, passengers who leapt to their feet and rushed off a
National Airlines jet at the sight of a gunman in Friday's abortive
hijacking had the right idea.)
</P>
<P>
   If someone invades your car and orders you to drive, flee the
vehicle if you can; if you can't, crash the car into a parked
vehicle, a telephone poll, a hydrant or a dumpster, even if your
children are inside.
</P>
<P>
   If more than one carjacker is involved and one has the wheel,
try to force a crash by attacking the driver's face, says Strong,
who taught survival tactics to officers during almost 20 years with
the San Diego Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The more quickly one reacts, the better his or her chances of
survival, Strong says. But how to fight through the shock and
terror that often leaves victims paralyzed with fear when violent
crime occurs?
</P>
<P>
   The best way is to have prepared yourself in advance, says
Strong, who recommends a simple mental exercise: When reading or
watching any crime story, take a moment to ask what the victim
might have done, early on, to escape. Did she get into a car when
she might have fled? Did he let fear freeze him into inaction when
he might have struggled? Obey a command to be silent instead of
screaming?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a situation where a woman was abducted at
gunpoint, stuffed in a car, driven out to a remote place, and raped
and murdered, if you take one thing from that, it is probably that
her biggest mistake was in the first few seconds, when she should
have run,'' Strong says.
</P>
<P>
   Which underscores one of his strongest imperatives: You must not
let yourself be moved from the place of confrontation, which he
calls ``crime scene number one,'' to a more remote location, which
he labels ``crime scene number two.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if the abductor has a gun or knife and threatens to
kill you if you don't obey? Strong has a disturbing, but logical,
reply: If your attacker is willing to kill you at that moment, in a
public place, what will he do later, once he has moved you to a
more secluded spot?
</P>
<P>
   Strong's is controversial counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Other crime specialists say a victim should assess a given
situation and decide for himself what course _ resistance or
compliance _ offers the greatest likelihood of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, while people would like a rule of thumb about
how to react when confronted, rules of thumb are relatively
worthless,'' says James Alan Fox, Lipman professor of criminal
justice at Northeastern University. ``You basically have to follow
your instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   In hostage situations, time is usually on the side of the
captives, says former Boston Police Commissioner Francis ``Mickey''
Roache, now a Boston city councilor. ``If we can get a phone in and
communicate (with the hostage-takers), we can start a discussion,''
Roache says. ``I have a hard time seeing why we should deviate from
what has been a successful approach.''
</P>
<P>
   As for rape, Steven McCarthy, manager of the Violent Criminal
Apprehension Program for the Massachusetts State Police, says
Strong's advice may well deter one type of rapist, who often back
off in the face of resistance, but might incite two other types,
categorized as ``anger excitation'' and ``sadistic'' rapists, to
even greater physical violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many rapes, to resist would be the correct response, but
the problem is there are different types of rapists,'' says
McCarthy. ``That is why people who are knowledgeable are very
hesitant about giving blanket advice, because how are you going to
educate the lay person about how to assess what type of offender
they are dealing with and do an accurate assessment of their own
capabilities?''
</P>
<P>
   To that criticism, Strong replies that, though all crimes are
different in some ways, they are alike enough in key aspects to
assert that your best chance of surviving comes if you act
immediately to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Second, though making a situational judgment sounds goods, it is
unrealistic to expect a victim to assess his prospects and
opportunities effectively while a crime is occurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assessment at the time a crime is going down is too late,''
Strong declares flatly. ``The person without decisions made ahead
of time will be paralyzed with fear. He will freeze up.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong also cites a massive 1985 study which, he says, showed
that in 96 percent of the 1.6 million rape cases examined, the
types of injuries were essentially the same whether a woman
resisted the rapist or not. Resisting increased the level of injury
by only 2 percent, Strong says.
</P>
<P>
   If there are those who question Strong's philosophy, others
basically endorse it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole '70s mindset we used to hear about `don't ever
fight' and `if he wants to rape you, just acquiesce,' is bull,''
says Reed Hillman, former head of the Massachusetts State Police.
``Fight, fight, fight is my philosophy. Fight as long as you can,
scream as long as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong says the ultimate defense of his survival techniques is
this: He is teaching people to respond the way police officers are
trained to react.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a cop to make life-or-death decisions
like a cop. You just have to think like one.''

EGYPTAIR CRASH VICTIM'S FAMILIES CLING TO EACH OTHER

<P>
   Tom Billings received his mother's orthotic shoe inserts in the
mail last month.
</P>
<P>
   He was thankful.
</P>
<P>
   In another time, he would have tossed them in the closet. But
nine months after his mother died in the crash of EgyptAir flight
990, which plunged into the sea off Nantucket, the items have made
the tragedy all too real.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a crash like this, your people disappear in thin air,''
said the Boston lawyer. ``I think all of us have been yearning for
a connection to the crash. This is the closest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In homes across the United States, families of the 129 Americans
who perished among the 217 people on the flight have received
shredded pieces of luggage, coins, wallets, baby's shoes _
fragments of lives, smelling of the sea and jet fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Their loved ones' belongings come as the result of an
association formed by the families. The group, based in
Massachusetts, has successfully fought for the return of the
passengers' personal effects, the collection of DNA samples to help
identify bodies, and the unsealing of data from the federal
investigation of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   But as the group plans a memorial service in Newport, R.I. Oct.
31 and braces for the upcoming release of a government report on
the crash, they say one thing is missing: A sense of alliance with
the relatives of 62 victims in Egypt suffering the same losses.
</P>
<P>
   This was, after all, a tragedy that once united people of
different cultures in their suffering, as American Muslims rushed
to comfort family members of Egyptian victims and an Egyptian
airline sought to offer assistance to grieving Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But ongoing speculation over the cause of the crash seems to
have thwarted efforts to unite the victims' families. Some
Egyptians say the US investigators have rushed to blame an
allegedly suicidal Egyptian copilot. Some Americans say that
EgyptAir has treated victims from the two countries differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that the families are divided they are not
effective, and could be played off against one another,'' said Jim
Brokaw, the association's president. ``They don't speak as one
voice, so they are not listened to.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw, of Chicago, and his siblings in Vermont lost their
stepmother and father in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Samir El Shanawany, general manager of EgyptAir's North American
operations, denied that the airline is trying to keep the two
groups apart. El Shanawany said the company has created a toll-free
telephone number for the families and recently established a
confidential Web site so that all survivors, American or Egyptian,
could voice their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But since the crash, Egyptian officials have vehemently rejected
findings from US investigators indicating that the Boeing 767 was
deliberately brought down by copilot Gameel el-Batouty. This month,
a book by an Egyptian journalist suggests the flight was either
sabotaged by a bomb or simply experienced mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   James Hall, chairman of the US National Transporation Safety
Board, told Congress that the movement of the plane prior to the
crash was ``consistent with a deliberate action on the part of one
of the crew members.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brokaw and other family members say the dispute over what
happened in the plane's final flight has left them unable to grieve
with the Egyptians. Family members said EgyptAir has consistently
refused to give them names or telephone numbers of Egyptian
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know those people have to be going through the same thing
we are,'' said Shari Gemmil of Washington, D.C., who lost her
mother and stepfather in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Gemmil said the two Web sites that have been set up for the
families have allowed Americans and Canadians to share the healing
process, as well as their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, said Brokaw, some of the Egyptian families are
discovering the site through word of mouth and beginning to contact
the Americans on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They were apparently unaware that American families had already
banded together to express their concerns about the identification
of bodies, the pace of the investigation, and other matters.
Brokaw, as president, met with the ambassador of Egypt, as well as
EgyptAir officials, before noticing some progress.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Egyptian officials have agreed to send four people
from each family to attend the memorial service in Newport. And, by
last winter, American families that had initially complained about
the pace of identifying remains were sending back DNA samples to
the Rhode Island's medical examiner's office. Egyptian families, by
contrast, have only recently begun to submit samples, said Brokaw.
</P>
<P>
   An EgyptAir official blamed the delay on the United States:
``Regretfully, the US government attempts to provide sampling kits
from the Egyptians failed because the laboratory contracted by the
US government went out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, American family members say they are also concerned that
EgyptAir hasn't made advance payments in equal amounts to settle
claims by families, as did Swissair, American Airlines, and Alaska
Airlines after recent crashes. Instead, Brokaw said, the airline
has made advances only to those who can show proof of need.
</P>
<P>
   ``This unnecessarily complicates and prolongs the process of
getting financial help to those in need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw and Billings said they believe Egyptian-born families now
in the United States are experiencing the most hardships. In one
case, said Brokaw, an Egyptian woman living in Arizona discovered
that she couldn't afford to stay in the United States after her
husband died in the crash. She had to return to Egypt. In another
case, an Egyptian-born man in California had to take in his
grandchildren after his daughter died.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carlsen, an attorney handling EgyptAir's insurance
underwriters, said nearly all of the families in Egypt have settled
with the airline. EgyptAir officials said they have provided
advance payments of as much as $40,000 to some family members.
</P>
<P>
   Carlsen also said they are beginning to talk to American and
Canadian families, whose relatives made up most of the passengers
on the plane, about their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Gemmil said that as of now, she is going to put all her energy
in planning the memorial service. Others say they are hoping to
receive more information about their relatives' remains.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a few remains have been found intact. Those remains
that cannot be identified will be placed in a cemetery in Newport.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw's sister _ Fran Brokaw of Stafford, Vt., received her
father's battered suitcase in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked just like a truck ran over it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw said it was hard to look at the little brown carry-on
suitcase that her father took everywhere with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing it and holding it made it all real,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors have decided not to accept any personal effects
at all, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she said, ``in some ways it's helpful to be able to
hold it and know it was with him.''

TRACKING AN IRISH PILGRIMAGE TO A FRENCH SHIRTMAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ For much of the last century, the Irish have flocked to
France, as much for religious reasons as for the foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   Busloads of Irish descend regularly on Lourdes, a market town
tucked into the southwestern corner of France where, in 1858, a
14-year-old girl named Bernadette Soubirous said she saw an
apparition of the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of 18 visions reported by the French peasant
girl. Her life was popularized by Hollywood in ``Song of
Bernadette,'' and she was made a saint in 1933, 54 years after her
death.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, Lourdes has attracted millions of
pilgrims, a disproportionate share of them Irish, who until recent
years were among the most fervent, devout Catholics of Europe. In
1990, Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich, the beloved leader of the Catholic
Church in Ireland, suffered a heart attack and died in Lourdes
while leading a pilgrimage there.
</P>
<P>
   But Ireland has changed, changed utterly, as William Butler
Yeats once put it. The influence of the church has waned over the
past decade, partly because of scandals involving pedophile
priests, and, some say, because of Ireland's booming economy.
Attendance at Mass has fallen dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   As Ireland has become more secular, it seems only natural that
the Irish have a new, secular shrine in France: the Charvet shirt
boutique just off the Place Vendome, one of the richest, most
exclusive, commercial areas of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, when a Dublin tribunal investigating widespread
political corruption found that Ireland's former prime minister,
Charles J. Haughey, had used $50,000 he had solicited from rich
businessmen to buy shirts at one of the most exclusive shirtmakers
in the world, Irish people have flocked to Charvet the way they
used to flock to Lourdes.
</P>
<P>
   They pose for photographs outside the venerable shop, and
sometimes venture inside to gawk at the crystal chandeliers, the
oak paneling, the Oriental rugs and the cuff links in bowls
scattered around the shop.
</P>
<P>
   And they pose indelicate questions about their former prime
minister. Their questions are met, like this reporter's were, with
stony silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not talk about that,'' an elegantly dressed salesman
said the other day. ``Please, will you leave?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least he said please.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish like nothing better than a good laugh, and they've
been yucking it up at Charvet. While many patrons of Charvet retire
to the nearby Ritz Hotel after a visit to the shop, many Irish
usually go to Kitty O'Shea's pub, 100 yards down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Loughney, the pub's owner, has an impish sense of humor.
From a purely selfish point of view, he thanks his lucky stars for
the proximity of his pub to the shirt shop, which was the
beneficiary of blank checks given to Haughey by Ireland's current
prime minister, Bertie Ahern, who was the financial manager of the
Fianna Fail party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can stand outside on the sidewalk, have a nice quiet pint,
and look down the street and see where our tax money was going,''
said Loughney, who casts a cold eye on politicians like Haughey.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Nelson, the pub's manager, said they recently hosted 20
nurses from Cork who won a free trip to Paris as part of a radio
competition. ``They weren't in here five minutes before they ran
down the street to Charvet,'' she said. ``They were taking photos,
having a great laugh for themselves. It was quite a scene.''
</P>
<P>
   While the store won't come right out and say it, Charvet's
discreet sales staff is none too pleased about the Irish pilgrims.
But, then, Charvet is one of those Parisian specialty shops where
customers will brave even a group of giggling nurses from Cork to
buy some of the world's most prestigious shirts.
</P>
<P>
   And it is one of those shops where, if you have to ask the
price, you can't afford it. When asked about one of the striped
cotton dress shirts made from luxurious Egyptian cotton, a salesman
politely responded, ``That is about 200 of your American dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Haughey's cost even more, because they were custom made, and he
had his initials, CJH, embroidered on the left breast pocket. But
trying to get the salespeople to cough up what Haughey's shirts
cost is like asking the IRS for an undeserved refund.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Kitty O'Shea's, meanwhile, Wayne Mills was pulling pints
of Guinness behind the bar, chuckling about the irony of moving
here from Arklow, County Wicklow, only to be closer to the heart of
his nation's corruption investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One of his customers, Padraig Wilson, a young Dubliner, grew
thoughtful as he nodded toward Mills for another pint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madonna's about to have another baby,'' Wilson mused about the
very pregnant pop singer. ``She named the first one Lourdes. Maybe
she'll name this one Charvet.''

REAL PICNIC ROSTER: KIDS, DOG, BUGS, DIRT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite what you may read in certain magazines, a real picnic
doesn't involve a damask tablecloth and a wicker picnic basket from
Restoration Hardware.
</P>
<P>
   There is no unobstrusive little Muscadet nor any refreshing
young Beaujolais, surprisingly chilled, at a real picnic. Nor will
you find any dainty watercress tea sandwiches. And it goes without
saying that a real picnic owes nothing to olive tapenade, sun-dried
tomatoes, or goat cheese.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see beautiful people at a real picnic, not, at least,
the kind of beautiful people who inhabit ads in glossy magazines.
Real people go to real picnics.
</P>
<P>
   A real picnic has certain essential elements, as follows.
</P>
<P>
   Weather. The best weather for a real picnic is what TV weather
forecasters call ``a chance of showers.'' There is no chance
involved at all. It will rain at some point, perhaps several
points, providing a measure of meteorological uncertainty crucial
to the success of a real picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Location. A real picnic is never set on the sweeping lawn of a
mansion overlooking the sea. Neither does it take place in an
officially designated picnic spot with wooden tables, barbecue
grills, and bathroom facilities. The ideal spot for a real picnic
is within sight of a ``No Trespassing'' sign. This lends the picnic
an aura of clandestine excitement. A view is nice for a real
picnic, but not necessary. Grass adds a pleasant touch. And low
shrubbery comes in handy.
</P>
<P>
   Children. A real picnic involves several children, one or two of
whom will wander off somewhere and get lost, briefly, thereby
throwing everybody into a panic and heightening the confusion that
is the hallmark of a successful real picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Dog. Every real picnic should have at least one dog, to help
find wandering children, to chase squirrels, to bark frequently for
no apparent reason, to eat leftovers and get sick on the ride home.
</P>
<P>
   Blanket. A real picnic is never spread upon a linen or even a
cotton tablecloth but on an ancient khaki Army blanket that smells
vaguely of mothballs or mildew, or both. The blanket's rough
texture should be enhanced with years of embedded beach sand, some
of which will work loose during the picnic and find its way into
the food.
</P>
<P>
   Car. The car that provides transportation to a real picnic may
be old or new, as long as it has something seriously wrong with it.
A real picnic is no fun without the constant, nagging fear that the
car will break down on the trip home.
</P>
<P>
   Insects. No real picnic is complete without plenty of insect
repellent and lots of anxious talk about dangerous bugs _ killer
bees, deer ticks, army ants, Formosan termites, West Nile
virus-bearing mosquitoes, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Food. The success of a real picnic is in direct proportion to
the number of calories consumed. Fried chicken. Potato salad.
Deviled eggs. A big cake with gooey frosting that gets stuck in the
children's hair. Real picnic food is always eaten with the hands.
And it's never packed in a special basket or hamper, but piled into
brown paper bags. At the end of the day real picnickers should be
able to throw away everything but the children, the dog, and the
blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Drinks. Homemade lemonade, preferably warm, is the official
drink of the real picnic. If anyone insists on cold lemonade, don't
use an insulated container that needs to be washed later. Buy a bag
or two of ice and let it melt in the back seat of the car so
someone can sit in the wet spot and complain all the way home.

SUCCESS SVENGALI ANTHONY ROBBINS PREACHES SELF-EMPOWERMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lantern jaw to dumbbell shoulders, he's chiseled like a
model. He emotes with weepy personal anecdotes and uplifting
homilies. And fans adore him for a nearly transcendent intensity
that bridges salesmanship and salvation.
</P>
<P>
   He's Anthony Robbins, late-night infomercial king, maven of
motivational speaking, celebrity of the self-help book industry,
and when he strides onstage it takes little more than the sparkle
of his toothy smile to wow the crowd of 12,000. Accompanied by
thumping rap music and scantily clad dancers, his 6-foot-7-inch
frame encased in a sleek black suit and gold tie, he winks and
blows kisses in an event that feels like a cross between arock
concert and a religious awakening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wake up! Wake up!'' he shouts through a microphone fixed to
his boxy head. ``You're the most passionate person you know, the
most aerobic, the most sexy. . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how trite or treacly his prescriptions for lifelong
happiness, Robbins, 40, attracts crowds wherever he goes.
</P>
<P>
   The author of such seize-the-day tomes as ``Awaken the Giant
Within: How to Take Immediate Control of Your Mental, Emotional,
Physical and Financial Destiny!,'' Robbins has been on the
motivation circuit since age 18, pumping up everyone from Bill
Clinton to Andre Agassi with his live-with-passion mantra. In the
past 22 years, he claims to have ``coached'' more than 2 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in everything he says,'' says Steve Howe, 46, a
salesman, after massaging his boss's back on Robbins's cue. ``What
he says is just so true. He tells you, `You can do anything, as
long as you set your mind to it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While Robbins may seem to cast a spell on his audience, his
message is more corporate than cultlike, with slogans like
``Success without fulfillment is failure,'' ``The secret to living
is giving,'' and ``Cultivate an attitude of gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach can help people by instilling a measure of hope,
psychologists say, but could backfire with the weak-minded and
impressionable. ``The problem is in the overly simplistic
interpretation by the listener,'' says Sanford Portnoy, president
of the Massachusetts Psychological Association. ``The risk is it
won't work, and listeners will experience failure. Other people
also might overidentify with such figures, and they won't think
about how the philosophy applies to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As Robbins lumbers from one motivation session to another at the
FleetCenter, fans rush at him with requests for hugs and beg him to
pose for photos. Between orders to his publicist and bodyguard,
Robbins complies just before slipping into a back corridor.
</P>
<P>
   A skeptical reporter follows. ``Aren't you little more than a
modern-day quack, a guy hawking simplistic solutions to lifelong
problems?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, visibly rankled, yields to a little unscripted emotion
and dismisses the query as ``uneducated'' blather from ``some jerk
who never took a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he recycles an anecdote he's been telling for years, the
one about the film critic who feels free to pan a movie, though he
has never made one himself.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Robbins is particularly appalled that a writer
nearly kept him from seeing ``Gladiator.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes no energy to be a critic,'' he rails.
</P>
<P>
   And although the promotional literature for his conferences,
audiotapes, and books promises to ``empower anyone who attends with
the proven tools they need to achieve measurable and lasting
results in their lives,'' Robbins insists he merely offers hope and
prods people to find their own answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them what's possible and how to produce results,'' he
says over the din of dance music blaring in his dressing room. ``I
don't come from a place as an authority. I just try to be a
catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   But do those who come to be coached expect more from Robbins
than ``the seven-day emotional fitness challenge'' and axiomatic
antidotes, such as ``The Secret to Relationships Is the Power of
Proximity''? Do they seek the tools, say, to score a house like
Robbins's $5.8 million mansion in Southern California? Perhaps they
want the resilience Robbins touts in his own life story, a tale of
a teenager evicted from his home who never went to college yet
became a self-made millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   The task for Day 1 of his ``emotional fitness challenge'' is to
maximize ``hunger and drive.'' Wake up, Robbins says, and ask
yourself a few simple questions: ``What would it mean to feel a
compelling hunger and drive for my life? What does someone who is
driven believe about life? What does someone who is hungry and
driven look like?'' Remember, he stresses, to be in ``a peak
performance state as you fully associate to each emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, it all works for Robbins's fans.
</P>
<P>
   At motivation extravaganzas like ``Results2000'' earlier this
month in Boston, Robbins's devotees praise him for helping them
lose weight or quit smoking, recommit to relationships, or make
lots of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such an aura about him,'' says Vinnie Digiacomo, 30,
a video store manager. ``Everyone here just gets it. He pumps you
up and refreshes your batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just awesome,'' says Donna Link, 35, a saleswoman for a
financial-services company. ``He really inspired me to be a better
person. I'm just more positive and outgoing. Also, he's really
good-looking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His `outstanding philosophy' pushes people over the edge,''
says Elaine Johnson, 51, an e-commerce consultant. ``The more I
hear, the more I get fed, the more I can give to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason people buy his books and flock to his seminars,
Robbins says, is that he offers ``strategies'' to attain happiness.
He presents himself as the proof, lacing his pitch with anecdotes
of his pals, the country's top plastic surgeon and the millionaire
movie producer, and of his own boundless bliss.
</P>
<P>
   At 40, he's not having a midlife crisis, he assures his fans. In
fact, Robbins says, he's in the midst of a ``midlife celebration.''
But even if he were down, it's unlikely he'd let on. His chief
product is happiness, and the salesman cannot be somber.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be hard to believe,'' he tells a lunchtime crowd in
Boston, ``but I'm enjoying my life more than ever before.''

AMERICAN JEWS' PASSIONATE ENGAGEMENT WITH ISRAEL IS WANING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat left Washington empty-handed last
week, hoping to forestall violence in Israel now that they had
failed to make peace at Camp David. But the Mideast leaders had
succeeded in making thinkable the unthinkable: The status of
Jerusalem, long claimed by Israel as its eternal and indivisible
capital, is now in play.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that American Jewry didn't balk at the concept of
shared sovereignty over Jerusalem illustrates how far the community
has come in its thinking about Israel since the first round of
Middle East peace talks concluded successfully at Camp David in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   American Jews, weary after decades of Mideast strife, are
increasingly emotionally distant from Israel, and more focused on
problems facing their own community here in the United States. For
most American Jews, the dream of Zion has been realized, but the
dream of peace has not.
</P>
<P>
   But the collective shrug at the notion of negotiations over the
status of Jerusalem also is recognition that Israel today is
getting bigger and stronger economically and militarily, if not
geographically, while the American Jewish community is getting
weaker by virtue of demographics, and, some argue, assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's classic politics: You claim something is taboo, but then
it turns out to be not quite as taboo as you thought it was,'' says
Rabbi Irving ``Yitz'' Greenberg, president of the Jewish Life
Network, a New York foundation working to bolster American Jewish
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem has a central significance for Jews everywhere, but
nevertheless the reality is American Jews want peace for Israel,
and if Israelis say shared sovereignty in Jerusalem is the price of
peace, the only groups who will oppose it are the groups that
oppose the whole peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest round of peace talks comes as Israel, long the
symbolic center of Jewish life, emerges also as the demographic
heart of the Jewish world for the first time since the days of the
Bible. The Jewish population of Tel Aviv (about 2.4 million in
1996) has surpassed that of New York City (1.9 million), and within
the next generation, the Jewish population of Israel (4.6 million
in 1996) is expected for the first time to pass that of the United
States (5.7 million).
</P>
<P>
   The American Jewish community's extraordinarily close
relationship with Israel was forged first by the dream of Zionists
seeking a return to the storied land of milk and honey, then by
immigrants and Holocaust survivors who put their backs into the
creation of a Jewish state in 1948, and finally by alarm over the
security of Israel after wars in 1967 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   But today Israel is economically and militarily strong, while
the Jewish community in America is, at least demographically,
decreasing in influence. The Jewish percentage of the US population
has dropped from about 4 percent to about 2 percent, and is
expected to continue to fall, and although accurate statistics are
difficult to compile, some scholars believe that Muslims have
already eclipsed Jews as America's largest non-Christian minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're no longer patrons, we're partners, and that's a
different relationship,'' says Nancy K. Kaufman, executive director
of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston.
Kaufman frets that the many American Jews paid little attention to
the events at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest concern is not what people think about the peace
process, but that they didn't think anything at all,'' she says.
``The apathy has been developing for the last several years, and
it's of great concern. The complexity and the years of waiting and
wondering and the lack of understanding by a lot of people has just
created a disconnect in the relationship between American Jews and
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between American Jews and Israel began to lose
intensity in the early 1980s, as Israel's invasion of Lebanon
muddied the Middle East scenario for some American Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Jews, like everybody else, realize that Israel is no
longer a tiny beleaguered state, and certainly is not a third-world
country,'' says Jonathan D. Sarna, chairman of Near Eastern and
Judaic Studies at Brandeis University. ``And American Jews, like
lots of people, have become more aware of the Arab side of the
dispute, and where it once seemed to be a case of black and white,
with virtue on one side and hatred on the other, there has now come
about an understanding that there were wrongs committed on both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor influencing the relationship was the near panic
set off among American Jewish community leaders by a 1990 study
claiming that half of all American Jews are marrying non-Jews.
While the study has since been disputed, it nevertheless forced a
wholesale rethinking of American Jewish community priorities, and
led to the current boom in Jewish day schools, as well as adult
education programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first 20 years following the '67 war, Israel became
the banner, the symbol, and the central story of what bound Jews
together,'' says Barry Shrage, president of Combined Jewish
Philanthropies of Greater Boston. ``The Jewish community is now
attempting to balance that with the development of stronger
community life. It's not that we don't love Israel as much, but
Israel has become so strong, there may be less need.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrage's organization is at the vanguard of a movement by
American Jewish charitable agencies to shift their philanthropy
from Israel to the United States. In some places, as much as 70
percent of American Jewish philanthropy was once directed to
Israel; in Boston just 30 percent of contributions now goes
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Personal connections to Israel are not as strong as they once
were. Just 18 percent of American Jews now view visiting Israel as
essential. By some estimates, young Jewish Americans are less
likely to visit Israel than those from Australia, Great Britain, or
Mexico, according to Barry Chazan, a professor at Hebrew University
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   American philanthropists recently started a program called
Birthright Israel that provides free trips to Israel to Jewish
youngsters. The program is an effort to strengthen the connection
of American Jews with Judaism, as well as with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Those American Jews who do focus on Israel no longer speak with
one voice. There are doves and hawks and everything in between;
during this latest round of negotiations, one group of prominent
American Jewish leaders ran a newspaper ad critizing Barak's
posture; another group of leaders countered with one supporting the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the apathy and the division are a traditional
deference by American Jews to the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The silent majority of American Jews, even those with clear
cut political views, have the view that Israeli leaders are the
ones who make the decisions, and most American Jews are reluctant
to second guess judgments made by democratically elected Israeli
leaders,'' says Martin J. Raffel, chief operating officer of the
Jewish Council for Public Affairs. ``They see their role as
supporting a U.S. policy which strengthens Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   So if Israeli Jews are ready to talk about some kind of shared
administrative structure over Jerusalem, so are American Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as little as five or ten years ago, no Israeli prime
minister would have survived had they brought this issue as far as
Barak has,'' says Kenneth Bricker, spokesman for the American
Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   There are other factors at work too. Jerusalem is no longer
divided as it was prior to 1967, but it's not exactly united
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideological argument was that Jerusalem was united, but
the truth of the matter is, if you talk about a lot of parts of
East Jerusalem, the average Israeli does not know where they are
and is not prepared to fight a war over it,'' says Ilan Peleg, a
government professor at Lafayette College. ``Jerusalem is divided.
That's the reality on the ground, and that's what Barak is building
on. And people are so sick and tired of the whole conflict that
they're not going to insist on having an Arab neighborohood under
Israeli control.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's staunchest defenders say the Jewish community's
willingness to consider some kind of movement on Jerusalem is the
ultimate sign of strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is different than most other issues, because
Jerusalem makes its way every single day into the consciousness of
every Jew _ because Jerusalem has been the source of hopes and
dreames of every Jew since time immemorial,'' says Steven Grossman,
the former president of the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee is considering a run for governor of Massachusetts. ``But
it is a sign of maturity and a growing up process over the years to
realize that to have everything you ever articulated may stand in
the way of peace.''

</P>
<P>
   A hallowed rite of American politics ended last Tuesday. Every
few weeks for the last six years, reporters have speculated
hopefully about whether Gen. Colin Powell would deign to run for
president or vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Countless polls have confirmed the general's astounding
popularity_ only 7 percent negative! That's better than motherhood!
</P>
<P>
   His every refusal has been dissected for a loophole. (What
exactly does, ``My answer is irrevocably no'' mean, anyway?) Even
when it became obvious that George W. Bush would pick Dick Cheney,
Dan Rather was claiming that Bush and his father were still trying
to convince the general to grace the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   When he declined a presidential run in 1995, Powell declared
that running for office was ``a calling that I do not yet hear.''
Now it seems clear he never will.
</P>
<P>
   Powell has telegraphed that he would serve as Bush's secretary
of state, and he will almost certainly get the job if Dubya wins.
But electoral politics is not likely. The general will be 67 by the
next presidential election, too old for a first run. He has become
the Mario Cuomo of the GOP, the girl who always got away.
</P>
<P>
   So this is the moment to wonder what we missed. What kind of No.
1 or No. 2 would Powell have been?
</P>
<P>
   Powell's fairytale biography tends to overwhelm actual thinking
about him. His story is too perfect. The son of striving West
Indian immigrants, he grew up in the tough, polyglot South Bronx.
He was an aimless kid, but he found order and meaning in the Army.
He rode military service from Vietnam soldier to national security
adviser to chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Eventually, he
prosecuted the most successful war in U.S. history, then retired to
help at-risk kids.
</P>
<P>
   For many, Powell is confirmation of the American dream: A black
man from modest circumstances can do anything if he works hard
enough. He affirmed idealism about the U.S. military: It is the
meritocratic, colorblind institution it claims to be. And he is a
role model and champion of hard work, discipline, honesty, loyalty,
patriotism and good humor.
</P>
<P>
   But the retelling of his spotless life suppresses cool
consideration of the general's fitness for office.
</P>
<P>
   Powell would have been a funny kind of candidate. American
voters demand that their politicians be (or pretend to be)
mavericks. Every presidential candidate promises to shake things
up, claims to be impatient with the ways of Washington, and wants
to seize power back from the bureaucrats and return it to the
people.
</P>
<P>
   Generals have traditionally made compelling candidates because
they appear to be warriors who won't be deterred by Beltway
opposition. This is not Powell. Despite his military service and
apparent outsiderness, he has exactly the qualities Americans say
they don't want in a president. He is an organization man, fiercely
loyal to bureaucracies, happy with the status quo, at least as
comfortable taking orders as giving them.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's military career testifies to his skills as a
bureaucratic infighter. He had one year of real combat_ a nasty
stint as a Vietnam adviser_ but mostly he was a staff officer,
planning and advising superiors on strategy and logistics.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was great at getting along. In a 1968-69 tour of Vietnam,
he served as a staff officer in the division that committed the My
Lai massacre. He arrived in Vietnam after the massacre occurred but
before it was discovered. As Charles Lane chronicled in the New
Republic, Powell made no aggressive effort to investigate war
crimes when he was asked to look into them, and he brushed off a
soldier who had complained.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lane, Powell also kept his head down as a White
House fellow during Watergate. When Powell worked for Ronald
Reagan's National Security Council, he objected quietly to the
Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages deal but then helped Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger arrange the dubious transfer of
missiles to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Powell confirmed his
reputation for caution and bureaucratic chess-playing. He won
credit from goo-goos for cutting the Pentagon budget after the Cold
War. But military reformers were dismayed by his methods. He did
not significantly trim any of the four service arms. More
important, he made little effort to reorganize the Pentagon to
fight new, less conventional kinds of war.
</P>
<P>
   Powell also preached the Powell doctrine, his gospelstemming
from Vietnamthat American troops should never be committed to
battle without overwhelming force and overwhelming popular support.
This philosophy, designed to protect the U.S. military from
anything that could tarnish its reputation, arguably elevated
Pentagon interests over national ones.
</P>
<P>
   So when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, Powell opposed driving
him out, favoring sanctions instead. When war came, Powell pushed
to end it quickly before Saddam fell or the Republican Guard was
smashed. Powell, who voiced his objections privately, carried out
President Bush's orders superbly and ended up a hero.
</P>
<P>
   But Powell has never absorbed any blame for the U.S. decision
not to vanquish Saddam, nor for our failure to intervene in Bosnia,
another policy he pushed.
</P>
<P>
   In a Washington Post article, Robert Kagan recently contended
that Powell's reluctance to use force, discomfort with the U.S.
acting as a global cop, and general caution make him an iffy choice
for secretary of state. Under Powell, Kagan hints, the Department
of State might retrench into isolationism and inactivity just when
the United States must be more engaged in the world than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, Powell has devoted much of his time to America's
Promise, a group he founded to encourage volunteering that helps
kids. It too has been marked by his establishmentarian,
bureaucratic style. Powell, a superb recruiter, enlisted
corporations, nonprofits, and governments to commit resources to
children. (America's Promise pushes mentoring, safe places for
kids, and child health among its ``five promises.'')
</P>
<P>
   But despite scads of Powell-centered PR, it's not clear the
organization has achieved much. The New York Times, the newspaper
Youth Today, and philanthropy scholar Pablo Eisenberg have smacked
America's Promise for operating secretively, exaggerating
accomplishments and resisting objective assessments of its
programs. Corporations have failed to deliver on some of their
commitments. Those that have delivered have made their
contributions to big, establishment charities, rather than the
grass-roots ones that most help needy kids.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's history, in short, does not suggest that he would have
made a great president. That job requires an impatient leader who
likes to slice through red tape, not create it, and who wants to
shake up the government, not pacify it.
</P>
<P>
   But we have missed a superb vice president, someone who would
complain mildly in private but follow the president's orders in
public, someone who would protect the federal bureaucracy while
making it slightly more efficient, someone who wouldn't take risks,
someone who would stay out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Someone a lot like Al Gore.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By SARA KENNEDY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If competition breeds creativity, then the theme parks in and
around Orlando are a case in point. They have some of the most
imaginative ways for guests to spend their leisure time. Everything
from a roller coaster that shoots its human cargo from the starting
gate with all the subtlety of a missile launcher to a beautiful
carousel based on the art of Dr. Seuss greet visitors to Orlando
theme parks this summer.
 &HT;    Vacationers will also find an entirely new park, SeaWorld's
Discovery Cove, which opened July 1. It features a tropical, beachy
setting populated with 10,000 fish and 300 birds. Guests can play
with dolphins under the supervision of trainers, and enjoy
leisurely swimming, snorkeling and sunning with smaller crowds and
no lines, thanks to a daily limit of 1,000 patrons.
 &HT;    Orlando's theme parks, which last year attracted more than 60
million visitors (up from 48.5 million in 1996), are trying to
handle the crush of crowds better. Discovery Cove's competitors are
trying various ways to cut down waiting lines, a chief complaint of
theme park customers.
 &HT;    Walt Disney World has inaugurated Fastpass, in which guests can
pick up free tickets near its 18 most popular attractions for later
in the day when the lines are shorter. Universal is testing a
similar arrangement called Fast Track. Disney also opens a
different theme park early each day, offering first admittance to
guests at Disney hotels. Until Sept. 4, Universal is rewarding
multiday ticket holders and its hotel guests with early entry to
its two parks, from 7 to 10 a.m. daily.
 &HT;    A spring drought that fueled wildfires and meant watering
restrictions for millions of Floridians seems to have left the
theme parks unscathed. During visits in June, pathways were lined
with bright blooms of bougainvillea and hibiscus, big shade trees
were heavy with foliage, and the acres of perfectly trimmed grass
were as lush as always.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Theme parks aren't the only show in Orlando, believe it or not.
Although the calendar of special events seems to thin out a bit in
summer, diversions exist elsewhere in the city.
 &HT;    This summer, audience members help solve a mystery set in deep
space at the Orlando Science Center's planetarium. Performances,
which run through Aug. 31, feature a planetarium show and a live
actor. It's based on the PBS geographical quiz show ``Where in the
World Is Carmen San Diego,'' and is included with admission to the
center: $14.25, seniors $13.25, ages 3 to 11 $11.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 10, ``Hunters of the Sky'' looks at birds of prey,
with over 70 mounted specimens of falcons, eagles, owls and other
raptors. The center, at 777 East Princeton St., is open daily;
(407) 896-7151.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 3, ``Art of the 20th Century,'' at the Cornell
Fine Arts Museum, on Holt Avenue at Rollins College in Winter Park,
looks at the last 100 years through European and American painting,
sculpture, prints and drawings from the permanent collection. Free
admission; closed Monday. Call (407) 646-2526.
 &HT;    The Orlando Museum of Art, 2416 North Mills Ave. in Loch Haven
Park, will display beadwork, baskets and decorated animal hides
from Kenya, Tanzania and other East African countries. The
exhibition runs through May 27. Admission is $6, seniors and
students $4, ages 4 to 11 $2; closed Monday: (407) 896-4231.
 &HT;    The Orlando-University of Central Florida Shakespeare Festival
begins Sept. 20, with previews of ``The Woman in Black,'' a
Victorian mystery by Stephen Mallatratt, from a book by Susan Hill,
which runs through Oct. 28. Performances are at the Orange County
Historical Museum Theatre in Loch Haven Park, at Princeton and
Mills Avenues in Orlando. Tickets: $7 to $20; (407) 893-4600.
 &HT;    At Disney's Wide World of Sports, adjacent to the theme parks,
the 2000 Junior Olympic Games, the Amateur Athletic Union's top
event, features track and field competition from July 31 through
Aug. 5. The 250-acre complex is off Exit 25B of I-4. Daily general
admission is $9, ages 3 to 9, $7; (407) 939-1505.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    At Discovery Cove, off Exits 27A and 28 of I-4, guests come face
to face with bottlenose dolphins. They can touch the animals, and
trainers allow some patrons to play water games with the dolphins.
The park requires reservations. It employs one staff member for
every five guests to provide supervision for the dolphins, better
service and no waiting lines. Admission is $179 for ages 6 and
older who want to swim with dolphins; ages 3 to 5 and those
skipping a dolphin swim pay $89.
 &HT;    Admission includes a meal outside at the Laguna Grill, use of
snorkeling and beach gear (towels, chairs, hammocks), and a
seven-day pass to the original SeaWorld park nearby, where visitors
can see Shamu and ride the Kraken, a roller coaster that made its
debut last month; (877) 434-7268.
 &HT;    Otherwise, ticket prices are one area where Orlando's theme
parks don't show variety. Prices for a one-day, one-park ticket for
ages 10 and up at Disney World's theme parks are $46; ages 3 to 9,
$37. The Magic Kingdom and Disney-MGM Studios are off Exit 25B;
Epcot and Animal Kingdom, Exit 26B. For all Disney parks
information: (407) 824-4321.
 &HT;    Ticket prices are the same at SeaWorld, at Exits 27A and 28,
(407) 351-3600; and Universal, at Exits 30A and 29B, (407)
363-8000. Various multipark and multiday tickets are also
available.
 &HT;    The theme-park attractions with the highest profile _ in the
physical sense _ are roller coasters, and Orlando boasts a crop of
wild new ones. SeaWorld's Kraken rises 15 stories, then plunges its
screaming passengers toward earth at 65 m.p.h. Riders on the
Incredible Hulk are practically blown out of the starting gate from
what looks like a giant missile launcher at Universal's Islands of
Adventure park, which opened in May 1999.
 &HT;    The Rock 'n' Roller Coaster at Disney-MGM Studios, which opened
a year ago, treats its riders to an equally explosive start,
accelerating from zero to 60 m.p.h. in 2.8 seconds, with the music
of the band Aerosmith pumped through the seats.
 &HT;    A simulator game that pits guests of DisneyQuest, an indoor
interactive playground, against the same motley gang from the
Pirates of the Caribbean ride opened June 21 outside the park in
Downtown Disney. Four players, all wearing three-dimensional
goggles, board a sailing ship under attack (its deck sickeningly
weaves and rolls on springs controlled by computer) and defend
themselves with cannons. Tickets cost $27, ages 3 to 9, $21.
 &HT;    Universal's ``Terminator 2,'' a film that opened in 1996 at
Universal Studios Theme Park, involves three-dimensional thrills
and bizarre special effects, including fog and rain. It's the usual
end-of-the-world scenario, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, complete
with realistic guns booming and screeching pileups.
 &HT;    One of the most elegant new rides is the beautiful interactive
carousel of Dr. Seuss animals _ pull the reins and hair might fly
up or a tongue stick out _ at Islands of Adventure. The bright pink
and blue carousel is based on the art of Dr. Seuss.
 &HT;    One park that has no problem with crowds is Splendid China, a
76-acre park opened in 1993 by a Chinese company to acquaint
Americans with the country's culture. It features nearly deserted
gardens with more than 60 miniature models of historical Chinese
sites.
 &HT;    Sparse crowds usually greet its chief daily theatrical
production, the ``Mysterious Kingdom of the Orient'' _ a pity since
it is a knockout performance of colorful costumes, traditional
Chinese song and dance, acrobatics and martial arts. Follow Route
192 west from I-4 to Exit 25B in Kissimmee (directions and ticket
information from park employees may be incorrect). Admission costs,
which include the show and a terrible meal, are $19.95, and $9.95
ages 5 to 12. Call (407) 396-7111 or (800) 244-6226.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    It's always easier to park your car and stay on the grounds of a
theme park, but hotels and food usually cost more. A moderately
priced choice is Disney's All-Star Resorts, at Exit 26B of I-4,
with a mammoth complex of 5,760 basic rooms with outdoor pools,
bakery, food court and free bus service to Disney attractions.
Rooms are $74 to $104 a night; (407) 934-7639.
 &HT;    Minutes east of the theme parks is the Hampton Inn-Orlando
Convention Center hotel, 8900 Universal Blvd., which opened in
April 1999. The staff is helpful and friendly; there is a heated
outdoor pool; the free Continental breakfast includes cereals,
bagels, yogurt, fruit and waffles; and the 170 spotless rooms, with
maple furniture and decorated in bright, tropical colors, are $69
to $109, depending on the season; (407) 354-4447, fax (407)
354-3031.
 &HT;    Budget: A simple hotel tucked away off Interstate 4, the Comfort
Inn Maingate South is an easy 15-minute ride from most of the theme
parks. It is off I-4 Exit 23, eight miles west of Walt Disney World
at 5510 U.S. Highway 27 North. Its 150 rooms cost $40 to $100, more
on holidays; outdoor pool; (800) 255-4386, fax (863) 424-1723.
 &HT;    Luxury: Elegant, sand-colored Italian marble and huge bouquets
of native orchids give the lobby of the Peabody Orlando, 9801
International Drive, a distinctive Florida feel, and it's fun to
watch the hotel's mascot ducks cavort in the fountain. Its 891
modern rooms are decorated in yellow and moss green; doubles are
$330 a night; outdoor pool and children's pool with waterfall;
(407) 352-4000, fax (407) 351-0073.
 &HT;    The Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, Disney's sprawling
Victorian-style hotel, boasts 900 quaint rooms, decorated with
printed wall coverings, marble-top sinks, ceiling fans and
Victorian woodwork. Big gingerbread porches with climbing roses
overlook a lagoon on theme park grounds with a man-made beach and
two outdoor pools, one for children. Off Exit 25B. Doubles are $304
to $400; (407) 824-3000, fax (407) 824-3186.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    At Universal's CityWalk, a 30-acre dining and entertainment
complex, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville is (what else?) completely
casual. Try conch fritters dipped in honey-mustard sauce, followed
by Caribbean grilled chicken salad, topped with almonds and
habanero-mango ranch dressing, and key lime pie for dessert. Dinner
for two with margaritas, about $50; (407) 224-2155.
 &HT;    Nearby, also at CityWalk, you'll find Emeril's, the Orlando
branch of a series of restaurants owned by the popular TV chef
Emeril Lagasse. Reservations are recommended. Specialties include
an appetizer of Maine lobster cheesecake; roasted rack of lamb with
a Creole mustard sauce, and fresh Florida orange cake with
strawberry compote. Dinner for two with wine, $125; (407) 224-2424.
 &HT;    Of all the theme parks, SeaWorld serves some of the best food,
and its casual Bimini Bay restaurant, with waiters and waitresses
wearing Hawaiian shirts, is typical. The menu features salads,
pasta and seafood; try the fresh Florida grouper sandwich or
marinated steak on a roll with sauteed onions and peppers. Lunch
for two with beer costs about $40 (you must have a park pass);
(407) 351-3600.
 &HT;    Two sessions of a gospel brunch occur every Sunday morning at
the House of Blues Music Hall, at Downtown Disney (where no park
pass is needed), featuring nationally known and local gospel
performers, and an all-you-can-eat Southern buffet. The meal and
show cost $28; ages 3 to 9, $15. It's a good idea to buy tickets at
least a week in advance at (407) 934-2583, fax (407) 934-2216, or
at the House of Blues box office.
 &HT;    A good family-style restaurant near Walt Disney World is
Pebbles, 12551 State Road 535; (407) 827-1111. It serves a nice mix
of dishes adults enjoy, like the excellent black bean soup ($3.25)
or Mediterranean salad ($7.50), and child-friendly items like the
cheeseburger ($6.95)and white chocolate mousse ($3.95).

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANNASUE MCCLEAVE WILSON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is hard to admit to being a soccer mom. That cliched title is
easier to bear, however, when the games are played on a crescent
moon of a beach in Brazil, where the team kicks up sand as white
and soft as baby powder.
 &HT;    Our family loves soccer, that jogo bonito, ``beautiful game,''
as they call it in Brazil. My son John, 14, has played since
kindergarten, and his coach, Paulo Barreto, is a Brazilian who
played professionally there. His Cincinnati company, Paulo's
Brazilian Soccer Training and Camp, began organizing trips last
year to his hometown, Florianopolis.
 &HT;    The coin toss to see whether my husband, John, or I would
accompany John on a trip there last March was agonizing. Not only
was the trip too expensive for everyone to go, but we would have
had to take our two younger children out of school. I won.
 &HT;    This particular eight-day trip was designed for a team, but not
all of John's team, the Cincinnati Classics, participated, so they
were supplemented by other boys and girls of the same age and
ability from around Cincinnati. Parents were welcome, and of the 17
players, only 5 traveled without a parent, making us a group of 39.
 &HT;    Other camps offer various levels of training and can include
international tournament play for players who hope to play at the
college level and beyond, but this trip offered the right balance
of soccer and vacation for us. Our trip revolved around three
matches with local teams and four morning training sessions, but
equally important was the beachfront hotel and organized afternoon
sightseeing.
 &HT;    Florianopolis, on the island of Santa Catarina, is about 350
miles down the coast from Sao Paulo. Our 24-hour trip was not made
easier by the way we were routed by the travel agency _ through
Detroit, Miami and Sao Paulo _ but the teenagers seemed oblivious
to the inconvenience.
 &HT;    When they weren't giving water to thirsty dogs in travel cages
or bumping into airport police officers on bikes, they managed to
find enough open space at each stopover to kick around a soccer
ball. In Sao Paulo, they sprawled over the floor of the airport
terminal, lounging or sleeping on backpacks.
 &HT;    Several in our group thought the island of Santa Catarina, on
which most of the city of Florianopolis is built, looked like one
of the islands of Hawaii from the air. The hilly countryside is
laden with subtropical flora, and both land and sea are dotted with
ancient black boulders that must have looked like gods to the
Tupi-Guarani Indians who first inhabited the region. The island is
connected to the mainland by two bridges, although one, the
Hercilio Luz, is closed to motor traffic.
 &HT;    Our bright blue hotel, the Ingleses Praia, sat beside a beach
called Praia dos Ingleses, on the northeast shore of the island,
about 22 miles from downtown Florianopolis. The beach was named for
English explorers who poked around there about 1700. Each room had
a balcony, cool tile floors, air-conditioning and surprisingly
spacious bathrooms.
 &HT;    We ate breakfast and occasionally another meal at the hotel,
buffet style. Fruits and juices were fresh and delicious, but all
else paled in the morning before the coffee. It was deeply rich and
black, served with hot milk.
 &HT;    Our first evening at the hotel, the parents in the group were
content to laze wearily on the veranda, drinking caipirinhas, a
lime drink usually made with cachaca, Brazilian sugar-cane liquor.
 &HT;    A few of the boys perused the small strip of beachfront
restaurants and souvenir shops selling T-shirts and crocheted
bikinis and thongs on either side of the hotel (their favorite
souvenirs were fake designer watches, but because the dollar is
strong against the real, almost everything seemed inexpensive).
 &HT;    Afterward, they brought out a ball and began to kick it around
on the beach under the stars. This attracted some local people and
soon a full fledged game was on. Not one Brazilian guy walking
along the beach _ student, vendor or fisherman _ could keep his
foot off the ball if it came near him during our practices, and
their skill was remarkable.
 &HT;    The team's first training session was at the Hotel Fazenda Jomar
on the mainland near Santo Amaro da Imperatriz, a spa town founded
to commemorate an imperial visit in 1845 by Dom Pedro II, emperor
of Brazil. Having traveled inland 18 miles, we were in dense green
mountains, and the group practiced on a field in danger of being
enveloped by the lush vegetation surrounding it.
 &HT;    Afterward, we all took advantage of the resort's amenities. The
team swam in the pool, went rafting in rapids not rapid enough to
be classified, and sank paddle boats in the lake.
 &HT;    On a shaded veranda, an accordionist played German music, a
reminder of the large influx of Germans who emigrated to this part
of Brazil in the 19th century. Several parents joined an ecological
walk around the grounds, which led to a waterfall of rare beauty;
on our way up, we disturbed a lizard the size of a small alligator.
 &HT;    Florianopolis has two professional soccer teams, the Figueirense
Futebol Clube, based on the mainland, and the island's Avai Futebol
Clube, both of which cultivate players from a young age.
 &HT;    After a day of practice and a couple of scrimmages on the beach,
our first match took place against the Figueirense youth team in
the club's stadium in Florianopolis. The Brazilians, who were a
year or two older than John, won, 8-1, which did not seem to
diminish the excitement of playing a challenging opponent.
 &HT;    Our game with the young Avai team two days later took place just
before the professional match between Avai and Caxias (from the
city of Porto Alegre). As the game went on, the stands filled up
with fans who cheered on both teams (we lost, 2-0) but who were
unforgiving of their pro team when it lost.
 &HT;    After the game with Figueirense, our bus took us to the beach at
Joaquina, which is on the east side of the island and is famous for
surfing championships held there each year. After an open-air
lunch, the team wandered the beach, climbing the huge rocks at one
end and examining jellyfish that washed onto the shore.
 &HT;    Behind Praia da Joaquina are massive sand dunes of Saharan
proportion and, even though the wind whipped up the sand so
fiercely it practically blinded them, the team was determined to go
sandboarding. John and the boys happily forged their way up the
dunes over and over again, and dumped their weight in sand onto the
floor of the bus on the way back to the hotel.
 &HT;    The next day, we boarded a schooner and headed for the island of
Anhatomirim, where the team was to practice in the shadow of the
Santa Cruz fort, built in 1744. A Brazilian school group about the
same age as ours happened to be touring the fort, too, and it
wasn't long before another impromptu match was on.
 &HT;    The Brazilian girls watched the American boys with obvious
pleasure, much to the consternation of the Brazilian boys, which
gave the game an edge it might not ordinarily have had.
 &HT;    The Brazilian boys, on the other hand, didn't know what to make
of the four highly skilled girls playing on our team. Only the
parents were in awe of the setting: on one side a centuries-old
fortress and on the other, the magnificent sea.
 &HT;    After morning training another day, the group ventured downtown.
The two bridges to the mainland shadow 19th-century ocher-colored
market buildings along the old waterfront. Across the street from
the Praca 15 de Novembro, the city's main square, John stopped at
the entrance to the pink Cruz e Souza Palace to have his picture
taken beside the guard, who wore an elaborate uniform and held a
rifle with a bayonet.
 &HT;    The team climbed the steps to the bright white Metropolitan
Cathedral, where a Mass was being said, then plopped down
pretending to be exhausted.
 &HT;    Since this day of sightseeing had little appeal for them, the
high point of the excursion was stopping at a shop called Futebol
Mania to buy official Figueirense and Avai jerseys. A few fathers
wandered off to the bus station to find Cuban cigars.
 &HT;    Our meals outside the hotel were in seafood restaurants or in
churrascarias, places serving meat smorgasbords called rodizio (all
you can eat). Seafood lunches were waterside, in open-air
restaurants that served us at long communal tables _ local shrimp
in butter and oil, mussels in salsa, deep-fried whitefish, served
with plates of beets, shredded carrots and tomato, clay pots of
rich black beans, and crisp, deep-fried manioc root.
 &HT;    When Mr. Barreto realized that our ravenous American teen-agers
kept passing on the plates of fish and making faces, he arranged
that they be served chicken with rice and French fries instead.
 &HT;    One evening we were taken to a cafe colonial, a Brazilian-style
high tea inspired by the customs of European immigrants in the 19th
century. On the beach, we snacked on corn on the cob served in the
husk and drank cool milk right from coconuts. The team's favorite
drink was Guarana, sweet green soda with lots of caffeine.
 &HT;    A cultural exchange had been arranged for us the afternoon
before we left at the Colegia Energia, a private school in
Florianopolis that prides itself on its English instruction. When
we arrived, we were met with wild cheers, as if we were a busload
of American movie stars. Our boys were a little stunned at such a
reception and we had to remind them to keep smiling.
 &HT;    The school had prepared a short program and presented each of
our team members with souvenir notebooks. A soccer scrimmage was
held in which our girls soundly beat four Brazilian girls. While
our boys were outclassed on the field, they were mobbed by
Brazilian girls and boys asking for e-mail addresses and
photographs.
 &HT;    Once our team got used to the attention, those who spoke a
little Spanish _ none spoke Portuguese _ tried to talk to the
students, who answered in their halting English.
 &HT;    That evening, we lost our last match, against the Astel Futebol
Clube, but only by a single goal. Once, John collided with an Astel
player, knocking him to the ground. As he would have back home, he
reached down to help the Brazilian to his feet, but was scolded by
Mr. Barreto.
 &HT;    ``Here you leave him alone,'' he said. ``Find him after the game
if you want.''
 &HT;    When we returned to Cincinnati, the team went on to become
division champions, at least partly because of improved soccer
skills. But the trip had also provided the players with a surprise,
the opportunity to represent their country by their actions: How
they played the game did matter.
 &HT;    -----

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY SUSAN ALLEN TOTH  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When I have finally opened the mail, unpacked my bags, started
the washing machine, restocked the refrigerator and riffled through
a few newspapers, I am ready to stay home forever.
 &HT;    Yes, I realize, I'm totally exhausted. I stroke our cats,
defrost some homemade soup and soon send my husband, James, to his
office so I can luxuriate in having the house to myself. No, I am
not going to travel again for a long time. Months and months, maybe
longer. Who knows when I'll ever be ready to study another
guidebook or decipher another map?
 &HT;    I am tired of looking at menus. I can't bear to sleep in any
more strange bedrooms. I want to forget all those uneasy searches
for public toilets.
 &HT;    Our friends applaud this decision. They think James and I travel
too much anyway.
 &HT;    ``Of course you have a cold,'' one says. ``Everyone knows you
can't travel on a plane without getting sick.'' Another chimes in:
``How can you complain of not getting any writing done? You're
never home.''
 &HT;    Some urge us to slow down, take it easy. Others suggest getting
back to work, enjoying my garden, volunteering for a local charity.
I'm sure they are right. In fact, as I nod in agreement, I feel
morally invigorated.
 &HT;    Travel is a kind of addiction, I tell myself, and I must simply
let it go for a while. I can. I know I can.
 &HT;    Then something happens. If I could predict it, I might be able
to ward it off. But the travel impulse is sly, mysterious and
dazzlingly sudden.
 &HT;    Last December, glad to be home for the holidays after a hectic
trip to London, I was savoring the prospect of quiet weeks ahead.
Then I opened a Christmas card from a family friend in my Iowa
hometown.
 &HT;    Close to 90 now, cheerful and bright but unable to travel,
Isabel wrote: ``You certainly travel a lot. But do keep it up as
long as you can! I wish I had seen York and Cornwall. But I am so
thankful I didn't miss the Alhambra and the Prado.''
 &HT;    The Alhambra! I thought. The Prado! Why is it we've never been
there? Immediately I began to think of Spain. Why not Portugal too?
Perhaps next fall?
 &HT;    A few days later, on New Year's Eve, I was transfixed by the
televised fantasy of fireworks that lit up the bejeweled Eiffel
Tower. Oh, Paris, beautiful City of Light _ had it really been five
years since we'd walked along the Seine?
 &HT;    I could instantly envision broad boulevards, thin women with
chic silk scarves, and a corner patisserie where I bought a moist
round mouthful of chocolate cake with an indescribably delicious
coffee-flavored icing. Definitely, back to Paris.
 &HT;    Cleaning my desk the following week, I took off the wall an
outdated calendar with large color photographs of waterfalls. I
hadn't really noticed it much. But now I was transfixed by a view
of Upper Yosemite Falls, tumbling down magnificent snow-covered
cliffs.
 &HT;    I hadn't been to Yosemite for more than 30 years, and I barely
remembered my one day there. How could I think of Paris, or Spain,
when I hadn't really experienced Yosemite?
 &HT;    I am helpless against unforeseen assaults on my homebound
intentions. Occasionally, when I am already on a trip, I have a
passing glimpse of a destination that calls to me so seductively I
know I must answer.
 &HT;    One June afternoon, on a fast train from Inverness to London, I
glanced, for only a whizzing moment, far across miles of empty
fields to a tiny village of snug houses clustered around a bay. The
surrounding countryside seemed so undiscovered, the village so
remote.
 &HT;    I studied my map: Alnmouth, Northumberland. Three years later,
we were walking through light rain down its long quiet beach.
 &HT;    On another afternoon, this time in early fall, I sat on a level
rock at the northernmost edge of Scotland and gazed, entranced, at
the distant gray-green shapes of the Orkney Islands half-hidden in
the mist. They seemed as if they belonged to a different world.
``James,'' I said, ``we have to go there.''
 &HT;    James smiled, partly in resignation. ``O.K.,'' he said amiably,
``but why don't we finish this trip first?''
 &HT;    Two Octobers later, we rented a cottage for a week on an Orkney
island called, disarmingly, Mainland.
 &HT;    Sometimes all it takes is a single picture or a few words. We
once spent a week near Cromer, on the north Norfolk coast, because
that was the phrase _ ``the north Norfolk coast'' _ occasionally
appearing in travel guides, that had begun to haunt my imagination.
It sounded so unlike the cozy Cotswolds, or the well-trodden and
prosaically named Lake District, or flowering Kent, the Garden of
England.
 &HT;    Then I read P. D. James' ``Devices and Desires,'' and her
intensely evocative description of that bleak, windswept land made
me determined to see if she was right. And she was.
 &HT;    Although P.D. James first sent me to Norfolk, Arthur Conan Doyle
to Dartmoor and Dylan Thomas to Wales, I am not often struck by the
travel impulse when I read nonfiction travel books. This may seem
odd, since I have indulged in such memoirs myself.
 &HT;    But, after closing a particularly atmospheric or vivid travel
narrative, I tend to think: ``OK. Wonderful. Now I've been there.''
 &HT;    If the author has filled my eyes with his or her personal
vision, I am perversely not moved to explore certain corners of
Provence, or Tuscany, or Patagonia.
 &HT;    If, however, I am swept into a place by reading a novel or
biography, I absorb the landscape sidewise, out of the corner of my
eye. Then I become intrigued.
 &HT;    After finishing Tim Binding's ``Lying With the Enemy,'' a novel
about life in occupied Guernsey during World War II, I asked James,
``Why haven't we ever been to the Channel Islands?'' He looked
blank. I handed him the novel, and the next year, we were off.
 &HT;    My love of Scottish islands began, not with a guidebook, but
with Gavin Maxwell's ``Ring of Bright Water,'' an account of life
with his beloved otters.
 &HT;    I soon tracked Maxwell through his later, much harsher, memoirs,
``The Rocks Remain'' and ``Raven Seek Thy Brother,'' and, after
many years, I eventually looked across the water to the lonely site
of his nearly inaccessible Camusfearna.
 &HT;    As James and I walked parts of the rocky coastline of western
Scotland, and explored Mull and Skye that year, I often thought of
Maxwell's intense, troubled spirit. His love of this land had
brought us there.
 &HT;    Or had it? As a young girl, I used to sit at the piano and play
through ``The Fireside Book of Folk Songs.'' One of my favorites
was ``The Skye Boat Song.'' Its simple, poignant melody had an
unforgettable refrain, especially alluring to an Iowa girl who
lived far from any ocean: ``Carry the lad who was born to be
king/Over the sea to Skye.''
 &HT;    I didn't know the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and I had no
idea where Skye was, but I knew loss and regret when I heard it.
Over the sea to Skye: someday perhaps I would know more.
 &HT;    So even a song can start me thinking of travel. After our trip
to Hawaii last winter, James began to play a CD we bought there. He
plays it a lot, especially when it gets really cold outside.
 &HT;    Like James, I had been delighted by our relaxing, balmy week on
Molokai. So when I hear ``Polynesian Love Song'' or ``Lovely Hula
Hands,'' I don't think, ``This is corny.'' No, I want to be back on
our screened lanai, listening to the warm splashing surf a few
yards away.
 &HT;    It doesn't take much. Sometimes I think I should look for an
antidote, but I haven't thought of one yet. Maybe if I muttered
Thoreau's proud boast, ``I have traveled much in Concord''? If I
repeated like a mantra, ``Home is where the heart is''? What about
a CD that played, again and again, ``Home Sweet Home''? I'm not
sure any of it would help.

 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My husband wants adventure, I want a spa with a spiritual
nature and our kids don't fit into either category. Help! Know of a
vacation destination that will meet everyone's needs?
 &HT;     A:  The Enchantment Resort in Sedona, Ariz., and its new
destination spa, Mii Amo, will surely please all. Nestled within a
truly enchanting red-rock canyon, Enchantment offers scenic
relaxation and adventure, as well as Camp Coyote, ranked one of the
best kids programs in the world.
 &HT;    One of Enchantment's treasures is Uqualla, the shaman and former
chief of the Havasupai tribe, who acts as spiritual ambassador for
the resort. While children play and learn about the local cultures,
guests can be pampered by healing oils that are blessed each
morning. Spiritual consultations are available, and the staff
offers an array of innovative spa treatments.
 &HT;    The Enchantment concierge can arrange a variety of hiking and
rock-climbing tours for the adventurous or the mere stroller.
 &HT;    Your family should save an afternoon to fly by helicopter with
Uqualla to his tribe's village at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.
There you can enjoy a swim and picnic at the nearby falls.
 &HT;    At the end of the day, whether your crew is rested or exhausted,
Enchantment's restaurants offer an eclectic selection of spa
cuisine and hearty southwestern fare, as well as an excellent wine
list.
 &HT;    Book now for the holidays to reserve an Enchantment casita or
one of Mii Amo's 16 rooms and suites. Room rates begin at $195 per
night. For more information, call (800) 826-4180 or visit
www.enchantmentresort.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I've always been intrigued by the mystique of Harvard, but
the two times I visited Cambridge I felt like such an outsider. How
can I get a better feel for the place?
 &HT;     A:2 Home to Harvard, MIT and the JFK School of Government,
Cambridge may well be the premiere locale for intellectuals in this
country. Most visiting lecturers and dignitaries stay at the
Charles Hotel on Harvard Square.
 &HT;    Not only is it within walking distance, at times the Charles
Hotel seems like an extension of the Harvard campus. Relax in the
foyer library and watch the comings and goings _ or better yet, ask
the concierge to arrange a private tour of Harvard with a recent
graduate. Often the guide runs into buddies, conversations ensue
and the scene opens before you.
 &HT;    I would suggest arriving early for breakfast at the Charles'
lively Henrietta's Table, where writer David Mamet or Cambridge's
dot.com elite might just be doing business.
 &HT;    Lunch would be a good idea at a popular joint called Bartley's
Burger Cottage (1246 Massachusetts Ave.), but Casablanca (40
Brattle St.), with its fusion Mediterranean cuisine, is a more
original mainstay of Cambridge _ especially in the evening at the
bar.
 &HT;    Room rates at the Charles Hotel begin at $250 per night.
Facilities include a day spa and three-story health-and-fitness
center. For more information, call (800) 882-1818, or visit
www.charleshotel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I have played on golf courses around the world and really
enjoy when courses throw a unique spin into the golfing experience.
Can you suggest a course that offers a bit of originality?
 &HT;     A:  The new ``Heli-Golf Package,'' offered by Rosewood Hotels &AMP;
Resorts in Little Dix Bay in the Virgin Islands, provides the
originality that adventurous golfers look for. This heli-golf
experience features a scenic helicopter flight to St. Croix, where
golfers are deposited right onto the green and are then processed
through customs and immigrations with minimal hassle.
 &HT;    Described as ``the Caribbean's most exclusive golf getaway,''
Little Dix Bay's Heli-Golf Package includes three nights'
accommodation for two; greens fees, cart and golf escort; daily
breakfast and dinner; and complimentary water activities. Rates are
based on double occupancy, with deluxe accommodations starting at
$3,500 and suite accommodations starting at $5,000.
 &HT;    Laurance Rockefeller founded exclusive Little Dix Bay in 1964.
These low-key yet upscale accommodations are set in a 500-acre
garden paradise and a pristine private beach. For more information,
call (888) ROSEWOOD.
 &HT;     Q:  I am a single female who enjoys traveling alone, but
occasionally I feel left out of certain social activities because I
am not part of a couple. Do other independent travelers ever feel
this way?
 &HT;     A:  Some people do _ and, unfortunately, it's usually women.
Because of this, Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines now feature their popular
gentlemen hosts aboard every cruise. With their gracious social
skills and dancing ability, these men are well-known for making
single female passengers feel at ease in all social activities.
 &HT;    Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines offers exhilarating cruises throughout
Africa, the Caribbean, Europe and South America. For more
information and reservations, visit www.eurocruises.com, or call
(800) 688-3876.
 &HT;     Q:  Over the years, I have noticed that some hotels are more
in-tune with the needs of female business travelers than others.
Can you recommend a good hotel that focuses on this segment of the
population?
 &HT;     A:  The Pan Pacific San Francisco recently surveyed female
guests _ focusing on those with business needs _ and has made
several adjustments.
 &HT;    The women who were surveyed reported that females appreciate
softer, more personal touches. For example, minibars are now
stocked with wines by the glass. There are lighter menu choices
available on the 24-hour room-service menu, personal butlers can be
provided and the staff is available to escort female guests to
their rooms. This is just a handful of the amenities that are part
of the hotel's signature luxury service.
 &HT;    For business travelers, the Pan Pacific has added a virtual
office to many rooms. Copy capabilities are now part of the in-room
fax machine, and all guest rooms will soon be wired for high-speed
Internet access. The hotel has also acquired a number of laptop
computers.
 &HT;    The Pan Pacific San Francisco is located just one block from
Union Square and is a cable-car ride away from the city's theater
district, fine restaurants and other tourist attractions. For more
information and reservations, call (800) 533-6465, or visit the web
at www.panpac.com.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The romance of the rails lingers in a handful of deluxe trains
that run on well-orchestrated trips throughout the world.
 &HT;    What's the appeal of such luxury train trips? Vintage rail cars
that have been lavishly restored; itineraries that take passengers
through some of the most beautiful landscapes and cities in the
world; impeccable service; and food that is extraordinary.
 &HT;    For those who can pay the price, here are some elegant journeys
to consider. Prices are per person, based on double occupancy.
 &HT;    The American Spirit (601 Union St., Seattle, WA 98101;
888-533-7245; www.americanspiritrail.com) features 1950s Budd-built
streamliner railcars. The company offers a variety of western
itineraries that include visits to the Glacier, Grand Tetons and
Yellowstone National Parks.
 &HT;    Trips last anywhere from two to nine nights. Accommodations are
in hotels, not on the train, and motorcoaches supplement the rail
service.
 &HT;    A typical itinerary is the ``Montana Rockies Rail Tour,'' which
begins in Post Falls, Idaho, continues on to Missoula, Mont., and
ends in Livingston, Mont. The cost of the two-night trip begins at
$499. Lodging and daily breakfast, as well as transfers from
Spokane Airport, are included.
 &HT;    The American Orient-Express (5100 Main St., Downer's Grove, IL
60515; 888-759-3944; www.americanorientexpress.com) utilizes 15
vintage rail cars on its luxury voyages. The train travels cross
country as well as on shorter trips throughout the West.
 &HT;    For example, the ``Rockies and Yellowstone'' itinerary is a
six-night trip that commences in Denver and visits Arches National
Park, Salt Lake City, Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks.
The cost begins at $2,990.
 &HT;    The best-known name in luxury-train travel is probably
Orient-Express Trains &AMP; Cruises (Sea Containers House, 20 Upper
Ground, London, SE1 9PF, England; 800-524-2420;
www.orient-expresstrains.com or c/o Abercrombie and Kent
International Inc., 1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523;
800-323-7308; www.abercrombiekent.com). They offer a variety of
rail itineraries for the well-heeled traveler.
 &HT;    The most famous trip is the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express
(VSOE), which features restored period rail cars, lavish service
and fine dining. Sightseeing and meals are included in most
itineraries.
 &HT;    The classic VSOE trip is from London to Paris and Venice, or
vice versa. The cost of this one-night trip starts at $1,970. The
train makes other trips as well, such as from Venice to Florence
and Rome; Venice to Prague, Paris and London; Venice to Lucerne,
Paris and London; and Paris to Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul.
 &HT;    Orient-Express also offers the Eastern &AMP; Oriental Express, a
luxury train that has three itineraries: Singapore to Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, and Bangkok (and vice versa); Bangkok to Chiang Mai,
Thailand; and Bangkok to Angkor Wat, Cambodia, and Singapore. The
overnight Singapore to Kuala Lumpur itinerary begins at $600.
 &HT;    Among the other Orient-Express trains are the Northern Belle,
which calls itself the ``Orient-Express of the North.'' It offers
day trips and weekend getaways in Britain with departures from
Liverpool, Manchester and York. Again, vintage rail carriages, fine
dining and a high level of service are offered.
 &HT;    Orient Express also operates the Great South Pacific Express in
Australia, a restored luxury train that runs from Brisbane to
Cairns; Brisbane to Sydney; Brisbane to Canberra and Sydney; and
Sydney to Brisbane and Cairns. Contact them for more information.
 &HT;    The Royal Scotsman (c/o Abercrombie and Kent International Inc.
1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523; 800-323-7308;
www.abercrombiekent.com or www.royalscotsman.com) takes visitors
through the rugged Scottish countryside on some of the beautiful
rails in Britain. The four-night Edinburgh to Edinburgh itinerary
is $4,150.
 &HT;    Beginning in the Scottish capital, the journey takes riders
through the dramatic West Highlands and rolling Perthshire hills
and then to the North East. Two-night trips start at $2,350. Rates
include all meals, wine and alcoholic and beverages as well as
sightseeing visits.
 &HT;    In Canada, the Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (1150 Station St.,
Vancouver, B.C. Canada V6A 2X7; 800-665-7245;
www.rockymountaineer.com) has a variety of trips through the
Canadian Rockies. These trains travel by daylight only, affording
the best views of the mountains. Overnights are spent in hotels.
 &HT;    One of the briefest excursions is the ``Two Day Redleaf Tour,''
a one-night trip through the Canadian Rockies, traveling from
Vancouver to either Jasper, Alberta, or Calgary, Alberta, with an
overnight hotel stay in Kamloops, Alberta. Prices start at $358 per
person and include the overnight stay and some meals.
 &HT;    Premier Selections (342 Madison Ave., Suite 916, New York, N.Y.
10173; 800-234-4000; www.premierselections.com) is the sales agent
for a number of great train journeys, including the Al Andalus
Express, the Royal Scottsman and the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.
Rates start at $1,512 and include five nights on the train, one in
a hotel, most meals and sightseeing.
 &HT;    Premier also has a variety of other luxury trains, including the
Blue Train in South Africa. This train runs from Capetown to
Pretoria, with an overnight in Johannesburg. The price of this
five-night train/tour package _ which includes four hotel nights,
one night on the train itself and some meals _ starts at $1,946.
 &HT;    Finally, Copper Canyon's Sierra Madre Express runs from Tuscon,
Ariz., down into Mexico's fabled Copper Canyon region. The
seven-night trip, which includes hotel and train accommodation, as
well as most meals, begins at $2,545.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: RENO'S HISTORIC RICHES

 &HT;    
 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Like anyone living in a popular tourist destination, I developed
a standard tour itinerary years ago for my out-of-town friends who
wish to see all that Reno, Nev., has to offer.
 &HT;    Because Reno is known for gaming, most of my visitors want to
stop at a casino to try their luck at gambling or to see a show.
But it doesn't take long for the area's natural beauty to weave its
magic. Even in midsummer, the snow-dappled Sierra Nevada set
against the clear blue sky is like a magnet for sightseers.
 &HT;    My personal tour starts in Truckee, home of the Donner Memorial
Museum, (530) 582-7892, that tells the heartbreaking story of the
Donner Party who were trapped in the Sierra Nevada during one of
our area's worst winters.
 &HT;    Then it's up Route 89 to Tahoe City for a stop at Fanny Bridge
overlooking the Truckee River. Fanny Bridge gets its name from the
poses people strike as they lean over the bridge to watch the giant
trout swim below.
 &HT;    A driving tour of Carson City, the capital of Nevada, is next.
Then, depending on the mood of the group, we head west to Genoa _
reputedly Nevada's first settlement and home of the state's oldest
saloon _ or east to Virginia City _ where the rich ore deposits of
this lavish boomtown helped finance Union efforts in the Civil War
and buy Nevada early statehood.
 &HT;    A visit to Reno wouldn't be complete without a walk along the
Truckee River and downtown _ usually with a stop at the National
Auto Museum _ and a meal at a Basque hotel, where ethnic fare is
served family-style at long tables.
 &HT;    But beware: If a Basque meal strikes your fancy, be prepared to
eat. A lot. The food is served in a series of seemingly endless
courses, giving diners ample time to visit with table mates who may
hail from other parts of the city, country or world.
 &HT;    A drive to Pyramid Lake, just northeast of Reno and famous for
being the location where Charleton Heston was filmed parting the
Red Sea in the ``The Ten Commandments,'' usually tops off my
official tour.
 &HT;    Recently, when I took a group of out-of-towners on a sightseeing
trip of the city, I realized how outdated my tour route had become.
All the sites I've mentioned are indeed worth visiting, but now
there's so much more to explore.
 &HT;    For example, a trip to Pyramid Lake and Paiute Indian
Reservation's Fish Hatchery, (775) 476-0500, where one can see how
prehistoric cui-ui fish are being saved, now can include a stop at
the new Tribal Museum and a visit to the Bureau of Land
Management's Wild Horse Adoption Center, (775) 475-2222 or
www.blm.gov/whb. Horses from Nevada's vast open spaces are brought
and kept here until people adopt them.
 &HT;    The Truckee River, with its 100-mile ribbon of rapids that lead
from Lake Tahoe down to Pyramid Lake, always has been a vital part
of my tour. Now, it's even more important.
 &HT;    Downtown Reno is where the Truckee River intersects with
Virginia Street, the town's main drag. It's home to many new
developments, including:
 &HT;    _ A walk with promenades for special events, such as ballet and
symphony performances.
 &HT;    _ Riverside paths, a favorite with bikers and hikers.
Eventually, these will run the length of the city once development
is completed.
 &HT;    _ Many unique Riverfront buildings, including the Riverside
Hotel and Casino, which is being converted into lofts and studios;
Christ Scientist Church, which is becoming the Lear Theater; and
McKinley School, which has been restored as an arts-and-cultural
center.
 &HT;    Some developments have new twists, such as the bluff overlooking
the south side of the Truckee River, where Reno's elite built homes
in what is now called the Newlands area. These days, local
residents involved in historic preservation lead tours of the area,
mostly for Elderhostel students, (877) 426-8056 or
www.elderhostel.org. Special group tours can be arranged by calling
the Historic Reno Preservation Society, (775) 322-1638.
 &HT;    At the other end of Virginia Street is the town's signature
landmark, an overhead street sign that proclaims Reno as ``The
Biggest Little City in the World.'' This is the fourth version of
the sign, which during World War II served as a landmark for
veterans heading home from the Pacific.
 &HT;    Two models of the sign adorn downtown. The newest is known to
turn green on St. Patrick's Day or go dark during Christmas carol
sing-alongs, while the other model is mounted outside the National
Auto Museum on Lake Street.
 &HT;    West of Reno, my tour now includes a stop at Chrissie Caughlin
Park beside the Truckee River. It's a place I have walked my
miniature schnauzers for years, but I now know that pioneers
traveling in covered wagons used a large pine tree, roughly four
feet in diameter, as their ``post office'' and stuck notes for
other immigrants on its trunk.
 &HT;    Further west, it's possible to take a look-see at the
still-visible tracks of the Donner Party wagon train on either side
of Dog Valley Road near a small town called Verdi.
 &HT;    Reno is rich in history, from miners searching for quick riches
and pioneers hurrying to reach California, to railroaders laying
the train tracks that would stitch together the North American

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By SARA KENNEDY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If competition breeds creativity, then the theme parks in and
around Orlando are a case in point. They have some of the most
imaginative ways for guests to spend their leisure time. Everything
from a roller coaster that shoots its human cargo from the starting
gate with all the subtlety of a missile launcher to a beautiful
carousel based on the art of Dr. Seuss greet visitors to Orlando
theme parks this summer.
 &HT;    Vacationers will also find an entirely new park, SeaWorld's
Discovery Cove, which opened July 1. It features a tropical, beachy
setting populated with 10,000 fish and 300 birds. Guests can play
with dolphins under the supervision of trainers, and enjoy
leisurely swimming, snorkeling and sunning with smaller crowds and
no lines, thanks to a daily limit of 1,000 patrons.
 &HT;    Orlando's theme parks, which last year attracted more than 60
million visitors (up from 48.5 million in 1996), are trying to
handle the crush of crowds better. Discovery Cove's competitors are
trying various ways to cut down waiting lines, a chief complaint of
theme park customers.
 &HT;    Walt Disney World has inaugurated Fastpass, in which guests can
pick up free tickets near its 18 most popular attractions for later
in the day when the lines are shorter. Universal is testing a
similar arrangement called Fast Track. Disney also opens a
different theme park early each day, offering first admittance to
guests at Disney hotels. Until Sept. 4, Universal is rewarding
multiday ticket holders and its hotel guests with early entry to
its two parks, from 7 to 10 a.m. daily.
 &HT;    A spring drought that fueled wildfires and meant watering
restrictions for millions of Floridians seems to have left the
theme parks unscathed. During visits in June, pathways were lined
with bright blooms of bougainvillea and hibiscus, big shade trees
were heavy with foliage, and the acres of perfectly trimmed grass
were as lush as always.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Theme parks aren't the only show in Orlando, believe it or not.
Although the calendar of special events seems to thin out a bit in
summer, diversions exist elsewhere in the city.
 &HT;    This summer, audience members help solve a mystery set in deep
space at the Orlando Science Center's planetarium. Performances,
which run through Aug. 31, feature a planetarium show and a live
actor. It's based on the PBS geographical quiz show ``Where in the
World Is Carmen San Diego,'' and is included with admission to the
center: $14.25, seniors $13.25, ages 3 to 11 $11.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 10, ``Hunters of the Sky'' looks at birds of prey,
with over 70 mounted specimens of falcons, eagles, owls and other
raptors. The center, at 777 East Princeton St., is open daily;
(407) 896-7151.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 3, ``Art of the 20th Century,'' at the Cornell
Fine Arts Museum, on Holt Avenue at Rollins College in Winter Park,
looks at the last 100 years through European and American painting,
sculpture, prints and drawings from the permanent collection. Free
admission; closed Monday. Call (407) 646-2526.
 &HT;    The Orlando Museum of Art, 2416 North Mills Ave. in Loch Haven
Park, will display beadwork, baskets and decorated animal hides
from Kenya, Tanzania and other East African countries. The
exhibition runs through May 27. Admission is $6, seniors and
students $4, ages 4 to 11 $2; closed Monday: (407) 896-4231.
 &HT;    The Orlando-University of Central Florida Shakespeare Festival
begins Sept. 20, with previews of ``The Woman in Black,'' a
Victorian mystery by Stephen Mallatratt, from a book by Susan Hill,
which runs through Oct. 28. Performances are at the Orange County
Historical Museum Theatre in Loch Haven Park, at Princeton and
Mills Avenues in Orlando. Tickets: $7 to $20; (407) 893-4600.
 &HT;    At Disney's Wide World of Sports, adjacent to the theme parks,
the 2000 Junior Olympic Games, the Amateur Athletic Union's top
event, features track and field competition from July 31 through
Aug. 5. The 250-acre complex is off Exit 25B of I-4. Daily general
admission is $9, ages 3 to 9, $7; (407) 939-1505.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    At Discovery Cove, off Exits 27A and 28 of I-4, guests come face
to face with bottlenose dolphins. They can touch the animals, and
trainers allow some patrons to play water games with the dolphins.
The park requires reservations. It employs one staff member for
every five guests to provide supervision for the dolphins, better
service and no waiting lines. Admission is $179 for ages 6 and
older who want to swim with dolphins; ages 3 to 5 and those
skipping a dolphin swim pay $89.
 &HT;    Admission includes a meal outside at the Laguna Grill, use of
snorkeling and beach gear (towels, chairs, hammocks), and a
seven-day pass to the original SeaWorld park nearby, where visitors
can see Shamu and ride the Kraken, a roller coaster that made its
debut last month; (877) 434-7268.
 &HT;    Otherwise, ticket prices are one area where Orlando's theme
parks don't show variety. Prices for a one-day, one-park ticket for
ages 10 and up at Disney World's theme parks are $46; ages 3 to 9,
$37. The Magic Kingdom and Disney-MGM Studios are off Exit 25B;
Epcot and Animal Kingdom, Exit 26B. For all Disney parks
information: (407) 824-4321.
 &HT;    Ticket prices are the same at SeaWorld, at Exits 27A and 28,
(407) 351-3600; and Universal, at Exits 30A and 29B, (407)
363-8000. Various multipark and multiday tickets are also
available.
 &HT;    The theme-park attractions with the highest profile _ in the
physical sense _ are roller coasters, and Orlando boasts a crop of
wild new ones. SeaWorld's Kraken rises 15 stories, then plunges its
screaming passengers toward earth at 65 m.p.h. Riders on the
Incredible Hulk are practically blown out of the starting gate from
what looks like a giant missile launcher at Universal's Islands of
Adventure park, which opened in May 1999.
 &HT;    The Rock 'n' Roller Coaster at Disney-MGM Studios, which opened
a year ago, treats its riders to an equally explosive start,
accelerating from zero to 60 m.p.h. in 2.8 seconds, with the music
of the band Aerosmith pumped through the seats.
 &HT;    A simulator game that pits guests of DisneyQuest, an indoor
interactive playground, against the same motley gang from the
Pirates of the Caribbean ride opened June 21 outside the park in
Downtown Disney. Four players, all wearing three-dimensional
goggles, board a sailing ship under attack (its deck sickeningly
weaves and rolls on springs controlled by computer) and defend
themselves with cannons. Tickets cost $27, ages 3 to 9, $21.
 &HT;    Universal's ``Terminator 2,'' a film that opened in 1996 at
Universal Studios Theme Park, involves three-dimensional thrills
and bizarre special effects, including fog and rain. It's the usual
end-of-the-world scenario, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, complete
with realistic guns booming and screeching pileups.
 &HT;    One of the most elegant new rides is the beautiful interactive
carousel of Dr. Seuss animals _ pull the reins and hair might fly
up or a tongue stick out _ at Islands of Adventure. The bright pink
and blue carousel is based on the art of Dr. Seuss.
 &HT;    One park that has no problem with crowds is Splendid China, a
76-acre park opened in 1993 by a Chinese company to acquaint
Americans with the country's culture. It features nearly deserted
gardens with more than 60 miniature models of historical Chinese
sites.
 &HT;    Sparse crowds usually greet its chief daily theatrical
production, the ``Mysterious Kingdom of the Orient'' _ a pity since
it is a knockout performance of colorful costumes, traditional
Chinese song and dance, acrobatics and martial arts. Follow Route
192 west from I-4 to Exit 25B in Kissimmee (directions and ticket
information from park employees may be incorrect). Admission costs,
which include the show and a terrible meal, are $19.95, and $9.95
ages 5 to 12. Call (407) 396-7111 or (800) 244-6226.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    It's always easier to park your car and stay on the grounds of a
theme park, but hotels and food usually cost more. A moderately
priced choice is Disney's All-Star Resorts, at Exit 26B of I-4,
with a mammoth complex of 5,760 basic rooms with outdoor pools,
bakery, food court and free bus service to Disney attractions.
Rooms are $74 to $104 a night; (407) 934-7639.
 &HT;    Minutes east of the theme parks is the Hampton Inn-Orlando
Convention Center hotel, 8900 Universal Blvd., which opened in
April 1999. The staff is helpful and friendly; there is a heated
outdoor pool; the free Continental breakfast includes cereals,
bagels, yogurt, fruit and waffles; and the 170 spotless rooms, with
maple furniture and decorated in bright, tropical colors, are $69
to $109, depending on the season; (407) 354-4447, fax (407)
354-3031.
 &HT;    Budget: A simple hotel tucked away off Interstate 4, the Comfort
Inn Maingate South is an easy 15-minute ride from most of the theme
parks. It is off I-4 Exit 23, eight miles west of Walt Disney World
at 5510 U.S. Highway 27 North. Its 150 rooms cost $40 to $100, more
on holidays; outdoor pool; (800) 255-4386, fax (863) 424-1723.
 &HT;    Luxury: Elegant, sand-colored Italian marble and huge bouquets
of native orchids give the lobby of the Peabody Orlando, 9801
International Drive, a distinctive Florida feel, and it's fun to
watch the hotel's mascot ducks cavort in the fountain. Its 891
modern rooms are decorated in yellow and moss green; doubles are
$330 a night; outdoor pool and children's pool with waterfall;
(407) 352-4000, fax (407) 351-0073.
 &HT;    The Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, Disney's sprawling
Victorian-style hotel, boasts 900 quaint rooms, decorated with
printed wall coverings, marble-top sinks, ceiling fans and
Victorian woodwork. Big gingerbread porches with climbing roses
overlook a lagoon on theme park grounds with a man-made beach and
two outdoor pools, one for children. Off Exit 25B. Doubles are $304
to $400; (407) 824-3000, fax (407) 824-3186.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    At Universal's CityWalk, a 30-acre dining and entertainment
complex, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville is (what else?) completely
casual. Try conch fritters dipped in honey-mustard sauce, followed
by Caribbean grilled chicken salad, topped with almonds and
habanero-mango ranch dressing, and key lime pie for dessert. Dinner
for two with margaritas, about $50; (407) 224-2155.
 &HT;    Nearby, also at CityWalk, you'll find Emeril's, the Orlando
branch of a series of restaurants owned by the popular TV chef
Emeril Lagasse. Reservations are recommended. Specialties include
an appetizer of Maine lobster cheesecake; roasted rack of lamb with
a Creole mustard sauce, and fresh Florida orange cake with
strawberry compote. Dinner for two with wine, $125; (407) 224-2424.
 &HT;    Of all the theme parks, SeaWorld serves some of the best food,
and its casual Bimini Bay restaurant, with waiters and waitresses
wearing Hawaiian shirts, is typical. The menu features salads,
pasta and seafood; try the fresh Florida grouper sandwich or
marinated steak on a roll with sauteed onions and peppers. Lunch
for two with beer costs about $40 (you must have a park pass);
(407) 351-3600.
 &HT;    Two sessions of a gospel brunch occur every Sunday morning at
the House of Blues Music Hall, at Downtown Disney (where no park
pass is needed), featuring nationally known and local gospel
performers, and an all-you-can-eat Southern buffet. The meal and
show cost $28; ages 3 to 9, $15. It's a good idea to buy tickets at
least a week in advance at (407) 934-2583, fax (407) 934-2216, or
at the House of Blues box office.
 &HT;    A good family-style restaurant near Walt Disney World is
Pebbles, 12551 State Road 535; (407) 827-1111. It serves a nice mix
of dishes adults enjoy, like the excellent black bean soup ($3.25)
or Mediterranean salad ($7.50), and child-friendly items like the
cheeseburger ($6.95)and white chocolate mousse ($3.95).

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANNASUE MCCLEAVE WILSON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is hard to admit to being a soccer mom. That cliched title is
easier to bear, however, when the games are played on a crescent
moon of a beach in Brazil, where the team kicks up sand as white
and soft as baby powder.
 &HT;    Our family loves soccer, that jogo bonito, ``beautiful game,''
as they call it in Brazil. My son John, 14, has played since
kindergarten, and his coach, Paulo Barreto, is a Brazilian who
played professionally there. His Cincinnati company, Paulo's
Brazilian Soccer Training and Camp, began organizing trips last
year to his hometown, Florianopolis.
 &HT;    The coin toss to see whether my husband, John, or I would
accompany John on a trip there last March was agonizing. Not only
was the trip too expensive for everyone to go, but we would have
had to take our two younger children out of school. I won.
 &HT;    This particular eight-day trip was designed for a team, but not
all of John's team, the Cincinnati Classics, participated, so they
were supplemented by other boys and girls of the same age and
ability from around Cincinnati. Parents were welcome, and of the 17
players, only 5 traveled without a parent, making us a group of 39.
 &HT;    Other camps offer various levels of training and can include
international tournament play for players who hope to play at the
college level and beyond, but this trip offered the right balance
of soccer and vacation for us. Our trip revolved around three
matches with local teams and four morning training sessions, but
equally important was the beachfront hotel and organized afternoon
sightseeing.
 &HT;    Florianopolis, on the island of Santa Catarina, is about 350
miles down the coast from Sao Paulo. Our 24-hour trip was not made
easier by the way we were routed by the travel agency _ through
Detroit, Miami and Sao Paulo _ but the teenagers seemed oblivious
to the inconvenience.
 &HT;    When they weren't giving water to thirsty dogs in travel cages
or bumping into airport police officers on bikes, they managed to
find enough open space at each stopover to kick around a soccer
ball. In Sao Paulo, they sprawled over the floor of the airport
terminal, lounging or sleeping on backpacks.
 &HT;    Several in our group thought the island of Santa Catarina, on
which most of the city of Florianopolis is built, looked like one
of the islands of Hawaii from the air. The hilly countryside is
laden with subtropical flora, and both land and sea are dotted with
ancient black boulders that must have looked like gods to the
Tupi-Guarani Indians who first inhabited the region. The island is
connected to the mainland by two bridges, although one, the
Hercilio Luz, is closed to motor traffic.
 &HT;    Our bright blue hotel, the Ingleses Praia, sat beside a beach
called Praia dos Ingleses, on the northeast shore of the island,
about 22 miles from downtown Florianopolis. The beach was named for
English explorers who poked around there about 1700. Each room had
a balcony, cool tile floors, air-conditioning and surprisingly
spacious bathrooms.
 &HT;    We ate breakfast and occasionally another meal at the hotel,
buffet style. Fruits and juices were fresh and delicious, but all
else paled in the morning before the coffee. It was deeply rich and
black, served with hot milk.
 &HT;    Our first evening at the hotel, the parents in the group were
content to laze wearily on the veranda, drinking caipirinhas, a
lime drink usually made with cachaca, Brazilian sugar-cane liquor.
 &HT;    A few of the boys perused the small strip of beachfront
restaurants and souvenir shops selling T-shirts and crocheted
bikinis and thongs on either side of the hotel (their favorite
souvenirs were fake designer watches, but because the dollar is
strong against the real, almost everything seemed inexpensive).
 &HT;    Afterward, they brought out a ball and began to kick it around
on the beach under the stars. This attracted some local people and
soon a full fledged game was on. Not one Brazilian guy walking
along the beach _ student, vendor or fisherman _ could keep his
foot off the ball if it came near him during our practices, and
their skill was remarkable.
 &HT;    The team's first training session was at the Hotel Fazenda Jomar
on the mainland near Santo Amaro da Imperatriz, a spa town founded
to commemorate an imperial visit in 1845 by Dom Pedro II, emperor
of Brazil. Having traveled inland 18 miles, we were in dense green
mountains, and the group practiced on a field in danger of being
enveloped by the lush vegetation surrounding it.
 &HT;    Afterward, we all took advantage of the resort's amenities. The
team swam in the pool, went rafting in rapids not rapid enough to
be classified, and sank paddle boats in the lake.
 &HT;    On a shaded veranda, an accordionist played German music, a
reminder of the large influx of Germans who emigrated to this part
of Brazil in the 19th century. Several parents joined an ecological
walk around the grounds, which led to a waterfall of rare beauty;
on our way up, we disturbed a lizard the size of a small alligator.
 &HT;    Florianopolis has two professional soccer teams, the Figueirense
Futebol Clube, based on the mainland, and the island's Avai Futebol
Clube, both of which cultivate players from a young age.
 &HT;    After a day of practice and a couple of scrimmages on the beach,
our first match took place against the Figueirense youth team in
the club's stadium in Florianopolis. The Brazilians, who were a
year or two older than John, won, 8-1, which did not seem to
diminish the excitement of playing a challenging opponent.
 &HT;    Our game with the young Avai team two days later took place just
before the professional match between Avai and Caxias (from the
city of Porto Alegre). As the game went on, the stands filled up
with fans who cheered on both teams (we lost, 2-0) but who were
unforgiving of their pro team when it lost.
 &HT;    After the game with Figueirense, our bus took us to the beach at
Joaquina, which is on the east side of the island and is famous for
surfing championships held there each year. After an open-air
lunch, the team wandered the beach, climbing the huge rocks at one
end and examining jellyfish that washed onto the shore.
 &HT;    Behind Praia da Joaquina are massive sand dunes of Saharan
proportion and, even though the wind whipped up the sand so
fiercely it practically blinded them, the team was determined to go
sandboarding. John and the boys happily forged their way up the
dunes over and over again, and dumped their weight in sand onto the
floor of the bus on the way back to the hotel.
 &HT;    The next day, we boarded a schooner and headed for the island of
Anhatomirim, where the team was to practice in the shadow of the
Santa Cruz fort, built in 1744. A Brazilian school group about the
same age as ours happened to be touring the fort, too, and it
wasn't long before another impromptu match was on.
 &HT;    The Brazilian girls watched the American boys with obvious
pleasure, much to the consternation of the Brazilian boys, which
gave the game an edge it might not ordinarily have had.
 &HT;    The Brazilian boys, on the other hand, didn't know what to make
of the four highly skilled girls playing on our team. Only the
parents were in awe of the setting: on one side a centuries-old
fortress and on the other, the magnificent sea.
 &HT;    After morning training another day, the group ventured downtown.
The two bridges to the mainland shadow 19th-century ocher-colored
market buildings along the old waterfront. Across the street from
the Praca 15 de Novembro, the city's main square, John stopped at
the entrance to the pink Cruz e Souza Palace to have his picture
taken beside the guard, who wore an elaborate uniform and held a
rifle with a bayonet.
 &HT;    The team climbed the steps to the bright white Metropolitan
Cathedral, where a Mass was being said, then plopped down
pretending to be exhausted.
 &HT;    Since this day of sightseeing had little appeal for them, the
high point of the excursion was stopping at a shop called Futebol
Mania to buy official Figueirense and Avai jerseys. A few fathers
wandered off to the bus station to find Cuban cigars.
 &HT;    Our meals outside the hotel were in seafood restaurants or in
churrascarias, places serving meat smorgasbords called rodizio (all
you can eat). Seafood lunches were waterside, in open-air
restaurants that served us at long communal tables _ local shrimp
in butter and oil, mussels in salsa, deep-fried whitefish, served
with plates of beets, shredded carrots and tomato, clay pots of
rich black beans, and crisp, deep-fried manioc root.
 &HT;    When Mr. Barreto realized that our ravenous American teen-agers
kept passing on the plates of fish and making faces, he arranged
that they be served chicken with rice and French fries instead.
 &HT;    One evening we were taken to a cafe colonial, a Brazilian-style
high tea inspired by the customs of European immigrants in the 19th
century. On the beach, we snacked on corn on the cob served in the
husk and drank cool milk right from coconuts. The team's favorite
drink was Guarana, sweet green soda with lots of caffeine.
 &HT;    A cultural exchange had been arranged for us the afternoon
before we left at the Colegia Energia, a private school in
Florianopolis that prides itself on its English instruction. When
we arrived, we were met with wild cheers, as if we were a busload
of American movie stars. Our boys were a little stunned at such a
reception and we had to remind them to keep smiling.
 &HT;    The school had prepared a short program and presented each of
our team members with souvenir notebooks. A soccer scrimmage was
held in which our girls soundly beat four Brazilian girls. While
our boys were outclassed on the field, they were mobbed by
Brazilian girls and boys asking for e-mail addresses and
photographs.
 &HT;    Once our team got used to the attention, those who spoke a
little Spanish _ none spoke Portuguese _ tried to talk to the
students, who answered in their halting English.
 &HT;    That evening, we lost our last match, against the Astel Futebol
Clube, but only by a single goal. Once, John collided with an Astel
player, knocking him to the ground. As he would have back home, he
reached down to help the Brazilian to his feet, but was scolded by
Mr. Barreto.
 &HT;    ``Here you leave him alone,'' he said. ``Find him after the game
if you want.''
 &HT;    When we returned to Cincinnati, the team went on to become
division champions, at least partly because of improved soccer
skills. But the trip had also provided the players with a surprise,
the opportunity to represent their country by their actions: How
they played the game did matter.
 &HT;    -----

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY SUSAN ALLEN TOT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When I have finally opened the mail, unpacked my bags, started
the washing machine, restocked the refrigerator and riffled through
a few newspapers, I am ready to stay home forever.
 &HT;    Yes, I realize, I'm totally exhausted. I stroke our cats,
defrost some homemade soup and soon send my husband, James, to his
office so I can luxuriate in having the house to myself. No, I am
not going to travel again for a long time. Months and months, maybe
longer. Who knows when I'll ever be ready to study another
guidebook or decipher another map?
 &HT;    I am tired of looking at menus. I can't bear to sleep in any
more strange bedrooms. I want to forget all those uneasy searches
for public toilets.
 &HT;    Our friends applaud this decision. They think James and I travel
too much anyway.
 &HT;    ``Of course you have a cold,'' one says. ``Everyone knows you
can't travel on a plane without getting sick.'' Another chimes in:
``How can you complain of not getting any writing done? You're
never home.''
 &HT;    Some urge us to slow down, take it easy. Others suggest getting
back to work, enjoying my garden, volunteering for a local charity.
I'm sure they are right. In fact, as I nod in agreement, I feel
morally invigorated.
 &HT;    Travel is a kind of addiction, I tell myself, and I must simply
let it go for a while. I can. I know I can.
 &HT;    Then something happens. If I could predict it, I might be able
to ward it off. But the travel impulse is sly, mysterious and
dazzlingly sudden.
 &HT;    Last December, glad to be home for the holidays after a hectic
trip to London, I was savoring the prospect of quiet weeks ahead.
Then I opened a Christmas card from a family friend in my Iowa
hometown.
 &HT;    Close to 90 now, cheerful and bright but unable to travel,
Isabel wrote: ``You certainly travel a lot. But do keep it up as
long as you can! I wish I had seen York and Cornwall. But I am so
thankful I didn't miss the Alhambra and the Prado.''
 &HT;    The Alhambra! I thought. The Prado! Why is it we've never been
there? Immediately I began to think of Spain. Why not Portugal too?
Perhaps next fall?
 &HT;    A few days later, on New Year's Eve, I was transfixed by the
televised fantasy of fireworks that lit up the bejeweled Eiffel
Tower. Oh, Paris, beautiful City of Light _ had it really been five
years since we'd walked along the Seine?
 &HT;    I could instantly envision broad boulevards, thin women with
chic silk scarves, and a corner patisserie where I bought a moist
round mouthful of chocolate cake with an indescribably delicious
coffee-flavored icing. Definitely, back to Paris.
 &HT;    Cleaning my desk the following week, I took off the wall an
outdated calendar with large color photographs of waterfalls. I
hadn't really noticed it much. But now I was transfixed by a view
of Upper Yosemite Falls, tumbling down magnificent snow-covered
cliffs.
 &HT;    I hadn't been to Yosemite for more than 30 years, and I barely
remembered my one day there. How could I think of Paris, or Spain,
when I hadn't really experienced Yosemite?
 &HT;    I am helpless against unforeseen assaults on my homebound
intentions. Occasionally, when I am already on a trip, I have a
passing glimpse of a destination that calls to me so seductively I
know I must answer.
 &HT;    One June afternoon, on a fast train from Inverness to London, I
glanced, for only a whizzing moment, far across miles of empty
fields to a tiny village of snug houses clustered around a bay. The
surrounding countryside seemed so undiscovered, the village so
remote.
 &HT;    I studied my map: Alnmouth, Northumberland. Three years later,
we were walking through light rain down its long quiet beach.
 &HT;    On another afternoon, this time in early fall, I sat on a level
rock at the northernmost edge of Scotland and gazed, entranced, at
the distant gray-green shapes of the Orkney Islands half-hidden in
the mist. They seemed as if they belonged to a different world.
``James,'' I said, ``we have to go there.''
 &HT;    James smiled, partly in resignation. ``O.K.,'' he said amiably,
``but why don't we finish this trip first?''
 &HT;    Two Octobers later, we rented a cottage for a week on an Orkney
island called, disarmingly, Mainland.
 &HT;    Sometimes all it takes is a single picture or a few words. We
once spent a week near Cromer, on the north Norfolk coast, because
that was the phrase _ ``the north Norfolk coast'' _ occasionally
appearing in travel guides, that had begun to haunt my imagination.
It sounded so unlike the cozy Cotswolds, or the well-trodden and
prosaically named Lake District, or flowering Kent, the Garden of
England.
 &HT;    Then I read P. D. James' ``Devices and Desires,'' and her
intensely evocative description of that bleak, windswept land made
me determined to see if she was right. And she was.
 &HT;    Although P.D. James first sent me to Norfolk, Arthur Conan Doyle
to Dartmoor and Dylan Thomas to Wales, I am not often struck by the
travel impulse when I read nonfiction travel books. This may seem
odd, since I have indulged in such memoirs myself.
 &HT;    But, after closing a particularly atmospheric or vivid travel
narrative, I tend to think: ``OK. Wonderful. Now I've been there.''
 &HT;    If the author has filled my eyes with his or her personal
vision, I am perversely not moved to explore certain corners of
Provence, or Tuscany, or Patagonia.
 &HT;    If, however, I am swept into a place by reading a novel or
biography, I absorb the landscape sidewise, out of the corner of my
eye. Then I become intrigued.
 &HT;    After finishing Tim Binding's ``Lying With the Enemy,'' a novel
about life in occupied Guernsey during World War II, I asked James,
``Why haven't we ever been to the Channel Islands?'' He looked
blank. I handed him the novel, and the next year, we were off.
 &HT;    My love of Scottish islands began, not with a guidebook, but
with Gavin Maxwell's ``Ring of Bright Water,'' an account of life
with his beloved otters.
 &HT;    I soon tracked Maxwell through his later, much harsher, memoirs,
``The Rocks Remain'' and ``Raven Seek Thy Brother,'' and, after
many years, I eventually looked across the water to the lonely site
of his nearly inaccessible Camusfearna.
 &HT;    As James and I walked parts of the rocky coastline of western
Scotland, and explored Mull and Skye that year, I often thought of
Maxwell's intense, troubled spirit. His love of this land had
brought us there.
 &HT;    Or had it? As a young girl, I used to sit at the piano and play
through ``The Fireside Book of Folk Songs.'' One of my favorites
was ``The Skye Boat Song.'' Its simple, poignant melody had an
unforgettable refrain, especially alluring to an Iowa girl who
lived far from any ocean: ``Carry the lad who was born to be
king/Over the sea to Skye.''
 &HT;    I didn't know the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and I had no
idea where Skye was, but I knew loss and regret when I heard it.
Over the sea to Skye: someday perhaps I would know more.
 &HT;    So even a song can start me thinking of travel. After our trip
to Hawaii last winter, James began to play a CD we bought there. He
plays it a lot, especially when it gets really cold outside.
 &HT;    Like James, I had been delighted by our relaxing, balmy week on
Molokai. So when I hear ``Polynesian Love Song'' or ``Lovely Hula
Hands,'' I don't think, ``This is corny.'' No, I want to be back on
our screened lanai, listening to the warm splashing surf a few
yards away.
 &HT;    It doesn't take much. Sometimes I think I should look for an
antidote, but I haven't thought of one yet. Maybe if I muttered
Thoreau's proud boast, ``I have traveled much in Concord''? If I
repeated like a mantra, ``Home is where the heart is''? What about
a CD that played, again and again, ``Home Sweet Home''? I'm not
sure any of it would help.

 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My husband wants adventure, I want a spa with a spiritual
nature and our kids don't fit into either category. Help! Know of a
vacation destination that will meet everyone's needs?
 &HT;     A:  The Enchantment Resort in Sedona, Ariz., and its new
destination spa, Mii Amo, will surely please all. Nestled within a
truly enchanting red-rock canyon, Enchantment offers scenic
relaxation and adventure, as well as Camp Coyote, ranked one of the
best kids programs in the world.
 &HT;    One of Enchantment's treasures is Uqualla, the shaman and former
chief of the Havasupai tribe, who acts as spiritual ambassador for
the resort. While children play and learn about the local cultures,
guests can be pampered by healing oils that are blessed each
morning. Spiritual consultations are available, and the staff
offers an array of innovative spa treatments.
 &HT;    The Enchantment concierge can arrange a variety of hiking and
rock-climbing tours for the adventurous or the mere stroller.
 &HT;    Your family should save an afternoon to fly by helicopter with
Uqualla to his tribe's village at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.
There you can enjoy a swim and picnic at the nearby falls.
 &HT;    At the end of the day, whether your crew is rested or exhausted,
Enchantment's restaurants offer an eclectic selection of spa
cuisine and hearty southwestern fare, as well as an excellent wine
list.
 &HT;    Book now for the holidays to reserve an Enchantment casita or
one of Mii Amo's 16 rooms and suites. Room rates begin at $195 per
night. For more information, call (800) 826-4180 or visit
www.enchantmentresort.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I've always been intrigued by the mystique of Harvard, but
the two times I visited Cambridge I felt like such an outsider. How
can I get a better feel for the place?
 &HT;     A:2 Home to Harvard, MIT and the JFK School of Government,
Cambridge may well be the premiere locale for intellectuals in this
country. Most visiting lecturers and dignitaries stay at the
Charles Hotel on Harvard Square.
 &HT;    Not only is it within walking distance, at times the Charles
Hotel seems like an extension of the Harvard campus. Relax in the
foyer library and watch the comings and goings _ or better yet, ask
the concierge to arrange a private tour of Harvard with a recent
graduate. Often the guide runs into buddies, conversations ensue
and the scene opens before you.
 &HT;    I would suggest arriving early for breakfast at the Charles'
lively Henrietta's Table, where writer David Mamet or Cambridge's
dot.com elite might just be doing business.
 &HT;    Lunch would be a good idea at a popular joint called Bartley's
Burger Cottage (1246 Massachusetts Ave.), but Casablanca (40
Brattle St.), with its fusion Mediterranean cuisine, is a more
original mainstay of Cambridge _ especially in the evening at the
bar.
 &HT;    Room rates at the Charles Hotel begin at $250 per night.
Facilities include a day spa and three-story health-and-fitness
center. For more information, call (800) 882-1818, or visit
www.charleshotel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I have played on golf courses around the world and really
enjoy when courses throw a unique spin into the golfing experience.
Can you suggest a course that offers a bit of originality?
 &HT;     A:  The new ``Heli-Golf Package,'' offered by Rosewood Hotels &AMP;
Resorts in Little Dix Bay in the Virgin Islands, provides the
originality that adventurous golfers look for. This heli-golf
experience features a scenic helicopter flight to St. Croix, where
golfers are deposited right onto the green and are then processed
through customs and immigrations with minimal hassle.
 &HT;    Described as ``the Caribbean's most exclusive golf getaway,''
Little Dix Bay's Heli-Golf Package includes three nights'
accommodation for two; greens fees, cart and golf escort; daily
breakfast and dinner; and complimentary water activities. Rates are
based on double occupancy, with deluxe accommodations starting at
$3,500 and suite accommodations starting at $5,000.
 &HT;    Laurance Rockefeller founded exclusive Little Dix Bay in 1964.
These low-key yet upscale accommodations are set in a 500-acre
garden paradise and a pristine private beach. For more information,
call (888) ROSEWOOD.
 &HT;     Q:  I am a single female who enjoys traveling alone, but
occasionally I feel left out of certain social activities because I
am not part of a couple. Do other independent travelers ever feel
this way?
 &HT;     A:  Some people do _ and, unfortunately, it's usually women.
Because of this, Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines now feature their popular
gentlemen hosts aboard every cruise. With their gracious social
skills and dancing ability, these men are well-known for making
single female passengers feel at ease in all social activities.
 &HT;    Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines offers exhilarating cruises throughout
Africa, the Caribbean, Europe and South America. For more
information and reservations, visit www.eurocruises.com, or call
(800) 688-3876.
 &HT;     Q:  Over the years, I have noticed that some hotels are more
in-tune with the needs of female business travelers than others.
Can you recommend a good hotel that focuses on this segment of the
population?
 &HT;     A:  The Pan Pacific San Francisco recently surveyed female
guests _ focusing on those with business needs _ and has made
several adjustments.
 &HT;    The women who were surveyed reported that females appreciate
softer, more personal touches. For example, minibars are now
stocked with wines by the glass. There are lighter menu choices
available on the 24-hour room-service menu, personal butlers can be
provided and the staff is available to escort female guests to
their rooms. This is just a handful of the amenities that are part
of the hotel's signature luxury service.
 &HT;    For business travelers, the Pan Pacific has added a virtual
office to many rooms. Copy capabilities are now part of the in-room
fax machine, and all guest rooms will soon be wired for high-speed
Internet access. The hotel has also acquired a number of laptop
computers.
 &HT;    The Pan Pacific San Francisco is located just one block from
Union Square and is a cable-car ride away from the city's theater
district, fine restaurants and other tourist attractions. For more
information and reservations, call (800) 533-6465, or visit the web
at www.panpac.com.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The romance of the rails lingers in a handful of deluxe trains
that run on well-orchestrated trips throughout the world.
 &HT;    What's the appeal of such luxury train trips? Vintage rail cars
that have been lavishly restored; itineraries that take passengers
through some of the most beautiful landscapes and cities in the
world; impeccable service; and food that is extraordinary.
 &HT;    For those who can pay the price, here are some elegant journeys
to consider. Prices are per person, based on double occupancy.
 &HT;    The American Spirit (601 Union St., Seattle, WA 98101;
888-533-7245; www.americanspiritrail.com) features 1950s Budd-built
streamliner railcars. The company offers a variety of western
itineraries that include visits to the Glacier, Grand Tetons and
Yellowstone National Parks.
 &HT;    Trips last anywhere from two to nine nights. Accommodations are
in hotels, not on the train, and motorcoaches supplement the rail
service.
 &HT;    A typical itinerary is the ``Montana Rockies Rail Tour,'' which
begins in Post Falls, Idaho, continues on to Missoula, Mont., and
ends in Livingston, Mont. The cost of the two-night trip begins at
$499. Lodging and daily breakfast, as well as transfers from
Spokane Airport, are included.
 &HT;    The American Orient-Express (5100 Main St., Downer's Grove, IL
60515; 888-759-3944; www.americanorientexpress.com) utilizes 15
vintage rail cars on its luxury voyages. The train travels cross
country as well as on shorter trips throughout the West.
 &HT;    For example, the ``Rockies and Yellowstone'' itinerary is a
six-night trip that commences in Denver and visits Arches National
Park, Salt Lake City, Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks.
The cost begins at $2,990.
 &HT;    The best-known name in luxury-train travel is probably
Orient-Express Trains &AMP; Cruises (Sea Containers House, 20 Upper
Ground, London, SE1 9PF, England; 800-524-2420;
www.orient-expresstrains.com or c/o Abercrombie and Kent
International Inc., 1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523;
800-323-7308; www.abercrombiekent.com). They offer a variety of
rail itineraries for the well-heeled traveler.
 &HT;    The most famous trip is the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express
(VSOE), which features restored period rail cars, lavish service
and fine dining. Sightseeing and meals are included in most
itineraries.
 &HT;    The classic VSOE trip is from London to Paris and Venice, or
vice versa. The cost of this one-night trip starts at $1,970. The
train makes other trips as well, such as from Venice to Florence
and Rome; Venice to Prague, Paris and London; Venice to Lucerne,
Paris and London; and Paris to Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul.
 &HT;    Orient-Express also offers the Eastern &AMP; Oriental Express, a
luxury train that has three itineraries: Singapore to Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, and Bangkok (and vice versa); Bangkok to Chiang Mai,
Thailand; and Bangkok to Angkor Wat, Cambodia, and Singapore. The
overnight Singapore to Kuala Lumpur itinerary begins at $600.
 &HT;    Among the other Orient-Express trains are the Northern Belle,
which calls itself the ``Orient-Express of the North.'' It offers
day trips and weekend getaways in Britain with departures from
Liverpool, Manchester and York. Again, vintage rail carriages, fine
dining and a high level of service are offered.
 &HT;    Orient Express also operates the Great South Pacific Express in
Australia, a restored luxury train that runs from Brisbane to
Cairns; Brisbane to Sydney; Brisbane to Canberra and Sydney; and
Sydney to Brisbane and Cairns. Contact them for more information.
 &HT;    The Royal Scotsman (c/o Abercrombie and Kent International Inc.
1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523; 800-323-7308;
www.abercrombiekent.com or www.royalscotsman.com) takes visitors
through the rugged Scottish countryside on some of the beautiful
rails in Britain. The four-night Edinburgh to Edinburgh itinerary
is $4,150.
 &HT;    Beginning in the Scottish capital, the journey takes riders
through the dramatic West Highlands and rolling Perthshire hills
and then to the North East. Two-night trips start at $2,350. Rates
include all meals, wine and alcoholic and beverages as well as
sightseeing visits.
 &HT;    In Canada, the Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (1150 Station St.,
Vancouver, B.C. Canada V6A 2X7; 800-665-7245;
www.rockymountaineer.com) has a variety of trips through the
Canadian Rockies. These trains travel by daylight only, affording
the best views of the mountains. Overnights are spent in hotels.
 &HT;    One of the briefest excursions is the ``Two Day Redleaf Tour,''
a one-night trip through the Canadian Rockies, traveling from
Vancouver to either Jasper, Alberta, or Calgary, Alberta, with an
overnight hotel stay in Kamloops, Alberta. Prices start at $358 per
person and include the overnight stay and some meals.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Like anyone living in a popular tourist destination, I developed
a standard tour itinerary years ago for my out-of-town friends who
wish to see all that Reno, Nev., has to offer.
 &HT;    Because Reno is known for gaming, most of my visitors want to
stop at a casino to try their luck at gambling or to see a show.
But it doesn't take long for the area's natural beauty to weave its
magic. Even in midsummer, the snow-dappled Sierra Nevada set
against the clear blue sky is like a magnet for sightseers.
 &HT;    My personal tour starts in Truckee, home of the Donner Memorial
Museum, (530) 582-7892, that tells the heartbreaking story of the
Donner Party who were trapped in the Sierra Nevada during one of
our area's worst winters.
 &HT;    Then it's up Route 89 to Tahoe City for a stop at Fanny Bridge
overlooking the Truckee River. Fanny Bridge gets its name from the
poses people strike as they lean over the bridge to watch the giant
trout swim below.
 &HT;    A driving tour of Carson City, the capital of Nevada, is next.
Then, depending on the mood of the group, we head west to Genoa _
reputedly Nevada's first settlement and home of the state's oldest
saloon _ or east to Virginia City _ where the rich ore deposits of
this lavish boomtown helped finance Union efforts in the Civil War
and buy Nevada early statehood.
 &HT;    A visit to Reno wouldn't be complete without a walk along the
Truckee River and downtown _ usually with a stop at the National
Auto Museum _ and a meal at a Basque hotel, where ethnic fare is
served family-style at long tables.
 &HT;    But beware: If a Basque meal strikes your fancy, be prepared to
eat. A lot. The food is served in a series of seemingly endless
courses, giving diners ample time to visit with table mates who may
hail from other parts of the city, country or world.
 &HT;    A drive to Pyramid Lake, just northeast of Reno and famous for
being the location where Charleton Heston was filmed parting the
Red Sea in the ``The Ten Commandments,'' usually tops off my
official tour.
 &HT;    Recently, when I took a group of out-of-towners on a sightseeing
trip of the city, I realized how outdated my tour route had become.
All the sites I've mentioned are indeed worth visiting, but now
there's so much more to explore.
 &HT;    For example, a trip to Pyramid Lake and Paiute Indian
Reservation's Fish Hatchery, (775) 476-0500, where one can see how
prehistoric cui-ui fish are being saved, now can include a stop at
the new Tribal Museum and a visit to the Bureau of Land
Management's Wild Horse Adoption Center, (775) 475-2222 or
www.blm.gov/whb. Horses from Nevada's vast open spaces are brought
and kept here until people adopt them.
 &HT;    The Truckee River, with its 100-mile ribbon of rapids that lead
from Lake Tahoe down to Pyramid Lake, always has been a vital part
of my tour. Now, it's even more important.
 &HT;    Downtown Reno is where the Truckee River intersects with
Virginia Street, the town's main drag. It's home to many new
developments, including:
 &HT;    _ A walk with promenades for special events, such as ballet and
symphony performances.
 &HT;    _ Riverside paths, a favorite with bikers and hikers.
Eventually, these will run the length of the city once development
is completed.
 &HT;    _ Many unique Riverfront buildings, including the Riverside
Hotel and Casino, which is being converted into lofts and studios;
Christ Scientist Church, which is becoming the Lear Theater; and
McKinley School, which has been restored as an arts-and-cultural
center.
 &HT;    Some developments have new twists, such as the bluff overlooking
the south side of the Truckee River, where Reno's elite built homes
in what is now called the Newlands area. These days, local
residents involved in historic preservation lead tours of the area,
mostly for Elderhostel students, (877) 426-8056 or
www.elderhostel.org. Special group tours can be arranged by calling
the Historic Reno Preservation Society, (775) 322-1638.
 &HT;    At the other end of Virginia Street is the town's signature
landmark, an overhead street sign that proclaims Reno as ``The
Biggest Little City in the World.'' This is the fourth version of
the sign, which during World War II served as a landmark for
veterans heading home from the Pacific.
 &HT;    Two models of the sign adorn downtown. The newest is known to
turn green on St. Patrick's Day or go dark during Christmas carol
sing-alongs, while the other model is mounted outside the National
Auto Museum on Lake Street.
 &HT;    West of Reno, my tour now includes a stop at Chrissie Caughlin
Park beside the Truckee River. It's a place I have walked my
miniature schnauzers for years, but I now know that pioneers
traveling in covered wagons used a large pine tree, roughly four
feet in diameter, as their ``post office'' and stuck notes for
other immigrants on its trunk.
 &HT;    Further west, it's possible to take a look-see at the
still-visible tracks of the Donner Party wagon train on either side
of Dog Valley Road near a small town called Verdi.
 &HT;    Reno is rich in history, from miners searching for quick riches
and pioneers hurrying to reach California, to railroaders laying
the train tracks that would stitch together the North American
continent. For decades, it stood as an oasis for people traveling
to other places.
 &HT;    Now, Reno is no longer just a pass-through town. In fact, the
place that's so dear to my heart has finally become a fascinating
vacation destination in its own right.
 &HT;    For more information Reno, call (800) 367-7366 or visit

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By SARA KENNEDY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If competition breeds creativity, then the theme parks in and
around Orlando are a case in point. They have some of the most
imaginative ways for guests to spend their leisure time. Everything
from a roller coaster that shoots its human cargo from the starting
gate with all the subtlety of a missile launcher to a beautiful
carousel based on the art of Dr. Seuss greet visitors to Orlando
theme parks this summer.
 &HT;    Vacationers will also find an entirely new park, SeaWorld's
Discovery Cove, which opened July 1. It features a tropical, beachy
setting populated with 10,000 fish and 300 birds. Guests can play
with dolphins under the supervision of trainers, and enjoy
leisurely swimming, snorkeling and sunning with smaller crowds and
no lines, thanks to a daily limit of 1,000 patrons.
 &HT;    Orlando's theme parks, which last year attracted more than 60
million visitors (up from 48.5 million in 1996), are trying to
handle the crush of crowds better. Discovery Cove's competitors are
trying various ways to cut down waiting lines, a chief complaint of
theme park customers.
 &HT;    Walt Disney World has inaugurated Fastpass, in which guests can
pick up free tickets near its 18 most popular attractions for later
in the day when the lines are shorter. Universal is testing a
similar arrangement called Fast Track. Disney also opens a
different theme park early each day, offering first admittance to
guests at Disney hotels. Until Sept. 4, Universal is rewarding
multiday ticket holders and its hotel guests with early entry to
its two parks, from 7 to 10 a.m. daily.
 &HT;    A spring drought that fueled wildfires and meant watering
restrictions for millions of Floridians seems to have left the
theme parks unscathed. During visits in June, pathways were lined
with bright blooms of bougainvillea and hibiscus, big shade trees
were heavy with foliage, and the acres of perfectly trimmed grass
were as lush as always.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Theme parks aren't the only show in Orlando, believe it or not.
Although the calendar of special events seems to thin out a bit in
summer, diversions exist elsewhere in the city.
 &HT;    This summer, audience members help solve a mystery set in deep
space at the Orlando Science Center's planetarium. Performances,
which run through Aug. 31, feature a planetarium show and a live
actor. It's based on the PBS geographical quiz show ``Where in the
World Is Carmen San Diego,'' and is included with admission to the
center: $14.25, seniors $13.25, ages 3 to 11 $11.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 10, ``Hunters of the Sky'' looks at birds of prey,
with over 70 mounted specimens of falcons, eagles, owls and other
raptors. The center, at 777 East Princeton St., is open daily;
(407) 896-7151.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 3, ``Art of the 20th Century,'' at the Cornell
Fine Arts Museum, on Holt Avenue at Rollins College in Winter Park,
looks at the last 100 years through European and American painting,
sculpture, prints and drawings from the permanent collection. Free
admission; closed Monday. Call (407) 646-2526.
 &HT;    The Orlando Museum of Art, 2416 North Mills Ave. in Loch Haven
Park, will display beadwork, baskets and decorated animal hides
from Kenya, Tanzania and other East African countries. The
exhibition runs through May 27. Admission is $6, seniors and
students $4, ages 4 to 11 $2; closed Monday: (407) 896-4231.
 &HT;    The Orlando-University of Central Florida Shakespeare Festival
begins Sept. 20, with previews of ``The Woman in Black,'' a
Victorian mystery by Stephen Mallatratt, from a book by Susan Hill,
which runs through Oct. 28. Performances are at the Orange County
Historical Museum Theatre in Loch Haven Park, at Princeton and
Mills Avenues in Orlando. Tickets: $7 to $20; (407) 893-4600.
 &HT;    At Disney's Wide World of Sports, adjacent to the theme parks,
the 2000 Junior Olympic Games, the Amateur Athletic Union's top
event, features track and field competition from July 31 through
Aug. 5. The 250-acre complex is off Exit 25B of I-4. Daily general
admission is $9, ages 3 to 9, $7; (407) 939-1505.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    At Discovery Cove, off Exits 27A and 28 of I-4, guests come face
to face with bottlenose dolphins. They can touch the animals, and
trainers allow some patrons to play water games with the dolphins.
The park requires reservations. It employs one staff member for
every five guests to provide supervision for the dolphins, better
service and no waiting lines. Admission is $179 for ages 6 and
older who want to swim with dolphins; ages 3 to 5 and those
skipping a dolphin swim pay $89.
 &HT;    Admission includes a meal outside at the Laguna Grill, use of
snorkeling and beach gear (towels, chairs, hammocks), and a
seven-day pass to the original SeaWorld park nearby, where visitors
can see Shamu and ride the Kraken, a roller coaster that made its
debut last month; (877) 434-7268.
 &HT;    Otherwise, ticket prices are one area where Orlando's theme
parks don't show variety. Prices for a one-day, one-park ticket for
ages 10 and up at Disney World's theme parks are $46; ages 3 to 9,
$37. The Magic Kingdom and Disney-MGM Studios are off Exit 25B;
Epcot and Animal Kingdom, Exit 26B. For all Disney parks
information: (407) 824-4321.
 &HT;    Ticket prices are the same at SeaWorld, at Exits 27A and 28,
(407) 351-3600; and Universal, at Exits 30A and 29B, (407)
363-8000. Various multipark and multiday tickets are also
available.
 &HT;    The theme-park attractions with the highest profile _ in the
physical sense _ are roller coasters, and Orlando boasts a crop of
wild new ones. SeaWorld's Kraken rises 15 stories, then plunges its
screaming passengers toward earth at 65 m.p.h. Riders on the
Incredible Hulk are practically blown out of the starting gate from
what looks like a giant missile launcher at Universal's Islands of
Adventure park, which opened in May 1999.
 &HT;    The Rock 'n' Roller Coaster at Disney-MGM Studios, which opened
a year ago, treats its riders to an equally explosive start,
accelerating from zero to 60 m.p.h. in 2.8 seconds, with the music
of the band Aerosmith pumped through the seats.
 &HT;    A simulator game that pits guests of DisneyQuest, an indoor
interactive playground, against the same motley gang from the
Pirates of the Caribbean ride opened June 21 outside the park in
Downtown Disney. Four players, all wearing three-dimensional
goggles, board a sailing ship under attack (its deck sickeningly
weaves and rolls on springs controlled by computer) and defend
themselves with cannons. Tickets cost $27, ages 3 to 9, $21.
 &HT;    Universal's ``Terminator 2,'' a film that opened in 1996 at
Universal Studios Theme Park, involves three-dimensional thrills
and bizarre special effects, including fog and rain. It's the usual
end-of-the-world scenario, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, complete
with realistic guns booming and screeching pileups.
 &HT;    One of the most elegant new rides is the beautiful interactive
carousel of Dr. Seuss animals _ pull the reins and hair might fly
up or a tongue stick out _ at Islands of Adventure. The bright pink
and blue carousel is based on the art of Dr. Seuss.
 &HT;    One park that has no problem with crowds is Splendid China, a
76-acre park opened in 1993 by a Chinese company to acquaint
Americans with the country's culture. It features nearly deserted
gardens with more than 60 miniature models of historical Chinese
sites.
 &HT;    Sparse crowds usually greet its chief daily theatrical
production, the ``Mysterious Kingdom of the Orient'' _ a pity since
it is a knockout performance of colorful costumes, traditional
Chinese song and dance, acrobatics and martial arts. Follow Route
192 west from I-4 to Exit 25B in Kissimmee (directions and ticket
information from park employees may be incorrect). Admission costs,
which include the show and a terrible meal, are $19.95, and $9.95
ages 5 to 12. Call (407) 396-7111 or (800) 244-6226.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    It's always easier to park your car and stay on the grounds of a
theme park, but hotels and food usually cost more. A moderately
priced choice is Disney's All-Star Resorts, at Exit 26B of I-4,
with a mammoth complex of 5,760 basic rooms with outdoor pools,
bakery, food court and free bus service to Disney attractions.
Rooms are $74 to $104 a night; (407) 934-7639.
 &HT;    Minutes east of the theme parks is the Hampton Inn-Orlando
Convention Center hotel, 8900 Universal Blvd., which opened in
April 1999. Te staff is helpful and friendly; there is a heated
outdoor pool; the free Continental breakfast includes cereals,
bagels, yogurt, fruit and waffles; and the 170 spotless rooms, with
maple furniture and decorated in bright, tropical colors, are $69
to $109, depending on the season; (407) 354-4447, fax (407)
354-3031.
 &HT;    Budget: A simple hotel tucked away off Interstate 4, the Comfort
Inn Maingate South is an easy 15-minute ride from most of the theme
parks. It is off I-4 Exit 23, eight miles west of Walt Disney World
at 5510 U.S. Highway 27 North. Its 150 rooms cost $40 to $100, more
on holidays; outdoor pool; (800) 255-4386, fax (863) 424-1723.
 &HT;    Luxury: Elegant, sand-colored Italian marble and huge bouquets
of native orchids give the lobby of the Peabody Orlando, 9801
International Drive, a distinctive Florida feel, and it's fun to
watch the hotel's mascot ducks cavort in the fountain. Its 891
modern rooms are decorated in yellow and moss green; doubles are
$330 a night; outdoor pool and children's pool with waterfall;
(407) 352-4000, fax (407) 351-0073.
 &HT;    The Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, Disney's sprawling
Victorian-style hotel, boasts 900 quaint rooms, decorated with
printed wall coverings, marble-top sinks, ceiling fans and
Victorian woodwork. Big gingerbread porches with climbing roses
overlook a lagoon on theme park grounds with a man-made beach and
two outdoor pools, one for children. Off Exit 25B. Doubles are $304
to $400; (407) 824-3000, fax (407) 824-3186.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    At Universal's CityWalk, a 30-acre dining and entertainment
complex, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville is (what else?) completely
casual. Try conch fritters dipped in honey-mustard sauce, followed
by Caribbean grilled chicken salad, topped with almonds and
habanero-mango ranch dressing, and key lime pie for dessert. Dinner
for two with margaritas, about $50; (407) 224-2155.
 &HT;    Nearby, also at CityWalk, you'll find Emeril's, the Orlando
branch of a series of restaurants owned by the popular TV chef
Emeril Lagasse. Reservations are recommended. Specialties include
an appetizer of Maine lobster cheesecake; roasted rack of lamb with
a Creole mustard sauce, and fresh Florida orange cake with
strawberry compote. Dinner for two with wine, $125; (407) 224-2424.
 &HT;    Of all the theme parks, SeaWorld serves some of the best food,
and its casual Bimini Bay restaurant, with waiters and waitresses
wearing Hawaiian shirts, is typical. The menu features salads,
pasta and seafood; try the fresh Florida grouper sandwich or
marinated steak on a roll with sauteed onions and peppers. Lunch
for two with beer costs about $40 (you must have a park pass);
(407) 351-3600.
 &HT;    Two sessions of a gospel brunch occur every Sunday morning at
the House of Blues Music Hall, at Downtown Disney (where no park
pass is needed), featuring nationally known and local gospel
performers, and an all-you-can-eat Southern buffet. The meal and
show cost $28; ages 3 to 9, $15. It's a good idea to buy tickets at
least a week in advance at (407) 934-2583, fax (407) 934-2216, or
at the House of Blues box office.
 &HT;    A good family-style restaurant near Walt Disney World is
Pebbles, 12551 State Road 535; (407) 827-1111. It serves a nice mix
of dishes adults enjoy, like the excellent black bean soup ($3.25)
or Mediterranean salad ($7.50), and child-friendly items like the
cheeseburger ($6.95)and white chocolate mousse ($3.95).

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANNASUE MCCLEAVE WILSON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is hard to admit to being a soccer mom. That cliched title is
easier to bear, however, when the games are played on a crescent
moon of a beach in Brazil, where the team kicks up sand as white
and soft as baby powder.
 &HT;    Our family loves soccer, that jogo bonito, ``beautiful game,''
as they call it in Brazil. My son John, 14, has played since
kindergarten, and his coach, Paulo Barreto, is a Brazilian who
played professionally there. His Cincinnati company, Paulo's
Brazilian Soccer Training and Camp, began organizing trips last
year to his hometown, Florianopolis.
 &HT;    The coin toss to see whether my husband, John, or I would
accompany John on a trip there last March was agonizing. Not only
was the trip too expensive for everyone to go, but we would have
had to take our two younger children out of school. I won.
 &HT;    This particular eight-day trip was designed for a team, but not
all of John's team, the Cincinnati Classics, participated, so they
were supplemented by other boys and girls of the same age and
ability from around Cincinnati. Parents were welcome, and of the 17
players, only 5 traveled without a parent, making us a group of 39.
 &HT;    Other camps offer various levels of training and can include
international tournament play for players who hope to play at the
college level and beyond, but this trip offered the right balance
of soccer and vacation for us. Our trip revolved around three
matches with local teams and four morning training sessions, but
equally important was the beachfront hotel and organized afternoon
sightseeing.
 &HT;    Florianopolis, on the island of Santa Catarina, is about 350
miles down the coast from Sao Paulo. Our 24-hour trip was not made
easier by the way we were routed by the travel agency _ through
Detroit, Miami and Sao Paulo _ but the teenagers seemed oblivious
to the inconvenience.
 &HT;    When they weren't giving water to thirsty dogs in travel cages
or bumping into airport police officers on bikes, they managed to
find enough open space at each stopover to kick around a soccer
ball. In Sao Paulo, they sprawled over the floor of the airport
terminal, lounging or sleeping on backpacks.
 &HT;    Several in our group thought the island of Santa Catarina, on
which most of the city of Florianopolis is built, looked like one
of the islands of Hawaii from the air. The hilly countryside is
laden with subtropical flora, and both land and sea are dotted with
ancient black boulders that must have looked like gods to the
Tupi-Guarani Indians who first inhabited the region. The island is
connected to the mainland by two bridges, although one, the
Hercilio Luz, is closed to motor traffic.
 &HT;    Our bright blue hotel, the Ingleses Praia, sat beside a beach
called Praia dos Ingleses, on the northeast shore of the island,
about 22 miles from downtown Florianopolis. The beach was named for
English explorers who poked around there about 1700. Each room had
a balcony, cool tile floors, air-conditioning and surprisingly
spacious bathrooms.
 &HT;    We ate breakfast and occasionally another meal at the hotel,
buffet style. Fruits and juices were fresh and delicious, but all
else paled in the morning before the coffee. It was deeply rich and
black, served with hot milk.
 &HT;    Our first evening at the hotel, the parents in the group were
content to laze wearily on the veranda, drinking caipirinhas, a
lime drink usually made with cachaca, Brazilian sugar-cane liquor.
 &HT;    A few of the boys perused the small strip of beachfront
restaurants and souvenir shops selling T-shirts and crocheted
bikinis and thongs on either side of the hotel (their favorite
souvenirs were fake designer watches, but because the dollar is
strong against the real, almost everything seemed inexpensive).
 &HT;    Afterward, they brought out a ball and began to kick it around
on the beach under the stars. This attracted some local people and
soon a full fledged game was on. Not one Brazilian guy walking
along the beach _ student, vendor or fisherman _ could keep his
foot off the ball if it came near him during our practices, and
their skill was remarkable.
 &HT;    The team's first training session was at the Hotel Fazenda Jomar
on the mainland near Santo Amaro da Imperatriz, a spa town founded
to commemorate an imperial visit in 1845 by Dom Pedro II, emperor
of Brazil. Having traveled inland 18 miles, we were in dense green
mountains, and the group practiced on a field in danger of being
enveloped by the lush vegetation surrounding it.
 &HT;    Afterward, we all took advantage of the resort's amenities. The
team swam in the pool, went rafting in rapids not rapid enough to
be classified, and sank paddle boats in the lake.
 &HT;    On a shaded veranda, an accordionist played German music, a
reminder of the large influx of Germans who emigrated to this part
of Brazil in the 19th century. Several parents joined an ecological
walk around the grounds, which led to a waterfall of rare beauty;
on our way up, we disturbed a lizard the size of a small alligator.
 &HT;    Florianopolis has two professional soccer teams, the Figueirense
Futebol Clube, based on the mainland, and the island's Avai Futebol
Clube, both of which cultivate players from a young age.
 &HT;    After a day of practice and a couple of scrimmages on the beach,
our first match took place against the Figueirense youth team in
the club's stadium in Florianopolis. The Brazilians, who were a
year or two older than John, won, 8-1, which did not seem to
diminish the excitement of playing a challenging opponent.
 &HT;    Our game with the young Avai team two days later took place just
before the professional match between Avai and Caxias (from the
city of Porto Alegre). As the game went on, the stands filled up
with fans who cheered on both teams (we lost, 2-0) but who were
unforgiving of their pro team when it lost.
 &HT;    After the game with Figueirense, our bus took us to the beach at
Joaquina, which is on the east side of the island and is famous for
surfing championships held there each year. After an open-air
lunch, the team wandered the beach, climbing the huge rocks at one
end and examining jellyfish that washed onto the shore.
 &HT;    Behind Praia da Joaquina are massive sand dunes of Saharan
proportion and, even though the wind whipped up the sand so
fiercely it practically blinded them, the team was determined to go
sandboarding. John and the boys happily forged their way up the
dunes over and over again, and dumped their weight in sand onto the
floor of the bus on the way back to the hotel.
 &HT;    The next day, we boarded a schooner and headed for the island of
Anhatomirim, where the team was to practice in the shadow of the
Santa Cruz fort, built in 1744. A Brazilian school group about the
same age as ours happened to be touring the fort, too, and it
wasn't long before another impromptu match was on.
 &HT;    The Brazilian girls watched the American boys with obvious
pleasure, much to the consternation of the Brazilian boys, which
gave the game an edge it might not ordinarily have had.
 &HT;    The Brazilian boys, on the other hand, didn't know what to make
of the four highly skilled girls playing on our team. Only the
parents were in awe of the setting: on one side a centuries-old
fortress and on the other, the magnificent sea.
 &HT;    After morning training another day, the group ventured downtown.
The two bridges to the mainland shadow 19th-century ocher-colored
market buildings along the old waterfront. Across the street from
the Praca 15 de Novembro, the city's main square, John stopped at
the entrance to the pink Cruz e Souza Palace to have his picture
taken beside the guard, who wore an elaborate uniform and held a
rifle with a bayonet.
 &HT;    The team climbed the steps to the bright white Metropolitan
Cathedral, where a Mass was being said, then plopped down
pretending to be exhausted.
 &HT;    Since this day of sightseeing had little appeal for them, the
high point of the excursion was stopping at a shop called Futebol
Mania to buy official Figueirense and Avai jerseys. A few fathers
wandered off to the bus station to find Cuban cigars.
 &HT;    Our meals outside the hotel were in seafood restaurants or in
churrascarias, places serving meat smorgasbords called rodizio (all
you can eat). Seafood lunches were waterside, in open-air
restaurants that served us at long communal tables _ local shrimp
in butter and oil, mussels in salsa, deep-fried whitefish, served
with plates of beets, shredded carrots and tomato, clay pots of
rich black beans, and crisp, deep-fried manioc root.
 &HT;    When Mr. Barreto realized that our ravenous American teen-agers
kept passing on the plates of fish and making faces, he arranged
that they be served chicken with rice and French fries instead.
 &HT;    One evening we were taken to a cafe colonial, a Brazilian-style
high tea inspired by the customs of European immigrants in the 19th
century. On the beach, we snacked on corn on the cob served in the
husk and drank cool milk right from coconuts. The team's favorite
drink was Guarana, sweet green soda with lots of caffeine.
 &HT;    A cultural exchange had been arranged for us the afternoon
before we left at the Colegia Energia, a private school in
Florianopolis that prides itself on its English instruction. When
we arrived, we were met with wild cheers, as if we were a busload
of American movie stars. Our boys were a little stunned at such a
reception and we had to remind them to keep smiling.
 &HT;    The school had prepared a short program and presented each of
our team members with souvenir notebooks. A soccer scrimmage was
held in which our girls soundly beat four Brazilian girls. While
our boys were outclassed on the field, they were mobbed by
Brazilian girls and boys asking for e-mail addresses and
photographs.
 &HT;    Once our team got used to the attention, those who spoke a
little Spanish _ none spoke Portuguese _ tried to talk to the
students, who answered in their halting English.
 &HT;    That evening, we lost our last match, against the Astel Futebol
Clube, but only by a single goal. Once, John collided with an Astel
player, knocking him to the ground. As he would have back home, he
reached down to help the Brazilian to his feet, but was scolded by
Mr. Barreto.
 &HT;    ``Here you leave him alone,'' he said. ``Find him after the game
if you want.''
 &HT;    When we returned to Cincinnati, the team went on to become
division champions, at least partly because of improved soccer
skills. But the trip had also provided the players with a surprise,
the opportunity to represent their country by their actions: How
they played the game did matter.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY SUSAN ALLEN TOTH  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When I have finally opened the mail, unpacked my bags, started
the washing machine, restocked the refrigerator and riffled through
a few newspapers, I am ready to stay home forever.
 &HT;    Yes, I realize, I'm totally exhausted. I stroke our cats,
defrost some homemade soup and soon send my husband, James, to his
office so I can luxuriate in having the house to myself. No, I am
not going to travel again for a long time. Months and months, maybe
longer. Who knows when I'll ever be ready to study another
guidebook or decipher another map?
 &HT;    I am tired of looking at menus. I can't bear to sleep in any
more strange bedrooms. I want to forget all those uneasy searches
for public toilets.
 &HT;    Our friends applaud this decision. They think James and I travel
too much anyway.
 &HT;    ``Of course you have a cold,'' one says. ``Everyone knows you
can't travel on a plane without getting sick.'' Another chimes in:
``How can you complain of not getting any writing done? You're
never home.''
 &HT;    Some urge us to slow down, take it easy. Others suggest getting
back to work, enjoying my garden, volunteering for a local charity.
I'm sure they are right. In fact, as I nod in agreement, I feel
morally invigorated.
 &HT;    Travel is a kind of addiction, I tell myself, and I must simply
let it go for a while. I can. I know I can.
 &HT;    Then something happens. If I could predict it, I might be able
to ward it off. But the travel impulse is sly, mysterious and
dazzlingly sudden.
 &HT;    Last December, glad to be home for the holidays after a hectic
trip to London, I was savoring the prospect of quiet weeks ahead.
Then I opened a Christmas card from a family friend in my Iowa
hometown.
 &HT;    Close to 90 now, cheerful and bright but unable to travel,
Isabel wrote: ``You certainly travel a lot. But do keep it up as
long as you can! I wish I had seen York and Cornwall. But I am so
thankful I didn't miss the Alhambra and the Prado.''
 &HT;    The Alhambra! I thought. The Prado! Why is it we've never been
there? Immediately I began to think of Spain. Why not Portugal too?
Perhaps next fall?
 &HT;    A few days later, on New Year's Eve, I was transfixed by the
televised fantasy of fireworks that lit up the bejeweled Eiffel
Tower. Oh, Paris, beautiful City of Light _ had it really been five
years since we'd walked along the Seine?
 &HT;    I could instantly envision broad boulevards, thin women with
chic silk scarves, and a corner patisserie where I bought a moist
round mouthful of chocolate cake with an indescribably delicious
coffee-flavored icing. Definitely, back to Paris.
 &HT;    Cleaning my desk the following week, I took off the wall an
outdated calendar with large color photographs of waterfalls. I
hadn't really noticed it much. But now I was transfixed by a view
of Upper Yosemite Falls, tumbling down magnificent snow-covered
cliffs.
 &HT;    I hadn't been to Yosemite for more than 30 years, and I barely
remembered my one day there. How could I think of Paris, or Spain,
when I hadn't really experienced Yosemite?
 &HT;    I am helpless against unforeseen assaults on my homebound
intentions. Occasionally, when I am already on a trip, I have a
passing glimpse of a destination that calls to me so seductively I
know I must answer.
 &HT;    One June afternoon, on a fast train from Inverness to London, I
glanced, for only a whizzing moment, far across miles of empty
fields to a tiny village of snug houses clustered around a bay. The
surrounding countryside seemed so undiscovered, the village so
remote.
 &HT;    I studied my map: Alnmouth, Northumberland. Three years later,
we were walking through light rain down its long quiet beach.
 &HT;    On another afternoon, this time in early fall, I sat on a level
rock at the northernmost edge of Scotland and gazed, entranced, at
the distant gray-green shapes of the Orkney Islands half-hidden in
the mist. They seemed as if they belonged to a different world.
``James,'' I said, ``we have to go there.''
 &HT;    James smiled, partly in resignation. ``O.K.,'' he said amiably,
``but why don't we finish this trip first?''
 &HT;    Two Octobers later, we rented a cottage for a week on an Orkney
island called, disarmingly, Mainland.
 &HT;    Sometimes all it takes is a single picture or a few words. We
once spent a week near Cromer, on the north Norfolk coast, because
that was the phrase _ ``the north Norfolk coast'' _ occasionally
appearing in travel guides, that had begun to haunt my imagination.
It sounded so unlike the cozy Cotswolds, or the well-trodden and
prosaically named Lake District, or flowering Kent, the Garden of
England.
 &HT;    Then I read P. D. James' ``Devices and Desires,'' and her
intensely evocative description of that bleak, windswept land made
me determined to see if she was right. And she was.
 &HT;    Although P.D. James first sent me to Norfolk, Arthur Conan Doyle
to Dartmoor and Dylan Thomas to Wales, I am not often struck by the
travel impulse when I read nonfiction travel books. This may seem
odd, since I have indulged in such memoirs myself.
 &HT;    But, after closing a particularly atmospheric or vivid travel
narrative, I tend to think: ``OK. Wonderful. Now I've been there.''
 &HT;    If the author has filled my eyes with his or her personal
vision, I am perversely not moved to explore certain corners of
Provence, or Tuscany, or Patagonia.
 &HT;    If, however, I am swept into a place by reading a novel or
biography, I absorb the landscape sidewise, out of the corner of my
eye. Then I become intrigued.
 &HT;    After finishing Tim Binding's ``Lying With the Enemy,'' a novel
about life in occupied Guernsey during World War II, I asked James,
``Why haven't we ever been to the Channel Islands?'' He looked
blank. I handed him the novel, and the next year, we were off.
 &HT;    My love of Scottish islands began, not with a guidebook, but
with Gavin Maxwell's ``Ring of Bright Water,'' an account of life
with his beloved otters.
 &HT;    I soon tracked Maxwell through his later, much harsher, memoirs,
``The Rocks Remain'' and ``Raven Seek Thy Brother,'' and, after
many years, I eventually looked across the water to the lonely site
of his nearly inaccessible Camusfearna.
 &HT;    As James and I walked parts of the rocky coastline of western
Scotland, and explored Mull and Skye that year, I often thought of
Maxwell's intense, troubled spirit. His love of this land had
brought us there.
 &HT;    Or had it? As a young girl, I used to sit at the piano and play
through ``The Fireside Book of Folk Songs.'' One of my favorites
was ``The Skye Boat Song.'' Its simple, poignant melody had an
unforgettable refrain, especially alluring to an Iowa girl who
lived far from any ocean: ``Carry the lad who was born to be
king/Over the sea to Skye.''
 &HT;    I didn't know the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and I had no
idea where Skye was, but I knew loss and regret when I heard it.
Over the sea to Skye: someday perhaps I would know more.
 &HT;    So even a song can start me thinking of travel. After our trip
to Hawaii last winter, James began to play a CD we bought there. He
plays it a lot, especially when it gets really cold outside.
 &HT;    Like James, I had been delighted by our relaxing, balmy week on
Molokai. So when I hear ``Polynesian Love Song'' or ``Lovely Hula
Hands,'' I don't think, ``This is corny.'' No, I want to be back on
our screened lanai, listening to the warm splashing surf a few
yards away.
 &HT;    It doesn't take much. Sometimes I think I should look for an
antidote, but I haven't thought of one yet. Maybe if I muttered
Thoreau's proud boast, ``I have traveled much in Concord''? If I
repeated like a mantra, ``Home is where the heart is''? What about
a CD that played, again and again, ``Home Sweet Home''? I'm not
sure any of it would help.

 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My husband wants adventure, I want a spa with a spiritual
nature and our kids don't fit into either category. Help! Know of a
vacation destination that will meet everyone's needs?
 &HT;     A:  The Enchantment Resort in Sedona, Ariz., and its new
destination spa, Mii Amo, will surely please all. Nestled within a
truly enchanting red-rock canyon, Enchantment offers scenic
relaxation and adventure, as well as Camp Coyote, ranked one of the
best kids programs in the world.
 &HT;    One of Enchantment's treasures is Uqualla, the shaman and former
chief of the Havasupai tribe, who acts as spiritual ambassador for
the resort. While children play and learn about the local cultures,
guests can be pampered by healing oils that are blessed each
morning. Spiritual consultations are available, and the staff
offers an array of innovative spa treatments.
 &HT;    The Enchantment concierge can arrange a variety of hiking and
rock-climbing tours for the adventurous or the mere stroller.
 &HT;    Your family should save an afternoon to fly by helicopter with
Uqualla to his tribe's village at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.
There you can enjoy a swim and picnic at the nearby falls.
 &HT;    At the end of the day, whether your crew is rested or exhausted,
Enchantment's restaurants offer an eclectic selection of spa
cuisine and hearty southwestern fare, as well as an excellent wine
list.
 &HT;    Book now for the holidays to reserve an Enchantment casita or
one of Mii Amo's 16 rooms and suites. Room rates begin at $195 per
night. For more information, call (800) 826-4180 or visit
www.enchantmentresort.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I've always been intrigued by the mystique of Harvard, but
the two times I visited Cambridge I felt like such an outsider. How
can I get a better feel for the place?
 &HT;     A:2 Home to Harvard, MIT and the JFK School of Government,
Cambridge may well be the premiere locale for intellectuals in this
country. Most visiting lecturers and dignitaries stay at the
Charles Hotel on Harvard Square.
 &HT;    Not only is it within walking distance, at times the Charles
Hotel seems like an extension of the Harvard campus. Relax in the
foyer library and watch the comings and goings _ or better yet, ask
the concierge to arrange a private tour of Harvard with a recent
graduate. Often the guide runs into buddies, conversations ensue
and the scene opens before you.
 &HT;    I would suggest arriving early for breakfast at the Charles'
lively Henrietta's Table, where writer David Mamet or Cambridge's
dot.com elite might just be doing business.
 &HT;    Lunch would be a good idea at a popular joint called Bartley's
Burger Cottage (1246 Massachusetts Ave.), but Casablanca (40
Brattle St.), with its fusion Mediterranean cuisine, is a more
original mainstay of Cambridge _ especially in the evening at the
bar.
 &HT;    Room rates at the Charles Hotel begin at $250 per night.
Facilities include a day spa and three-story health-and-fitness
center. For more information, call (800) 882-1818, or visit
www.charleshotel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I have played on golf courses around the world and really
enjoy when courses throw a unique spin into the golfing experience.
Can you suggest a course that offers a bit of originality?
 &HT;     A:  The new ``Heli-Golf Package,'' offered by Rosewood Hotels &AMP;
Resorts in Little Dix Bay in the Virgin Islands, provides the
originality that adventurous golfers look for. This heli-golf
experience features a scenic helicopter flight to St. Croix, where
golfers are deposited right onto the green and are then processed
through customs and immigrations with minimal hassle.
 &HT;    Described as ``the Caribbean's most exclusive golf getaway,''
Little Dix Bay's Heli-Golf Package includes three nights'
accommodation for two; greens fees, cart and golf escort; daily
breakfast and dinner; and complimentary water activities. Rates are
based on double occupancy, with deluxe accommodations starting at
$3,500 and suite accommodations starting at $5,000.
 &HT;    Laurance Rockefeller founded exclusive Little Dix Bay in 1964.
These low-key yet upscale accommodations are set in a 500-acre
garden paradise and a pristine private beach. For more information,
call (888) ROSEWOOD.
 &HT;     Q:  I am a single female who enjoys traveling alone, but
occasionally I feel left out of certain social activities because I
am not part of a couple. Do other independent travelers ever feel
this way?
 &HT;     A:  Some people do _ and, unfortunately, it's usually women.
Because of this, Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines now feature their popular
gentlemen hosts aboard every cruise. With their gracious social
skills and dancing ability, these men are well-known for making
single female passengers feel at ease in all social activities.
 &HT;    Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines offers exhilarating cruises throughout
Africa, the Caribbean, Europe and South America. For more
information and reservations, visit www.eurocruises.com, or call
(800) 688-3876.
 &HT;     Q:  Over the years, I have noticed that some hotels are more
in-tune with the needs of female business travelers than others.
Can you recommend a good hotel that focuses on this segment of the
population?
 &HT;     A:  The Pan Pacific San Francisco recently surveyed female
guests _ focusing on those with business needs _ and has made
several adjustments.
 &HT;    The women who were surveyed reported that females appreciate
softer, more personal touches. For example, minibars are now
stocked with wines by the glass. There are lighter menu choices
available on the 24-hour room-service menu, personal butlers can be
provided and the staff is available to escort female guests to

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The romance of the rails lingers in a handful of deluxe trains
that run on well-orchestrated trips throughout the world.
 &HT;    What's the appeal of such luxury train trips? Vintage rail cars
that have been lavishly restored; itineraries that take passengers
through some of the most beautiful landscapes and cities in the
world; impeccable service; and food that is extraordinary.
 &HT;    For those who can pay the price, here are some elegant journeys
to consider. Prices are per person, based on double occupancy.
 &HT;    The American Spirit (601 Union St., Seattle, WA 98101;
888-533-7245; www.americanspiritrail.com) features 1950s Budd-built
streamliner railcars. The company offers a variety of western
itineraries that include visits to the Glacier, Grand Tetons and
Yellowstone National Parks.
 &HT;    Trips last anywhere from two to nine nights. Accommodations are
in hotels, not on the train, and motorcoaches supplement the rail
service.
 &HT;    A typical itinerary is the ``Montana Rockies Rail Tour,'' which
begins in Post Falls, Idaho, continues on to Missoula, Mont., and
ends in Livingston, Mont. The cost of the two-night trip begins at
$499. Lodging and daily breakfast, as well as transfers from
Spokane Airport, are included.
 &HT;    The American Orient-Express (5100 Main St., Downer's Grove, IL
60515; 888-759-3944; www.americanorientexpress.com) utilizes 15
vintage rail cars on its luxury voyages. The train travels cross
country as well as on shorter trips throughout the West.
 &HT;    For example, the ``Rockies and Yellowstone'' itinerary is a
six-night trip that commences in Denver and visits Arches National
Park, Salt Lake City, Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks.
The cost begins at $2,990.
 &HT;    The best-known name in luxury-train travel is probably
Orient-Express Trains &AMP; Cruises (Sea Containers House, 20 Upper
Ground, London, SE1 9PF, England; 800-524-2420;
www.orient-expresstrains.com or c/o Abercrombie and Kent
International Inc., 1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523;
800-323-7308; www.abercrombiekent.com). They offer a variety of
rail itineraries for the well-heeled traveler.
 &HT;    The most famous trip is the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express
(VSOE), which features restored period rail cars, lavish service
and fine dining. Sightseeing and meals are included in most
itineraries.
 &HT;    The classic VSOE trip is from London to Paris and Venice, or
vice versa. The cost of this one-night trip starts at $1,970. The
train makes other trips as well, such as from Venice to Florence
and Rome; Venice to Prague, Paris and London; Venice to Lucerne,
Paris and London; and Paris to Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul.
 &HT;    Orient-Express also offers the Eastern &AMP; Oriental Express, a
luxury train that has three itineraries: Singapore to Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, and Bangkok (and vice versa); Bangkok to Chiang Mai,
Thailand; and Bangkok to Angkor Wat, Cambodia, and Singapore. The
overnight Singapore to Kuala Lumpur itinerary begins at $600.
 &HT;    Among the other Orient-Express trains are the Northern Belle,
which calls itself the ``Orient-Express of the North.'' It offers
day trips and weekend getaways in Britain with departures from
Liverpool, Manchester and York. Again, vintage rail carriages, fine
dining and a high level of service are offered.
 &HT;    Orient Express also operates the Great South Pacific Express in
Australia, a restored luxury train that runs from Brisbane to
Cairns; Brisbane to Sydney; Brisbane to Canberra and Sydney; and
Sydney to Brisbane and Cairns. Contact them for more information.
 &HT;    The Royal Scotsman (c/o Abercrombie and Kent International Inc.
1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523; 800-323-7308;
www.abercrombiekent.com or www.royalscotsman.com) takes visitors
through the rugged Scottish countryside on some of the beautiful
rails in Britain. The four-night Edinburgh to Edinburgh itinerary
is $4,150.
 &HT;    Beginning in the Scottish capital, the journey takes riders
through the dramatic West Highlands and rolling Perthshire hills
and then to the North East. Two-night trips start at $2,350. Rates
include all meals, wine and alcoholic and beverages as well as
sightseeing visits.
 &HT;    In Canada, the Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (1150 Station St.,
Vancouver, B.C. Canada V6A 2X7; 800-665-7245;
www.rockymountaineer.com) has a variety of trips through the
Canadian Rockies. These trains travel by daylight only, affording
the best views of the mountains. Overnights are spent in hotels.
 &HT;    One of the briefest excursions is the ``Two Day Redleaf Tour,''
a one-night trip through the Canadian Rockies, traveling from
Vancouver to either Jasper, Alberta, or Calgary, Alberta, with an
overnight hotel stay in Kamloops, Alberta. Prices start at $358 per
person and include the overnight stay and some meals.
 &HT;    Premier Selections (342 Madison Ave., Suite 916, New York, N.Y.
10173; 800-234-4000; www.premierselections.com) is the sales agent
for a number of great train journeys, including the Al Andalus
Express, the Royal Scottsman and the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.
Rates start at $1,512 and include five nights on the train, one in
a hotel, most meals and sightseeing.
 &HT;    Premier also has a variety of other luxury trains, including the
Blue Train in South Africa. This train runs from Capetown to
Pretoria, with an overnight in Johannesburg. The price of this
five-night train/tour package _ which includes four hotel nights,
one night on the train itself and some meals _ starts at $1,946.
 &HT;    Finally, Copper Canyon's Sierra Madre Express runs from Tuscon,
Ariz., down into Mexico's fabled Copper Canyon region. The
seven-night trip, which includes hotel and train accommodation, as
well as most meals, begins at $2,545.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Like anyone living in a popular tourist destination, I developed
a standard tour itinerary years ago for my out-of-town friends who
wish to see all that Reno, Nev., has to offer.
 &HT;    Because Reno is known for gaming, most of my visitors want to
stop at a casino to try their luck at gambling or to see a show.
But it doesn't take long for the area's natural beauty to weave its
magic. Even in midsummer, the snow-dappled Sierra Nevada set
against the clear blue sky is like a magnet for sightseers.
 &HT;    My personal tour starts in Truckee, home of the Donner Memorial
Museum, (530) 582-7892, that tells the heartbreaking story of the
Donner Party who were trapped in the Sierra Nevada during one of
our area's worst winters.
 &HT;    Then it's up Route 89 to Tahoe City for a stop at Fanny Bridge
overlooking the Truckee River. Fanny Bridge gets its name from the
poses people strike as they lean over the bridge to watch the giant
trout swim below.
 &HT;    A driving tour of Carson City, the capital of Nevada, is next.
Then, depending on the mood of the group, we head west to Genoa _
reputedly Nevada's first settlement and home of the state's oldest
saloon _ or east to Virginia City _ where the rich ore deposits of
this lavish boomtown helped finance Union efforts in the Civil War
and buy Nevada early statehood.
 &HT;    A visit to Reno wouldn't be complete without a walk along the
Truckee River and downtown _ usually with a stop at the National
Auto Museum _ and a meal at a Basque hotel, where ethnic fare is
served family-style at long tables.
 &HT;    But beware: If a Basque meal strikes your fancy, be prepared to
eat. A lot. The food is served in a series of seemingly endless
courses, giving diners ample time to visit with table mates who may
hail from other parts of the city, country or world.
 &HT;    A drive to Pyramid Lake, just northeast of Reno and famous for
being the location where Charleton Heston was filmed parting the
Red Sea in the ``The Ten Commandments,'' usually tops off my
official tour.
 &HT;    Recently, when I took a group of out-of-towners on a sightseeing
trip of the city, I realized how outdated my tour route had become.
All the sites I've mentioned are indeed worth visiting, but now
there's so much more to explore.
 &HT;    For example, a trip to Pyramid Lake and Paiute Indian
Reservation's Fish Hatchery, (775) 476-0500, where one can see how
prehistoric cui-ui fish are being saved, now can include a stop at
the new Tribal Museum and a visit to the Bureau of Land
Management's Wild Horse Adoption Center, (775) 475-2222 or
www.blm.gov/whb. Horses from Nevada's vast open spaces are brought
and kept here until people adopt them.
 &HT;    The Truckee River, with its 100-mile ribbon of rapids that lead
from Lake Tahoe down to Pyramid Lake, always has been a vital part
of my tour. Now, it's even more important.
 &HT;    Downtown Reno is where the Truckee River intersects with
Virginia Street, the town's main drag. It's home to many new
developments, including:
 &HT;    _ A walk with promenades for special events, such as ballet and
symphony performances.
 &HT;    _ Riverside paths, a favorite with bikers and hikers.
Eventually, these will run the length of the city once development
is completed.
 &HT;    _ Many unique Riverfront buildings, including the Riverside
Hotel and Casino, which is being converted into lofts and studios;
Christ Scientist Church, which is becoming the Lear Theater; and
McKinley School, which has been restored as an arts-and-cultural
center.
 &HT;    Some developments have new twists, such as the bluff overlooking
the south side of the Truckee River, where Reno's elite built homes
in what is now called the Newlands area. These days, local
residents involved in historic preservation lead tours of the area,
mostly for Elderhostel students, (877) 426-8056 or
www.elderhostel.org. Special group tours can be arranged by calling
the Historic Reno Preservation Society, (775) 322-1638.
 &HT;    At the other end of Virginia Street is the town's signature
landmark, an overhead street sign that proclaims Reno as ``The
Biggest Little City in the World.'' This is the fourth version of
the sign, which during World War II served as a landmark for
veterans heading home from the Pacific.
 &HT;    Two models of the sign adorn downtown. The newest is known to
turn green on St. Patrick's Day or go dark during Christmas carol
sing-alongs, while the other model is mounted outside the National
Auto Museum on Lake Street.
 &HT;    West of Reno, my tour now includes a stop at Chrissie Caughlin
Park beside the Truckee River. It's a place I have walked my
miniature schnauzers for years, but I now know that pioneers
traveling in covered wagons used a large pine tree, roughly four
feet in diameter, as their ``post office'' and stuck notes for
other immigrants on its trunk.
 &HT;    Further west, it's possible to take a look-see at the
still-visible tracks of the Donner Party wagon train on either side
of Dog Valley Road near a small town called Verdi.
 &HT;    Reno is rich in history, from miners searching for quick riches
and pioneers hurrying to reach California, to railroaders laying
the train tracks that would stitch together the North American
continent. For decades, it stood as an oasis for people traveling
to other places.
 &HT;    Now, Reno is no longer just a pass-through town. In fact, the
place that's so dear to my heart has finally become a fascinating
vacation destination in its own right.
 &HT;    For more information Reno, call (800) 367-7366 or visit
www.renolaketahoe.com on the Web.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By SARA KENNEDY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    If competition breeds creativity, then the theme parks in and
around Orlando are a case in point. They have some of the most
imaginative ways for guests to spend their leisure time. Everything
from a roller coaster that shoots its human cargo from the starting
gate with all the subtlety of a missile launcher to a beautiful
carousel based on the art of Dr. Seuss greet visitors to Orlando
theme parks this summer.
 &HT;    Vacationers will also find an entirely new park, SeaWorld's
Discovery Cove, which opened July 1. It features a tropical, beachy
setting populated with 10,000 fish and 300 birds. Guests can play
with dolphins under the supervision of trainers, and enjoy
leisurely swimming, snorkeling and sunning with smaller crowds and
no lines, thanks to a daily limit of 1,000 patrons.
 &HT;    Orlando's theme parks, which last year attracted more than 60
million visitors (up from 48.5 million in 1996), are trying to
handle the crush of crowds better. Discovery Cove's competitors are
trying various ways to cut down waiting lines, a chief complaint of
theme park customers.
 &HT;    Walt Disney World has inaugurated Fastpass, in which guests can
pick up free tickets near its 18 most popular attractions for later
in the day when the lines are shorter. Universal is testing a
similar arrangement called Fast Track. Disney also opens a
different theme park early each day, offering first admittance to
guests at Disney hotels. Until Sept. 4, Universal is rewarding
multiday ticket holders and its hotel guests with early entry to
its two parks, from 7 to 10 a.m. daily.
 &HT;    A spring drought that fueled wildfires and meant watering
restrictions for millions of Floridians seems to have left the
theme parks unscathed. During visits in June, pathways were lined
with bright blooms of bougainvillea and hibiscus, big shade trees
were heavy with foliage, and the acres of perfectly trimmed grass
were as lush as always.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Theme parks aren't the only show in Orlando, believe it or not.
Although the calendar of special events seems to thin out a bit in
summer, diversions exist elsewhere in the city.
 &HT;    This summer, audience members help solve a mystery set in deep
space at the Orlando Science Center's planetarium. Performances,
which run through Aug. 31, feature a planetarium show and a live
actor. It's based on the PBS geographical quiz show ``Where in the
World Is Carmen San Diego,'' and is included with admission to the
center: $14.25, seniors $13.25, ages 3 to 11 $11.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 10, ``Hunters of the Sky'' looks at birds of prey,
with over 70 mounted specimens of falcons, eagles, owls and other
raptors. The center, at 777 East Princeton St., is open daily;
(407) 896-7151.
 &HT;    Through Sept. 3, ``Art of the 20th Century,'' at the Cornell
Fine Arts Museum, on Holt Avenue at Rollins College in Winter Park,
looks at the last 100 years through European and American painting,
sculpture, prints and drawings from the permanent collection. Free
admission; closed Monday. Call (407) 646-2526.
 &HT;    The Orlando Museum of Art, 2416 North Mills Ave. in Loch Haven
Park, will display beadwork, baskets and decorated animal hides
from Kenya, Tanzania and other East African countries. The
exhibition runs through May 27. Admission is $6, seniors and
students $4, ages 4 to 11 $2; closed Monday: (407) 896-4231.
 &HT;    The Orlando-University of Central Florida Shakespeare Festival
begins Sept. 20, with previews of ``The Woman in Black,'' a
Victorian mystery by Stephen Mallatratt, from a book by Susan Hill,
which runs through Oct. 28. Performances are at the Orange County
Historical Museum Theatre in Loch Haven Park, at Princeton and
Mills Avenues in Orlando. Tickets: $7 to $20; (407) 893-4600.
 &HT;    At Disney's Wide World of Sports, adjacent to the theme parks,
the 2000 Junior Olympic Games, the Amateur Athletic Union's top
event, features track and field competition from July 31 through
Aug. 5. The 250-acre complex is off Exit 25B of I-4. Daily general
admission is $9, ages 3 to 9, $7; (407) 939-1505.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    At Discovery Cove, off Exits 27A and 28 of I-4, guests come face
to face with bottlenose dolphins. They can touch the animals, and
trainers allow some patrons to play water games with the dolphins.
The park requires reservations. It employs one staff member for
every five guests to provide supervision for the dolphins, better
service and no waiting lines. Admission is $179 for ages 6 and
older who want to swim with dolphins; ages 3 to 5 and those
skipping a dolphin swim pay $89.
 &HT;    Admission includes a meal outside at the Laguna Grill, use of
snorkeling and beach gear (towels, chairs, hammocks), and a
seven-day pass to the original SeaWorld park nearby, where visitors
can see Shamu and ride the Kraken, a roller coaster that made its
debut last month; (877) 434-7268.
 &HT;    Otherwise, ticket prices are one area where Orlando's theme
parks don't show variety. Prices for a one-day, one-park ticket for
ages 10 and up at Disney World's theme parks are $46; ages 3 to 9,
$37. The Magic Kingdom and Disney-MGM Studios are off Exit 25B;
Epcot and Animal Kingdom, Exit 26B. For all Disney parks
information: (407) 824-4321.
 &HT;    Ticket prices are the same at SeaWorld, at Exits 27A and 28,
(407) 351-3600; and Universal, at Exits 30A and 29B, (407)
363-8000. Various multipark and multiday tickets are also
available.
 &HT;    The theme-park attractions with the highest profile _ in the
physical sense _ are roller coasters, and Orlando boasts a crop of
wild new ones. SeaWorld's Kraken rises 15 stories, then plunges its
screaming passengers toward earth at 65 m.p.h. Riders on the
Incredible Hulk are practically blown out of the starting gate from
what looks like a giant missile launcher at Universal's Islands of
Adventure park, which opened in May 1999.
 &HT;    The Rock 'n' Roller Coaster at Disney-MGM Studios, which opened
a year ago, treats its riders to an equally explosive start,
accelerating from zero to 60 m.p.h. in 2.8 seconds, with the music
of the band Aerosmith pumped through the seats.
 &HT;    A simulator game that pits guests of DisneyQuest, an indoor
interactive playground, against the same motley gang from the
Pirates of the Caribbean ride opened June 21 outside the park in
Downtown Disney. Four players, all wearing three-dimensional
goggles, board a sailing ship under attack (its deck sickeningly
weaves and rolls on springs controlled by computer) and defend
themselves with cannons. Tickets cost $27, ages 3 to 9, $21.
 &HT;    Universal's ``Terminator 2,'' a film that opened in 1996 at
Universal Studios Theme Park, involves three-dimensional thrills
and bizarre special effects, including fog and rain. It's the usual
end-of-the-world scenario, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, complete
with realistic guns booming and screeching pileups.
 &HT;    One of the most elegant new rides is the beautiful interactive
carousel of Dr. Seuss animals _ pull the reins and hair might fly
up or a tongue stick out _ at Islands of Adventure. The bright pink
and blue carousel is based on the art of Dr. Seuss.
 &HT;    One park that has no problem with crowds is Splendid China, a
76-acre park opened in 1993 by a Chinese company to acquaint
Americans with the country's culture. It features nearly deserted
gardens with more than 60 miniature models of historical Chinese
sites.
 &HT;    Sparse crowds usually greet its chief daily theatrical
production, the ``Mysterious Kingdom of the Orient'' _ a pity since
it is a knockout performance of colorful costumes, traditional
Chinese song and dance, acrobatics and martial arts. Follow Route
192 west from I-4 to Exit 25B in Kissimmee (directions and ticket
information from park employees may be incorrect). Admission costs,
which include the show and a terrible meal, are $19.95, and $9.95
ages 5 to 12. Call (407) 396-7111 or (800) 244-6226.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    It's always easier to park your car and stay on the grounds of a
theme park, but hotels and food usually cost more. A moderately
priced choice is Disney's All-Star Resorts, at Exit 26B of I-4,
with a mammoth complex of 5,760 basic rooms with outdoor pools,
bakery, food court and free bus service to Disney attractions.
Rooms are $74 to $104 a night; (407) 934-7639.
 &HT;    Minutes east of the theme parks is the Hampton Inn-Orlando
Convention Center hotel, 8900 Universal Blvd., which opened in
April 1999. The staff is helpful and friendly; there is a heated
outdoor pool; the free Continental breakfast includes cereals,
bagels, yogurt, fruit and waffles; and the 170 spotless rooms, with
maple furniture and decorated in bright, tropical colors, are $69
to $109, depending on the season; (407) 354-4447, fax (407)
354-3031.
 &HT;    Budget: A simple hotel tucked away off Interstate 4, the Comfort
Inn Maingate South is an easy 15-minute ride from most of the theme
parks. It is off I-4 Exit 23, eight miles west of Walt Disney World
at 5510 U.S. Highway 27 North. Its 150 rooms cost $40 to $100, more
on holidays; outdoor pool; (800) 255-4386, fax (863) 424-1723.
 &HT;    Luxury: Elegant, sand-colored Italian marble and huge bouquets
of native orchids give the lobby of the Peabody Orlando, 9801
International Drive, a distinctive Florida feel, and it's fun to
watch the hotel's mascot ducks cavort in the fountain. Its 891
modern rooms are decorated in yellow and moss green; doubles are
$330 a night; outdoor pool and children's pool with waterfall;
(407) 352-4000, fax (407) 351-0073.
 &HT;    The Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, Disney's sprawling
Victorian-style hotel, boasts 900 quaint rooms, decorated with
printed wall coverings, marble-top sinks, ceiling fans and
Victorian woodwork. Big gingerbread porches with climbing roses
overlook a lagoon on theme park grounds with a man-made beach and
two outdoor pools, one for children. Off Exit 25B. Doubles are $304
to $400; (407) 824-3000, fax (407) 824-3186.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    At Universal's CityWalk, a 30-acre dining and entertainment
complex, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville is (what else?) completely
casual. Try conch fritters dipped in honey-mustard sauce, followed
by Caribbean grilled chicken salad, topped with almonds and
habanero-mango ranch dressing, and key lime pie for dessert. Dinner
for two with margaritas, about $50; (407) 224-2155.
 &HT;    Nearby, also at CityWalk, you'll find Emeril's, the Orlando
branch of a series of restaurants owned by the popular TV chef
Emeril Lagasse. Reservations are recommended. Specialties include
an appetizer of Maine lobster cheesecake; roasted rack of lamb with
a Creole mustard sauce, and fresh Florida orange cake with
strawberry compote. Dinner for two with wine, $125; (407) 224-2424.
 &HT;    Of all the theme parks, SeaWorld serves some of the best food,
and its casual Bimini Bay restaurant, with waiters and waitresses
wearing Hawaiian shirts, is typical. The menu features salads,
pasta and seafood; try the fresh Florida grouper sandwich or
marinated steak on a roll with sauteed onions and peppers. Lunch
for two with beer costs about $40 (you must have a park pass);
(407) 351-3600.
 &HT;    Two sessions of a gospel brunch occur every Sunday morning at
the House of Blues Music Hall, at Downtown Disney (where no park
pass is needed), featuring nationally known and local gospel
performers, and an all-you-can-eat Southern buffet. The meal and
show cost $28; ages 3 to 9, $15. It's a good idea to buy tickets at
least a week in advance at (407) 934-2583, fax (407) 934-2216, or
at the House of Blues box office.
 &HT;    A good family-style restaurant near Walt Disney World is
Pebbles, 12551 State Road 535; (407) 827-1111. It serves a nice mix
of dishes adults enjoy, like the excellent black bean soup ($3.25)
or Mediterranean salad ($7.50), and child-friendly items like the
cheeseburger ($6.95)and white chocolate mousse ($3.95).

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANNASUE MCCLEAVE WILSON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is hard to admit to being a soccer mom. That cliched title is
easier to bear, however, when the games are played on a crescent
moon of a beach in Brazil, where the team kicks up sand as white
and soft as baby powder.
 &HT;    Our family loves soccer, that jogo bonito, ``beautiful game,''
as they call it in Brazil. My son John, 14, has played since
kindergarten, and his coach, Paulo Barreto, is a Brazilian who
played professionally there. His Cincinnati company, Paulo's
Brazilian Soccer Training and Camp, began organizing trips last
year to his hometown, Florianopolis.
 &HT;    The coin toss to see whether my husband, John, or I would
accompany John on a trip there last March was agonizing. Not only
was the trip too expensive for everyone to go, but we would have
had to take our two younger children out of school. I won.
 &HT;    This particular eight-day trip was designed for a team, but not
all of John's team, the Cincinnati Classics, participated, so they
were supplemented by other boys and girls of the same age and
ability from around Cincinnati. Parents were welcome, and of the 17
players, only 5 traveled without a parent, making us a group of 39.
 &HT;    Other camps offer various levels of training and can include
international tournament play for players who hope to play at the
college level and beyond, but this trip offered the right balance
of soccer and vacation for us. Our trip revolved around three
matches with local teams and four morning training sessions, but
equally important was the beachfront hotel and organized afternoon
sightseeing.
 &HT;    Florianopolis, on the island of Santa Catarina, is about 350
miles down the coast from Sao Paulo. Our 24-hour trip was not made
easier by the way we were routed by the travel agency _ through
Detroit, Miami and Sao Paulo _ but the teenagers seemed oblivious
to the inconvenience.
 &HT;    When they weren't giving water to thirsty dogs in travel cages
or bumping into airport police officers on bikes, they managed to
find enough open space at each stopover to kick around a soccer
ball. In Sao Paulo, they sprawled over the floor of the airport
terminal, lounging or sleeping on backpacks.
 &HT;    Several in our group thought the island of Santa Catarina, on
which most of the city of Florianopolis is built, looked like one
of the islands of Hawaii from the air. The hilly countryside is
laden with subtropical flora, and both land and sea are dotted with
ancient black boulders that must have looked like gods to the
Tupi-Guarani Indians who first inhabited the region. The island is
connected to the mainland by two bridges, although one, the
Hercilio Luz, is closed to motor traffic.
 &HT;    Our bright blue hotel, the Ingleses Praia, sat beside a beach
called Praia dos Ingleses, on the northeast shore of the island,
about 22 miles from downtown Florianopolis. The beach was named for
English explorers who poked around there about 1700. Each room had
a balcony, cool tile floors, air-conditioning and surprisingly
spacious bathrooms.
 &HT;    We ate breakfast and occasionally another meal at the hotel,
buffet style. Fruits and juices were fresh and delicious, but all
else paled in the morning before the coffee. It was deeply rich and
black, served with hot milk.
 &HT;    Our first evening at the hotel, the parents in the group were
content to laze wearily on the veranda, drinking caipirinhas, a
lime drink usually made with cachaca, Brazilian sugar-cane liquor.
 &HT;    A few of the boys perused the small strip of beachfront
restaurants and souvenir shops selling T-shirts and crocheted
bikinis and thongs on either side of the hotel (their favorite
souvenirs were fake designer watches, but because the dollar is
strong against the real, almost everything seemed inexpensive).
 &HT;    Afterward, they brought out a ball and began to kick it around
on the beach under the stars. This attracted some local people and
soon a full fledged game was on. Not one Brazilian guy walking
along the beach _ student, vendor or fisherman _ could keep his
foot off the ball if it came near him during our practices, and
their skill was remarkable.
 &HT;    The team's first training session was at the Hotel Fazenda Jomar
on the mainland near Santo Amaro da Imperatriz, a spa town founded
to commemorate an imperial visit in 1845 by Dom Pedro II, emperor
of Brazil. Having traveled inland 18 miles, we were in dense green
mountains, and the group practiced on a field in danger of being
enveloped by the lush vegetation surrounding it.
 &HT;    Afterward, we all took advantage of the resort's amenities. The
team swam in the pool, went rafting in rapids not rapid enough to
be classified, and sank paddle boats in the lake.
 &HT;    On a shaded veranda, an accordionist played German music, a
reminder of the large influx of Germans who emigrated to this part
of Brazil in the 19th century. Several parents joined an ecological
walk around the grounds, which led to a waterfall of rare beauty;
on our way up, we disturbed a lizard the size of a small alligator.
 &HT;    Florianopolis has two professional soccer teams, the Figueirense
Futebol Clube, based on the mainland, and the island's Avai Futebol
Clube, both of which cultivate players from a young age.
 &HT;    After a day of practice and a couple of scrimmages on the beach,
our first match took place against the Figueirense youth team in
the club's stadium in Florianopolis. The Brazilians, who were a
year or two older than John, won, 8-1, which did not seem to
diminish the excitement of playing a challenging opponent.
 &HT;    Our game with the young Avai team two days later took place just
before the professional match between Avai and Caxias (from the
city of Porto Alegre). As the game went on, the stands filled up
with fans who cheered on both teams (we lost, 2-0) but who were
unforgiving of their pro team when it lost.
 &HT;    After the game with Figueirense, our bus took us to the beach at
Joaquina, which is on the east side of the island and is famous for
surfing championships held there each year. After an open-air
lunch, the team wandered the beach, climbing the huge rocks at one
end and examining jellyfish that washed onto the shore.
 &HT;    Behind Praia da Joaquina are massive sand dunes of Saharan
proportion and, even though the wind whipped up the sand so
fiercely it practically blinded them, the team was determined to go
sandboarding. John and the boys happily forged their way up the
dunes over and over again, and dumped their weight in sand onto the
floor of the bus on the way back to the hotel.
 &HT;    The next day, we boarded a schooner and headed for the island of
Anhatomirim, where the team was to practice in the shadow of the
Santa Cruz fort, built in 1744. A Brazilian school group about the
same age as ours happened to be touring the fort, too, and it
wasn't long before another impromptu match was on.
 &HT;    The Brazilian girls watched the American boys with obvious
pleasure, much to the consternation of the Brazilian boys, which
gave the game an edge it might not ordinarily have had.
 &HT;    The Brazilian boys, on the other hand, didn't know what to make
of the four highly skilled girls playing on our team. Only the
parents were in awe of the setting: on one side a centuries-old
fortress and on the other, the magnificent sea.
 &HT;    After morning training another day, the group ventured downtown.
The two bridges to the mainland shadow 19th-century ocher-colored
market buildings along the old waterfront. Across the street from
the Praca 15 de Novembro, the city's main square, John stopped at
the entrance to the pink Cruz e Souza Palace to have his picture
taken beside the guard, who wore an elaborate uniform and held a
rifle with a bayonet.
 &HT;    The team climbed the steps to the bright white Metropolitan
Cathedral, where a Mass was being said, then plopped down
pretending to be exhausted.
 &HT;    Since this day of sightseeing had little appeal for them, the
high point of the excursion was stopping at a shop called Futebol
Mania to buy official Figueirense and Avai jerseys. A few fathers
wandered off to the bus station to find Cuban cigars.
 &HT;    Our meals outside the hotel were in seafood restaurants or in
churrascarias, places serving meat smorgasbords called rodizio (all
you can eat). Seafood lunches were waterside, in open-air
restaurants that served us at long communal tables _ local shrimp
in butter and oil, mussels in salsa, deep-fried whitefish, served
with plates of beets, shredded carrots and tomato, clay pots of
rich black beans, and crisp, deep-fried manioc root.
 &HT;    When Mr. Barreto realized that our ravenous American teen-agers
kept passing on the plates of fish and making faces, he arranged
that they be served chicken with rice and French fries instead.
 &HT;    One evening we were taken to a cafe colonial, a Brazilian-style
high tea inspired by the customs of European immigrants in the 19th
century. On the beach, we snacked on corn on the cob served in the
husk and drank cool milk right from coconuts. The team's favorite
drink was Guarana, sweet green soda with lots of caffeine.
 &HT;    A cultural exchange had been arranged for us the afternoon
before we left at the Colegia Energia, a private school in
Florianopolis that prides itself on its English instruction. When
we arrived, we were met with wild cheers, as if we were a busload
of American movie stars. Our boys were a little stunned at such a
reception and we had to remind them to keep smiling.
 &HT;    The school had prepared a short program and presented each of
our team members with souvenir notebooks. A soccer scrimmage was
held in which our girls soundly beat four Brazilian girls. While
our boys were outclassed on the field, they were mobbed by
Brazilian girls and boys asking for e-mail addresses and
photographs.
 &HT;    Once our team got used to the attention, those who spoke a
little Spanish _ none spoke Portuguese _ tried to talk to the
students, who answered in their halting English.
 &HT;    That evening, we lost our last match, against the Astel Futebol
Clube, but only by a single goal. Once, John collided with an Astel
player, knocking him to the ground. As he would have back home, he
reached down to help the Brazilian to his feet, but was scolded by
Mr. Barreto.
 &HT;    ``Here you leave him alone,'' he said. ``Find him after the game
if you want.''
 &HT;    When we returned to Cincinnati, the team went on to become
division champions, at least partly because of improved soccer
skills. But the trip had also provided the players with a surprise,
the opportunity to represent their country by their actions: How
they played the game did matter.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY SUSAN ALLEN TOTH  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When I have finally opened the mail, unpacked my bags, started
the washing machine, restocked the refrigerator and riffled through
a few newspapers, I am ready to stay home forever.
 &HT;    Yes, I realize, I'm totally exhausted. I stroke our cats,
defrost some homemade soup and soon send my husband, James, to his
office so I can luxuriate in having the house to myself. No, I am
not going to travel again for a long time. Months and months, maybe
longer. Who knows when I'll ever be ready to study another
guidebook or decipher another map?
 &HT;    I am tired of looking at menus. I can't bear to sleep in any
more strange bedrooms. I want to forget all those uneasy searches
for public toilets.
 &HT;    Our friends applaud this decision. They think James and I travel
too much anyway.
 &HT;    ``Of course you have a cold,'' one says. ``Everyone knows you
can't travel on a plane without getting sick.'' Another chimes in:
``How can you complain of not getting any writing done? You're
never home.''
 &HT;    Some urge us to slow down, take it easy. Others suggest getting
back to work, enjoying my garden, volunteering for a local charity.
I'm sure they are right. In fact, as I nod in agreement, I feel
morally invigorated.
 &HT;    Travel is a kind of addiction, I tell myself, and I must simply
let it go for a while. I can. I know I can.
 &HT;    Then something happens. If I could predict it, I might be able
to ward it off. But the travel impulse is sly, mysterious and
dazzlingly sudden.
 &HT;    Last December, glad to be home for the holidays after a hectic
trip to London, I was savoring the prospect of quiet weeks ahead.
Then I opened a Christmas card from a family friend in my Iowa
hometown.
 &HT;    Close to 90 now, cheerful and bright but unable to travel,
Isabel wrote: ``You certainly travel a lot. But do keep it up as
long as you can! I wish I had seen York and Cornwall. But I am so
thankful I didn't miss the Alhambra and the Prado.''
 &HT;    The Alhambra! I thought. The Prado! Why is it we've never been
there? Immediately I began to think of Spain. Why not Portugal too?
Perhaps next fall?
 &HT;    A few days later, on New Year's Eve, I was transfixed by the
televised fantasy of fireworks that lit up the bejeweled Eiffel
Tower. Oh, Paris, beautiful City of Light _ had it really been five
years since we'd walked along the Seine?
 &HT;    I could instantly envision broad boulevards, thin women with
chic silk scarves, and a corner patisserie where I bought a moist
round mouthful of chocolate cake with an indescribably delicious
coffee-flavored icing. Definitely, back to Paris.
 &HT;    Cleaning my desk the following week, I took off the wall an
outdated calendar with large color photographs of waterfalls. I
hadn't really noticed it much. But now I was transfixed by a view
of Upper Yosemite Falls, tumbling down magnificent snow-covered
cliffs.
 &HT;    I hadn't been to Yosemite for more than 30 years, and I barely
remembered my one day there. How could I think of Paris, or Spain,
when I hadn't really experienced Yosemite?
 &HT;    I am helpless against unforeseen assaults on my homebound
intentions. Occasionally, when I am already on a trip, I have a
passing glimpse of a destination that calls to me so seductively I
know I must answer.
 &HT;    One June afternoon, on a fast train from Inverness to London, I
glanced, for only a whizzing moment, far across miles of empty
fields to a tiny village of snug houses clustered around a bay. The
surrounding countryside seemed so undiscovered, the village so
remote.
 &HT;    I studied my map: Alnmouth, Northumberland. Three years later,
we were walking through light rain down its long quiet beach.
 &HT;    On another afternoon, this time in early fall, I sat on a level
rock at the northernmost edge of Scotland and gazed, entranced, at
the distant gray-green shapes of the Orkney Islands half-hidden in
the mist. They seemed as if they belonged to a different world.
``James,'' I said, ``we have to go there.''
 &HT;    James smiled, partly in resignation. ``O.K.,'' he said amiably,
``but why don't we finish this trip first?''
 &HT;    Two Octobers later, we rented a cottage for a week on an Orkney
island called, disarmingly, Mainland.
 &HT;    Sometimes all it takes is a single picture or a few words. We
once spent a week near Cromer, on the north Norfolk coast, because
that was the phrase _ ``the north Norfolk coast'' _ occasionally
appearing in travel guides, that had begun to haunt my imagination.
It sounded so unlike the cozy Cotswolds, or the well-trodden and
prosaically named Lake District, or flowering Kent, the Garden of
England.
 &HT;    Then I read P. D. James' ``Devices and Desires,'' and her
intensely evocative description of that bleak, windswept land made
me determined to see if she was right. And she was.
 &HT;    Although P.D. James first sent me to Norfolk, Arthur Conan Doyle
to Dartmoor and Dylan Thomas to Wales, I am not often struck by the
travel impulse when I read nonfiction travel books. This may seem
odd, since I have indulged in such memoirs myself.
 &HT;    But, after closing a particularly atmospheric or vivid travel
narrative, I tend to think: ``OK. Wonderful. Now I've been there.''
 &HT;    If the author has filled my eyes with his or her personal
vision, I am perversely not moved to explore certain corners of
Provence, or Tuscany, or Patagonia.
 &HT;    If, however, I am swept into a place by reading a novel or
biography, I absorb the landscape sidewise, out of the corner of my
eye. Then I become intrigued.
 &HT;    After finishing Tim Binding's ``Lying With the Enemy,'' a novel
about life in occupied Guernsey during World War II, I asked James,
``Why haven't we ever been to the Channel Islands?'' He looked
blank. I handed him the novel, and the next year, we were off.
 &HT;    My love of Scottish islands began, not with a guidebook, but
with Gavin Maxwell's ``Ring of Bright Water,'' an account of life
with his beloved otters.
 &HT;    I soon tracked Maxwell through his later, much harsher, memoirs,
``The Rocks Remain'' and ``Raven Seek Thy Brother,'' and, after
many years, I eventually looked across the water to the lonely site
of his nearly inaccessible Camusfearna.
 &HT;    As James and I walked parts of the rocky coastline of western
Scotland, and explored Mull and Skye that year, I often thought of
Maxwell's intense, troubled spirit. His love of this land had
brought us there.
 &HT;    Or had it? As a young girl, I used to sit at the piano and play
through ``The Fireside Book of Folk Songs.'' One of my favorites
was ``The Skye Boat Song.'' Its simple, poignant melody had an
unforgettable refrain, especially alluring to an Iowa girl who
lived far from any ocean: ``Carry the lad who was born to be
king/Over the sea to Skye.''
 &HT;    I didn't know the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and I had no
idea where Skye was, but I knew loss and regret when I heard it.
Over the sea to Skye: someday perhaps I would know more.
 &HT;    So even a song can start me thinking of travel. After our trip
to Hawaii last winter, James began to play a CD we bought there. He
plays it a lot, especially when it gets really cold outside.
 &HT;    Like James, I had been delighted by our relaxing, balmy week on
Molokai. So when I hear ``Polynesian Love Song'' or ``Lovely Hula
Hands,'' I don't think, ``This is corny.'' No, I want to be back on
our screened lanai, listening to the warm splashing surf a few
yards away.
 &HT;    It doesn't take much. Sometimes I think I should look for an
antidote, but I haven't thought of one yet. Maybe if I muttered
Thoreau's proud boast, ``I have traveled much in Concord''? If I
repeated like a mantra, ``Home is where the heart is''? What about
a CD that played, again and again, ``Home Sweet Home''? I'm not
sure any of it would help.

 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My husband wants adventure, I want a spa with a spiritual
nature and our kids don't fit into either category. Help! Know of a
vacation destination that will meet everyone's needs?
 &HT;     A:  The Enchantment Resort in Sedona, Ariz., and its new
destination spa, Mii Amo, will surely please all. Nestled within a
truly enchanting red-rock canyon, Enchantment offers scenic
relaxation and adventure, as well as Camp Coyote, ranked one of the
best kids programs in the world.
 &HT;    One of Enchantment's treasures is Uqualla, the shaman and former
chief of the Havasupai tribe, who acts as spiritual ambassador for
the resort. While children play and learn about the local cultures,
guests can be pampered by healing oils that are blessed each
morning. Spiritual consultations are available, and the staff
offers an array of innovative spa treatments.
 &HT;    The Enchantment concierge can arrange a variety of hiking and
rock-climbing tours for the adventurous or the mere stroller.
 &HT;    Your family should save an afternoon to fly by helicopter with
Uqualla to his tribe's village at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.
There you can enjoy a swim and picnic at the nearby falls.
 &HT;    At the end of the day, whether your crew is rested or exhausted,
Enchantment's restaurants offer an eclectic selection of spa
cuisine and hearty southwestern fare, as well as an excellent wine
list.
 &HT;    Book now for the holidays to reserve an Enchantment casita or
one of Mii Amo's 16 rooms and suites. Room rates begin at $195 per
night. For more information, call (800) 826-4180 or visit
www.enchantmentresort.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I've always been intrigued by the mystique of Harvard, but
the two times I visited Cambridge I felt like such an outsider. How
can I get a better feel for the place?
 &HT;     A:2 Home to Harvard, MIT and the JFK School of Government,
Cambridge may well be the premiere locale for intellectuals in this
country. Most visiting lecturers and dignitaries stay at the
Charles Hotel on Harvard Square.
 &HT;    Not only is it within walking distance, at times the Charles
Hotel seems like an extension of the Harvard campus. Relax in the
foyer library and watch the comings and goings _ or better yet, ask
the concierge to arrange a private tour of Harvard with a recent
graduate. Often the guide runs into buddies, conversations ensue
and the scene opens before you.
 &HT;    I would suggest arriving early for breakfast at the Charles'
lively Henrietta's Table, where writer David Mamet or Cambridge's
dot.com elite might just be doing business.
 &HT;    Lunch would be a good idea at a popular joint called Bartley's
Burger Cottage (1246 Massachusetts Ave.), but Casablanca (40
Brattle St.), with its fusion Mediterranean cuisine, is a more
original mainstay of Cambridge _ especially in the evening at the
bar.
 &HT;    Room rates at the Charles Hotel begin at $250 per night.
Facilities include a day spa and three-story health-and-fitness
center. For more information, call (800) 882-1818, or visit
www.charleshotel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I have played on golf courses around the world and really
enjoy when courses throw a unique spin into the golfing experience.
Can you suggest a course that offers a bit of originality?
 &HT;     A:  The new ``Heli-Golf Package,'' offered by Rosewood Hotels &AMP;
Resorts in Little Dix Bay in the Virgin Islands, provides the
originality that adventurous golfers look for. This heli-golf
experience features a scenic helicopter flight to St. Croix, where
golfers are deposited right onto the green and are then processed
through customs and immigrations with minimal hassle.
 &HT;    Described as ``the Caribbean's most exclusive golf getaway,''
Little Dix Bay's Heli-Golf Package includes three nights'
accommodation for two; greens fees, cart and golf escort; daily
breakfast and dinner; and complimentary water activities. Rates are
based on double occupancy, with deluxe accommodations starting at
$3,500 and suite accommodations starting at $5,000.
 &HT;    Laurance Rockefeller founded exclusive Little Dix Bay in 1964.
These low-key yet upscale accommodations are set in a 500-acre
garden paradise and a pristine private beach. For more information,
call (888) ROSEWOOD.
 &HT;     Q:  I am a single female who enjoys traveling alone, but
occasionally I feel left out of certain social activities because I
am not part of a couple. Do other independent travelers ever feel
this way?
 &HT;     A:  Some people do _ and, unfortunately, it's usually women.
Because of this, Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines now feature their popular
gentlemen hosts aboard every cruise. With their gracious social
skills and dancing ability, these men are well-known for making
single female passengers feel at ease in all social activities.
 &HT;    Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines offers exhilarating cruises throughout
Africa, the Caribbean, Europe and South America. For more
information and reservations, visit www.eurocruises.com, or call
(800) 688-3876.
 &HT;     Q:  Over the years, I have noticed that some hotels are more
in-tune with the needs of female business travelers than others.
Can you recommend a good hotel that focuses on this segment of the
population?
 &HT;     A:  The Pan Pacific San Francisco recently surveyed female
guests _ focusing on those with business needs _ and has made
several adjustments.
 &HT;    The women who were surveyed reported that females appreciate
softer, more personal touches. For example, minibars are now
stocked with wines by the glass. There are lighter menu choices
available on the 24-hour room-service menu, personal butlers can be
provided and the staff is available to escort female guests to
their rooms. This is just a handful of the amenities that are part
of the hotel's signature luxury service.
 &HT;    For business travelers, the Pan Pacific has added a virtual
office to many rooms. Copy capabilities are now part of the in-room
fax machine, and all guest rooms will soon be wired for high-speed
Internet access. The hotel has also acquired a number of laptop
computers.
 &HT;    The Pan Pacific San Francisco is located just one block from
Union Square and is a cable-car ride away from the city's theater
district, fine restaurants and other tourist attractions. For more
information and reservations, call (800) 533-6465, or visit the web
at www.panpac.com.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The romance of the rails lingers in a handful of deluxe trains
that run on well-orchestrated trips throughout the world.
 &HT;    What's the appeal of such luxury train trips? Vintage rail cars
that have been lavishly restored; itineraries that take passengers
through some of the most beautiful landscapes and cities in the
world; impeccable service; and food that is extraordinary.
 &HT;    For those who can pay the price, here are some elegant journeys
to consider. Prices are per person, based on double occupancy.
 &HT;    The American Spirit (601 Union St., Seattle, WA 98101;
888-533-7245; www.americanspiritrail.com) features 1950s Budd-built
streamliner railcars. The company offers a variety of western
itineraries that include visits to the Glacier, Grand Tetons and
Yellowstone National Parks.
 &HT;    Trips last anywhere from two to nine nights. Accommodations are
in hotels, not on the train, and motorcoaches supplement the rail
service.
 &HT;    A typical itinerary is the ``Montana Rockies Rail Tour,'' which
begins in Post Falls, Idaho, continues on to Missoula, Mont., and
ends in Livingston, Mont. The cost of the two-night trip begins at
$499. Lodging and daily breakfast, as well as transfers from
Spokane Airport, are included.
 &HT;    The American Orient-Express (5100 Main St., Downer's Grove, IL
60515; 888-759-3944; www.americanorientexpress.com) utilizes 15
vintage rail cars on its luxury voyages. The train travels cross
country as well as on shorter trips throughout the West.
 &HT;    For example, the ``Rockies and Yellowstone'' itinerary is a
six-night trip that commences in Denver and visits Arches National
Park, Salt Lake City, Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks.
The cost begins at $2,990.
 &HT;    The best-known name in luxury-train travel is probably
Orient-Express Trains &AMP; Cruises (Sea Containers House, 20 Upper
Ground, London, SE1 9PF, England; 800-524-2420;
www.orient-expresstrains.com or c/o Abercrombie and Kent
International Inc., 1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523;
800-323-7308; www.abercrombiekent.com). They offer a variety of
rail itineraries for the well-heeled traveler.
 &HT;    The most famous trip is the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express
(VSOE), which features restored period rail cars, lavish service
and fine dining. Sightseeing and meals are included in most
itineraries.
 &HT;    The classic VSOE trip is from London to Paris and Venice, or
vice versa. The cost of this one-night trip starts at $1,970. The
train makes other trips as well, such as from Venice to Florence
and Rome; Venice to Prague, Paris and London; Venice to Lucerne,
Paris and London; and Paris to Budapest, Bucharest and Istanbul.
 &HT;    Orient-Express also offers the Eastern &AMP; Oriental Express, a
luxury train that has three itineraries: Singapore to Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, and Bangkok (and vice versa); Bangkok to Chiang Mai,
Thailand; and Bangkok to Angkor Wat, Cambodia, and Singapore. The
overnight Singapore to Kuala Lumpur itinerary begins at $600.
 &HT;    Among the other Orient-Express trains are the Northern Belle,
which calls itself the ``Orient-Express of the North.'' It offers
day trips and weekend getaways in Britain with departures from
Liverpool, Manchester and York. Again, vintage rail carriages, fine
dining and a high level of service are offered.
 &HT;    Orient Express also operates the Great South Pacific Express in
Australia, a restored luxury train that runs from Brisbane to
Cairns; Brisbane to Sydney; Brisbane to Canberra and Sydney; and
Sydney to Brisbane and Cairns. Contact them for more information.
 &HT;    The Royal Scotsman (c/o Abercrombie and Kent International Inc.
1520 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, IL 60523; 800-323-7308;
www.abercrombiekent.com or www.royalscotsman.com) takes visitors
through the rugged Scottish countryside on some of the beautiful
rails in Britain. The four-night Edinburgh to Edinburgh itinerary
is $4,150.
 &HT;    Beginning in the Scottish capital, the journey takes riders
through the dramatic West Highlands and rolling Perthshire hills
and then to the North East. Two-night trips start at $2,350. Rates
include all meals, wine and alcoholic and beverages as well as
sightseeing visits.
 &HT;    In Canada, the Rocky Mountaineer Railtours (1150 Station St.,
Vancouver, B.C. Canada V6A 2X7; 800-665-7245;
www.rockymountaineer.com) has a variety of trips through the
Canadian Rockies. These trains travel by daylight only, affording
the best views of the mountains. Overnights are spent in hotels.
 &HT;    One of the briefest excursions is the ``Two Day Redleaf Tour,''
a one-night trip through the Canadian Rockies, traveling from
Vancouver to either Jasper, Alberta, or Calgary, Alberta, with an
overnight hotel stay in Kamloops, Alberta. Prices start at $358 per
person and include the overnight stay and some meals.
 &HT;    Premier Selections (342 Madison Ave., Suite 916, New York, N.Y.
10173; 800-234-4000; www.premierselections.com) is the sales agent
for a number of great train journeys, including the Al Andalus
Express, the Royal Scottsman and the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.
Rates start at $1,512 and include five nights on the train, one in
a hotel, most meals and sightseeing.
 &HT;    Premier also has a variety of other luxury trains, including the
Blue Train in South Africa. This train runs from Capetown to
Pretoria, with an overnight in Johannesburg. The price of this
five-night train/tour package _ which includes four hotel nights,
one night on the train itself and some meals _ starts at $1,946.
 &HT;    Finally, Copper Canyon's Sierra Madre Express runs from Tuscon,
Ariz., down into Mexico's fabled Copper Canyon region. The
seven-night trip, which includes hotel and train accommodation, as
well as most meals, begins at $2,545.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Like anyone living in a popular tourist destination, I developed
a standard tour itinerary years ago for my out-of-town friends who
wish to see all that Reno, Nev., has to offer.
 &HT;    Because Reno is known for gaming, most of my visitors want to
stop at a casino to try their luck at gambling or to see a show.
But it doesn't take long for the area's natural beauty to weave its
magic. Even in midsummer, the snow-dappled Sierra Nevada set
against the clear blue sky is like a magnet for sightseers.
 &HT;    My personal tour starts in Truckee, home of the Donner Memorial
Museum, (530) 582-7892, that tells the heartbreaking story of the
Donner Party who were trapped in the Sierra Nevada during one of
our area's worst winters.
 &HT;    Then it's up Route 89 to Tahoe City for a stop at Fanny Bridge
overlooking the Truckee River. Fanny Bridge gets its name from the
poses people strike as they lean over the bridge to watch the giant
trout swim below.
 &HT;    A driving tour of Carson City, the capital of Nevada, is next.
Then, depending on the mood of the group, we head west to Genoa _
reputedly Nevada's first settlement and home of the state's oldest
saloon _ or east to Virginia City _ where the rich ore deposits of
this lavish boomtown helped finance Union efforts in the Civil War
and buy Nevada early statehood.
 &HT;    A visit to Reno wouldn't be complete without a walk along the
Truckee River and downtown _ usually with a stop at the National
Auto Museum _ and a meal at a Basque hotel, where ethnic fare is
served family-style at long tables.
 &HT;    But beware: If a Basque meal strikes your fancy, be prepared to
eat. A lot. The food is served in a series of seemingly endless
courses, giving diners ample time to visit with table mates who may
hail from other parts of the city, country or world.
 &HT;    A drive to Pyramid Lake, just northeast of Reno and famous for
being the location where Charleton Heston was filmed parting the
Red Sea in the ``The Ten Commandments,'' usually tops off my
official tour.
 &HT;    Recently, when I took a group of out-of-towners on a sightseeing
trip of the city, I realized how outdated my tour route had become.
All the sites I've mentioned are indeed worth visiting, but now
there's so much more to explore.
 &HT;    For example, a trip to Pyramid Lake and Paiute Indian
Reservation's Fish Hatchery, (775) 476-0500, where one can see how
prehistoric cui-ui fish are being saved, now can include a stop at
the new Tribal Museum and a visit to the Bureau of Land
Management's Wild Horse Adoption Center, (775) 475-2222 or
www.blm.gov/whb. Horses from Nevada's vast open spaces are brought
and kept here until people adopt them.
 &HT;    The Truckee River, with its 100-mile ribbon of rapids that lead
from Lake Tahoe down to Pyramid Lake, always has been a vital part
of my tour. Now, it's even more important.
 &HT;    Downtown Reno is where the Truckee River intersects with
Virginia Street, the town's main drag. It's home to many new
developments, including:
 &HT;    _ A walk with promenades for special events, such as ballet and
symphony performances.
 &HT;    _ Riverside paths, a favorite with bikers and hikers.
Eventually, these will run the length of the city once development
is completed.
 &HT;    _ Many unique Riverfront buildings, including the Riverside
Hotel and Casino, which is being converted into lofts and studios;
Christ Scientist Church, which is becoming the Lear Theater; and
McKinley School, which has been restored as an arts-and-cultural
center.
 &HT;    Some developments have new twists, such as the bluff overlooking
the south side of the Truckee River, where Reno's elite built homes
in what is now called the Newlands area. These days, local
residents involved in historic preservation lead tours of the area,
mostly for Elderhostel students, (877) 426-8056 or
www.elderhostel.org. Special group tours can be arranged by calling
the Historic Reno Preservation Society, (775) 322-1638.
 &HT;    At the other end of Virginia Street is the town's signature
landmark, an overhead street sign that proclaims Reno as ``The
Biggest Little City in the World.'' This is the fourth version of
the sign, which during World War II served as a landmark for
veterans heading home from the Pacific.
 &HT;    Two models of the sign adorn downtown. The newest is known to
turn green on St. Patrick's Day or go dark during Christmas carol
sing-alongs, while the other model is mounted outside the National
Auto Museum on Lake Street.
 &HT;    West of Reno, my tour now includes a stop at Chrissie Caughlin
Park beside the Truckee River. It's a place I have walked my
miniature schnauzers for years, but I now know that pioneers
traveling in covered wagons used a large pine tree, roughly four
feet in diameter, as their ``post office'' and stuck notes for
other immigrants on its trunk.
 &HT;    Further west, it's possible to take a look-see at the
still-visible tracks of the Donner Party wagon train on either side
of Dog Valley Road near a small town called Verdi.
 &HT;    Reno is rich in history, from miners searching for quick riches
and pioneers hurrying to reach California, to railroaders laying
the train tracks that would stitch together the North American
continent. For decades, it stood as an oasis for people traveling
to other places.
 &HT;    Now, Reno is no longer just a pass-through town. In fact, the
place that's so dear to my heart has finally become a fascinating
vacation destination in its own right.
 &HT;    For more information Reno, call (800) 367-7366 or visit

   In March 1997, the DVD format debuted with about 900 titles and
players costing as much as $1,000. Now, with 9,000 titles and
inexpensive players, DVD is on the cusp of replacing audio CD, VHS,
CD-ROM, and video game discs and cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   The digital versatile disc or digital video disc _ no one agrees
on what DVD stands for _ has revived the home video market,
breathed new life into old movies, given actors and directors the
option to discuss their work on alternate tracks, and, with
declining prices for both discs and players on the horizon, has
become affordable for the consumer. Players can now be purchased
for $150 and the average price of a disc is expected to fall to
$20-$25 retail before the end of the year. As of last month, more
than 2 million players have been sold, according to Jim Taylor,
author of ``Demystifying DVD,'' the definitive book on the format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before its third birthday in March, 2000,'' writes Taylor,
``DVD had become the most successful consumer electronics product
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kagan, an industry analyst, expects 172 million discs to be
purchased
</P>
<P>
   this year and estimates that, by 2006, the total number will
reach 623 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky's the limit,'' says Martin Greenwald, president of
Image Entertainment, one of the largest distributors and licensees
of DVD titles. ``I thought the laserdisc would catch on, but people
weren't ready. Now they are. The only problem with the boom is
getting the discs out to the public and keeping the quality high.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Paul Sweeting, who writes for both Video Business
and Variety, rental spending is up 3.3 percent at a time when most
experts believed the rental market would continue shrinking. And
it's due to the increased availability of DVD titles. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Stealing a look &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem. As long as there are products people are
willing to buy, there'll be others who are willing to steal them.
Piracy is a huge issue for the producers. For several years, Steven
Spielberg refused to release his films in DVD because of piracy
problems. Walt Disney Co. chairman and CEO Michael Eisner, who has
released many of the Disney animated films on DVD, is threatening
to delay ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' until he receives more
assurances that safeguards will be improved.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is ``one of the backbones of the company, and it could
be lost forever,'' Eisner told a joint committee of Congress
earlier this summer. ``We're considering not doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, as quoted in Video Business magazine, called the threat
of digital piracy ``the most devastating thing to happen to the
entertainment business, I think, in 75 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Eisner's testimony, Congress passed the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, a law designed to protect the studios
against piracy. The Motion Picture Association of America and
various other groups dedicated to preserving creative property have
filed suits against a variety of Web sites accusing them of
illegally copying DVD movies.
</P>
<P>
   US District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan is currently hearing
testimony in New York in the case of Eric Corley, a computer hacker
who explained how to decode DVDs on his Internet site. The studios
are suing Corley to prevent the ``unauthorized distribution of
their copyrighted material.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsha King, vice president of worldwide business affairs for
Warner Home Video, testified, ``If the legislation is not upheld,
then we've lost our protection for products in the digital
domain.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kaplan issued an injunction preventing Corley from
unlocking the encryption codes, most industry analysts expect that
no matter which side wins in New York, the other side will appeal
and the legal ramifications won't be decided until the case, as
expected, gets to the US Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue now is not whether DVD will succeed, but how we
should go about our business,'' said consultant Andrew Harrington. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Clarity begins at home &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the appeal of the DVD, aside from a clearer picture
and crisper sound, is the additional information and entertainment
value of the ancillary tracks,'' says R O'Donnell, a spokesman for
Criterion and Home Vision, two major DVD manufacturers and
distributors. ``Our staff has also played an important role in film
preservation.'' Since videotape tends to disintegrate through use
over time, films last much longer when imprinted on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   The additional appeal of DVD is that movie producers, directors,
and actors are beginning to see the new format not as a competitor
to the theatrical run, but as another step in a movie's
evolutionary path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that more people get to see the film,'' says Sigourney
Weaver, who took time out from a film she's shooting to discuss the
fate of ``A Map of the World,'' an independent film that didn't
find a large audience during its theatrical run last fall and is
slotted for release on DVD in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big films tend to crush the smaller ones in the
theaters,'' says the star of ``The Year of Living Dangerously,''
``Ghostbusters,'' ``Alien,'' and dozens of other movies with
budgets large and small. ``This film came out of the festivals,
including the Boston Film Festival, with great promise, but it's a
complex film and needs good word-of-mouth. Unfortunately, it didn't
last long enough in the theaters to get that going. Everyone in the
movie business seems to be so impatient. I'm hoping that it'll find
its audience on DVD.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Muniz, 14, star of ``My Dog Skip,'' believes that the
additional commentary tracks on DVD add to the film's entertainment
value. On the alternate track, the young actor talks about bonding
with Enzo, the Jack Russell terrier who plays the majority of
Skip's scenes. Enzo, by the way, is the son of Moose, who plays
Eddie, the pooch on ``Frasier.'' Moose plays the older Skip at the
end of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to do the DVD,''
says Muniz, before reporting to work for his successful situation
comedy, ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' earlier this week. ``I was just
honest. I think the movie's just awesome and I'm not saying that
because I'm in it. I would think it was the best movie even if I
wasn't in it. I just sat down and talked about the movie. It was
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   At last week's Video Software Dealers Association conference in
Las Vegas, industry professionals no longer debated the acceptance
of the format but how to proceed in the future.
</P>
<P>
   While the piracy issue remains unresolved, the DVD titles are
pouring out of the studios as fast as the manufacturers can press
the discs. Upcoming releases include ``Men in Black'' with
commentary by director Barry Sonnenfeld and star Tommy Lee Jones,
on Sept. 5, ``The Perfect Storm'' on Nov. 14, and ``Gladiator'' on
Nov. 21.

GAUGING THE PROSPECT OF A WOMAN BECOMING PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE LOTH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
MADAM PRESIDENT 
Shattering the Last Glass Ceiling 
By Eleanor Clift and Tom Brazaitis. Scribner. 349 pp. $26. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do women deserve consideration for high political office as a
matter of sheer equity, or because they will fundamentally change
the way business is conducted in the halls of power? This question
is never quite addressed in ``Madam President,'' a timely look at
the nation's sputtering efforts to envision a woman in America's
top job.
</P>
<P>
   There are 65 women in the 106th Congress, 92 in statewide
office, and 1,670 in state legislatures, and sometimes it seems
that authors Eleanor Clift and Tom Brazaitis have interviewed every
one. Like many of the pragmatic activists pushing female
candidates, the book itself seems more intent on achieving critical
mass than on examining the unique perspective and negotiating style
women might bring to the national stage. From Elizabeth Dole and
Geraldine Ferraro to Arizona's superintendent of education, Lisa
Graham Keegan, the tales of scores of ``ladies in waiting'' are
told in detail. Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift even
gets her own chapter.
</P>
<P>
   But Clift, a contributing editor at Newsweek magazine, and
Brazaitis, her husband and a Washington columnist for the Plain
Dealer of Cleveland, make few distinctions among the women they
consider, Republican or Democrat, hawk or dove, big spender or
skinflint. They do, however, make the point that women who play
against stereotypes (tough on crime, conservative on social
spending) may have a better chance at pioneering election to the
highest office _ sort of a feminist take on
only-Nixon-could-go-to-China.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, the book reflects the ambivalence that has plagued
the women's movement for at least 20 years: Is it better to excel
at playing the game by the old boy rules, or to change the rules?
The authors cannot suppress a certain pride in the fact that
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright displays a Thatcheresque
willingness to prosecute a war, or that California congresswoman
Ellen Tauscher was named to head a Democratic Party fund-raising
committee that offers $10,000 contributors ``special entree to
members (of Congress) and issue briefings in exchange for financial
support.'' It is this kind of business as usual that many voters
hope women will reject.
</P>
<P>
   Clift and Brazaitis are thorough reporters and display a
journalistic reserve that would be admirable in a magazine or
newspaper article but seems rather dry for a book, considering the
clarion call in the title. The narrative is not well-organized; if
it had been written chronologically or thematically it might have
had more drive. As it is, a little Jeanne Kirkpatrick is shoehorned
into the chapter on Dole, a little Sandra Day O'Connor is in the
section on women governors.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Madam President,'' with its careful recitation of the
hurdles women candidates face, is an invaluable primer for any
woman who is considering a run for office at any level. And with
the Democratic veepstakes still in full swing, it could prompt at
least one presidential candidate to give more than the obligatory
once-over to a woman for that job _ not because the
vice-presidential choice ever counts much in winning elections
(just ask Ferraro), but because the very act of interviewing women
can give a presidential hopeful a fuller perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Women have much to offer national campaigns, but the white-hot
glare of the spotlight makes all but the strongest wither. Dole,
who abandoned her bid for president earlier this year, is typical
of the ambitious woman whose ``childhood and young adulthood was a
steady march of achievement'' but couldn't stand the risk of
failure. On the way to attaining critical mass, women in politics,
business, science, and other nontraditional pursuits look forward
to the day when they are allowed not to excel, to achieve, to break
barriers, but simply to participate.

AMY BLOOM SHEDS LIGHT ON EVERYDAY CHARACTERS IN DARK HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
A BLIND MAN CAN SEE HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU 
By Amy Bloom. Random House. 163 pp. $22.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Empathy is one of the implicit prerequisites for a good writer
of fiction; next to sensibility (an instinctual regard for nouns
and verbs) and imagination, it may be the trait that matters most.
As a practicing psychotherapist, Amy Bloom presumably relies daily
upon this quality, which abounded through her 1993 debut, the story
collection ``Come to Me,'' and her 1997 novel, ``Love Invents Us.''
She grapples with the darkest of subjects _ psychosis, betrayal,
the death of children _ and yet infuses these caverns with light:
The perspective is so unruffled and intimate that she might as well
be rendering a morning spent baking cookies in a sun-filled
kitchen. Her distinguishing premise is the warmth of the ordinary,
in other words, for Bloom must have long realized that suffering,
whether madness or illness or a shattered heart, is as common as
night, and can be just as hard to stare down and describe.
</P>
<P>
   The stories of ``A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You'' all
draw on this generosity of affect, which allows them to be more
bearable than their subjects sound in summary: a best friend
struggling through the last ravages of cancer; a son, ravaged by
grief, who takes illicit refuge in his stepmother's arms. See?
Death and incest, but portrayed here with grace, authenticity, and
even considerable wit. In the paired stories of ``Lionel and
Julia,'' delivered in the first and then third persons, a son
announces in the opening paragraphs that he slept with his
stepmother the day after his father's funeral. The next 40 pages
are spent understanding how this could have happened _ the cliff's
edge of grief and misplaced yearning they both walked, the price
extracted for that moment of desperation. It's one thing to
consider this experience _ the Oedipal kiss of death _ without the
individual human quality; quite another to meet the mother in
question, who turns out to be a gray-haired jazz critic with a
heart the size of Utah, as well as her own crater of regret.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because Bloom isn't frightened of such human misfires,
she can see beyond their tragic consequence to the fear and
confusion that spawned them. And love walks the hallways of all
these rooms, whether they hold the mother grieving her infant son
in ``Stars at Elbow and Foot'' or the young woman in ``The Gates
Are Closing,'' a child of Holocaust survivors, whose lover is
succumbing to Parkinson's. Partly everyone just soldiers on: When
the Holocaust daughter tries to explain to her mother that
Buchenwald may have had something to do with her brother's mental
illness, the mother brushes her aside: ``Please,'' she tells her.
``We're very lucky. We're fine. Louis has your Uncle Morti's
nervous stomach, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Louis recovered from his nervous stomach,'' the narrator tells
us, ``with enough Haldol to fell an ox, and when he got obese and
shaved only on Sundays and paced my mother's halls day and night in
backless bedroom slippers, this was Uncle Morti's legacy as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom's ability to see past the shock of alienation to its human
core hovers over the design of her title story, which begins with
the adoration of a mother for her little girl, ``a mutual
admiration society of two smart, strong, blue-eyed women, one five
and one thirty-five.'' Jane loves Jessie with the unequivocal
boosterism every parent knows; loves her, too, in every infinite
unfolding moment that she realizes her child feels more at home as
a boy. This is a story, in capsule, about gender reassignment, or
transsexual crisis, but Bloom's compassionate reach has made it
something else _ an exploration of identity where the answers lie
in tenderness, desire, and unflagging loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   But this collection is slighter than Bloom's widely admired
``Come to Me''; its shadows of individual sorrows start to seem
redundant after a while, which is hardly the point. And the stories
falter at times under an externally imposed quality of literary
artifice, where Bloom sacrifices her unerring psychic candor for a
more academic notion of what a story ought to be. This reveals
itself most often in weak or too-neat endings: a mother's grief
salved by sacrifice; fear and sorrow soothed, however transiently,
by love. Life is messier than this, as Bloom well knows, and her
stories end most resonantly when they're left to the stony path of
ambiguity. More unnerving though less frequent is an occasional
creakiness of craft, when people hear through walls or see through
binoculars in order to further the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, the abundance of humanity in ``A Blind Man Can
See How Much I Love You'' is enough to carry it, for the simple
reason that Bloom blasts a hole through the narrow spaces of
provincial thought: She delivers terrible news in palatable ways.
The finest story in the collection is markedly different from the
rest. Told in the first person by an unapologetically angry woman
who's been mauled by her own life, ``The Story'' is about the
unscripted, unkempt disappointments that await you on the road. It
is also, to its credit and daring, about the art of deceit that we
call fiction _ the ways we manipulate, revise, or bend the
narrative to shoehorn it into order. Some people will not take to
this story; it is self-conscious and artful, and almost vehemently
anti-Bloom. But it has about it an architectural truthfulness and
pain that I appreciated: No tidy endings or sweet transcendence,
just the demon of daily living. That's a universal beast that won't
be tamed by either literary finery or the 50-minute hour, and it
seems to me fitting, and oddly courageous, that Bloom has given it
the final say.

`SPACE JAM' SCORES AGAIN ON DVD

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Space Jam'' (DVD) _ The Michael Jordan, Bugs
Bunny, and Daffy Duck movie was released on VHS last year, but the
DVD has added some amusing features. The alternate track
commentary, particularly the remarks by Bunny and Duck complaining
about their roles, is as funny as anything in the film. The problem
is that the voice talent and other commentators keep repeating the
difficulties of working with digital effects. Who cares? Give us
more of the animated cast's complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intimate Lighting'' _ While the French New Wave garnered most
of the publicity, the influential East European independent cinema
has had a comparable effect on film history. In this Ivan Passer
1965 release, the story of two musicians is equally comic and
tragic. Filled with marvelous political metaphors and
anti-totalitarian symbols, Passer's work showed that making films
about everyday people can make for extraordinary movies.

AN ILLUMINATING ACCOUNT OF THE LIVES OF ABUSED WOMEN

SAVING BERNICE 
Battered Women, Welfare, and Poverty 
By Jody Raphael 
Northeastern University Press, 184 pp., $45 (cloth), $16.95
(paperback) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, Bernice Hampton's story sounds so grim it invites
cynicism. Her father was an alcoholic who beat his wife and put his
son in a bucket, poured gasoline on the boy, and tossed in a match,
burning the child to death. He told his wife that if she testified
against him, he would kill her and everyone else in the family. An
aunt went to court and told the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Putting this story in chapter one of a book called ``Saving
Bernice: Battered Women, Welfare, and Poverty,'' could seem like a
pathetic ploy for sympathy. But Jody Raphael, head of the Center
for Impact Research, a nonprofit organization in Chicago, has
written a more profound book.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Woolf quotes head each chapter _ haunting reminders
that women have been poor ``not for two hundred years merely, but
from the beginning of time.'' Even with a room of one's own, Woolf
says, women must struggle to pay the rent and furnish the room. In
a foreboding tone, she warns that the obstacles women face include
men.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Woolf, Raphael deftly mixes news stories,
research, interviews, anecdotes, and statistics. It is, however,
Bernice's raw narrative that drives the book. Although she tells of
being a teenage victim of rape, dating violence, and domestic abuse
who ends up on welfare for eight years, readers are not asked for
pity. Instead, Raphael offers insight.
</P>
<P>
   Take the anecdote _ you can often find it in newspaper stories,
or politicians' remarks _ about the welfare mother who drops out of
a training program. She may seem lazy, fearful, addled, or
unconcerned about her children. But Raphael argues that the woman
may not be the problem at all. In Bernice's case, her partner,
Billy, would take her books, refuse to baby-sit for their children,
beat her, or rape her when she attended classes or training
programs. Bernice explains: ``Billy knew that our life was nothing.
If I went to work, he would have lost me. He knew it, and that was
what he was afraid of. He was right. If I had been able to get a
job, I would have been gone.''
</P>
<P>
   A memoir might provide a flimsy haven, the sensation that by
definition the tale of a tragedy is only one person's story. But
the point of this book is that Bernice _ even in her most tortured
moments _ is not alone. And Billy is no aberration. Raphael quotes
training program staff who confirm that domestic violence is a
common problem. Employers describe women who come to work with
bruises. And studies show that women who are stalked by abusers
lose time at work.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael whacks traditional gender roles, arguing that the desire
for a ``normal'' life causes some women to put up with abuse that
may trap them in poverty in order to keep families intact.
Similarly, Billy and other men in the book argue that women should
stay home. This faded chestnut becomes a justification for
sabotaging or even beating women.
</P>
<P>
   Although the book often reads like a novel, Raphael makes a
compelling public policy plea. Before the first chapter ends,
readers get a thorough education. An easily digestible 156 pages of
text, the book is nonetheless packed with information. Even readers
who disagree with Raphael are likely to concur with her call for
more research.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael tackles controversial issues: men's jealousy of women's
earnings, and the idea that while women of all incomes suffer from
domestic violence, poor women are more vulnerable to this abuse.
Raphael argues that teenagers' pregnancies may be due not to
carelessness but to coerced sex. Women who keep having babies, she
notes, may do so because their partners refuse _ even violently _
to use contraception. And she discusses the impact of
post-traumatic stress disorder on victims of domestic violence. A
vital point: Look at the men. Study their conflicts and stresses
and help them meet their economic needs.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bernice, she is working by the book's end. Sadly, her son
lives with Billy, who is in another abusive relationship. But like
Hester Prynne at the end of ``The Scarlet Letter,'' Bernice says
she believes that men and women can get along. She talks of reading
about a ``nice little block'' where in one house a man abused his
partner, but eventually left because women neighbors kept calling
the police. Bernice's and the book's powerful last words: ``I want
to live on that block.''

AN UNPLANNED MODERN TREND: A SLIPPING SENSE OF COMMUNITY

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
BOWLING ALONE 
The Collapse and Revival of American Community 
By Robert D. Putnam. Simon &AMP; Schuster. 541 pp. $26. 
 
ALMOST HOME 
America's Love-Hate Relationship with Community 
By David L. Kirp. Princeton University Press. 350 pp. $24.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Bowling Alone,'' Robert D. Putnam amasses an overpowering
body of statistical evidence to buttress his argument that the
sense of community has been lost in American society.
</P>
<P>
   The paradigm that produces the title is the decline in the
number of people who belong to bowling leagues _ and thus bowl
together _ even as bowling remains a popular pastime. Further
evidence, both anecdotal and statistical, comes from the records of
bridge clubs, service organizations, church groups, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   As Putnam, a professor of public policy and former dean of
Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, puts it, well
into the 1960s, Americans were ``joiners,'' entering ``into ever
deeper engagement in the life of their communities.'' But in the
years since then, ``we have been pulled apart'' _ or perhaps more
accurately, have pulled ourselves apart _ ``from one another and
from our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   This argument, originally made in a 1995 article in Journal of
Democracy, attracted considerable academic criticism, mainly about
its methodology. The current book is an attempt both to prove the
original point with new data and to suggest how that lost sense of
community can be restored.
</P>
<P>
   A curious thing about this decline of community _ or of ``social
capital,'' to use the favored public-policy term _ is that America
appears to be awash in ``community.'' It is pretty much impossible
to go through a day's worth of news without finding references to
aggressively powerful or power-hopeful communities _ the ``South
Boston community'' on the one hand, or various minority
``communities'' that would like a taste of such power on the other.
</P>
<P>
   If, as Putnam has put it, social capital represents those
``features of social life'' such as personal networks and shared
activities that help people ``to act together more effectively to
pursue shared objectives,'' then surely the ability of the South
Boston ``community'' to require ``community benefits'' from
would-be developers fits the definition.
</P>
<P>
   This observation provokes a further one: It is an open question
whether more social capital is necessarily a good thing. On this
point, Putnam has arrayed a series of indices. They suggest that
states that rank high in social capital _ in New England,
especially Vermont, and the upper Midwest, especially the Dakotas
(despite, apparently, the endemic poverty and alcoholism on the
Indian reservations) _ have lower rates of violent crime, are
``less pugnacious,'' with children ``who are better off'' and watch
less TV.
</P>
<P>
   Useful _ and engagingly written _ anecdotal evidence on this
subject is presented by David L. Kirp, Putnam's academic opposite
number at the University of California at Berkeley. One such
account describes a community coming together in the aftermath of
the brush fires that swept through the Berkeley-Oakland hills in
1991, destroying some 3,300 homes. ``People who had been burned out
of their homes painted ceramic tiles to memorialize what they had
lost'' _ grandma's china, ``the squirrels who used our telephone
lines as a highway'' _ that ``had an emotional punch akin to the
AIDS quilt.''
</P>
<P>
   When they weren't designing tiles, homeowners were banding
together ``to negotiate bigger insurance claims.'' And when the
insurance money rolled in, those neighborly homeowners proceeded to
build monster villas to replace the arts-and-crafts bungalows that
had been destroyed. As Kirp puts it, ``An inviting hillside of
winding roads, thick foliage, and informal houses had been
transformed, at the cost of more than a billion dollars, into the
kind of place that nobody supposedly wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   It is instructive to place this anecdote against a hypothetical
case that Putnam presents to illustrate the public and personal
benefits of social capital. Putnam's hypothetical couple, Bob and
Rosemary Smith, are parents of 6-year-old Jonathan. They ``support
public education in principle,'' but the local elementary school is
``a shambles.'' Instead of pulling out for a private school, Bob
and Rosemary decide to stick around and organize a PTA.
</P>
<P>
   In public-policy speak, the PTA not only improves the school,
but ``allows for the deepening of interpersonal bonds and `we-ness'
between families and educators.'' And there are personal benefits
for Bob and Rosemary _ ``another couple or two with whom they can
catch a movie on Friday nights'' and more contacts for Bob to call
on if he loses his job.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the two cases illustrate an important caveat
that Putnam raises about the value of social capital. ``Sometimes,
`social capital,' like its conceptual cousin `community,' sounds
warm and cuddly,'' he writes. But while ``networks and the
associated norms of reciprocity are generally good for those
inside, the external effects of social capital are by no means
always positive.'' Community-relations officers for police
departments, for example, will privately acknowledge that one
unintended consequence of an alert and vigorous neighborhood crime
watch is to move that neighborhood's criminals along to another,
less-watchful, neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the issue of what to do about all this.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam is very much into think tanks and the like, several times
referring to ``a concerted nationwide conversation'' involving
``thinkers and doers'' that he has ``spearheaded'' in recent years.
(Regrettably, he does not name any specific social-capital product
that has resulted from these conversations.) But at least he seems
to be on the right track with suggestions about the value of
participating in local governmental affairs and community cultural
groups. And, he notes, ``what we need is not civic broccoli _ good
for you but unappealing _ but an updated version of scouting's
ingenious combinations of values and fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, if Americans are no longer ``joiners'' in the old Boy
Scout, Kiwanis, bowling league tradition, the answer lies in taking
advantage of informal opportunities. One bit of sociological
information that should bother readers who consider themselves
friendly and sociable is that the number of times Americans
entertain friends at home has dropped from about 14 times a year in
the late 1970s to about eight now.
</P>
<P>
   A neighborhood cookout appears long overdue _ but please, no
``concerted neighborhood conversations.''

WICKED PLEASURES, EMPTY CALORIES   IN A GONZO TOME 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
AMERICAN RHAPSODY 
By Joe Eszterhas. Knopf. 432 pp. $25.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If presidents get the histories they deserve, and it says here
they do, then it's fitting that we go from ``Dutch,'' an authorized
Ronald Reagan biography that trafficked in fictional characters and
presidential cluelessness, to ``American Rhapsody,'' an
unauthorized Bill Clinton biography that mixes Hollywood depravity
with musings on (and by) the president's private parts.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the immediate question: Is it too late for the
Democrats to draft Warren Beatty? Because _ forget presidential
timber _ Beatty would make sensational copy. A dream candidate for
the Drudge Age, a walking, talking DNA sample on the Gap dress of
history. ``The flesh he liked to press was horizontal, not
vertical,'' writes Joe Eszterhas of Beatty, comparing him to
Clinton, in a sentence that neatly captures both the wicked
pleasures and empty calories stuffed inside the bloated roast pig
of a book that is ``American Rhapsody.''
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas is the latest to take measure of the Clinton conundrum
(masterful pol/mendacious skirt-chaser), much to the consternation
of others who have already made a buck or two exploring the subject
and have yet to share a shag rug and a bong with Sharon Stone, darn
their luck. Best known as a highly paid Tinseltown hack (``Basic
Instinct'' and ``Showgirls'' are two of his screenplays), Eszterhas
was at one time a youthful champion of the New Journalism, back in
the days when Rolling Stone was gathering no Kate Moss profiles and
gonzo was a trip, not a cliche. It's nice to see he hasn't lost his
journalistic fastball, even if he's pitching in a more rarefied
league these days _ so rarefied that a publisher will apparently
pay you millions of dollars not to do any reporting, then peddle
your work as nonfiction. Yo, Joe, is this a great country or what?
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Eszterhas dropped everything he was working on
(and hasn't the film industry suffered since?) to hunker down with
all the Clinton material he could get his paws on, from the Starr
report to Monica Lewinsky's memoirs. Eszterhas had begun to
recognize in Clinton the same uncontrollable appetites _ for sex,
drugs, rock 'n' roll, and denial _ that shaped the behavior of an
entire generation, appetites that killed Elvis (one of Clinton's
early role models), made a media star out of pornographer Larry
Flynt, and caused Hollywood to release movies like ``Jagged Edge,''
also written by Eszterhas. In other words, the author saw a lot of
himself in the president, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Having decided to explain Bad Boy Bill to the rest of us,
Eszterhas goes all the way, baby, like the governor portrayed in
``American Rhapsody'' with the White House in his sights and his
pants down around his ankles in the back seat of a Cadillac with
Someone Other Than Hillary. And why not the Full Monty? Hollywood
is a perfect lens through which to view contemporary Washington,
Eszterhas suggests. In Hollywood, oral sex is not regarded as sex
at all but rather as a ``little break in a busy afternoon'' for
hard-working male executives.
</P>
<P>
   How perfectly Clintonian! (Or Packwood-esque! Or Gingrich-like!
Your favorite adjective here). And what better final take on the
Clinton years, no? Does anyone this side of Hope, Ark., even
pretend to care how someone like David McCullough would handle the
cigar incident, or what Robert Caro would do with Juanita
Broddrick? Nah.
</P>
<P>
   Give us Kathleen Willey's Oval Office grope, intercut with
scenes from producer Robert Evans's mink-accented bedroom. Give us
James Carville _ rumored to be Hunter S. Thompson's illegitimate
brother! _ kneecapping Clinton's political opponents. Give us a
president who has functioned, in Eszterhas's words, as ``the wet
spot on America's bed.'' Give us footnote 209 to the Starr report,
the one that Nobody Talks About. Give us, Eszterhas says, a
commander in chief who is a compulsive onanist, does drugs with his
cokehead brother, and survives impeachment thanks to two defenders
_ Flynt and Vernon Jordan _ who turn out to have been shot by the
same assailant, a coincidence even Oliver Stone could not make up.
</P>
<P>
   Weaving together two narrative forms (one plainly fictional) in
a way that purportedly separates fact from fantasy, Eszterhas goes
so far over the top as to render any such distinction meaningless.
As a journalist, he's about as reliable as Clinton was a grand jury
witness; as an entertainer, he's Ted Koppel crossed with Ted
Nugent. Eszterhas has plenty to say about his own exploits of the
flesh, too, much of it mildly amusing if not exactly on a par with
the Camp David peace talks for historical significance. ``The truth
was that in the battle of the sexes, many of us were war
criminals,'' he observes, before claiming to have been
rehabilitated by his second marriage. (We'll wait for her memoirs
before rendering judgment.)
</P>
<P>
   The dark heart of this book, though, is occupied not by
sex-crazed Hollywood moguls or even by a phone-sex-crazed Clinton,
but by Richard M. Nixon _ no big surprise, really, in a rambling,
'60s-style manifesto stoned to the gills on generational juices.
JFK may have been priapic, LBJ bombastic, and Reagan a drooling
hypocrite, but Nixon was a true force of evil, the author writes.
Nixon The Night Creature, along with J. Edgar Hoover, the
wire-tapping drag queen. And because Clinton represents everything
Nixon hated _ ``the symbol and personification of the generation
that drove him from office,'' Eszterhas writes _ he is that much
more a sympathetic figure to boomers who came of age loathing Nixon
and who now recoil from born-again pols like George W. Bush, even
though he's a member of their generational tribe.
</P>
<P>
   So where does all this place Eszterhas politically? Does he
betray a conservative or liberal bias? As in the more capable hands
of Thompson, gonzo is a reportorial form that resists easy
categorizing. Thus it is with Eszterhas, who comes from a culture,
after all, that worships money and power far more than political
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   In a Hollywood where Disney executives send along copies of the
XXX-rated Tommy Lee-Pamela Anderson honeymoon tape in the same
package as ``The Lion King'' and ``Beauty and the Beast,'' family
values are better defined by the Sopranos than by the Christian
Coalition, anyway. Hey, have you heard the one about the studio
head who had sex on the balcony of an agent's home in sight of
dozens of party guests? In Hollywood, a story like that is all over
town the next morning. Everybody cares, and then nobody does 15
minutes later. Which is why Hollywood shrugged its shoulders at the
intern-in-the-Oval-Office story, according to Eszterhas. Yawn. Been
there, done that.
</P>
<P>
   So give Eszterhas his due, if not his seven-figure advance.
Quibbling over the factual accuracy of ``American Rhapsody'' is a
bit like chastising the Who for singing ``My Generation'' in the
year 2000, or Minnesota voters for electing Jesse Ventura anything
other than wrestling commissioner. It's utterly beside the point.
Either this book nails the essence of Washington and Hollywood
today _ the two-faced, casting-couch, power-grabbing,
electorate-pandering grotesqueness of it all _ or it does not.
Either it rocks, or it flops. The verdict here is that, like
Clinton and his tenure in office, it's a big, sprawling,
self-contradictory mess: hilarious, profane, improbable, and too
long by half.
</P>
<P>
   And if Warren Beatty ever does get elected president, we already
have a leading candidate for the job of White House spokesman.

RIGHT-WING LEGISLATOR WINS PRESIDENCY OVER PERES; BARAK WINS
NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE

 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a political upset, a relatively unknown right-wing legislator
was elected Monday as the eighth president of Israel, edging out
his more celebrated opponent, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres,
by a vote of 63-57 in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The president-elect, Moshe Katzav, 55, has served in the Israeli
parliament for 23 years and held several ministerial posts for the
right-wing Likud Party. His election Monday was hailed by Likud,
which has been the most prominent opponent of conceding any land to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The humiliating defeat for Peres, 76, reflected a contentious
mood in parliament that portended even more serious political
problems for Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who rode out a
no-confidence vote Monday following his return from a summit
meeting last week with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's ruling coalition was fractured when three parties
defected to protest his decision to join the summit talks. The
defeat Monday of Peres for the presidency threatened to further
undercut Barak's precarious minority government, which survived the
no-confidence motion by a vote of 50-50 with eight abstentions and
12 legislators not present. That was 11 votes short of the 61-vote
majority needed to bring it down.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone, from Israeli political commentators to daily
newspapers, had predicted a shoo-in for Peres. Peres won the Nobel
peace prize for his work in helping to bring about the peace
accords reached in Oslo between the Israelis and the Palestinians
in 1983. In addition to serving as prime minister three times,
Peres was also defense minister, foreign minister and finance
minister. He just resigned Sunday as regional cooperation minister.
</P>
<P>
   Katzav, who was born in Iran and raised among immigrants in the
Israeli town of Kiryat Malachi, where he became mayor at 24, is
descended from Sephardic Jews who immigrated from Arabic and
Islamic countries. The elite Ashkenazi Jews of European origin have
traditionally dominated Israeli politics.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency of Israel is considered a ceremonial position and
therefore nominally non-political. But Katzav's predecessor, Ezer
Weizman, had thrown his prestige behind the peace process espoused
by Peres and now Barak. Weizman resigned last month after becoming
embroiled in a scandal over accepting donations of cash from a
French businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Katzav on Monday stressed that his priority would be national
unity and declared his intention to become the president of ``all
Israelis.'' He attributed his election to a desire in parliament
``to bring about a calmer, more unified society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to contribute to the reduction of tensions within our
society, and I will be the representative of all classes,'' Katzav
said, according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Katzav called upon ``Arabs of Israel, the religious and the
secular, Sephardim and Ashkenazi, to see me as their
representative, their president.''
</P>
<P>
   To win the presidency, Katzav needed a simple majority of 61
votes in the 120-seat parliament. But in the first round of
balloting, he received 60 votes while Peres got 57. The three
remaining legislators abstained by casting unmarked ballots.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, Katzav picked up all three abstentions to
win the presidency with 63 votes to Peres' 57, touching off a
celebration among Likud legislators, some of whom cried and hugged
one another.
</P>
<P>
   Katzav has been described as an earnest but relatively colorless
politician. But his election highlights an ongoing ethnic-political
struggle between the country's Sephardic underclass and its
Ashkenazi establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, having survived Monday's no-confidence vote in parliament
_ his second in a month _ will confront another vote Wednesday on
whether to convene early elections, which otherwise would not fall
due for another three years.

CITY OF BROTHERLY LOVE COULD WOO OR BOO BUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BUD KENNEDY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ This city will never escape its history. Nor its
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   As the natives would say, you got yer Ben Franklin. You got yer
George Washington. But the name everybody remembers first is yer
Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the city that booed Santa Claus,'' said Steve Harmon,
a former Dallas radio personality now at a budding Philadelphia
country music station. ``People here know all about that.''
</P>
<P>
   That was at halftime of a Philadelphia Eagles pro football game
in 1968, not as long ago in memory as the city's last national
political conventions in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the nation will see whether the same Philadelphia
that bitterly despises the Dallas Cowboys will boo or cheer two
guys from Texas: George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if the locals even stay in town in the face of warnings
of traffic, protests and chaos, not to mention the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be madness,'' said Jason Williams, 29, guiding
the Philadelphia Ghost Tour on its nightly sundown search for the
spirits of Franklin and other Founding Fathers in the old homes and
cemeteries around Independence Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say 12,000 delegates, 50,000 protesters _ and another
50,000 from the media? Philly people are getting out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   The chaos began over the weekend when the Benjamin Franklin
Parkway, the broad boulevard from downtown to the Eakins Oval and
the Philadelphia Museum of Art, was blocked for protest marches.
That also cut off the main route to the museum's ``Rocky steps'' of
movie fame and to the bright red Alexander Calder statue ``Eagle,''
fetched from its previous home in downtown Fort Worth last year and
perched here on its way to a new home in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Republicans will find other familiar sights: the Thomas
Eakins painting ``Swimming,'' at the Philadelphia Museum on loan
from a Fort Worth museum and even a bronze statue of a longhorn
across from the ``Eagle'' at a fountain in the Eakins Oval. Several
hot dog stands sell franks with bacon and barbecue sauce called
``Texas wieners.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush's entourage will find that Philadelphians are of a
single mind about Texans, Harmon said: ``They hate 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   He carefully described his Philadelphia listeners as ``crusty.''
``They don't have a soft exterior, but they're good people down
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   They love Dallas music by the Dixie Chicks and LeAnn Rimes, he
said. ``But they hate losing to the Cowboys. Now, they sure hate
this convention tying up the town.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon and his radio partner, Scott Evans, will risk stirring
that attitude Tuesday when they have Bush's father, noted country
music fan and former President Bush, as a radio guest.
</P>
<P>
   They are not the only hosts who invited the senior Bush and hope
he brings his son along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know his father is coming here for a party, but _ say, do
you know anything about the governor's schedule?'' museum director
Dr. Marc Micozzi asked hopefully. His Muetter Museum, a medical
school history center, features an exhibit on presidential
surgeries but also showcases ``Siamese Twins in Fact and Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor will arrive Wednesday, missing a Tuesday party at
City Hall featuring the building of a mile long hoagie sandwich,
followed by a midsummer Mummers parade.
</P>
<P>
   Other planned events for delegates include a tour of the QVC
cable shopping network studio in nearby West Chester, Pa., on
Wednesday morning and, for Young Republican delegates and guests,
late-night happy hours every night and an end-of-convention disco
party until 6 a.m. Friday hosted by MTV.
</P>
<P>
   If other delegates stray into Philadelphia's dozens of downtown
pubs and bars, they will find Katmandu serving a drink called
``Nixon's the One'' and the Irish Pub pouring its version of ``The
American Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   A different fantasy experience can be achieved at PoliticalFest,
a giant local festival staged to attract tourists and visitors to
the downtown convention center, miles from the convention at the
First United Center sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   At PoliticalFest, similar to the interactive ``NFL Experience''
festival at Super Bowls, children or political junkies of any age
can:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pick up a fake press pass.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sit before a camera and anchor a mock TV news report.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a whistle-stop campaign speech from the back of a rail
car.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sign the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wave signs from a fake convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sit at a mock Oval Office desk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Or even emerge waving from the door of a mock Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism students from Fort Worth's Texas Christian University
took turns coming out of Air Force One waving ``victory'' hand
gestures like Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here asks whether I'm for Bush, and I'm not,'' said
Emily Ward, 20, of Springtown, Texas. She has begrudgingly
fulfilled several requests to say ``y'all.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, vendor Beverly Hills, 53, of Cordova, Tenn., was
trying to sell red, white and blue cloth cowboy hats for $25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put my life savings into this,'' she said, explaining how
she plans to recover her $42,000 investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be packed this weekend,'' she said. ``The Texans will be
coming in. Texans never have enough cowboy hats. I hope George W.
doesn't let me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, then, the alternative newspaper Philadelphia Weekly was
not referring to Texans on Friday when it greeted visitors with a
single 3-inch high headline:
</P>
<P>
   ``GO HOME!''

GOP HOPING TO SPOTLIGHT PARTY DIVERSITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB RAY SANDERS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Back in the days when television was broadcast
mostly in black and white, the National Broadcasting Co. created a
stylized peacock to remind viewers that it had more color than any
other network.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the GOP will begin displaying its own peacock image,
hoping to prove that it, too, can present programs ``in living
color.'' After Thursday, Republicans hope to be known as the ``full
color'' party.
</P>
<P>
   At least from the stage of the Republican National Convention _
and, of course, in front of prime-time TV audiences _ there will be
more color than I can ever remember in the GOP. The party will
parade its high-profile minorities across the huge platform for the
next four days to reinforce Gov. George W. Bush's message of
inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to judge it only from what you will see on the TV
screen this week, you might think the Republican Party has spent
the whole year in a tanning salon, attending diversity workshops
and spending a lot of time in sensitivity sessions.
</P>
<P>
   With NBC, there was truth in advertising; it was the color
leader in television 35 to 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP, some people are joking that there will be more
black and brown people on the convention stage than there will be
in the entire audience at First Union Center, for still more than
90 percent of the 4,132 delegates and alternates is white.
</P>
<P>
   Among 116 of the 124 Republican delegates from Texas, The
Associated Press reports that 8 percent are Hispanic, 2 percent
black, 1 percent mixed race and 1 percent Asian. So although the
Anglo population constitutes only 55 percent of the Lone Star State
(and is predicted to be less than 50 percent by 2008), whites make
up 88 percent of the Republican delegation from the state.
</P>
<P>
   The ``presentation of the colors'' will take on fresh meaning
during this convention. You will see all those Republican people of
color you know, and many whom you've never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Colin Powell, who's being talked about as secretary
of state in a Bush administration, will be on display, as well as
the highest-ranking Hispanic state officeholder in Texas, Railroad
Commissioner Tony Garza. The latter was one of Bush's first
appointments, being named Texas' secretary of state during the
governor's first term in office.
</P>
<P>
   Garza and Dallas native Alphonso Jackson, a black businessman
and longtime Republican who's the former head of the Dallas Housing
Authority, have been named assistant secretaries of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Also featured in high-profile spots will be Condoleezza Rice, an
African-American who is one of Bush's foreign policy advisers, and
U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, perhaps the Republicans'
fastest-rising (if not brightest) African-American stars.
</P>
<P>
   There will be other Hispanics and blacks _ ``regular folks''
such as a teacher, businessman, community worker _ who will get to
tell their stories before the convention crowd and the national TV
audience.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, and especially the credit of Bush, this
Republican convention will not look like those from the past, and
that's exactly what the governor wants.
</P>
<P>
   As technicians and performers went through rehearsals yesterday,
it was also evident that there will be a different feel to this
one.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from what I heard of the convention orchestra, and a
run-through with the Philadelphia Boys Choir, even the music will
be diverse. I heard a little funk. Someone was rehearsing a Stevie
Wonder song, and the boys choir added a touch of African rhythm
with a rendition of ``Circle of Life'' from the movie ``The Lion
King.''

there myriad utilities and upstart energy companies to choose from,
but countless permutations and combinations of ways to contract for
electricity, including buying it on the Web. As a result, all kinds
of businesses _ from metal smelters to property managers, from

&HT;       CADDY DEVILLE GETS RESTYLE TO TEMPT AFFECTIONS OF YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cadillac's flagship sedan, the De-Ville, has been completely
redesigned
</P>
<P>
   for 2000 in what may be a last-ditch but highly successful
attempt to save it from what looked to be certain extinction in the
late
</P>
<P>
   '90s. The problem was that the DeVille hadn't been keeping up
with the
</P>
<P>
   times. That is, it wasn't being designed to appeal to the people
who can
</P>
<P>
   most afford to buy it: upscale baby boomers in the prime of
their careers,
</P>
<P>
   with lots of spending power.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the DeVille remained a big, boatlike, glitzy luxury
sedan that
</P>
<P>
   was a clear throwback to the '60s and '70s, when there still was
a market
</P>
<P>
   for such vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In today's auto market, savvy buyers who have the big bucks to
spend on
</P>
<P>
   their cars don't want the kind of vehicle that an old-style
Cadillac
</P>
<P>
   represents: lots of gratuitous flash, but no real performance or
staying
</P>
<P>
   power.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they have been embracing the luxury brands from
Europe and
</P>
<P>
   Japan, such as Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, Infiniti, Audi and Acura.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the past, though, because Cadillac has made almost all of
the
</P>
<P>
   right moves with this new DeVille, and it should finally be
drawing some
</P>
<P>
   serious attention from affluent, educated boomers.
</P>
<P>
   I say almost, because the styling still might not be quite what
baby
</P>
<P>
   boomers are looking for.
</P>
<P>
   In what I believe had to be a concession to loyal DeVille buyers
of the
</P>
<P>
   past, the car still looks like a Cadillac, although it's not
quite as
</P>
<P>
   large and boat-like as its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all bad, though, because even though it still is
readily
</P>
<P>
   identifiable as a Caddy, there's really not much of the old
DeVille left.
</P>
<P>
   This car is new from the ground up, built on the chassis of the
popular
</P>
<P>
   Seville, which Cadillac drastically changed in the early '90s to
try to
</P>
<P>
   appeal to a younger market.
</P>
<P>
   The new DeVille has front-wheel drive, just like the Seville,
and it has
</P>
<P>
   the same basic drivetrain __ the outstanding Northstar System,
with a
</P>
<P>
   powerful but efficient 4.6-liter V-8 engine and smooth-as-glass
four-speed
</P>
<P>
   automatic transmission. The engine turns out 275 horsepower (300
in the
</P>
<P>
   uplevel DTS model).
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the styling and the drivetrain, the new DeVille has
something
</P>
<P>
   else that has never been a strong attribute of a giant Caddy:
great road
</P>
<P>
   handling. It doesn't wallow all over the road like DeVilles of
the past;
</P>
<P>
   in fact, like the Seville, it has become something of a driver's
car.
</P>
<P>
   But that improvement really hasn't come at the expense of ride
and
</P>
<P>
   comfort, as is often the case when performance is enhanced in a
luxury
</P>
<P>
   car. Sure, the new DeVille isn't quite as big as it used to be,
but it's
</P>
<P>
   still a comfortable ride for up to five adults __ six in a pinch
__ and it
</P>
<P>
   still smoothes out bumps almost as well as before (but without
the bounce).
</P>
<P>
   GM says the new DeVille is a trimmer, nimbler execution of a
spacious
</P>
<P>
   luxury sedan, and is three inches shorter and two inches
narrower than the
</P>
<P>
   car it replaces, giving it a trimmer, more athletic appearance.
</P>
<P>
   But its wheelbase is actually 1.5 inches longer, and its
interior space
</P>
<P>
   is virtually as roomy as the 1999 model.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its trimmer appearance, it still is classified a large
car by
</P>
<P>
   the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech gadgetry abounds in the new DeVille, which should help
in its
</P>
<P>
   bid to appeal to those savvy baby boomers, most of whom have
three or four
</P>
<P>
   personal computers at their disposal, as well as the latest TVs,
audio
</P>
<P>
   systems and home appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Among the gadgetry in our test car for the week, the 2000
DeVille DHS
</P>
<P>
   (base price $45,595 plus $720 transportation), were the
DeVille's unique
</P>
<P>
   night-vision system ($1,995) and the GPS satellite navigation
system with
</P>
<P>
   moving map display ($1,995).
</P>
<P>
   The Raytheon night-vision system, patterned after an infrared
system
</P>
<P>
   used by U.S. troops in the Gulf War, projects a display onto the
lower
</P>
<P>
   part of the windshield in front of the driver showing what lies
in front
</P>
<P>
   of the car's headlights, about a half-mile down the road. It
uses an
</P>
<P>
   infrared beam that picks up the heat of animate objects in the
car's path,
</P>
<P>
   such as a bounding deer or a child running into the street.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first application of this military technology to a
civilian
</P>
<P>
   motor vehicle, and it will be exclusive to the DeVille at least
for the
</P>
<P>
   first two years; after that, General Motors might expand it to
other
</P>
<P>
   vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio Cadillac dealers say the system has been popular
with
</P>
<P>
   DeVille buyers who either live in the Hill Country, or who drive
in those
</P>
<P>
   hills regularly, where deer crossing highways at night is a real
safety
</P>
<P>
   problem.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't see any deer during our test drive, but the system did
show us
</P>
<P>
   some people crossing the road ahead of our headlight beams,
giving us
</P>
<P>
   plenty of time to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   The navigation system is in addition to the DeVille's built-in
GM OnStar
</P>
<P>
   system, which connects the driver to a live operator anytime, by
pushing a
</P>
<P>
   button, to get real-time directions or help.
</P>
<P>
   Using the car's built-in GPS system, OnStar tells the telephone
operator
</P>
<P>
   exactly where the car is, and the operator can give the driver
directions
</P>
<P>
   to any destination, help out with hotel or dining reservations,
or even
</P>
<P>
   summon emergency help.
</P>
<P>
   But if the driver wants to navigate on his or her own, the
navigation
</P>
<P>
   system will lead the car to the destination that the driver
programs into
</P>
<P>
   it, and a colorful moving map on the dash shows the driver
exactly where
</P>
<P>
   the car is at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Another high-tech component is the DeVille's ``Ultrasonic Rear
Parking
</P>
<P>
   Assist,'' part of an $895 safety/security package that also
includes the
</P>
<P>
   Stabilitrak automatic stability system and a built-in
garage-door opener.
</P>
<P>
   The parking-assist system uses ultrasonic beams to ``look''
behind the
</P>
<P>
   vehicle while it is backing, and to alert the driver with a
series of
</P>
<P>
   rapidly increasing beeps as the vehicle nears an obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Front and side air bags are standard for front-seat passengers,
while
</P>
<P>
   our test car came with the optional side air bags for the rear
outboard
</P>
<P>
   passengers ($295).
</P>
<P>
   Other standard equipment on our DHS (the midlevel model)
included
</P>
<P>
   Magnasteer power rack-and-pinion steering, electronic level
control,
</P>
<P>
   four-wheel antilock disc brakes, all-speed traction control,
16-inch
</P>
<P>
   chrome wheels, audible theft-deterrent system, rain-sensing
windshield
</P>
<P>
   wipers, keyless entry, power and heated outside mirrors, power
</P>
<P>
   windows/seats/door locks, wood trim and steering wheel, leather
seats,
</P>
<P>
   power tilt and telescopic steering column, electronic compass in
the
</P>
<P>
   rearview mirror, Bose AM/FM/cassette/compact-disc sound system
with eight
</P>
<P>
   speakers, memory function for all personal settings, heated
seats, power
</P>
<P>
   rear sunshade and manual side-window rear sunshades, and daytime
running
</P>
<P>
   lights.
</P>
<P>
   Options on our car, besides the night vision, navigation system,
</P>
<P>
   safety/security package and rear-seat side air bags, included a
six-disc,
</P>
<P>
   glove-box-mounted CD changer ($595); and white-diamond exterior
paint
</P>
<P>
   ($650).
</P>
<P>
   Total sticker was $52,740, including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel economy ratings are 17 miles per gallon in the city and
an
</P>
<P>
   impressive 28 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 18.5 gallons of
gasoline,
</P>
<P>
   and unleaded regular is recommended. That's a departure from
most luxury
</P>
<P>
   cars, whose owner's manuals usually ask for premium fuel.

   CVN-BUSH-STRATEGY (Columbus, Ohio) _ As the Republican National
Convention opens in Philadelphia, Karl Rove, the top strategist for
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, optimistically does his electoral
college math and concludes that Bush lacks only 44 of the 270
electoral votes needed to win the presidency in November. By
STEWART M. POWELL.
</P>
<P>
   CVN-LAURA-BUSH (Philadephia) _ The first lady of Texas, Laura
Bush, has been described as ``traditional,'' ``shy'' and
``reluctant.'' But after a year on the campaign trail, she's come
into her own as the candidate's wife focused on education. Despite
a small case of butterflies, she steps into the limelight as one of
the main speakers at the Republican National Convention's opening
night. By DAN FREEDMAN.
</P>
<P>
   CVN-POWELL (Philadelphia) _ Colin Powell, the retired chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, speaks to Republican convention
delegates about community and volunteer service. Powell, who is
widely believed to be Texas Gov. George W. Bush's choice for
secretary of state if the Republican candidate wins the fall
election, heads a national volunteer group. By ERIC ROSENBERG.

<P>
   CVN-MEANS-COLUMN (Philadelphia) _ Gov. George W. Bush's
convention here demonstrates the power of the southwestern branch
of the elite eastern cartel dominated by Wall Street mogols,
internationalists and the Republican country club set in which his
father and grandfather had their political roots. It is more
conservative and has a younger face, but it redirects the party
away from the social issues and toward familiar conservative
economic policy. By MARIANNE MEANS.

   There's a move afoot to name a new national monument. Secretary
of the Interior Bruce Babbitt returned to northern Arizona last
week to discuss the future of the Paria (``Pa-ree-ah'') Plateau,
nearly 300,000 acres of federal wilderness bordering the Colorado
River as it flows south out of Glen Canyon Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Babbitt led a hike 1,500 feet up Spencer Trail so
participants could view the Vermilion Cliffs which make up the
Paria Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear that Babbitt wants to preserve this area of his
home state, and national monument status may be the only way for it
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   We can expect Babbitt to make a series of new national monument
recommendations to President Clinton soon _ probably after the
Republican National Convention. Paria Plateau will certainly be
among the areas recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Something special is happening with the more than 3.8 million
acres of public lands that have already been granted national
monument status by Clinton _ a vision _ Babbitt's vision for
preserving large tracts of landscape for the future and the
enjoyment of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument,
the more than 3.3 million acres of public land administered by the
Bureau of Land Management that have been set aside as national
monuments by this administration will continue to be under BLM
control. In the past, most of the national monuments were put under
the management of the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   The BLM administers millions more acres of public land than any
other federal lands agency. Babbitt wants to erase the BLM's image
as the ``bureau of livestock and mining'' and give the agency a
sense of pride in managing prime landscapes and ecosystems as
national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   This represents a change in direction for the BLM, but deeper
still, it represents a radical change in perception of what should
be set aside as national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Babbitt gave at the University of Denver Law School
on Feb. 17, he outlined a plan for the creation of ``landscape
monuments.'' He said the original ``postage stamp'' monuments to
preserve archeological ruins were a product of a vision from the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't it make sense in light of a subsequent 100 years of
understanding to say that we have room in the West to protect the
landscape, an _ if you will _ an anthropological ecosystem,''
Babbitt asked rhetorically. ''The real science on these landscapes
doesn't come out of digging out a room and extracting a few pots.
That was the 19th century _ and it was important. The real
discoveries of today come from asking the deeper question of `How
did communities manage to live in spiritual and physical
equilibrium with the landscape?' ... We can do better than to
protect five or six Indian ruins out on that land and say that
there is room in this culture for a quarter-million acres from
which we honor the past and, more importantly, learn, and take
inspiration from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The newly established Aqua Fria National Monument, less than an
hour's drive from Phoenix, is a 71,100-acre landscape monument. It
preserves ancient ruins, at least 450 prehistoric sites,
petroglyphs and prehistoric agricultural features like terracing.
</P>
<P>
   Aqua Fria National Monument is, for the mobile public of
Phoenix, a landscape preserve not far from home that can be
appreciated after a comparatively short drive. It's the city park
concept made grander with grandeur -- large vistas found outside of
cities but serving them and states and the people of the entire
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Paria Plateau, if it becomes a national monument, will be a
landscape monument greater than itself. It borders the Kaibab
National Forest and the Paria Canyon Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness
Area in Arizona and the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument
in Utah. A Paria Plateau National Monument could interlock those
vast vistas and scenic landscapes in perpetuity _ for all of us and
the generations we leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Babbitt asked the BLM to create a system to make
policy and provide guidance for the management of the national
monuments, national conservation areas, and other areas designated
for important scientific and ecological characteristics. BLM
Director Tom Fry announced the creation of the National Landscape
Conservation System in mid-June. Larry Finfer, the BLM's assistant
director for communications was named interim director.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview July 28, Finfer said about landscape monuments,
``These places are going to be different from (national) parks.
They're not going to be necessarily classic tourist destination
sites. They're not going to have a lot of facilities in them. The
touch is going to be light in them. The facilities will be located
primarily in the surrounding communities. That's the basics of what
was done at the Grand Staircase, for example. They're going to be
different from parks in that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be different also in the sense of some of
what are considered traditional uses like hunting, fishing,
grazing, and even in a case or two, oil and gas might be continued
out there. There's a sort of niche the BLM can fill in preserving
open spaces that's not quite the same as parks. Keeping them
remote, but allowing for some continuation of traditional uses ...
where those uses are compatible with the purpose for which the area
was established. In just about all cases, there will be no new
mineral location, no new leasing and regulation of off-highway
vehicles -- but no outright ban.''
</P>
<P>
   Finfer emphasized that his office would only provide guidance
and policy, that the management of any site would be left to those
on site.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said in his February speech, ``right now on this
landscape it's pretty much either/or.'' He is right. Either we set
aside some of these vast unique vistas and landscapes to preserve
them in their uniqueness, or the new urban sprawl across the West
will eat them away. Now is the time _ before it is too late.

   NATIVE AMERICAN MUSIC DESERVES IT'S OWN GRAMMY CATEGORY _
Columnist Karen Lincoln Michel argues that the recent decision by
the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to add a Native
American category to the Grammy Awards lineup next year may be well
intended but falls short. The Academy created only one category:
best Native American Music Album. She writes: ``That's similar to
having a single award for Latin music ... It's going to be
extremely difficult to find the best Native American recording when
you consider the category also includes contemporary native music,
a growing genre in recent years.'' (slugged:

   BEYOND TICKLING THE IVORIES _ This excerpt from Emerge magazine
by contributing columnist Calvin Wilson looks at two of today's
American jazz greats, pianists Matthew Shipp and Andrew Hill. These
two experimental jazz artists have roots in the musical past.
Indeed, Shipp cites Hill, 62, as one of his idols. Wilson examines
the predecessors who inspired these two contemporary artists and
how they continue to set standards of their own. (slugged:

   SOFTENING THE GOP _ The GOP is making headway with Latino voters
these days, writes columnist James Garcia. But more than a few
Latino politicos will tell you this is inherently bad. If you are a
``Latino Republican,'' they say, you are a ``vendido,'' a sellout.
Maybe, maybe not. Garcia believes that if there is such a thing as
a kinder, gentler ``21st Century Republican Party,'' then it's
epitomized by its newest recruits _ Latinos. If Latinos can
moderate the Republican Party _ humanize it, make it truly more
compassionate than it has been _ then the Latino community, and the
nation as a whole, will be better off. (slugged:

   COME TOGETHER _ In this commentary from a recent issue of KoreAm
Journal, the writer, a Korean-American who wishes to remain
anonymous, offers his opinion on the historical meeting between
President Dae Jung Kim of South Korea and Chairman Jong II Kim of
North Korea. ``Both sides have their own ideas of how North and
South should become one,'' he writes. ``The agreement essentially
states that both sides agree to disagree on that issue. It will be
interesting to see how that works out.'' He closes his article by
stating that although his Korean side yearns for the two Koreas to
become one, the American in him is skeptical of the show of
friendship and doubtful of the ``Stalinist state's intentions.''

TEXAS DELEGATION MEMBERS TO BACK TICKET DESPITE DISAGREEMENTS ON

</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN BROOKS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Bill Eastland stepped through his first political
loophole at 16 while growing up in the affluent Highland Park
neighborhood of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It was summer 1964, and Eastland and some buddies decided to
stage a carwash to raise money for Barry Goldwater's Republican
presidential bid. But red tape threatened when the ``local
constabulary'' wouldn't let them carry political signs on a busy
corner.
</P>
<P>
   That's where politics came in.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of one of the boys was an attorney who persuaded City
Hall that it was legal for them to carry signs if they were
walking. The event went on, they raised $400, and the teen-age
Eastland stumped for a GOP icon.
</P>
<P>
   This week marks another milestone for Eastland. After a decade
of trying, the Arlington, Texas, accountant is at the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia as one of 248 delegates and
alternates representing Texas and officially nominating Gov. George
W. Bush for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being elected a delegate or alternate to the national
convention is basically an honor that is bestowed on people for
party service,'' said Eastland, 52, who has worked as a volunteer
at two national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates vote on the party platform and party rules and hear
speeches from elected officials and internationally known
activists. Alternates step in when their assigned delegate can't be
there for an important vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Tarrant County delegation includes the two top officials of
the Texas Christian Coalition, the leader of the Eagle Forum, two
preachers and several ardent anti-abortion activists. Several have
run unsuccessful campaigns for elected office, and many have worked
behind the scenes for Bush since he was running for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the delegation don't consider themselves part of the
conservative Christian segment of the party, although they say that
they will put aside their differences for the benefit of party
unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my way or the highway,'' said Don Diamond, 55, of
Cleburne, a Johnson County alternate from a district in which the
three delegates are a preacher, an anti-abortion activist and a
lifetime member of Daughters of the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond considers himself socially conservative and opposes
abortion. But in contrast to his party platform's call for an
absolute ban on abortion, Diamond believes that, if a mother's life
is in danger, she and her doctor should be allowed to decide if an
abortion is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want George W. Bush to succeed, and whatever disagreements I
have should not stand in the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All Republican statewide officeholders and several legislators
are delegates. Many of the other delegates and alternates are
Christian conservative activists, including state GOP
second-in-command David Barton of Annetta, who wrote a book called
``The Myth of Separation'' and owns a faith-based construction
company called Wallbuilders.
</P>
<P>
   Others include Kelly Shackleford, head of the conservative Free
Market Institute in Dallas, and Jeff Fisher, a former Christian
Coalition official.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders characterize the state delegation as ``mainstream
conservative,'' led by Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison,
Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, Attorney General John Cornyn and State
Comptroller Carol Keeton Rylander.
</P>
<P>
   Although the abortion debate gets most of the media attention,
some delegates stressed that they're more interested in such issues
as education, health care, taxes and government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Eleanor Hutcheson, 74, of Fort Worth is opposed to
abortion. But her true passion lies in education issues, and, as a
member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, she has spent
most of the past decade reviewing textbooks for the state. She ran
for the state Board of Education but lost.

<P>
   Scott Fisher and other local Christian conservatives agree that
disagreements on how to prioritize issues shouldn't split the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see a constitutional amendment (banning abortion),
but it's not all or nothing,'' said Fisher, a Bedford pastor and
former Christian Coalition officer. ``You've got to look at what
you can accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian conservatives believed that they accomplished
their main goal going into the convention when Bush announced the
conservative, anti-abortion Dick Cheney as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he listened,'' said Michele Quinones, a member of the
State Republican Executive Committee. Christian conservatives had
threatened an uprising unless Bush selected a staunch social
conservative.

   CVN-BUSH-STRATEGY (Columbus, Ohio) _ As the Republican National
Convention opens in Philadelphia, Karl Rove, the top strategist for
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, optimistically does his electoral
college math and concludes that Bush lacks only 44 of the 270
electoral votes needed to win the presidency in November. By
STEWART M. POWELL.

<P>
   CVN-LAURA-BUSH (Philadephia) _ The first lady of Texas, Laura
Bush, has been described as ``traditional,'' ``shy'' and
``reluctant.'' But after a year on the campaign trail, she's come
into her own as the candidate's wife focused on education. Despite
a small case of butterflies, she steps into the limelight as one of
the main speakers at the Republican National Convention's opening
night. By DAN FREEDMAN.

<P>
   CVN-POWELL (Philadelphia) _ Colin Powell, the retired chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, speaks to Republican convention
delegates about community and volunteer service. Powell, who is
widely believed to be Texas Gov. George W. Bush's choice for
secretary of state if the Republican candidate wins the fall
election, heads a national volunteer group. By ERIC ROSENBERG.

<P>
   CVN-MEANS-COLUMN (Philadelphia) _ Gov. George W. Bush's
convention here demonstrates the power of the southwestern branch
of the elite eastern cartel dominated by Wall Street mogols,
internationalists and the Republican country club set in which his
father and grandfather had their political roots. It is more
conservative and has a younger face, but it redirects the party
away from the social issues and toward familiar conservative
economic policy. By MARIANNE MEANS.

 &HT;    
 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As a young student in a cheder _ private Jewish school _ I was
discouraged from playing sports. Our teachers, called rebbes, were
from the old country. They displayed an aversion to any kind of
organized sport.
 &HT;    For many of them, sports meant body-worship and that was a big
no-no. For others, sports meant pitting the weak against the
stronger, teaching that the deciding factor in life is that might
counts and what was right makes no difference.
 &HT;    The rebbes said, ``Sports is not kosher and not productive.
Sports bring out the worst in people. You can get hurt, or worse,
pick up violent tendencies.''
 &HT;    My friends from European families told me that only the
irreligious free-thinkers sent their children to sports. I felt
this was not a valid explanation _ a lot of American kids who went
to the gym or to soccer games were not irreligious. Thinking that
sports could be the precursor of becoming faithless was crazy.
 &HT;    Being one of the only American-born students among a class of
European children, I knew that here in America sports were the in
thing: ``A healthy body in a healthy mind.'' I knew of some great
Jews in sports like baseball's Hank Greenberg and Sandy Koufax.
 &HT;    Regardless of our teachers' feelings, we would organize games of
soccer and stickball. During our class recess we would enjoy fierce
competitive games. I would return to class all sweaty and excited.
I wondered what in the world could be wrong with sports?
 &HT;    In high school I had a more enlightened rebbe who saw sports as
a way to unify people of all colors and creeds. He taught us that
in a game everybody learns to play together, that no one can go off
and do whatever they want. Each player has a responsibility to each
other. The team spirit in playing together is what makes the
winning.
 &HT;    So sports become kosher and our school had a basketball team.
 &HT;    Later on I attended rabbinical seminary. I asked my teacher, an
old rabbi in his 80s, about sports. He said sports are good for
America. In the old country, he said, people had nothing to do on
weekends for entertainment. They would drink and plan pogroms. Here
in America the people go to games and vent all their energy with
something safe and sound.
 &HT;    Thinking about sports I become aware of an interesting anomaly.
It's the no-contact games that are often followed by violence while
the more punishing sports have little or no violence.
 &HT;    The welterweight title fight in Los Angeles between Oscar De La
Hoya and Shane Mosely resulted in a very close split decision. De
La Hoya and his fans were not happy with the decision, but the
spectators went home peacefully.
 &HT;    On the other hand, the Los Angeles Lakers' championship game
produced violent celebrations, causing havoc and riotous
conditions. Police cars were destroyed and lives were threatened.
 &HT;    Why would a seemingly innocent no-contact game cause so much
havoc while boxing, the killing-machine game, has no such
aftermath?
 &HT;    I think we may have lost the spiritual message of the games. We
have lost contact with our souls.
 &HT;    The late Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson,
world leader of Hassidic Jewry, once commented on the game of
soccer:
 &HT;    ``When a child has studied Torah and he wants to go out and play
ball, he should not be criticized. Rather, we must show him how he
can play ball ``for the sake of Heaven.'' Recreation contributes to
his health, which will, in turn, give him a greater capacity to
learn Bible.
 &HT;    The purpose of a Jewish child's life is to learn Torah and
fulfill mitzvahs. Playing ball can contribute toward this goal. If
he wins he thanks God for his victory.
 &HT;    Phil Jackson, coach of the Lakers, is the son of a
fundamentalist Christian preacher. Jackson is reported to believe
in the path of spirituality. It has been said he uses Zen
meditation and incorporates spirituality into his coaching.
Buddhism, basketball and spirituality all go hand-in-hand in
helping his team win.
 &HT;    The recent ruling by the Supreme Court forbidding students to
offer a prayer before a game is wrong. The ruling reinforces the
message that sports encourage players and spectators to worship the
body and not the spirit.
 &HT;    I believe it would do America well not only to have a prayer
before the game but a prayer after the game, thanking God for
giving the human race the capability to compete in a harmonious
fashion.
 &HT;    The spirit of our competition should move the spectators toward
acknowledging that sports can bring us all together for a good
time. If we had prayed after the Laker game there would have been
no losers, only winners.

&HT;     CONVENTION TRIES TO PUT NEW FACE ON GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ZACHARY COILE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA - Republicans control the U.S. Senate and the House
of Representatives, but TV viewers wouldn't know it from watching
the party's national convention this week.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of Republican members of Congress have been asked
to speak at the weeklong event. And although Republicans control 37
of the nation's governorships, only two GOP governors _ besides
presumptive nominee Texas Gov. George W. Bush _ will address the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the Bush campaign has tapped teachers, single moms,
farmers, community leaders and small businesspeople to parade
before the delegates and the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is trying to reinforce the image that this is not your
father's Republican Party,'' said Jack Pitney, a political
scientist at Claremont McKenna College. ``He is hoping when people
channel-surf on their TVs and happen to come across the Republican
convention, they will see someone who looks a lot like
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials, who have been honing the speakers list
for months, also plan to put an unprecedented number of minority
speakers on the podium. Retired Gen. Colin Powell and former
Stanford provost Condoleezza Rice, both of whom are black, are
scheduled to give prime-time speeches this week. A little-known
Latino assemblyman from Los Angeles, Abel Maldonado, will deliver a
speech in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of speakers shows Bush understands two key political
facts: First, the public has grown increasingly cynical and weary
of politicians, particularly Washington politicians. And second, in
order to win in November, he's going to have to do better than past
Republican nominees among women, independents and minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a new kind of Republican,'' explained Gerald Parsky,
chairman of the California Bush campaign, using a line that has
become a steady refrain from Bush allies and spokespeople.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new kind of Republican politics,'' Parsky said. ``They
want to hear from citizens and people who represent interests that
traditionally have been left out of the Republican party.''
</P>
<P>
   But the speakers, particularly the choice of minorities,
contrast with the audience listening to them. An Associated Press
survey found 83 percent of the GOP convention delegates are white.
And the diversity of speakers, analysts say, isn't likely to help
the Republicans cut into the Democrats' overwhelming advantage with
voters who are minorities come November.
</P>
<P>
   This year's strategy is a departure from the 1996 GOP convention
in San Diego, where the podium was dominated by cabinet members,
diplomats and other inside-the-Beltway officials.
</P>
<P>
   A review of the speakers list for the 1996 convention showed
that of the 44 people who spoke, 26 were senators, U.S.
representatives or governors.
</P>
<P>
   On this year's convention agenda, of the 52 scheduled speakers,
only 10 are top elected officials _ if you include Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials have been replaced by people like Kim Jennings
of Rodgers, Ark., a single mother, and Gayle White, a
fifth-generation farmer from Oklahoma, who will discuss tax policy
with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings will talk on Wednesday about the challenges of working
while going to school and the tax bite she suffered. And White will
spotlight how the estate tax hurts family farmers.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert said the speaker
understood Bush's desire to show a different face to the party this
election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very comfortable with the Bush campaign's desire to
highlight real Americans, and to keep the message focused on what
Gov. Bush and Republicans want to do for this country,`` the
speaker's spokesman, John McGovern, said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara O'Connor, a communications professor at Cal State
Sacramento, called Bush's effort part of a ``heartland strategy``
to portray himself as a leader from outside Washington who
understands voters' daily problems. It's similar to the strategy
Bill Clinton used when he, as the governor of Arkansas, ran for
president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor suspects the ultimate aim may be to paint Democratic
Vice President Al Gore as a creature of Washington _ son of a
senator, 16-year member of Congress and vice president for eight
years _ who is out of touch with the average American.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy, however, could backfire on Bush. He is the son of
a president and his ties to Washington are shown by his kitchen
cabinet of former aides to President George Bush and his choice of
Dick Cheney, his father's Defense secretary, as the vice
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney is an inside-the-Beltway person, and most of (Bush's)
advisors have had extensive Washington experience,'' O'Connor said.
``The message of the convention is different from the reality.''

&HT;     FANGS FOR THE MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Everyone has heard stories about William
Randolph Hearst. They've heard about this ``miserable little
sheet'' his father gave him. WRH said it lovingly.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has heard about the little war in Cuba and the colorful
brand of journalism he helped invent _ I won't mention the specific
color.
</P>
<P>
   By now, most people probably have heard The San Francisco
Examiner is no longer a Hearst paper. It's now a Fang paper, and
the Chronicle is a Hearst paper.
</P>
<P>
   We've already started to talk about the old Examiner with
nostalgia even though we'll be here another four months putting it
out the same as usual. Media stories about the Chronicle purchase
can't call this paper ``failing'' anymore. ``Malodorous'' and
``horse-trading'' may stick around for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   It was with a sense of relief that I finally read a positive
description of The Examiner. An Associated Press article on Friday
described this newspaper as ``the storied afternoon daily.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a proud tradition of stories here, ones about Hunter
Thompson when he was an Examiner columnist, ones about the
political consultant who somehow managed to get his ankle broken
during a meeting in the editorial board room, and ones about our
executive editor who married the movie star.
</P>
<P>
   Stories are what newspapers are all about, not just the stories
in the paper, but ones about the paper. But they aren't the whole
story. People are. This place is filled with amazing people.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how amazing the folks at The Examiner are: Some are still
here. And eager young staffers are still signing up.
</P>
<P>
   These people have been doing their jobs as well as ever, maybe
better, while they've been sitting in limbo. Check out our coverage
of the Hearst-Chronicle deal for the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Brown is still under an Examiner microscope. We still
cover the state Capitol like one of our own neighborhoods, a
particularly freaky one. The Examiner sports section is still the
best in the Bay Area. The Examiner is still watch-dogging the
Police Department, the Planning Department, developers and minority
contracting.
</P>
<P>
   It's only one columnist who may have been slacking off a bit,
getting a lot of those ``taking the day off'' squibs where his
column should appear.
</P>
<P>
   The days have been going by very slowly. It's almost a year
since the Hearst Corp. announced it was buying the Chronicle. It's
been a year in slow-cooking hell.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's paper, the timeline of the Examiner-Chronicle deal
was just as long as the timelines of the histories of both papers.
That tells you all you need to know.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many of our colleagues went to other publications,
dot-coms or rural hideouts far from a news rack.
</P>
<P>
   We've had so many goodbye cakes we're getting hyperactive from
all the sugar. Maybe that's what keeps us going, along with the
idea that the Bay Area could have a great newspaper at the end of
all this.
</P>
<P>
   We decided to ride this sled named Rosebud as far as it goes.
We're here out of loyalty to this small band of quirky individuals
and this storied afternoon daily. We just had no idea how long the
sled ride would be.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to hear about the suffering of journalists, any
more than they want to hear about lawyers' struggles with their
consciences or Bill Gates' troubles with contractors working on his
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   We're not so bad off. The Examiner is a wonderful dysfunctional
family, and when the going gets dysfunctional, we're functional.
</P>
<P>
   If this has been water torture, then it's Evian, or maybe scotch
and water for a lot of us. We can still make jokes about this
situation.
</P>
<P>
   One friend said the last year at The Examiner has felt like a
Band-Aid being pulled off very slowly, one hair at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend said it's like stepping into dog poop and
thinking you got it off, but it's always there.
</P>
<P>
   To me, a recent frequent flier, it's like one of those flights
where you get stuck on the runway, unable to take off or go back to
the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at least, we're moving.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Reilly lost his lawsuit, and it looks like he won't sue
again, at least not for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you very much, Clint, and may you be elected
mayor-for-life of a small island in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how loyal Examiner staffers are to their paper.
</P>
<P>
   One of my best friends has been ill in the hospital and wasn't
in the office when the judge ruled that the Hearst Corp. could buy
the Chronicle. When I called him on Friday, he didn't want to talk
about his health. He wanted to talk about the health of The
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   He's furious about the Fangs getting the archives of The
Examiner. He thought Clint Reilly had done everyone a favor by
throwing a spoke in the wheels of Hearst. He didn't want The
Examiner's name given away for (or with) a pot of gold.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't want The Examiner style to disappear. He was
passionate about it.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Examiner style. It won't die.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA - If you don't count the fact that the platform
committee of their very own party has totally screwed and
humiliated them _ AGAIN _ this is a great year to be a pro-choice
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   That's what everybody kept saying during the jam-packed Planned
Parenthood reception Sunday night in the Grand Ballroom of the Park
Hyatt Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't this something? Can you believe it?
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds and hundreds of abortion-rights Republicans, all under
one roof! And most wearing big buttons that read ``Don't Squash
Freedom of Choice'' and showed an elephant with his foot about to
crash down on the Liberty Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great thrill to be around so many like-minded people,''
said the master of ceremonies, actress Dina Merrill. ``Especially
after the week we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   You can say that again.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP platform committee not only refused to alter one word of
its misogynistic abortion plank _ which vows to nullify Roe vs.
Wade with a constitutional amendment _ the majority added a special
little bonus for the procreation-obsessed Christian right:
</P>
<P>
   A pledge to withdraw all federal funding that provides public
school teenagers with information about contraception, and use the
money instead for abstinence-only education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Try as she might, the best thing that Planned Parenthood's
national president, Gloria Feldt, could say about the situation
was, ``By golly, you're gaining on them, and you have forced a
different kind of conversation this year.''
</P>
<P>
   As a pro-choice Catholic, I know what it's like to be affiliated
with a large group whose mostly male leadership refuses to trust
women with agency over their wombs. But at least I don't have to go
into a voting booth every four years and re-elect the pope to be
considered a loyal Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   How bad does it have to get before pro-choice Republicans do
something serious about this mess?
</P>
<P>
   Something like gather, hundreds strong, in a ballroom and give
their sexist party leaders a public ultimatum: Lose the abortion
plank or lose us to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if they don't know what they're up against. Or can't
articulate their rage.
</P>
<P>
   Had it not been for all the chunky gold jewelry, Chanel pumps
and semi-successful face-lifts, one could have mistaken the Hyatt
crowd for a gathering of radical '60s feminists.
</P>
<P>
   Roselyn O'Connell, the first Republican woman to head the
National Women's Political Caucus, was truly eloquent in her
savagery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the people who represent the heart and the soul of the
Republican Party, not the anti-choice zealots who are holding this
party hostage!'' she told the audience.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite the hostage crisis, she said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe reason will prevail, and we will get that
anti-choice, anti-woman, antediluvian plank out of our platform!''
</P>
<P>
   And so they may.
</P>
<P>
   Just not for another four years.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, if their anti-choice boy Dubbya gets elected
along with his even anti-er-choice running mate Dick Cheney, the
United States of America can kiss safe and legal abortion goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Is it really worth setting up that irreparable disaster to beat
Al Gore?
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the highest-ranking
Republican to address the Hyatt audience, may not have meant to,
but he solved the Zen koan that is pro-choice Republicanism in the
era of anti-choice zealot hostage takers. Speaking of what ``good
Republicans'' all the gathered folks were, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that we're TOO good of Republicans _ to be as
passive and docile as we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bingo, senator. Or, as we used to say in the radical '60s: If
you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the fiery rhetoric and threats of retaliation in
2004, it appears that most pro-choice Republicans have not yet
tired of having their noses rubbed deeply enough in you-know-what.
</P>
<P>
   In this convention, like the one before it and the one before
that, the platform says the GOP is committed to making all abortion
illegal, even for pregnant women and teenagers who were raped or
the victims of incest. Even for women who are likely to die because
of their pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   True, this time, during the platform crafting process, there
actually was a sufficient number of pro-choice delegates _ 27 out
of 107 _ who raised their hands in protest, thus qualifying the
group to lodge an official minority report against the abortion
plank.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Susan Cullman of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition
told the Hyatt crowd:

<P>
   ``When it came time for the people who raised their hands to
sign their names, somehow the pen got lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about profiles in courage. The minority report wouldn't
have changed much of anything except posterity. But, when it came
time to OWN their pro-choice position, too many platform delegates
wimped out.
</P>
<P>
   Of more than a dozen speakers at the Planned Parenthood
reception, Dr. Leroy Carhart probably received the loudest ovation.
A courageous Nebraska gynecologist, he recently helped persuade the
U.S. Supreme Court to reject a deceptively worded law that would
have banned all abortions in his state.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican, Carhart told the audience that legislators have
proposed an amendment to Nebraska's constitution that would force
him to LEAVE the state and would remove him from his position on
the medical staff at the University of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' Carhart said of this year's GOP
abortion and family planning platform planks, ``this is scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, it is going to get worse.

LET THE CHENEY-BASHERS HAVE THEIR FUN WHILE THEY CAN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Democrats are having fun ripping Dick Cheney's congressional
voting record and painting the Republican
vice-presidential-nominee-to-be as some sort of snarling right-wing
ideologue. Good for them _ it's always nice to have a little fun
right before you get your clock cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the current flurry of Cheney-bashing falls into
the category of instant gratification; it will have no long-term
impact on the outcome of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, nobody chooses a presidential candidate to
support on the basis of that candidate's choice for a running mate.
For another, Cheney left Congress to become secretary of defense
back in 1989 _ which means that his legislative voting record as a
House member from Wyoming pretty much qualifies as ancient history
in today's blink-and-it's-forgotten world.
</P>
<P>
   Even many Democrats believe that votes cast by a politician in a
previous life on Capitol Hill are basically irrelevant. They are
obligated to believe that in order to rationalize the many votes
against gun control and abortion rights racked up in Congress by
their current presidential candidate, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he's changed his views over the years. But he can't
change those votes. And Democrats say that's OK.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney can't change his votes, either, and in most cases he
probably wouldn't want to. He said the other day that there might
be a few positions that he would ``tweak'' if given another crack
at them today, but he was then and is now a proud conservative who
believes in conservative values and in conservative solutions to
society's problems.
</P>
<P>
   That's not OK, say liberal Democrats who insist on
characterizing any opposition to liberal political and social
doctrine as right-wing extremism. But in attempting to slap the
extremist label on Cheney, the Democrats and their liberal henchmen
in the media might be crashing into a brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   They can deride Cheney's votes in Congress till the cows come
home. They can misrepresent and even flat-out lie about positions
that Cheney took on certain issues till their lungs give out. But
they will never convince the public that Dick Cheney is an
extremist.
</P>
<P>
   And why not, you ask?
</P>
<P>
   Because Dick Cheney is not an extremist. Any reasonable person
can figure that out the moment he opens his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Left-leaning media stars have been raking Cheney over the coals
for days on end, and yet Cheney has come across as a sensible and
moderate advocate of mainstream conservative ideals that achieved
widespread public acceptance during the 1990s, if not sooner.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of political propaganda can persuade a thinking voter
that a candidate is something that he is not. Dan Quayle's
detractors were able to discredit the former vice president as a
vapid nitwit for one reason and only one reason: Quayle was a vapid
nitwit.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Cheney a ``Jesse Helms Republican'' may seem like
brilliant strategy to the Democrats who disseminate anti-Cheney
propaganda on the Internet. But as the campaign progresses and the
American people become more familiar with Cheney, voters not only
will realize that such a description is inaccurate but will
seriously question the credibility of those who devised it.
</P>
<P>
   In the cutthroat game of negative politics, overreaching can be
dangerously counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   So let the Democrats have their fun. Let them rant and rave
about votes cast by Cheney when he served in Congress during an
earlier millennium. Let them cluck over George W. Bush's choice of
a running mate as they try to convince the electorate that the
Republicans' soon-to-be presidential nominee made a mistake when he
selected Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, the fun might be over as we speak. A
presidential preference poll conducted shortly after the
Bush-Cheney ticket made its public debut last week gave Bush a
double-digit lead over Gore among likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   The election is more than three months away. But could it be
that the post-fun clock-cleaning has begun?

&HT;     'TALK SHOW ROW' BEING SQUEEZED OUT BY `INTERNET ALLEY' 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Political junkies may need to put down their
remotes and pick up their mice for comprehensive coverage of the
Republican Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has exploded since the last presidential election
in 1996, when only about a dozen dot-com news organizations covered
the GOP convention in San Diego. This year, the Republicans expect
more than 100 Web-based outlets to cover the convention, with
countless other news organizations also funneling coverage to their
own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the most accessible convention in history,''
convention press secretary Tim Fitzpatrick said. ```Internet Alley'
was an afterthought four years ago, but now it has overtaken `Talk
Show Row,' which provided broadcasters easy access to
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Sagging ratings prompted TV networks to drop gavel-to-gavel
coverage of the major conventions this year. Web sites like
PseudoPolitics.com, Speakout.com, Policast.com and even
ComedyCentral.com are seizing on the chance to redefine the way
conventions are covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will provide a unique interactive experience,'' said
PseudoPolitics.com's executive producer and managing editor Sam
Hollander. His site will offer several 360-degree live Web cams
that can be operated by viewers, audio feeds from convention
speakers and commentators, plus chat rooms for viewers to discuss
the goings-on in real time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public usually has a director telling them what to watch
and there has been no ability to participate,'' Hollander said.
``We are allowing you to choose what you listen to and how you
interact _ the control is in your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues cable channel Comedy Central usually cover might be
mainstream, but its take on them isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ```Indecision 2000' will be our first foray into the convention
with a Web site,'' Comedy Central spokesman Steve Albani said. ``We
will be producing original content specifically for the Web _
serious coverage of the campaign with a comedy twist.``
</P>
<P>
   Among those adding to the twist supplied by The Daily Show will
be political correspondent Robert Reich and Bob Dole, who will both
provide analysis throughout the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Bob Dole is a serious guy,'' Albani said, ``but he has a
sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Another site, Speakout.com, targets the activist community with
polls, petitions and direct e-mail to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take two sides and background information, frame it,
and then you can take action,'' said Speakout.com Vice President
Chris Vestal. ``We are small and we are trying to do something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC is anything but small, but is instead an example of how
much online convention coverage has changed since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last convention came only a matter of weeks after we
launched,'' MSNBC Executive Editor Michael Silberman said. ``We
were still just trying to figure out how to run the site.''
</P>
<P>
   Silberman said this year's MSNBC coverage will feature Web-only
coverage from a team of reporters, other stories from the
Washington Post and Newsweek, and video from NBC News.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do any streaming (audio) at the 1996 convention, but
now the Web has become another TV channel,'' Silberman said. ``This
is still a major news event and it's important for any news
organizations to show their smarts for television reporting,
producing and ability to break news.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is convention coverage shifting toward the Web, the
tools available to media for covering the convention are advancing
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP has built an on-site Intranet to provide facts,
statistics and transcripts to all journalists, and has created a
communications infrastructure that includes 8,000 phone lines,
2,000 ISDN lines, 500 DSL lines and 6,600 miles of fiber optic
cable.
</P>
<P>
   While online coverage is surging, some observers wonder if
increased coverage on the Internet can offset waning public
interest in political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Patterson, of Harvard's VanishingVoter.org, said gaining a
political audience as a consequence of the Internet was missing the
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have monitored Web use, and it tends to complement other
media,'' said Patterson. ``It tends not to stand alone, so the
audience will be tiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson also questioned whether the Web is ready to change the
way the public views conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not be the wired convention. Not this time,'' said
Patterson. ``The Internet will be a substantial medium once all the
pieces are in place, but television is still the easier way to view
the convention - that audience will be bigger.''

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Republicans opened their convention Monday,
beginning what party leaders hope will be a highly scripted
four-day celebration for their presidential nominee, Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The first real business of the convention came Monday afternoon
when the delegates approved by voice vote a platform that reaffirms
the party's staunch position opposing abortion while adopting
Bush's ``compassionate conservative'' positions on issues like
education and immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is in Ohio Monday on a cross-country bus tour that is
wending its way toward Philadelphia and is expected to arrive here
on Wednesday morning. In advance of his arrival, his running mate,
former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, and other political
surrogates have been in Philadelphia since the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney arrived here Sunday and on Monday morning met with
delegates outside the convention hall. He continued to defend his
conservative voting record as a member of the House of
Representatives from 1979 to 1989 and to reconcile that record with
Bush's contention that the ticket represents a new kind of
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I feel best about is my record voting for
smaller government, lower taxes, the policies of Ronald Reagan,''
Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney met briefly with the delegation from Wyoming, his home
state. But he spent much of the day in his hotel room working on
the acceptance speech he is scheduled to deliver on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush asked Cheney last week to run with him on the
Republican ticket, Democrats have criticized the Republican vice
presidential candidate's congressional voting record.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have focused on Cheney's votes against a resolution
calling for the release from prison of Nelson Mandela, the former
president of South Africa, and for his vote against banning plastic
guns and so-called cop killer bullets.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews on Sunday, Cheney defended his vote against
Mandela's release but said he would now support the ban on the
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats began broadcasting advertisements in 17 states on
Sunday criticizing Cheney's votes against the school lunch program,
Head Start and the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cheney's record sits well with the more than 2,000
delegates who have come to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   According to a New York Times/CBS News poll of delegates, the
Republicans who have gathered here are far more conservative than
average Republican voters. The delegates by and large support large
tax cuts and school vouchers, and oppose gun control, curbs on
trade, environmental safeguards, abortion rights, prescription drug
subsidies for the elderly and campaign finance regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush campaign, played
down the dichotomy between the delegates and the message from the
podium in an interview Monday on ``Political Points,'' a joint
production of ABCNEWS.com and The New York Times on the Web. Rove
said that the delegates would not have nominated Bush if they did
not agree with his message and agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in this convention hall represent the grass
roots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has sought to prevent any issues from flaring into
controversy at this convention by keeping tight-fisted control of
the proceedings, including requiring speakers to follow
pre-approved, scripted themes.
</P>
<P>
   Rove defended the scripted nature of the convention and said
voters are hungry for a positive message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants a convention focused on a forward-looking
message,'' Rove said. ``Parties always strive to have a
noncontroversial, positive convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The speakers scheduled for Monday evening include retired Gen.
Colin L. Powell, who is slated to speak on community and volunteer
service.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A top Republican official said that Powell had told Bush that he
intends to use the national platform to challenge the Republican
nominee to live up to the ideals Bush outlined in a July 10 speech
to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   In that speech Bush said ``the party of Lincoln has not always
carried the mantle of Lincoln,'' and he pledged that ``strong civil
rights enforcement will be a cornerstone of my administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene outside the convention center was quiet as dozens of
secret service agents guided delegates and journalists through
metal detectors and x-ray machines. But in downtown Philadelphia
the police made the first convention-related arrests. Eight people
protesting a U.S. Army training school were arrested after they
blocked traffic during the morning rush hour.

<P>
   If you grab an energy-boosting bar or drink for a quick lift,
you might get more than you expect.
</P>
<P>
   Some popular energy boosters sold at health stores and on the
Internet often contain dangerously high quantities of the herb
ephedra, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra is considered a ``dietary supplement'' and therefore is
not controlled by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The
stimulant can raise blood pressure and heart rate, cause vomiting,
heart palpitations, dizziness, nervousness and more serious
reactions including heart attacks, seizures and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Sass, a registered dietician at the University of
Florida in Tampa who has studied ephedra in energy foods, says most
people are unaware of the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are under the impression that if it's
on the shelf, it must be safe; if it's on the shelf, it must be
regulated, but we know that's not true,'' Sass says.
</P>
<P>
   She cites federal figures showing 800 cases of adverse reactions
_ some as serious as heart attacks, seizures and strokes _ linked
to ephedra. The herb also has been blamed for a dozen deaths, she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra, derived from an Asiatic shrub, contains ephedrine, a
stimulant that acts on the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Sass says high doses of the popular herb are especially
dangerous for people with high blood pressure or heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   A single portion of some energy-boosting bars contain as much as
300 milligrams of ephedra, far more than the 24-milligrams-a-day
maximum recommended by the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``When customers buy a product that claims to be an energy
booster, they should ask what it contains and where the energy
boost is supposed to come from,'' Sass says. ``It's really up to
the consumers to be educated about the product they're taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulations govern ephedra in 21 states, but Sass says they vary
widely, and the energy-boosters are easy to find on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra also can interact with medications and increase or
counter their effect, Sass says.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reaching for a quick energy boost, Sass suggests
healthier alternatives including small, frequent meals and snacks
of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, yogurt and proteins found in
peanut butter, soy and lean meats.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she says turning to energy-boosters that rely heavily
on stimulants like ephedra could mask the real causes of low
energy, such as diabetes or other medical conditions, poor
nutrition or lack of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are experiencing a low energy level, they really
need to look at what's going on with their lifestyles instead of
reaching for a product,'' Sass says.
</P>
<P>
   John Cordaro, president and CEO of the Washington-based Council
for Responsible Nutrition, which represents supplement makers and
suppliers, says ephedra has gotten a bad name because of misuse. He
says labels on most products he found recommend no more than 100
milligrams a day.
</P>
<P>
   The council is commissioning an independent investigation of the
herb to sort fact from fiction, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people read the warnings statements, and if the warning
applies to them, they stay away from the product. And if people use
it as directed, then the product should be safe for most people,''
Cordaro says.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice is: number one, read the label; number two, know the
company that you're buying from, and number three, if you have any
question about the company or the product, and it doesn't have an
800 number, ask the pharmacist or health-store clerk to get you to
the company,'' he says. ``And, finally, use as directed.''

<P>
   If you suffer from allergies, you might want to follow your nose
outside to your yard to sniff out the cause of your suffering.
</P>
<P>
   By planting the wrong types of trees and other landscape plants,
we're drowning our cities and ourselves in pollen, says California
author Thomas Ogren in his new book, Allergy-Free Gardening: A
Revolutionary Approach to Landscape Planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so obvious that you would have thought somebody would
have discovered this years ago,'' says Ogren, a former landscape
gardening instructor.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, in a nutshell, is that most cities and private
landscapers and nurseries favor a few dozen types of male,
wind-pollinated plants, instead of a blend of male and female
insect-pollinated trees and shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   That's because male trees don't produce so-called ``litter,''
which is old seeds, seed pods or fruit that mess up your yard. But
while male trees don't create that debris, they do pump out huge
volumes of pollen.
</P>
<P>
   Ogren says many people mistakenly believe pollen is dispersed
far and wide so there's nothing you can do to get away from it. But
after examining previous research and doing his own pollen
dispersal counts, Ogren says an allergenic, pollen-pumping tree in
your own backyard exposes you to 10 times the pollen than from a
tree down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the drip line of the tree, that's where most of the
pollen falls,'' he says. ``Even if you have a big, tall tree,
within 50 feet of the tree almost all of the pollen has fallen out
right in the immediate vicinity.''
</P>
<P>
   He compares it to second-hand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy is standing a block away and the wind is blowing
toward you, you're going to smell the cigarette smoke. But when
you've got that big male (tree) pumping out all this pollen and
that big tree is in your yard, it's just like being in an elevator
with a guy smoking a cigar,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   There's another problem with the predominance of male trees and
lack of females.
</P>
<P>
   ``The female trees are all electrically charged positive. The
airborne pollen is negative. The two are mutually attracted. So
when you have a large female tree in your urban landscape, that
acts as a magnet and draws the pollen to it. It doesn't just catch
it by accident,'' Ogren says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you take the landscape of today, there are few female
trees. So now you've got way more males and almost no females and
you_ve got all this pollen drifting around and there are no pollen
traps there for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogren developed a system called the Ogren Plant Allergy Scale
(OPALS), to grade more than 5,000 plants from 1 (best) to 10
(worst). The ratings are based on a number of factors including
whether the plant is insect or wind pollinated, whether it has
large, bright flowers or tiny, off-white or greenish flowers, and
the length of its pollen period.
</P>
<P>
   Current allergy scales are too simplistic because they give only
a high or low allergy ranking and tend to be too general when
comparing species, Ogren says. But, he adds, within the same
species of some trees, you can find different cultivars that rank
at the top and the bottom of the OPALS scale.
</P>
<P>
   Ogren says anyone involved in landscaping, from city arborists
to individual homeowners, needs to pay more attention to this
problem and use the OPALS system to clear the air. He's been
contacted by officials in a number of cities, including London,
about his scale.
</P>
<P>
   And the OPALS system is being used by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture Forest Service in a study to develop allergy rankings
of a number of American and Canadian cities.
</P>
<P>
   Many cities are now interested in rating plants based on pollen,
particularly in the Southwestern United States, says David Nowak,
project leader of the USDA Forest Service's Northeastern Research
Station in Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   And even the desert doesn_t offer the escape it once did. Many
people move to the Southwest to escape allergies, but find they're
still having problems, he says. That's because many re-create
landscapes using allergy-causing plants from their previous homes.
</P>
<P>
   An allergy expert says Ogren's book could help turn the tide of
pollen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a book that will probably find a place in schools that
teach landscaping and those people will begin to think about these
things,'' says David Stadtner, a retired allergist in Stockton,
Calif., who wrote the foreword to Ogren's book.

 &UR; (Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate) &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Diabetics dependent on daily insulin could replace their
syringes with a pump the size of a pager, but few patients do so, a
new study found.
</P>
<P>
   The device is most popular among diabetes specialists who have
Type I diabetes, the study says. More than half use the insulin
pump, compared with only about 10 percent of all U.S. Type I
diabetes patients.
</P>
<P>
   Why the wide discrepancy between specialists and diabetes
patients as a whole?
</P>
<P>
   The specialists, says the study, published in The Diabetes
Educator, know what most patients don't _ that the pump provides
more accurate, steady and precise insulin doses and is much easier
to use.
</P>
<P>
   The pump provides round-the-clock insulin by simulating the
action of the pancreas to replace the insulin supply. Patients can
swim, ride a bike, do other exercises and eat what they wish while
using the pump.
</P>
<P>
   The device comprises a reservoir filled with insulin, a small
battery-operated pump and a computer chip that allows the user to
control how much insulin the pump delivers. And it's all in a
plastic case about the size of a beeper. The reservoir delivers
insulin to the body through a thin plastic tube painlessly inserted
beneath the skin, typically in the abdomen, and the user changes
the tube every two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity and reliability of the pump has won over many
converts, says the study's lead author, Marilyn R. Graff, a
registered nurse and longtime diabetes educator who is now senior
manager for professional education at MiniMed Inc., a California
company that makes insulin pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``People call and write and tell us, 'Now that I've got my pump,
I'll never give it back,''' says Graff, former president of the
10,000-member American Association of Diabetes Education. ``That's
the message we get from patients: 'I've been trying all this time
to take better care of myself and now I'm able to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The pump costs about $5,500, she says, and most insurance
companies will pick up 80 percent of the tab. The first insulin
pump went to market in 1983 with a much bigger, bulkier monitor.
MiniMed developed the pager-like device in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The study is based on survey responses from about 800 diabetics
who also treat the disease. The specialists, the study said, not
only used the pump more than their patients, but also almost
universally maintained recommended ``intensive treatment
regimens,'' consisting of three or more insulin shots a day or use
of an insulin pump. By contrast, less than a quarter of American
Type I diabetes patients follow the recommended regimens, the study
says.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Perley, an endocrinologist who uses the pump for his
own Type I diabetes, says the study demonstrates ``a huge
disconnect'' between specialists and their patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a matter of education, and it's also a matter of
attitude,'' he adds. Perley suggests specialists, including doctors
and nurses, think the pump may be ``overwhelming to the lay
public.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he adds, ``these attitudes are being broken down. The
pump after training is much easier'' than daily shots, he says.
``It provides a much more flexible lifestyle for the patient but,
more important, it provides much better medical outcomes.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1 million people in the United States have Type I diabetes
and most them are diagnosed as children or young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of proper treatment can lead to serious complications
including blindness, amputation, kidney disease and increased risk
of heart and blood vessel diseases. Untreated, Type I diabetes can
cause death.

EGYPTAIR CRASH VICTIM'S FAMILIES CLING TO EACH OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Billings received his mother's orthotic shoe inserts in the
mail last month.
</P>
<P>
   He was thankful.
</P>
<P>
   In another time, he would have tossed them in the closet. But
nine months after his mother died in the crash of EgyptAir flight
990, which plunged into the sea off Nantucket, the items have made
the tragedy all too real.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a crash like this, your people disappear in thin air,''
said the Boston lawyer. ``I think all of us have been yearning for
a connection to the crash. This is the closest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In homes across the United States, families of the 129 Americans
who perished among the 217 people on the flight have received
shredded pieces of luggage, coins, wallets, baby's shoes _
fragments of lives, smelling of the sea and jet fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Their loved ones' belongings come as the result of an
association formed by the families. The group, based in
Massachusetts, has successfully fought for the return of the
passengers' personal effects, the collection of DNA samples to help
identify bodies, and the unsealing of data from the federal
investigation of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   But as the group plans a memorial service in Newport, R.I. Oct.
31 and braces for the upcoming release of a government report on
the crash, they say one thing is missing: A sense of alliance with
the relatives of 62 victims in Egypt suffering the same losses.
</P>
<P>
   This was, after all, a tragedy that once united people of
different cultures in their suffering, as American Muslims rushed
to comfort family members of Egyptian victims and an Egyptian
airline sought to offer assistance to grieving Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But ongoing speculation over the cause of the crash seems to
have thwarted efforts to unite the victims' families. Some
Egyptians say the US investigators have rushed to blame an
allegedly suicidal Egyptian copilot. Some Americans say that
EgyptAir has treated victims from the two countries differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that the families are divided they are not
effective, and could be played off against one another,'' said Jim
Brokaw, the association's president. ``They don't speak as one
voice, so they are not listened to.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw, of Chicago, and his siblings in Vermont lost their
stepmother and father in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Samir El Shanawany, general manager of EgyptAir's North American
operations, denied that the airline is trying to keep the two
groups apart. El Shanawany said the company has created a toll-free
telephone number for the families and recently established a
confidential Web site so that all survivors, American or Egyptian,
could voice their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   But since the crash, Egyptian officials have vehemently rejected
findings from US investigators indicating that the Boeing 767 was
deliberately brought down by copilot Gameel el-Batouty. This month,
a book by an Egyptian journalist suggests the flight was either
sabotaged by a bomb or simply experienced mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   James Hall, chairman of the US National Transporation Safety
Board, told Congress that the movement of the plane prior to the
crash was ``consistent with a deliberate action on the part of one
of the crew members.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brokaw and other family members say the dispute over what
happened in the plane's final flight has left them unable to grieve
with the Egyptians. Family members said EgyptAir has consistently
refused to give them names or telephone numbers of Egyptian
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know those people have to be going through the same thing
we are,'' said Shari Gemmil of Washington, D.C., who lost her
mother and stepfather in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Gemmil said the two Web sites that have been set up for the
families have allowed Americans and Canadians to share the healing
process, as well as their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, said Brokaw, some of the Egyptian families are
discovering the site through word of mouth and beginning to contact
the Americans on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They were apparently unaware that American families had already
banded together to express their concerns about the identification
of bodies, the pace of the investigation, and other matters.
Brokaw, as president, met with the ambassador of Egypt, as well as
EgyptAir officials, before noticing some progress.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Egyptian officials have agreed to send four people
from each family to attend the memorial service in Newport. And, by
last winter, American families that had initially complained about
the pace of identifying remains were sending back DNA samples to
the Rhode Island's medical examiner's office. Egyptian families, by
contrast, have only recently begun to submit samples, said Brokaw.
</P>
<P>
   An EgyptAir official blamed the delay on the United States:
``Regretfully, the US government attempts to provide sampling kits
from the Egyptians failed because the laboratory contracted by the
US government went out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, American family members say they are also concerned that
EgyptAir hasn't made advance payments in equal amounts to settle
claims by families, as did Swissair, American Airlines, and Alaska
Airlines after recent crashes. Instead, Brokaw said, the airline
has made advances only to those who can show proof of need.
</P>
<P>
   ``This unnecessarily complicates and prolongs the process of
getting financial help to those in need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw and Billings said they believe Egyptian-born families now
in the United States are experiencing the most hardships. In one
case, said Brokaw, an Egyptian woman living in Arizona discovered
that she couldn't afford to stay in the United States after her
husband died in the crash. She had to return to Egypt. In another
case, an Egyptian-born man in California had to take in his
grandchildren after his daughter died.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carlsen, an attorney handling EgyptAir's insurance
underwriters, said nearly all of the families in Egypt have settled
with the airline. EgyptAir officials said they have provided
advance payments of as much as $40,000 to some family members.
</P>
<P>
   Carlsen also said they are beginning to talk to American and
Canadian families, whose relatives made up most of the passengers
on the plane, about their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Gemmil said that as of now, she is going to put all her energy
in planning the memorial service. Others say they are hoping to
receive more information about their relatives' remains.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a few remains have been found intact. Those remains
that cannot be identified will be placed in a cemetery in Newport.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw's sister _ Fran Brokaw of Stafford, Vt., received her
father's battered suitcase in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked just like a truck ran over it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw said it was hard to look at the little brown carry-on
suitcase that her father took everywhere with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing it and holding it made it all real,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors have decided not to accept any personal effects
at all, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she said, ``in some ways it's helpful to be able to
hold it and know it was with him.''

 &HT;    An open-minded critic finally listens to rap
 &HT;    By Charles Passey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There I am, doing my morning workout at
the gym, when I finally decide to pop the tape I've been avoiding
into my cassette player. It's Eminem's chart-topping The Marshall
Mathers LP, and if you've read any of the headlines concerning this
Michigan-born rapper, you'd understand my hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem specializes in a style of rap that's harder than
hard-core. Defiantly rude and crude, it's a celebration of man at
his most misogynistic and homophobic. The fact that the artist's
life closely resembles his music _ his wife recently attempted
suicide after attending one of his concerts _ only adds to the
legend.
</P>
<P>
   I'm fully prepared to hate the album _- and the first couple of
cuts confirm my expectations. Public Service Announcement, the
opening selection, offers a hint of what's to come, warning
Eminem's listeners that ``if you don't like (the album),'' you're
welcome to perform a certain sexual act on the artist. That's
followed by Kill You, in which Eminem (aka Slim Shady) articulates
his formula for mayhem: There are brutal descriptions of the artist
raping his own mother and committing other violent crimes against
women.
</P>
<P>
   But as the album plays on, something strange starts to happen: I
find myself drawn into Eminem's menacing universe. A song about a
psychotic fan (Stan) and an autobiographical rant (The Real Slim
Shady) resonate with a blend of crassness and verve. Leaving the
gym, I keep wanting to listen, so I switch to my car stereo. By the
time Eminem comes to the album's most harrowing cut, Kim, the
musical equivalent of watching a man go postal, I am sitting in my
driveway, unwilling to hit the stop button, and am left with two
unshakable conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The man is brilliant. And I'm going to do everything in my power
to make sure my oldest child, an 8-year-old boy who's just
beginning to explore the vast terrain of pop music, never gets his
hands on this album.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is precisely the way Eminem wants it. I'm 36
years old, white and comfortably middle class, a demographic far
removed from rap's target audience of urban black and suburban
white teenagers. This isn't my music _ and the very reason it
offends me is the very reason kids are drawn to it. It's the
age-old principle of rebellion. My parents, who grew up during
Sinatra's heyday, still struggle with rock _ and that is no doubt
what partially attracted me to it. I remember watching Blondie
perform on Saturday Night Live, enraptured by Deborah Harry's icy,
punk-princess persona; my mother asked me to turn off the
television.
</P>
<P>
   Now, my music is relegated to nostalgic anthologies and I'm the
one who's out of touch. As a rule, I don't listen to rap
recordings. And I don't line up to buy tickets to rap concerts,
such as the ``Up In Smoke'' tour, featuring Eminem, Dr. Dre, Snoop
Dogg and Ice Cube, which comes to the National Car Rental Center on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But my story is a little more complex. I'm not just a
36-year-old white guy, I'm also a critic. For more than a decade, I
have made my living writing primarily about music and musicians,
first in the classical field _ I once considered becoming an opera
singer _ and more recently in pop and rock. But during this time, I
have generally avoided rap. I like to consider myself open-minded:
My record collection ranges from Sondheim to the Rolling Stones,
Mozart to the Dave Matthews Band. But there are no albums by
Run-D.M.C., the Beastie Boys or Dr. Dre.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I gave myself the challenge of coming to terms
with rap. I wanted to know what all these kids were listening to. I
wanted to understand how a genre that many critics wrote off in its
early years _ who ever heard of ``songs'' in which nobody sang? _
had managed to survive more than two decades. And not just survive,
but prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first rap record in 1979, Rapper's Delight by the
Sugar Hill Gang, rap has shifted from its streetwise New York
origins to become an international phenomenon. According to the
Recording Industry Association of America, rap accounted for 10.8
percent of all record sales in 1999, putting it in a virtual tie
for the first time with country music. (Rock remains the industry
leader, with 25.2 percent, but its market share has slipped
dramatically in the last decade.) Look at the latest Billboard pop
charts and you'll find four rap or rap-dominated albums occupying
the top five spots. (The one exception? Britney Spears, of course.)
</P>
<P>
   Soundtrack of Middle America
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon extends well beyond music. Rap is the leading
edge of the entire aesthetic wave known as hip-hop, a term that
encompasses nearly everything rooted in the black urban cultural
experience, from dancing to fashion. But if hip-hop's creators are
largely black _ and even that has started to change with the
current rage for white rappers like Eminem and Kid Rock _ its
audience has become increasingly white. Look at MTV and it's
obvious that rap is now the soundtrack of Middle America. Even my
8-year-old son, who's exposed to a spectrum of fairly clean-cut rap
artists on the kid-oriented Nickelodeon cable network, claims it as
his music.
</P>
<P>
   So what's my problem?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm not that different from most parents I know _ or
even most pop critics of a certain age. On a certain level, we all
don't get it. A current story in the American Journalism Review
talks about how newspapers are being forced to reexamine who they
have covering music _ and the critics themselves admit there's a
problem. The piece quotes 58-year-old Village Voice pop critic
Robert Christgau, one of the few senior music scribes who's made an
earnest attempt to stay current. ``Hip-hop is the great
generational divide,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   To try to cross that divide, I did what any critic would do: I
listened. In my weeklong foray, I sampled bits and pieces of about
a dozen albums, ranging from the ``old school'' rap of the Sugar
Hill Gang to such contemporary voices as Dr. Dre and Will Smith. I
also read Nelson George's seminal volume on rap, Hip Hop America.
And I talked to everyone from a rap-loving spokesman with a
Washington media think tank to a local artist who specializes in
Christian rap.
</P>
<P>
   The mere mention of a Christian rapper brings me to the first of
many lessons I learned _ that there as many kinds of rap as there
are rappers. While it's the hard-core artists who often grab the
headlines, particularly such ``gangsta'' rappers as Tupac Shakur
and Notorious B.I.G., whose violent lifestyles ended in their
murders, these represent just one branch of an ever-growing tree.
There are the party rappers who started it all (Sugar Hill Gang,
Run-D.M.C.), the alternative rappers who bring an avant-garde
mindset to the urban scene (De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest), the
female rappers who blend soul and spice (Queen Latifah,
Salt-N-Pepa). And there are icons aplenty: rap balladeer L.L. Cool
J, Public Enemy, pop rapper Will Smith, South Florida's own
booty-rapping, free-speech advocate Luther Campbell, and rap's
Grammy girl, Lauryn Hill, whose R&AMP;B-shaded solo debut became the
first hip-hop recording to win the industry's highest honor, Album
of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer diversity was something I didn't expect to encounter.
On a lazy afternoon, I listened to A Tribe Called Quest's The Low
End Theory, an album that overflows with the cool, funky vibes of
jazz _ and not just because bassist Ron Carter appears as a guest.
Hearing the muted horns, the lyrics that refer to everything from
Shakespeare to pagers (more on that aspect later), the recording
struck me as a quintessential Beat-generation-inspired expression
(remember, the Beat poets also did their thing to jazz). This is
rap that any adult could appreciate _ or at least any adult with
taste.
</P>
<P>
   But the point is not to focus on a particular album. Saying you
don't like rap because of some sex-and-violence-filled rant is a
little like saying you don't like rock because of Marilyn Manson's
music. Any genre that has passed the test of time has room for
everybody. A colleague told me about an Orthodox Jew who raps about
the Holocaust. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a country-western
rapper out there.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, when I looked closer at the ``gangsta''
subgenre, I couldn't automatically write it off. True, much of it
revolves around limited themes (sex, drugs and street violence),
told in the same brutal, foul-mouthed style. As much as I tried, I
had a hard time distinguishing Dr. Dre's The Chronic from Tupac
Shakur's 2Pacalypse Now, both considered important historical
recordings. And on first listening, I could barely make it through
N.W.A.'s Straight Outta Compton. But another colleague urged me to
listen again. This time, I got it: The title track tells it all _
this is music that exposes the underside of America. It's the anger
of a riotous Los Angeles after the Rodney King trial, set to a
furious beat. You may not like the message, but attention must be
paid.
</P>
<P>
   Not that rock hasn't offered its share of political commentary,
from Bob Dylan to U2. By contrast, most black music during the '60s
and '70s, from the Motown sound of The Supremes to the disco beat
of Donna Summer, rarely asked you to do anything more than listen
with a smile or dance. There were such noteworthy social-minded
exceptions as Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, but it took rap to
truly unleash the urban message.
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious in its scope
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just ``gangsta'' artists who have something to say.
You'll find your share of conscience on everything from Grandmaster
Flash's groundbreaking 1982 single The Message, which chronicles
one man's quest to hold on to his sanity amidst all the urban
decay, to Will Smith's recent Just the Two of Us, which talks about
the challenges of fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rap nowadays is no different from the folk music of the '60s;
they're coming up with the same grass-roots vibes,'' says local
Christian rapper Proverb, whose group, 1Way, has released two
nationally acclaimed recordings.
</P>
<P>
   But even when rap is not asking you to think, it's usually
ambitious in its scope. From album to album, I was consistently
impressed by the sheer length of rap songs. Whereas rock and pop
rarely venture beyond five minutes _ you can't risk the possibility
of turning off radio programmers _ rap has trouble thinking in such
short terms. Take the song that started it all, Rapper's Delight.
It's a 14-minute party of a record that holds up remarkably well, a
playful vision of the inner city that's as big and proud as the MCs
behind the mike. You hear the same ambition when rap artists ``free
style'' _ improvise lyrics on the spot. The best go on like a great
rock guitarist on a mighty tear.
</P>
<P>
   Clever wordplay
</P>
<P>
   And yet, where is that ambition in rock today? Consider
alternative rock, says Anthony DeCurtis, a Rolling Stone
contributing editor and rap aficionado. He points to the grunge
bands' ``refusal of scale, refusal of fame.'' By contrast, he adds,
``I like that the rappers go for it ... That, to me, is exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, rap is about lyrics. The many prosaic
rappers notwithstanding, the genre's hallmark may be its clever
wordplay. You can find examples left and right. Here's the Sugar
Hill Gang in Rapper's Delight: ``I say can of beer that's sweeter
than honey/Like a millionaire that has no money/Like a rainy day
that is not wet/Like a gambling fiend that does not bet/Like a
Dracula without his fangs/Like the boogie to the boogie without the
boogie bang/Like collard greens that don't taste good/Like a tree
that's not made out of wood.'' And here's A Tribe Called Quest in
What?: ``What's a childbirth without the umbilica?/What's United
Parcel without the deling such personal favorites as The Police's
Every Breath You Take and The Clash's Rock the Casbah, in the end,
it's the beat that propels rap. And while that beat can be expanded
and explored in countless ingenious ways, from the funk rhythms of
Dr. Dre to those jazz musings of A Tribe Called Quest, it's still
just a beat. To my ears, raised on Bach and rock, it's melody that
seduces the ears, that attaches itself to a lyric and lets you feel
its emotional content. That's why rap's lyrics are so short and
clipped _ they're defined by rhythm. I can't help but think of it
as a limitation.
</P>
<P>
   Complaint of ownership
</P>
<P>
   And let's go back to sampling: This, too, is a problem for me _
and one that has bothered many musicians, blaclight' (1979) and
Grandmaster Flash's `The Message' (1982):
</P>
<P>
   You can find these two seminal singles on various rap
anthologies (I chose one called Old School Rap, Volume 1, on the
Thump Records label). Both hold up remarkably well after all these
years, the former offering a generous taste of rap in its best
party-days mode, the latter giving an early glimpse of rap's social
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  N.W.A.'s `Straight Outta Compton' (1989):
</P>
<P>
   This is ``gangsta'' rap before it got a bad rap _ an
uncompromising vision of America's urban nightmare. Just check out
the title cut.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A Tribe Called Quest's `The Low End Theory' (1991): Think rap
meets the avant-garde. This jazz- and funk-flavored album is an
alternative rap definition of cool.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lauryn Hill's `The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill' (1998): After
her success with the Fugees, Hill released this R&AMP;B-shaded solo
debut. It took rap to another place, blending heart and soul with
the rhythm of the street.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Eminem's `The Marshall Mathers LP' (2000): You'll hate the
message, but you can't ignore the man's creativity. And Stan is one
of the most chilling songs you'll ever hear _ a powerful narrative
that builds to a shocking conclusion.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Aug. 1:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-EYE-SURGERY (Undated) _ Although the Food and Drug
Administration approved the procedure only two years ago, Lasik,
short for laser in-situ keratomileusis, has quickly grown into a $3
billion-a-year industry, with 750,000 Americans expected to choose
the surgery this year. Intended to correct nearsightedness, the
procedure can now treat farsightedness as well. With 1.2 million
American customers expected next year, Lasik is becoming the issue
in a financial turf war between ophthalmologists and optometrists,
between top-dollar surgeons and low-cost, high-volume centers. By
Kenneth Chang. (1900 words)

going through with this laser eye surgery. (325 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CALIF-ANTS (La Jolla, Calif.) _ Because of a quirk of
evolution and genetics, Argentine ants are taking over California
while forming what scientists believe could be the biggest ant
colony in the world, stretching over 600 miles from San Diego to
San Francisco. The ants in this so-called supercolony are nearly
identical genetically so that different colonies do not fight one
another the way they do in their homeland. As a result they are
using a united family front to win territory from native ants. By
Jon Christensen. (1785 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PHYSICS-PARTICLES (Undated) _ Scientists announced that they
have succeeded in producing millions of well-known, if somewhat
obscure, particles called B mesons along with their antimatter
counterparts and plan to compare the decay rates of B's and
anti-B's with a precision that has never before been possible. The
comparison should provide a new measuring stick of one of nature's
most basic symmetries _ or asymmetries. By James Glanz. (1700
words)

<P>
   SCI-DYSON-PHYSICS (Undated) _ An interview with Dr. Freeman J.

Revkin. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VINES-BUTTERFLIES (Undated) _ Heliconius butterflies have
acquired aggressive survival techniques like feeding on cyanide
carrying passion vines which make them posionous to pedators, and

Biologists suspect that this interaction between the vine and the
butterfly over millions of years caused their evolution into
different species. By Nicholas Wade. (1550 words)

<P>
   With photos, NYT4,5.
</P>
<P>

TAIWAN'S PRESIDENT FACES MORE POLITICAL TROUBLES AT HOME AND WITH
CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, issued another
appeal Monday to the Chinese government to reopen negotiations
between their countries. But Chen's overture _ the latest of
several since he was elected in March _ was all but lost in the
face of his deepening political troubles at home and evidence of
mounting impatience in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is dialogue, there can be exchanges,'' Chen said at a
news conference in Taipei. ``If there are exchanges, there can be a
consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the conciliatory words, Chen brushed aside Beijing's
demand that Taiwan acknowledge a single China, of which it is a
part. Instead, he asked China to embrace ``the spirit of 1992'' _ a
reference to negotiations in which the two sides agreed to disagree
about the meaning of ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Chen's flexibility on relations with China was
constrained in June when his party reaffirmed its support of an
independent Taiwan. But his party ties are the least of the
president's problems these days.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than two months after his inauguration, following a
sweeping victory over the Nationalist Party, Chen's government has
been battered by accusations of incompetence and thwarted by
Taiwan's legislature, which is dominated by the opposition. The
49-year-old leader's approval rating has plummeted in polls.
</P>
<P>
   Most damaging was the government's bungled response to a recent
flash flood in central Taiwan that killed four construction
workers. The workers clung desperately to each other while the
military and police bickered over which agency should respond to
the rescue call. Tens of thousands of Taiwanese watched on
television as the four men were swept away by the raging waters.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's deputy prime minister resigned to take responsibility
for the deaths. The prime minister, Tang Fei, stayed on only after
Chen refused to accept his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chen Shui-bian's government is in deep trouble,'' said Andrew
Yang, the secretary-general of the Chinese Council of Advanced
Policy Studies, a research group in Taipei. ``His opponents,
particularly in the legislature, are taking advantage of his
weakness on the mainland China issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen has described the tragedy as a ``turning point,'' which
will force his administration to confront thorny issues. He said on
Monday that the government would reopen an investigation into a
seven-year-old arms scandal, in which senior officials allegedly
took bribes to approve the purchase of French-made frigates, German
minesweepers and other military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are eager to see a clean government,'' Chen said.
``They are disappointed in the new government because they have yet
to see any action.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Chinese government is also showing new impatience with
Taiwan's leader. Although Beijing did not respond to Chen on
Monday, the official state media have sharpened their criticism of
his closest advisers. Last week, the New China News Agency
condemned the head of Taiwan's mainland affairs council, Tsai
Ying-wen, for being a separatist and for denying her Chinese
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In its most direct swipe yet at Chen, the agency said Tsai's
``words and deeds mirror the true face of the new leader of
Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   China is also holding firm on the ``one China'' principle _
insisting that its territorial claim to Taiwan be recognized in its
pending agreement to join the World Trade Organization. Taiwan was
expected to gain entry into the WTO as a stand-alone member,
shortly after China's admission.
</P>
<P>
   But Chinese negotiators are now insisting that Taiwan be
classified as a ``customs territory'' of the mainland, much like
Hong Kong and Macao, both former colonies. The dispute is not
expected to derail China's long-sought entry into the World Trade
Organization, but could delay it.
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts expect significant developments in cross-strait
relations until after the summer retreat of China's top leaders in
the resort town of Beidaihe. Things could get rockier before then.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said on Monday that in two weeks he would embark on his
first overseas trip as president _ visiting five Central American
and African nations, including Costa Rica and Chad, that recognize
Taiwan as a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diplomacy will symbolize and highlight our sovereignty,'' Chen
declared. ``It will allow us to see the world and let the world see
Taiwan.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the mid-March deal was struck for the late
John Fang's family to buy The Examiner, the patriarch's wife,
Florence, went to his grave and left a copy of The Examiner, whose
bold headline said ``SOLD.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that when people pass away, they should lie in peace,''
said Florence Fang. ``But this time, I just had to tell him. . . .
I think he read it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ink dry on Friday's transfer of the 135-year-old
Examiner to the Asian American publishing family, Florence Fang,
65, and her three sons - James, Ted and Douglas - have even more to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very happy and grateful,'' she said in a phone
interview from her Hillsborough, Calif., home. ``I feel we have a
long way to go. We have a heavier burden, because all the Asian and
Chinese communities are looking upon us. I will do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco's Chinese American community - where penniless
immigrant John Ta Chuan Fang arrived from Taiwan in the early 1950s
- the rags-to-riches rise of his family to a media dynasty with
potent political connections has awed some and dismayed others.
</P>
<P>
   What's undisputed is the fact that The Examiner's sale - part of
the Hearst Corp.'s purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle - makes
the Fangs the first Asian Americans to own a major daily newspaper
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That is significant in a city that is now 37 percent Asian,
according to the latest census estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, this encapsulates part of the changing
demographics and political atmosphere in San Francisco's civic
life,'' said David Lee of the Chinese American Voters Education
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's completion of the sale of The Examiner to the Fangs
drew widely divergent views.
</P>
<P>
   Praising the Fangs as driven immigrants who have achieved the
American Dream, Housing Commissioner Julie Lee, founder of the San
Francisco Neighbors' Association, said, ``For a minority family to
own a paper is very tough to begin with. But they are fighters.
They don't give up easily. They are very determined, even though
they've had a lot of bad publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Critic L. Ling-Chi Wang, UC-Berkeley's chair of ethnic studies,
offered another perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fangs know what they want: money and power,'' Wang said.
``And they pursue it vigorously and relentlessly. They play
hardball. There will probably be even more fear of them now. The
constituency they have is driven by fear and self-interest . . . by
convenience and necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others say the Fangs' success merely mirrors most American
journalism enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're first and foremost business people who've made inroads
into the political landscape,'' said Henry Der, former executive
director of Chinese for Affirmative Action who is now state deputy
superintendent for education. ``The line is very blurred between
business and politics. But that's no different from any other
newspaper business.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowning achievement of those efforts was their purchase of
The Examiner - for $100 million while receiving a $66 million
subsidy from the Hearst Corp. to run it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a coup that even their critics had to admire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else do you get that kind of deal?'' said Wang. ``The
Fangs are laughing all the way to the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   But Benny Yee, redevelopment commissioner for San Francisco and
a longtime family friend, said that if John Fang were here, he
wouldn't be laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were alive today, I'm telling you, he would be crying
(with joy),'' said Yee. ``I can see the tears running down his face
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yee said journalism was John Fang's passion and life work.
</P>
<P>
   The Shanghai-born Fang's involvement in journalism began at age
11, when he journeyed alone to inland China and sold newspapers for
a living. He later studied journalism at Taipei's Chen Chi
University and worked at the New Life newspaper, a
government-controlled paper in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   He came to San Francisco in 1952 to study ``everything'' at
UC-Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of getting a master's degree in journalism, however, he
began working at the Chinese Daily Post and Young China Daily News
newspapers - both organs of the Kuomintang, Taiwan's then-ruling
Nationalist Party. While on a trip back to Taiwan, he married
Florence Fang in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on the fact that Chinatowns were becoming tourist
attractions, John Fang began publishing ``Chinatown Handy Guide''
booklets in major cities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, he started the family's newspaper dynasty by founding
AsianWeek, a English-language tabloid aimed at Asian American
communities.
</P>
<P>
   It was a commitment that benefited others, said Sandy Close,
executive editor of Pacific News Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted (Fang) helped me start `Yo!''' said Close of the
syndicated column written for and by youth. ``And his father helped
start a Spanish-language newspaper. It speaks to me of inclusion
that every ethnic community would do well to emulate.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the Fangs boldly expanded, acquiring the Independent, a
West of Twin Peaks weekly. They turned it into a cheeky
thrice-weekly free broadsheet, upping the press run from 80,000 to
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   With their acquisitions grew political power. The Fangs, who are
Republicans, became key backers of politicians from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   As the Fang sons grew up, they took places in the family
business. Ted, 37, is publisher of the Independent. Elder brother
James - married to the daughter of the former mayor of Shanghai -
is the 39-year-old publisher of AsianWeek while Douglas, 35,
handles the papers' online operations.
</P>
<P>
   The family's fortunes soared after the Fangs used the paper to
campaign to elect Frank Jordan mayor in 1991. James Fang was
appointed as director of international trade.
</P>
<P>
   With each new venture, the Fangs were developing clout, not just
in Chinatown but in high political circles.
</P>
<P>
   And they have not been shy about using the pages of the
Independent to advocate for politicians they support and issues
they feel strongly about.
</P>
<P>
   However they're viewed, the Fangs are posed to set a precedent
when they take over The Examiner in roughly four months. That
burden is made heavier by the way the Fangs obtained the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Asians will feel a sense of pride and vindication that an
Asian American has cracked the ownership of a serious and
well-known American newspaper,'' said William Woo, journalism
professor at Stanford University and former editor of the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch. ``It's not the same as founding a newspaper. They
essentially bought it at a fire sale. They went out and found the
remnants of a Justice Department requirement. So in the long run,
the pride that Asians get depends on what the Fangs are able to
accomplish with this paper. I think the Fangs have a very steep
road ahead of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But all those cautions were not in the mind of Florence Fang on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband would have been the happiest person - it was his
dream,'' she said. ``Do we celebrate? Not yet. Today, I want to be
very quiet and start thinking of the whole thing.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Court returns loot to the looters
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While much attention recently has been paid the demands for
return of art treasures looted by the Nazis, and while Greece
continues to insist Great Britain give back the Elgin Marbles
looted from the Parthenon two centuries ago, a court ruling in
Virginia late last month has turned this type of reclamation into a
tizzy.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported Monday that a federal appeals court in Virginia
has ruled that Spain owns the remains of two sunken warships lying
off the Virginia coast for several centuries. This is a major blow
to the treasure salvors and carries with it severe implications,
including the presumption that other colonial powers of yesteryear
also will lay claim to their sunken vessels rather than stand by
and watch private parties locate, claim and salvage the ships.
</P>
<P>
   In of itself, that sounds fair, but it isn't. In most cases, the
sunken vessels are carrying booty looted from the indigenous people
of the Western Hemisphere, likely obtained by pressing those people
into slave labor to obtain it.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic coast and Caribbean waters are strewn with sunken
ships, mostly Spanish, dating to a period when the Spanish were
looting the Western Hemisphere. There can be no argument that the
ships, those two off the Virginia coast and as many as 600 others,
belong to Spain. There, the courts ruled properly.
</P>
<P>
   But to accede to the claim that the contents also belong to
Spain is to give succor to anyone else who has looted over the
centuries, or the recipients of that loot _ including the art
collectors, museums and banks that now hold booty taken from
victims of World War II and now in the hands of third parties.
</P>
<P>
   Great Britain, for instance, did not loot the Parthenon of
ancient Greece. But it bought stolen goods. With the help of
Turkish occupiers, a British statesman, Lord Elgin, stripped them
from their already despoiled home in Athens over a two-year period
at the beginning of the 19th century, ostensibly to save them from
greater damage. In 1916, Elgin sold them to Great Britain and the
British Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Greece has demanded the return of the sculpture friezes. The
British thus far have refused, saying they will return them only
when the Greeks have a way to protect them from pollution, a
serious problem in Athens. Soon, the challenge may be met. Last
week, Greece opened competition for design of a protective
structure, promising to have its museum completed by 2004. Then the
ball falls back into Great Britain's court.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the sunken ships, a more proper ruling would have
been to grant rights to the ships and the remains, if any, of its
crew to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   But not the stolen booty.
</P>
<P>
   There are detailed records of the treasure fleets that perished
on their way back to Spain and surely it can be determined from
where the gold and precious stones were taken. And how many slaves
were on those ships, stolen not from Africa but from Central and
South America and the West Indies?
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia decision, limited to U.S. waters, nevertheless is a
dangerous one. It not only upsets the existing rules of salvage but
awards to transgressors the spoils of their transgressions. Few
were comfortable when private salvors grabbed the treasures off
sunken Spanish ships but neither are many comfortable that they now
transfer from Column A to Column B.
</P>
<P>
   If it can be shown that the treasure from the two ships involved
in the suit _ La Galga and Juno _ came from the looted temples of,
say, the Inca empire, then that's where most of the treasure ought
to be returned. (Compounding that, of course, is whether aggressive
Incans looted it from somewhere else.)
</P>
<P>
   It was argued by legal advocates for Spain that treasure aboard
the two ships was minimal, but ``minimal'' needs definition. Even
so, was that the criteria used by the federal appeals court to
determine ownership of the vessels? If so, how would it apply to
sunken ships carrying more than ``minimal'' treasure?
</P>
<P>
   If Spain is not forced to relinquish its claim to stolen
property, then what does that portend for others who have stolen
through conquest over the centuries?

 &HT;    An open-minded critic finally listens to rap
 &HT;    By Charles Passey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There I am, doing my morning workout at
the gym, when I finally decide to pop the tape I've been avoiding
into my cassette player. It's Eminem's chart-topping The Marshall
Mathers LP, and if you've read any of the headlines concerning this
Michigan-born rapper, you'd understand my hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem specializes in a style of rap that's harder than
hard-core. Defiantly rude and crude, it's a celebration of man at
his most misogynistic and homophobic. The fact that the artist's
life closely resembles his music _ his wife recently attempted
suicide after attending one of his concerts _ only adds to the
legend.
</P>
<P>
   I'm fully prepared to hate the album _- and the first couple of
cuts confirm my expectations. Public Service Announcement, the
opening selection, offers a hint of what's to come, warning
Eminem's listeners that ``if you don't like (the album),'' you're
welcome to perform a certain sexual act on the artist. That's
followed by Kill You, in which Eminem (aka Slim Shady) articulates
his formula for mayhem: There are brutal descriptions of the artist
raping his own mother and committing other violent crimes against
women.
</P>
<P>
   But as the album plays on, something strange starts to happen: I
find myself drawn into Eminem's menacing universe. A song about a
psychotic fan (Stan) and an autobiographical rant (The Real Slim
Shady) resonate with a blend of crassness and verve. Leaving the
gym, I keep wanting to listen, so I switch to my car stereo. By the
time Eminem comes to the album's most harrowing cut, Kim, the
musical equivalent of watching a man go postal, I am sitting in my
driveway, unwilling to hit the stop button, and am left with two
unshakable conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The man is brilliant. And I'm going to do everything in my power
to make sure my oldest child, an 8-year-old boy who's just
beginning to explore the vast terrain of pop music, never gets his
hands on this album.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is precisely the way Eminem wants it. I'm 36
years old, white and comfortably middle class, a demographic far
removed from rap's target audience oo rap recordings. And I don't
line up to buy tickets to rap concerts, such as the ``Up In Smoke''
tour, featuring Eminem, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube, which
comes to the National Car Rental Center on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But my story is a little more complex. I'm not just a
36-year-old white guy, I'm also a critic. For more than a decade, I
have made my living writing primarily about music and musicians,
first in the classical field _ I once considered becoming an opera
singer _ and more recently in pop and rock. But during this time, I
have generally avoided rap. I like to consider myself open-minded:
My record collection ranges from Sondheim to the Rolling Stones,
Mozart to the Dave Matthews Band. But there are no albums by
Run-D.M.C., the Beastie Boys or Dr. Dre.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I gave myself the challenge of coming to terms
with rap. I wanted to know what all these kids were listening to. I
wanted to understand how a genre that many critics wrote off in its
early years _ who ever heard of ``songs'' in which nobody sang? _
had managed to survive more than two decades. And not just survive,
but prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first rap record in 1979, Rapper's Delight by the
Sugar Hill Gang, rap has shifted from its streetwise New York
origins to become an international phenomenon. According to the
Recording Industry Association of America, rap accounted for 10.8
percent of all record sales in 1999, putting it in a virtual tie
for the first time with country music. (Rock remains the industry
leader, with 25.2 percent, but its market share has slipped
dramatically in the last decade.) Look at the latest Billboard pop
charts and you'll find four rap or rap-dominated albums occupying
the top five spots. (The one exception? Britney Spears, of course.)
</P>
<P>
   Soundtrack of Middle America
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon extends well beyond music. Rap is the leading
edge of the entire aesthetic wave known as hip-hop, a term that
encompasses nearly everything rooted in the black urban cultural
experience, from dancing to fashion. But if hip-hop's creators are
largely black _ and even that has started to change with the
current rage for white rappers like Eminem and Kid Rock _ its
audience has become increasingly white. Look at MTV and it's
obvious that rap is now the soundtrack of Middle America. Even my
8-year-old son, who's exposed to a spectrum of fairly clean-cut rap
artists on the kid-oriented Nickelodeon cable network, claims it as
his music.
</P>
<P>
   So what's my problem?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm not that different from most parents I know _ or
even most pop critics of a certain age. On a certain level, we all
don't get it. A current story in the American Journalism Review
talks about how newspapers are being forced to reexamine who they
have covering music _ and the critics themselves admit there's a
problem. The piece quotes 58-year-old Village Voice pop critic
Robert Christgau, one of the few senior music scribes who's made an
earnest attempt to stay current. ``Hip-hop is the great
generational divide,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   To try to cross that divide, I did what any critic would do: I
listened. In my weeklong foray, I sampled bits and pieces of about
a dozen albums, ranging from the ``old school'' rap of the Sugar
Hill Gang to such contemporary voices as Dr. Dre and Will Smith. I
also read Nelson George's seminal volume on rap, Hip Hop America.
And I talked to everyone from a rap-loving spokesman with a
Washington media think tank to a local artist who specializes in
Christian rap.
</P>
<P>
   The mere mention of a Christian rapper brings me to the first of
many lessons I learned _ that there as many kinds of rap as there
are rappers. While it's the hard-core artists who often grab the
headlines, particularly such ``gangsta'' rappers as Tupac Shakur
and Notorious B.I.G., whose violent lifestyles ended in their
murders, these represent just one branch of an ever-growing tree.
There are the party rappers who started it all (Sugar Hill Gang,
Run-D.M.C.), the alternative rappers who bring an avant-garde
mindset to the urban scene (De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest), the
female rappers who blend soul and spice (Queen Latifah,
Salt-N-Pepa). And there are icons aplenty: rap balladeer L.L. Cool
J, Public Enemy, pop rapper Will Smith, South Florida's own
booty-rapping, free-speech advocate Luther Campbell, and rap's
Grammy girl, Lauryn Hill, whose R&AMP;B-shaded solo debut became the
first hip-hop recording to win the industry's highest honor, Album
of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer diversity was something I didn't expect to encounter.
On a lazy afternoon, I listened to A Tribe Called Quest's The Low
End Theory, an album that overflows with the cool, funky vibes of
jazz _ and not just because bassist Ron Carter appears as a guest.
Hearing the muted horns, the lyrics that refer to everything from
Shakespeare to pagers (more on that aspect later), the recording
struck me as a quintessential Beat-generation-inspired expression
(remember, the Beat poets also did their thing to jazz). This is
rap that any adult could appreciate _ or at least any adult with
taste.
</P>
<P>
   But the point is not to focus on a particular album. Saying you
don't like rap because of some sex-and-violence-filled rant is a
little like saying you don't like rock because of Marilyn Manson's
music. Any genre that has passed the test of time has room for
everybody. A colleague told me about an Orthodox Jew who raps about
the Holocaust. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a country-western
rapper out there.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, when I looked closer at the ``gangsta''
subgenre, I couldn't automatically write it off. True, much of it
revolves around limited themes (sex, drugs and street violence),
told in the same brutal, foul-mouthed style. As much as I tried, I
had a hard time distinguishing Dr. Dre's The Chronic from Tupac
Shakur's 2Pacalypse Now, both considered important historical
recordings. And on first listening, I could barely make it through
N.W.A.'s Straight Outta Compton. But another colleague urged me to
listen again. This time, I got it: The title track tells it all _
this is music that exposes the underside of America. It's the anger
of a riotous Los Angeles after the Rodney King trial, set to a
furious beat. You may not like the message, but attention must be
paid.
</P>
<P>
   Not that rock hasn't offered its share of political commentary,
from Bob Dylan to U2. By contrast, most black music during the '60s
and '70s, from the Motown sound of The Supremes to the disco beat
of Donna Summer, rarely asked you to do anything more than listen
with a smile or dance. There were such noteworthy social-minded
exceptions as Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, but it took rap to
truly unleash the urban message.
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious in its scope
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just ``gangsta'' artists who have something to say.
You'll find your share of conscience on everything from Grandmaster
Flash's groundbreaking 1982 single The Message, which chronicles
one man's quest to hold on to his sanity amidst all the urban
decay, to Will Smith's recent Just the Two of Us, which talks about
the challenges of fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rap nowadays is no different from the folk music of the '60s;
they're coming up with the same grass-roots vibes,'' says local
Christian rapper Proverb, whose group, 1Way, has released two
nationally acclaimed recordings.
</P>
<P>
   But even when rap is not asking you to think, it's usually
ambitious in its scope. From album to album, I was consistently
impressed by the sheer length of rap songs. Whereas rock and pop
rarely venture beyond five minutes _ you can't risk the possibility
of turning off radio programmers _ rap has trouble thinking in such
short terms. Take the song that started it all, Rapper's Delight.
It's a 14-minute party of a record that holds up remarkably well, a
playful vision of the inner city that's as big and proud as the MCs
behind the mike. You hear the same ambition when rap artists ``free
style'' _ improvise lyrics on the spot. The best go on like a great
rock guitarist on a mighty tear.
</P>
<P>
   Clever wordplay
</P>
<P>
   And yet, where is that ambition in rock today? Consider
alternative rock, says Anthony DeCurtis, a Rolling Stone
contributing editor and rap aficionado. He points to the grunge
bands' ``refusal of scale, refusal of fame.'' By contrast, he adds,
``I like that the rappers go for it ... That, to me, is exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, rap is about lyrics. The many prosaic
rappers notwithstanding, the genre's hallmark may be its clever
wordplay. You can find examples left and right. Here's the Sugar
Hill Gang in Rapper's Delight: ``I say can of beer that's sweeter
than honey/Like a millionaire that has no money/Like a rainy day
that is not wet/Like a gambling fiend that does not bet/Like a
Dracula without his fangs/Like the boogie to the boogie without the
boogie bang/Like collard greens that don't taste good/Like a tree
that's not made out of wood.'' And here's A Tribe Called Quest in
What?: ``What's a childbirth without the umbilica?/What's United
Parcel without the delivera? ... What's a black nation without
black unity?/What is a child who doesn't know puberty?''
</P>
<P>
   And while every hard-core rapper picks on Will Smith for his
PG-rated approach, let's give the guy some credit as well, DeCurtis
suggests: ``When he says something like `I'm soft like Microsoft,'
that's pretty great.''
</P>
<P>
   So there we have it _ a diversity of styles, an uncompromising
portrait of America, a boundless idea of song and lots of great
rhymes. It should be enough to make me a rap fan _ all in a week's
time.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I'm still puzzled. For starters, I can't fully
accept music that ignores one of the most crucial elements _
melody. While I know that rappers have no problem sampling songs
from yesteryear, including such personal favorites as The Police's
Every Breath You Take and The Clash's Rock the Casbah, in the end,
it's the beat that propels rap. And while that beat can be expanded
and explored in countless ingenious ways, from the funk rhythms of
Dr. Dre to those jazz musings of A Tribe Called Quest, it's still
just a beat. To my ears, raised on Bach and rock, it's melody that
seduces the ears, that attaches itself to a lyric and lets you feel
its emotional content. That's why rap's lyrics are so short and
clipped _ they're defined by rhythm. I can't help but think of it
as a limitation.
</P>
<P>
   Complaint of ownership
</P>
<P>
   And let's go back to sampling: This, too, is a problem for me _
and one that has bothered many musicians, black and white, whose
music has been lifted. While their essential complaint may have to
do with royalties, ultimately it's a complaint of ownership. As
creative as some rappers may be, they are re-creators in a musical
context _ they expand on another musician's idea and then claim it
for themselves. It's not just that I'm bothered by the inherent
dishonesty of the process, it's that, once again, I perceive it as
a limitation. Especially since sampling is one of the key reasons
rap is more an art of the recording studio than the concert stage.
I like my music to thrive in both media.
</P>
<P>
   But what p culture. But while my belief in free speech still
makes me wary of warning labels on records, I can't stomach this
much hatred, even if rap listeners tell me not to take it so
seriously. Or as Eminem says at the end of the horrific Kill You:
``I'm just playing ladies, you know I love you.'' I'm sorry, Slim
Shady: You can't have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Women and gays
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not even a member of the two groups most targeted by
hard-core rappers: women and gays. Listening to Dr. Dre's first
album, The Chronic, I can't get past all the references to
``bitches'' _ and I just about lose it when the album includes a
depiction of rough sex. This isn't art; it's pornography. And yet,
here's what Nelson George has to say about the artist: ``The beauty
of Dre's musicianship and the seductive ugliness that it supported
is a true hip-hop statement, full of genius, pain and contradictory
values.'' Would a female critic share the same perspective?
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, my real problem is that I grew up with a
different soundtrack. And while there are no shortage of rock songs
that deal with sex and violence, there's a subtler approach, for
the most part. Take some of Bruce Springsteen's darkest work: The
images are less graphic, but the messages are far stronger. It
takes Matthew Felling, a rap-loving spokesman for the Center for
Media and Public Affairs, a Washington think tank, to put it in the
proper context for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce is talking about angst in a totally lonely way,'' he
says. ``But we're living in the age of Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Eminem tried to work in some references to the
infamous high-school shooting on his latest album, but his record
company nixed the idea. Not to worry: There's plenty that will
offend nearly every adult. Even his fans are not spared his wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony DeCurtis tells me it's important to distinguish the
message from the essential talent of the creator. ``What may well
be reprehensible about these records doesn't necessarily make them
bad,'' he explains. ``It may make them evil, it may make them
dangerous, it may make them things you want your kids to avoid, but
there still is an artistry to all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Music appreciation
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in my driveway that morning, I had to accept, even
marvel at, Eminem's artistry. And throughout my rap-filled week,
there were other moments of appreciation. At the end of the day,
however, this is not the music I will put on my turntable (and yes,
I still own one). I only hope that young people will be able to
make the same distinction that DeCurtis makes. And I hope the
record-buying public gives equal recognition to the non-hardcore
rappers, whose talent is not overshadowed by their message.
</P>
<P>
   A parting thought: Don't get too cocky about your music, kids.
One day you'll have to face the prospect of Eminem being packaged
as part of a ``golden oldies'' anthology. Or maybe if he's as
strong-willed as Mick Jagger, he'll still be strutting his stuff in
concert in his 60s _ and you'll be paying hundreds of dollars to
relive the memories from your youth.
</P>
<P>
   And God knows what your children will be listening to.
</P>
<P>
   PASSY'S DELIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   After a week of listening to rap recordings, it wasn't hard to
separate the good from the bad. favorites, listed in chronological
order:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sugar Hill Gang's `Rapper's Delight' (1979) and Grandmaster
Flash's `The Message' (1982):
</P>
<P>
   You can find these two seminal singles on various rap
anthologies (I chose one called Old School Rap, Volume 1, on the
Thump Records label). Both hold up remarkably well after all these
years, the former offering a generous taste of rap in its best
party-days mode, the latter giving an early glimpse of rap's social
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  N.W.A.'s `Straight Outta Compton' (1989):
</P>
<P>
   This is ``gangsta'' rap before it got a bad rap _ an
uncompromising vision of America's urban nightmare. Just check out
the title cut.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A Tribe Called Quest's `The Low End Theory' (1991): Think rap
meets the avant-garde. This jazz- and funk-flavored album is an
alternative rap definition of cool.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lauryn Hill's `The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill' (1998): After
her success with the Fugees, Hill released this R&AMP;B-shaded solo
debut. It took rap to another place, blending heart and soul with
the rhythm of the street.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Eminem's `The Marshall Mathers LP' (2000): You'll hate the
message, but you can't ignore the man's creativity. And Stan is one
of the most chilling songs you'll ever hear _ a powerful narrative
that builds to a shocking conclusion.

PERSONAL HEALTH: FIBROMYALGIA: REAL ILLNESS, REAL ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Is it a real disease?'' is the most frequently asked question
about fibromyalgia, an ailment characterized by chronic widespread
musculoskeletal pain. The cynical tone that usually accompanies the
question suggests that many think this syndrome is all in a
person's head, the result, perhaps, of an emotional disorder or an
attempt to avoid the demands of work and life.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, say experts who have spent years studying this
controversial disorder. Yes, some people with fibromyalgia may be
depressed or anxious, but wouldn't you be if you couldn't carry a
bag of groceries, walk through a park or tie your shoelaces without
considerable pain?
</P>
<P>
   And yes, there is as yet no convincing physiological explanation
for the array of symptoms suffered by people with fibromyalgia. It
is neither an inflammatory disorder nor a degenerative disease. Its
victims look perfectly normal. But when even mild pressure is
applied to certain points on the body that do not normally hurt,
most of those areas are painfully tender in a person with
fibromyalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Don Goldenberg, rheumatologist at Newton-Wellesley Hospital
and Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, cites studies
indicating that 10 percent to 12 percent of the population suffers
from persistent widespread pain, women more than men and older more
than younger. Many of these people have no well-defined
musculoskeletal disease but rather satisfy the diagnostic criteria
for fibromyalgia, making it the second most common diagnosis in
rheumatology clinics, behind osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health estimates that 3.7 million
Americans over 18 have fibromyalgia: about 3.4 percent of women and
0.5 percent of men and more than 7 percent of women from 60 to 79.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, after careful study, the American College of
Rheumatology concluded that chronic pain patients without some
other well-defined disease who had mild or greater tenderness at 11
or more of 18 specific points on the body could be said to have
fibromyalgia. But pain is only part of the problem. Patients with
fibromyalgia typically also suffer from fatigue, sleep disturbances
and headaches, as well as depression and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The disorder is often mistaken for osteoarthritis, which may
coexist with it in the elderly. It may also be confused with
degenerative spinal disk disease, a nerve entrapment syndrome or
chronic Lyme disease. As with these other disorders, symptoms of
fibromyalgia are often made worse by weather, stress or
inappropriate exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Half or more of fibromyalgia patients have or once had other
disorders that lack a defined organic basis, like chronic fatigue
syndrome, chronic headaches or irritable bowel syndrome. This has
led some to believe that fibromyalgia is a psychosomatic disorder,
an emotional problem that manifests itself as a physical one. But
while half or more of people with fibromyalgia have a history of
depression, most have no current psychiatric illness.
</P>
<P>
   Certain organic aberrations have been found in people with
fibromyalgia, although it is not yet known if these came before or
after the syndrome developed. Among them are changes in nervous
system chemicals that may explain the common problem of disturbed
sleep. Fibromyalgia patients typically lack restorative, or
slow-wave, sleep, which can result in chronic fatigue and
heightened sensitivity. Levels of substance P, a chemical related
to pain, and some abnormal pain-related peptides are at high levels
in the cerebrospinal fluid of fibromyalgia patients, who may also
have insufficient blood flow to parts of the brain involved in pain
perception.
</P>
<P>
   Patients often report that their chronic pain is preceded by a
physical or emotional trauma, like a neck injury from a car
accident or loss of a job. Or the disorder may follow an infection.
For example, 10 percent to 25 percent of Lyme disease patients
develop fibromyalgia that persists for months or years after they
have received adequate treatment for Lyme disease. These patients
do not respond to prolonged treatment with antibiotics that treat
Lyme disease. Despite considerable investigation, no infectious
organism _ not Epstein-Barr virus or any other suspect
micro-organism _ has been identified as a cause of fibromyalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis Turk, a pain specialist at the University of
Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, summed up the perplexing
disorder: ``Because fibromyalgia is so confusing, other people
wonder if it's real. This contributes to the sufferer's emotional
distress.''
</P>
<P>
   Fibromyalgia is considered a chronic problem that could last
indefinitely. But proper treatment, which may involve medication to
improve sleep along with a specially designed exercise program and
psychological counseling, can greatly alleviate a patient's
discomfort and disability.
</P>
<P>
   Even when patients are not depressed, studies have shown that
taking low doses of an antidepressant can often treat the
underlying sleep disorder and alleviate the accompanying fatigue.
But experts warn against using sleeping pills, sedatives or
alcohol, because these may only make the sleep problem worse.
</P>
<P>
   The pain and disability associated with fibromyalgia can become
a self-fulfilling prophecy. As patients with pain refrain more and
more from physical activity, their muscles become increasingly
deconditioned and susceptible to pain from the slightest exertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important key to managing muscles affected by
fibromyalgia is to keep them moving,'' says Stacie Bigelow, a
health educator and counselor who has had fibromyalgia for nearly a
decade. In her sensible and informative new book, ``Fibromyalgia:
Simple Relief Through Movement,'' she likens the problem to a
cement truck that must keep the cement moving to keep it from
solidifying. Unused muscles become stiff and painful.
</P>
<P>
   The key in fibromyalgia is to increase daily activities
gradually so that muscles do not remain in one position for long
and to adopt a program of gentle exercise to recondition muscles,
along with a stretching routine that also helps to reduce pain.
Bigelow's book details ways of adopting a program of activity and
exercise (alternating with rest) that, though it may not seem so at
first, is essential to reducing the pain of fibromyalgia and
relieving the associated disability.
</P>
<P>
   Another excellent book, ``Fibromyalgia and the Mind-Body-Spirit
Connection,'' by Dr. William B. Salt II and Dr. Edwin Season,
describes the enormous benefits that can be gleaned from a
relatively brief form of counseling called cognitive behavioral
therapy, which helps people address self-defeating thoughts that
can aggravate pain and make adopting changes to alleviate pain
difficult. If you find yourself thinking that you can never get
better or that you can't stand it anymore, cognitive behavioral
therapy can be very helpful.

convention-related stories for Tuesday, Aug. 1. The New York Times

<P>
   GOP-RDP-NYT (Philadelphia) _ A convention roundup: Republicans
open their convention, beginning what party leaders hope will be a
highly scripted four- day celebration of George W. Bush; the first
real business came when the delegates approved a platform that
reaffirms the party's staunch position opposing abortion while
adopting Bush's compassionate conservative positions; according to
a New York Times/CBS News poll of delegates, the Republicans here
are far more conservative than average Republican voters, but Karl
Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush Campaign, played down the
dichotomy between the delegates and the message in an interview
Monday on ``Political Points,'' a joint production of ABCNEWS.com
and The New York Times on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: An early, 600-word version of the roundup has moved and
will be updated by 9 p.m. ET with a 1,300-word version written by
Richard L. Berke, updated with quotes from late speeches by Colin
Powell and Laura Bush; complete text will be available the New York
Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com)
</P>
<P>
   GOP-PLATFORM _ Maintaining the promise of a friction-free
convention, delegates to the Republican National Convention swiftly
adopt a platform that adheres to most of the party's core
conservative principles but softens some of the edges on other
issues in keeping with George W. Bush's effort to project a more
compassionate image.
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: An early 755-word story is scheduled to move by 4 p.m. ET
and will be updated by 9 p.m. ET with a 1,000-word version by Robin
Toner; the text is available on the Web: www.nytimes.com)

</P>

REPUBLICAN DELEGATES ADOPT NEW PARTY PLATFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story will be updated by 9 p.m. EDT with a 1,000-word
version by Robin Toner; the text is available on the Web:
www.nytimes.com) By DANIEL J. WAKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Maintaining the promise of a friction-free
convention, delegates to the Republican National Convention swiftly
adopted a platform Monday that adheres to most of the party's core
conservative principles but softens some of the edges on other
issues in keeping with Gov. George W. Bush's effort to project a
more compassionate image.
</P>
<P>
   The platform was approved by the delegates in a voice vote, in
the first major action at the convention. It maintains a tough line
on abortion and rejects special rights for gays and homosexuals. It
calls for a reduction in the size of the federal government and for
tax cuts. The platform enshrines other basic Republican touchstones
like the pre-eminence of the family and a need for ``rebuilding the
American military.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the platform closely matches the message of the
convention, as scripted by the Bush campaign. The first chapter's
title, for example, is ``The American Dream: Prosperity with a
Purpose,'' echoing the message in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The language on abortion, despite the appeals of pro-choice
Republicans, remains particularly strict. The platform condemns a
recent Supreme Court decision prohibiting states from banning what
critics call partial birth abortions. It calls for a ``human life''
amendment to the Constitution and legislation ``to make clear''
that the 14th Amendment applies to fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Also included was support for the appointment of judges ``who
respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent
human life,'' which abortion rights supporters denounce as a litmus
test for judges.
</P>
<P>
   But in recognition of Bush's strategy of pulling in moderate
voters, the platform differed from previous ones on some major
issues.
</P>
<P>
   There was no call for abolishing the Department of Education, a
favored goal of conservatives. In fact, the 73-page document
devoted four pages to education, which polls show is one of the
major concerns of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It listed the principles for ``what works'' in education:
``strong parental involvement, excellent teachers, safe and orderly
classrooms, high academic standards and a commitment to teaching
the basics _ from an early start in phonics to mastery of computer
technology.'' It emphasized greater control over education,
increasing the number of charter schools and allowing students in
dangerous schools to transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Notable was language reaching out to foreign-born citizens. ``As
a nation of immigrants, we welcome all new Americans who have
entered lawfully and are prepared to follow our laws and provide
for themselves and their families,'' the platform said.
</P>
<P>
   The balancing act embodied by this platform reflected the perils
of Bush's strategy of tempering the party's harder-edged views.
While reaching out to more moderate voters and Democrats willing to
abandon Vice President Al Gore, his eventual opponent, Bush risks
alienating his Republican core.
</P>
<P>
   The debate before Monday's vote reflected that. More
conservative members fought fiercely to keep in the call for the
abolishment of the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the divide, less conservative members of
the platform committee failed to keep out a statement that
homosexuals had no place in the military. Even Bush had more in
common with the losers in that battle. He supports the ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy, a spokesman said, which the Clinton
administration has adopted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On other gay issues, the platform said that no ``special legal
protections or standing in law'' should be granted gays, nor should
civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family is society's central core of energy. That is why
efforts to strengthen family life are the surest way to improve
life for everyone,'' the platform said. And later: ``We support the
traditional definition of `marriage' as the legal union of one man
and one woman, and we believe that federal judges and bureaucrats
should not force states to recognize other living arrangements as
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   On foreign trade, the platform calls for a ``new and ambitious
round'' of multilateral negotiations aimed at opening markets,
efforts to have countries bring down tariffs so more U.S. goods can
be sold and a tightening of export controls over military
technology.
</P>
<P>
   It also calls for giving the next president so-called fast-track
negotiating authority. And it supports the development of
bioengineered crops, an idea that is at odds with many European
economic allies and trading partners.

EVANGELIST FOLLOWING BUSH'S CUES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BUD KENNEDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ This should be David Barton's week in the
spotlight, a week when the Texas historian and best-selling
evangelical Christian author could show Republicans around the
birthplace of what he calls a ``godly'' nation founded under
``Christian principles.''
</P>
<P>
   So where is this outspoken Texan whose religious books are
quoted across America? Where is this Texan who wants Supreme Court
judges impeached and calls separation of church and state a
``myth''?
</P>
<P>
   Ssshhh. He's the state party vice chairman now. So he's
following the same script as the Guv.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to build bridges, trying to seek common ground in
the party,'' said Barton, 46, of rural Annetta in Parker County,
west of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Once a Bible-preaching evangelical guest speaker, he comes to
this week's Republican National Convention in a state leadership
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make gains a little at a time,'' he said. ``A lot of the
voters in the Christian movement don't understand that. They want
everything changed right now.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, common ground is named George W. Bush. The Texas
governor is a Methodist who calls for ``compassionate
conservatism,'' but also speaks the evangelical language of
``knowing'' Jesus Christ as a ``personal savior.''
</P>
<P>
   With the once-powerful Christian Coalition lobbying group
divided, Barton sees himself as a connection between mainstream
evangelicals who want, say, prayers at high school football games,
and extreme groups who want America reinvented as a ``Christian
nation'' under a religious government.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago in San Diego, Barton pitched evangelical books
and videos to the latter group, selling his meticulous research
suggesting that the Founding Fathers may have intended to govern by
the Bible. (Since then, his most popular book, ``The Myth of
Separation,'' has been withdrawn and re-edited to remove some
unverified content. It is now titled ``Original Intent.'')
</P>
<P>
   This week, joining 17,000 Republicans in the home of
Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, he not only won't give any
``heritage'' speeches _ he might not even revisit the historic
sites which were the backdrop for his books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philadelphia is great for a historian,'' he said. ``There is
no better place to see American history than the place where the
principles of our government were established. That's something to
be celebrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he plans to quietly shop for antique documents and add to
his collection of Revolutionary War-era publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``No tours,'' he said with a shrug and a grin. ``I think our
delegates can find it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of giving his old rapid-fire speeches filled with quotes
and statistics about how America has gone bad since school prayers
ended in 1962, now Barton delivers a broad plea for all Americans
to vote and participate in government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get people more involved,'' he said. ``I'm disturbed
that the voter turnout is so low. On either side of the aisle, I
want more people taking part. That adversarial process turns out a
better final product.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that his leadership role has not changed his
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to promise that anybody could get involved,'' he said.
``Then, I was only speaking to religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm giving the same speech. But instead of telling
Christian groups to get involved, I'm telling civic clubs and
Republican clubs and all sides to get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the gospel according to Bush.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harriet Bass lay on a table at the New York Eye and
Ear Infirmary, her right eye propped open by a metal ring, staring
up at a red dot of light.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to feel a little pressure,'' Dr. John A. Seedor
told Bass, a 49-year-old casting director, as he was about to slice
into her cornea. Using a motorized blade known as a keratome,
Seedor cut a circular flap around the cornea, about one-third of an
inch wide and one-150th of an inch thick, and peeled it back.
</P>
<P>
   Switching to a computer-controlled laser, Seedor trained an
invisible beam of cool ultraviolet light on the exposed soft
underlayers. The lenses within Bass' nearsighted eyes bent light
too sharply, making her vision fuzzy. The laser vaporized bits of
cornea in a way that flattened the curvature at the front of Bass'
eye to bring images at the back of the eye, on the retina, into
focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, Harriet. It looks beautiful,'' Seedor said. He
placed the flap back down, caressing it with a brush back into
place. ``Ready for the other eye?''
</P>
<P>
   Seedor repeated the procedure. The operation took about 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Food and Drug Administration approved the procedure
only last year, Lasik, short for laser in-situ keratomileusis, has
quickly grown into a $3 billion-a-year industry, with 750,000
Americans expected to choose the surgery this year. Intended to
correct nearsightedness, the procedure can now treat farsightedness
as well.
</P>
<P>
   With 1.2 million American customers expected next year, Lasik is
becoming the issue in a financial turf war between ophthalmologists
and optometrists, between top-dollar surgeons and low-cost,
high-volume centers.
</P>
<P>
   Ophthalmologists are the eye surgeons with medical degrees who
perform the surgery. Optometrists are specialists in measuring
vision who prescribe eyeglasses and contact lenses, and,
increasingly, handle the care before and after Lasik surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Lasik's popularity is easily explained: For the vast majority of
patients, it is safe, effective and, increasingly, affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple procedure,'' said Dr. Richard S. Koplin, medical
director of LaserOne in Manhattan. ``It's not brain surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many people willing to pay out of pocket _ most
insurance companies do not pay for the procedure, because they
regard it as ``cosmetic'' _ to be rid of contacts or glasses, Lasik
surgeons have turned to the familiar marketing tools: celebrity
testimonials, billboards, radio and television advertisements,
telemarketing.
</P>
<P>
   For would-be patients, the choices _ LaserOne, Lasik Vision, the
Laser Center, Insight Laser Center, Infinity Laser Center, among
others _ can bewilder.
</P>
<P>
   Three general business models have evolved. Seedor is in the
mode of a traditional practice: A patient pays for the attention
and experience of the surgeon, $2,650 an eye in Bass' case.
</P>
<P>
   Centers like Lasik Vision and LaserOne are decidedly corporate
and mass market; Carmine Asparro of Bellmore, taking advantage of
the grand opening special at Lasik Vision in Garden City, N.Y.,
paid just $500 for Lasik on his right eye. (His left already had
20/20 vision.)
</P>
<P>
   The third is an increasingly popular arrangement known as
``co-management'' in which a patient's optometrist handles the
initial evaluation and postoperative care in exchange for part of
the fee. The Laser Center in Manhattan, for example, works with
about 75 optometrists who send a stream of patients. The
optometrists make money from a procedure that eliminates the need
for their services.
</P>
<P>
   At the Laser Center, Evan Mason of Irvington paid more than
Bass: $5,500 for two eyes. Yet she never met her surgeon, Dr. Mark
G. Speaker, before the surgery and has not seen him since. No
studies have showed which approach yields better results, and all
three have their critics and defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing materials from the traditional Lasik surgeons often
darkly hint that their cheaper competitors might be skimping to
make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Dello Russo of the New Jersey Eye Institute in
Bergenfield charges $2,800 per eye. ``I know what I'm worth,'' he
said. ``You're not going to get an experienced surgeon for $1,000
an eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Henderson, president and chief executive of Lasik
Vision Corp., which runs centers in North America, is similarly
emphatic. ``If you pay $5,000,'' he said, ``you're simply being
gouged.''
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Susan Fromer, an ophthalmologist at Garden City Lasik
Vision, says higher-cost surgeons can coexist with the high-volume
centers. In addition to her work at Lasik Vision, Fromer also
performs the surgery in her private practice in Manhattan, charging
$3,600 for two eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In her practice, Fromer handles the evaluation and postoperation
visits herself. At Lasik Vision _ which now charges $999 an eye
after 1,000 people quickly signed up for the introductory special _
an optometrist on the staff handles those duties, although Fromer
says she reviews the optometrists' data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in both models,'' Fromer said. ``It's an issue of
handholding. The level of care is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   In the co-management debates, some ophthalmologists are
concerned about the appearance of optometrists' steering patients
their way.
</P>
<P>
   Others fear that optometrists may be slow to recognize
complications after operations. The Laser Center is ``an economic
model,'' said Dr. Joseph Evitar, a surgeon at Chelsea Eye
Associates in Manhattan. ``You can't know what is really going on.
You're relying on someone else's judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker, on the other hand, says he carefully chooses his
co-managing optometrists. ``It wouldn't reflect well on me if I
were associated with someone who wasn't knowledgeable,'' he said.
The payment, 20 percent, is simply for the visits before and after.
``They are entitled to be paid for their services,'' he said,
``just like any other profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason said she was not aware that $1,000 of the $5,000 she paid
Speaker was going to her optometrist, Arkady Selenow, but that did
not bother her. ``I trust Dr. Selenow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Optometrists say they know their patients better and that
results in better care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a prescription,'' said Selenow, who practices in
Manhattan and Queens and co-manages about 1,000 Lasik cases a year.
``It's knowing their complete lifestyle. You know if they're going
to be happy. It's not just a science. There's an art to it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, a person who spends lots of time reading
or staring at a computer screen might be dissatisfied with 20/20
vision, because up-close viewing might be uncomfortable. Leaving
the vision slightly nearsighted might be a better option.
</P>
<P>
   With Mason, 44, Selenow steered her toward monovision, where her
right eye was corrected to 20/20 vision, while her left eye was
intentionally left a slightly nearsighted 20/40. That creates a
sort of bifocal vision, with the right eye to focus on distant
objects and the left eye for close-up reading.
</P>
<P>
   The sparring over co-management has escalated to the
professional societies of ophthalmologists and optometrists.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the
American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery released a
paper declaring that co-management should be ``an exceptional,
rather than a routine, occurrence,'' applicable, say, to someone
who lives far from the surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the co-management of patients is done on a routine basis
for predominantly financial reasons,'' the two organizations said,
``it represents unethical behavior and may be illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Optometric Association countered, ``This conclusion
is not grounded in law, regulation, or the American Academy of
Ophthalmology's own Code of Ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the International Society of Refractive Surgeons,
which includes ophthalmologists and optometrists, also said that
co-management was acceptable and that it was developing guidelines
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Properly structured, legal co-management arrangements should
not be cast under a pall just because they're co-management,'' said
Dr. Jeffrey B. Robin, the society's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   While no study offers a comprehensive picture, anecdotes point
to potential pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marc Odrich, director of refractive surgery at Columbia and
medical director of VISX, a laser manufacturer, tells of one
co-managed Lasik patient referred to him.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's eyesight was worsening, and an exam quickly showed
why: cataracts were clouding her lenses. Her optometrist had not
spotted the problem. The ophthalmologist did not check and, relying
on the optometrist, performed the operation. It went smoothly, but
the cataracts render it useless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fault the optometrist,'' Odrich said. ``I fault the
doctor who is operating on someone else's exam. You've got to do
the exam. This doesn't absolve you from being a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Lasik patients encounter no problems at all, although 1
percent to 10 percent require a second Lasik operation to fine-tune
their prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, complications do occasionally occur, some serious.
</P>
<P>
   During surgery, the flap-cutting keratome might jam or create a
wrinkle in the cornea, in perhaps one in 500 eyes, said Dr.
Jonathan Carr, director of medical services for the Lasik Vision
chain.
</P>
<P>
   After surgery, a range of problems can arise, although most can
be easily treated if caught promptly. About one in 500 will
experience an inflammation under the eye, Carr said. The odds of an
infection are about one in 10,000. There is one reported case of a
35-year-old man who had one eye removed after a Lasik-induced
infection.
</P>
<P>
   The operation also cuts down on production of tears, leading to
eyes that need drops. Almost always, the condition improves after a
few months.
</P>
<P>
   For some, particularly those with large pupils, Lasik can result
in nighttime glare and blurry halos around street lamps. Only
rarely does bothersome glare persist longer than a few months, Carr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other surgical alternatives exist, including corrective lenses
implanted in the cornea. That procedure costs about the same and is
reversible.
</P>
<P>
   In June the FDA approved a new procedure called laser thermal
keratoplasty for treatment of mild to moderate farsightedness in
people over 40. The condition affects an estimated 60 million
Americans. The procedure takes less than three seconds: The thermal
laser fires 16 bursts in two concentric rings, causing cornea
tissue to shrink and steepening the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements with Lasik are expected to help extremely
nearsighted people and those with oddly shaped corneas. For most,
Lasik already produces the results as promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing perfect,'' Evan Mason said a couple of weeks after
her surgery. ``It was perfect that night.'' Monovision, which she
tested with contact lenses before her surgery, was also no problem.
``I adapted immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Asparro, who took advantage of the special offered by Lasik
Vision, is also a satisfied patient. ``I'm so happy I did it,'' he
said. ``Love it. Would recommend it to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months after her surgery, Bass' vision is 20/50, not
the intended 20/25. She has bought reading glasses.
</P>
<P>
   She has a second operation scheduled _ an ``enhancement'' in
industry parlance and included in the original cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they have to do me again at the beginning of
August,'' she said. ``It's not as easy as I thought it would be. I
am not a disgruntled patient by any means. I'm still satisfied with
the work because it's greatly improved over what I used to see.''

   It's a funny thing about vice presidential nominations. Hardly
any politician professes to want the office; yet few have ever
turned it down when it's actually offered.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's nod to Richard Cheney is a case in point. So,
quite possibly, will be Vice President Al Gore's selection of a
running mate. Don't be surprised if it, too, produces someone who's
indicated previously that he had no interest in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Often the vice presidential selection is part of an effort to
balance the ticket for broader voter appeal. Bush's teaming up with
Cheney offers no geographic diversity, but it does provide an
otherwise missing dimension of Washington experience.
</P>
<P>
   In that, it's reminiscent of Bill Clinton's chob%9

EYE WITNESS ACCOUNT OF LASIK SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Science Times) 
(Eds: Also See SCI-EYE-SURGERY and SCI-EYE-DECIDE) 
 By SARAH LYALL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Surgery that would let me give up my glasses forever
had always sounded too good to be true, like one of those ads
promising that you can earn $10,000 a month by sitting around the
house doing nothing. I had been discussing it with my eye doctor
for years, and for years, the doctor had told me the technology was
not yet advanced enough.
</P>
<P>
   But he changed his mind because of improvements in the
technology. ``We can do it, if you're ready,'' he said last summer.
</P>
<P>
   I directed my unfiltered gaze to the eye chart on the wall. It
was silly to bother. As usual, I couldn't make out any of the
letters. In truth, I couldn't even tell that there was an eye
chart.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I told him, I'm ready.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I had my concerns. I worried that it would smell like
burning eyeball, or feel as if someone were taking an X-acto knife
to Jell-O. I worried that I would go blind, develop a disfiguring
infection or have to spend the rest of my life wearing tinted,
oversized double-thick aviator glasses.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that I was severely nearsighted and a good
candidate for Lasik treatment. I'd worn glasses since I was 7 and,
according to family legend, failed to see the beautiful wild goat
silhouetted against the sunset while we were on vacation in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Those first glasses _ bulbous tortoise-shell ones that clashed
with my Dorothy Hamill haircut _ were followed by other, equally
dismaying ones, and then some years later by contact lenses, which
tended to become dry, scratchy and unbearable, forcing me back into
the glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, my eyesight kept spiraling downward, finally settling
at a miserable -8.5. This is roughly equivalent to having 20-1,600
vision, meaning that what a perfectly sighted person could see from
1,600 feet away, I could see at 20 feet. But I wore my disability,
which included considerable astigmatism, with perverse pride,
happily using it to explain a number of my most glaring personal
failures, including a pathological fear of heights, an inability to
remember what people looked like, and a tendency to drive in a way
that made my passengers want to take the bus.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen, I wondered, when I lost the ability to not
see?
</P>
<P>
   It happened last fall, at a laser lab in the gold-encrusted
Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. Fortified with the
drugs I'd been prescribed, Valium and Percocet, I took my seat
along with a half-dozen other laser patients, all of them men in
their mid-'30s. They had brought their wives. I brought my mother.
We were all nervous.
</P>
<P>
   We swapped stories about lifetimes hobbled by corrective lenses,
and then it was my turn. I sat down, surrounded by nurses whose
job, it seemed, was to prevent me from running from the room. Then
the doctor began, one eye after the other.
</P>
<P>
   He gave me some numbing drops. Then he clamped my eyelid open to
prevent me from blinking, and put a suction ring around my eye.
Then he took the microkeratone _ which looks like a mini-version of
a butcher's meat-slicing machine _ and moved it across the eye,
cutting a tiny flap in the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   After that, which made everything go dark for about a minute,
the actual laser was not that bad. The suction ring was removed,
and I could see again. My job was not to flail erratically, not to
sob pitiably, and, most frighteningly, not to divert my eye from a
light blinking overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you do, DON'T LOOK AWAY,'' my doctor said ominously.
I did not smell burning, of fresh eyeball or singed flesh or
anything else. And I didn't feel any pain, only a lot of discomfort
and a strong desire to shout, ``Get your finger out of my eye!''
</P>
<P>
   The the doctor flooded my eye with liquid, taking what felt like
a mini-paintbrush and stroked my eyeball over and over, to get the
flap to re-attach itself over the cornea. Then he did the same
thing to the other eye.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt, but by the end, my eyes felt so dry and scratchy
that all I wanted to do was close them and crawl away somewhere
dark. Which is what I did next, in a dimly lighted communal
recovery room along with several patients who had already had the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The other patients' wives (and my mother) asked anxiously how we
felt. We felt as though someone were blowing sand into our eyes
with a straw. But when I left the laser lab, wearing a pair of
goggles and an enormous pair of surgical sunglasses, I had enough
vanity left to make it clear to those who joined us on the Trump
Tower elevator that, No, I had not had a face lift, but an
important, medically necessary ocular procedure. (My insurance
company didn't think it was medically necessary: It cost $5,000,
out of pocket).
</P>
<P>
   The next few weeks were strange ones, as my eyes healed and I
began to realize that I could see again in a way that I had never
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hard feeling to describe, because it's not as if I'd been
actually blind before. But I'd always taken my fragile sight to be
a precarious commodity, a favor that, having been granted, could
easily be snatched away. And then there was the ever-present fear
of being caught in a thunderstorm in the middle of the woods,
losing my contact lenses, breaking my glasses and starving to death
when I could not find my way home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I've almost forgotten all those years of gray, all those
lenses and inchoate worries. My eyes are better than 20-20: I can
see the tiny little line of letters at the bottom of the eye chart,
the optional ones. When I wake up, it's just me facing the world
without any distorting layers, with eyes that seem sharper and
brighter and more alive than they ever have before.

DECISIONS, DECISIONS: QUESTIONS TO ASK A LASIK SURGEON 
</HEADLINE>
  (Science Times) 
(Eds: Also See SCI-EYE-SURGERY and SCI-EYE-WITNESS) 
 By KENNETH CHANG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For would-be Lasik patients, there is unfortunately no way to
compare the results of different surgeons. The gushing testimonial
of a friend may be misleading: Lasik's results are so good that the
majority of patients of any surgeon will be happy with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts recommend asking surgeons, ``How many Lasik
procedures have you done?'' Some studies have indicated that, on
average, a surgeon's rate of complications drops over the course of
the first 300 or so Lasik procedures.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Marc Odrich, director of refractive surgery at Columbia
University and medical director of the laser manufacturer VISX,
says he believes newer flap-cutting keratomes have smoothed out the
learning curve.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests these questions for Lasik surgeons:
</P>
<P>
   _ What is the ``enhancement'' rate, that is, what percentage of
patients require a second surgery to fine-tune the prescription?
``I think that tells you how careful they are with the initial
work-up and the refraction they are getting,'' Odrich said.
</P>
<P>
   _ What percentage of people do you turn away? ``If the answer is
almost nobody, that would give me concern,'' Odrich said. ``I think
that's the hardest part of the procedure: the judgment. There are
lots of patients who are better off not having the surgery.''
Conditions that could rule out patients include thin corneas, past
herpes infections in the eyes, diabetes and unrealistic
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   _ For people over 40, do you recommend monovision? With
monovision, one eye is left somewhat nearsighted, postponing or
eliminating the need for reading glasses. If so, ask the doctor if
a trial with contact lenses is offered.
</P>
<P>
   _ What complications have you had and how have they turned out?
There are two ways that a doctor can avoid complications. ``No. 1
is you're lying,'' Odrich said, ``and way No. 2 is you've stopped
operating.'' What is more telling is how the surgeon handled the
complications.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lo, the ironies of our postmodern culture.
</P>
<P>
   If the Internet is ostensibly igniting new communities,
cellphones are making us easier to reach and home officing is
keeping us closer to our loved ones, then why are we so lonely?
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe you're not exactly lonely. But if you're an average
American, you're not nearly as connected to the people around you
as your parents or grandparents were, according to a new book.
</P>
<P>
   You don't vote as regularly.
</P>
<P>
   You don't join clubs as much.
</P>
<P>
   You don't entertain at home as often.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, you spend more time each week watching ``Friends''
than making them.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a little more familiar?
</P>
<P>
   According to Harvard public policy Professor Robert Putnam, not
only are all of the above statements true, but they also threaten
the very well-being of American society.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's book, ``Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of
American Community,'' assembles a century's worth of research to
reveal just how disconnected we've become from our communities, our
neighbors and even our friends. The professor argues that ``social
capital'' _ the bonds between people _ is as important to a
productive society as an educated work force and efficient
factories. That is, the more we volunteer together, socialize
together and stand up for causes together, the more we learn to
trust one another and build strong civic foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, television, mobility, computers and economics, as
well as changes in family structure and age, have all contributed
to the growing gulf between individuals in the United States,
Putnam contends. As a result, Americans, especially younger
generations, now suffer from what he terms ``civic malaise.''
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Bowling Alone's'' debut in June, Putnam has crisscrossed
the country, speaking to TV and radio audiences and drawing
impressive crowds at public appearances _ 800 in Greensboro, N.C.;
1,000 in Manchester, N.H.; 500 in Hartford, Conn. His research has
undeniably hit a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guy in Montana and a woman from Pennsylvania said the
same thing,'' notes Putnam during a phone interview. `` `Professor,
you've described exactly my life. My mom was active and I would
love to be active, but I don't seem to be able to find the time or
ways to do that.' Or `My dad was active in the Moose Club, but I
don't want to belong to a funny hat organization.'''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's theory of disengagement first struck a chord in 1995,
when he published an article in the little-known Journal of
Democracy. (The title of the paper, and now the book, refers to the
fact that participation in league bowling decreased by more than 40
percent between 1980 and 1993, while individuals bowling increased
by 10 percent). The mainstream media somehow caught wind, and, as
Putnam writes, ``a deluge struck.'' The professor was invited to
Camp David by President Clinton and profiled in People magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Putnam believes that he had ``unwittingly articulated an
unease that had already begun to form in the minds of many ordinary
Americans,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics were at his heels, too. ``People said, `You
forgot about soccer leagues or reading groups or self-help
groups,''' Putnam recalls. So he went back to the data, looking for
evidence. ``To my shock,'' he says, he found that the original
article actually ``underestimated'' the extent to which Americans
have become disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   The disengagement that Putnam reveals ``is typical of what
sociologists are alarmed about in a post-modern society,'' notes
Howard Kurtz, a professor of sociology and criminal justice at
Oklahoma City University. ``We don't have the local soda shop
anymore where the kids hang out,'' he says. ``Today, people go to
the mall and consume.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz's own experience echoes Putnam's findings. When his
children were in school, he socialized with their friends' parents,
but his interactions outside of that were limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to a lot of people who just don't know anybody,'' he
says. ``I've lived in this house for the past five years, and the
gentleman across the street from me passed away, and I didn't even
know his name.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz attributes some of the disconnectedness to an increased
rationality among Americans. When making decisions about where we
live, how many children to have or whether to invite a stranger to
dinner, we use our heads more than our hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say you see a neighborhood kid who is doing something he
shouldn't be doing,'' Kurtz says. ``In the past you would have
said, `Hey, quit doing that.' Now, you think, `I better not say
anything to the boy because his parents might sue me,' or `The
police are supposed to take care of that.'''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of a show like ``Friends,'' he suggests, may be
due to our yearning for the kinds of deep, emotional bonds that the
characters seem to have _ the kind Americans take less and less
time to develop these days, according to Putnam.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Crain is a glaring exception. Sort of. Since moving to
Fort Worth in 1988, Crain has flexed her civic muscle almost
ceaselessly in local and national organizations. Ten years ago, at
age 27, she was the youngest member of the local League of Women
Voters and eventually became its president. She recently quit her
job as the city of Fort Worth Web master to start her own business
and work part time for Councilman Clyde Picht.
</P>
<P>
   But despite her exhaustive public involvement, Crain can't
remember the last time she chatted with her neighbors. If she
wanted to go shopping on the weekend, she admits, she wouldn't know
who to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no strong relationships,'' Crain says. ``Probably
because as a working mother there are so many social hours in a day
and you choose.''

<P>
   CVN-SHADOW _ PHILADELPHIA _ What evil lurks in the hearts of

   CVN-BLACKS _ PHILADELPHIA _ The Republican party says it's tired
of its age old image of being unfriendly toward minorities in
America. During this election cycle in particular, the party is
pushing African-American candidates in three congressional

African Americans active in the party say the GOP serves as a
better match toward traditional, conservative African-American
philosophies. (Eversley, Cox News Service)

yells into the phone plastered against my ear. ``A pox upon Martha
Stewart!'' Rather than ask what has tilted her day into a spell of

second while she thinks that one over. ``Who's that?'' she asks. I
knew she would. Gail's 12 years younger than I am. (Schuett, Cox

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ It was early in the a.m. and
something woke me. A sound. The faint plastic-on-plastic tap of
computer keys. It was only my daughter reacting to a federal court
order. Knowing she had only a day left to use Napster, she was up
late downloading the last few songs. Around the planet, a record
number of computer users were hooked up to Napster. (Lane, Daytona

credit line of $1 million. (Paul, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   OBESITY-WOMEN _ Obese women avoid going to the doctor because
they're overweight and know they'll just get a lecture to lose
weight. This despite the fact that they're at high risk for cancer
and heart disease and other problems because they are overweight.
Obesity is the only life-threatening health condition doctors don't
try to treat effectively: usually they send women home with a
admonition to lose weight, but no effective means to do it. What
overweight consumers need to know to get the health care they need
from doctors. (Lore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTO

FALL TV: WHERE DID OUR BUZZ GO?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ If anything can be gleaned from the recently
concluded broadcast network/press mating dance, where networks,
studios, producers and stars pumped every new project as the next
groundbreaking phenomenon, it's that the promotion departments of
the big four networks have their work cut out for them.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz concerning the upcoming fall season will have to be
manufactured because for the first time in a long time the buzz is
about the lack of it. Of the 30 or so pilots screened during the
12-day network portion of the Critics Press Tour, only NBC's
``Ed,'' a whimsical, lighthearted male take on ``Providence,'' and
``Gilmore Girls,'' a disarmingly effective drama about a
mother-daughter relationship slated for the WB, showed enough
promise that they may, at some point anyway, turn into solid
dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Bette Midler's ``Bette,'' on CBS, Andre Braugher's ``Gideon's
Crossing'' and Geena Davis' ``The Geena Davis Show,'' both on ABC,
and a remake of ``The Fugitive'' (CBS), starring former ``Wings''
star Tim Daly, arrived as the most-discussed series only to lose
steam quickly after the pilots were deemed less than spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Braugher's ``Gideon's Crossing,'' featuring the Emmy-winning
actor as a devoted doctor at a teaching hospital, ``looked''
gorgeous and so wanted to prove its unconventionality that it
opened with a nearly three-minute conversation between a doctor and
patient, the camera remaining tightly on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   So high-minded is ``Gideon's Crossing'' that viewers will be
asked to sit and ``listen'' to what this series has to say, which
often hinges on medicine as a kind of spiritually edifying
profession. That's ambitious and refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Gideon's Crossing,'' featuring a nice variety of new
faces, is so thoughtful and quiet, and moves at such a snail's pace
that viewers conditioned to the shoot-from-the-hip style of ``ER''
may very well abandon it by the 30-minute mark. Not by reaching for
the remote, but by dozing off.
</P>
<P>
   Just as lethargic was Davis' sitcom about a career woman who
falls for a widower and his two kids. Peter Horton
(''thirtysomething'') is the dad, and plays him as though he's got
a gun at his back.
</P>
<P>
   At least Davis had a pilot. Michael Richards, the first
``Seinfeld'' star to return to weekly TV, and John Goodman
(''Roseanne''), met with critics but came empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Richards' sitcom, ``The Michael Richards Show'' on NBC, about a
bumbling detective named Vic, is being retooled, which is never a
good sign. He became defensive when a reporter brought up the
infamous big-star disaster _ Nathan Lane's ``Encore! Encore!'' _
and spent most of the night at a post-press-conference party
pleading his case to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, who is so uncomfortable with interviews that all he did
was grunt, let his producers talk for him. They didn't say much,
except that they are still trying to find a title for the series,
let alone figure out how they will approach the star's character,
who is a gay man trying to patch things up with his son. (He was
married at some point.)
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of trouble is the continued decline of David E.
Kelley (''Ally McBeal,'' ``The Practice''), who, after giving us
the dreadful, unfocused ``Snoops'' last season, could have his
second consecutive bomb. ``Boston Public,'' a Fox series that
explores the work lives of teachers, is far more over-the-top than
the usual thoughtful or intelligently quirky dramas Kelley
develops.
</P>
<P>
   There are some nice touches _ it is, after all, Kelley _ but
critics lashed out at the writer/producer in uncharacteristic
fashion, wondering why he decided to take the easy way out by
portraying a school as a war zone.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode we screened, a teacher sick of being bullied by
students fires a gun in class; the principal, played by Chi
McBride, slams a student into a locker; and another teacher spends
most of the episode running up and down the halls, screaming that
she can no longer take the profession.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley dismissed every notion that he was relying on stereotypes
to make his case, and grew downright angry when it was pointed out
that he spent his Boston years in private schools before going to
Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's ridiculous to think that I have no knowledge
whatsoever of public schools,'' Kelley said afterward. ``Should I
only be allowed to write about the law?'' (The next day, students
from a Chicago area high school filmed for the documentary series
``American High'' called the pilot ``kinda stupid.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston Public'' wasn't the only series to stir controversy.
The pilot of ``The District,'' a CBS series starring Craig T.
Nelson as a newly hired police commissioner of Washington, D.C.,
focused on the commissioner wiping the city clean of incompetent or
corrupt black officials.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot prompted a heated exchange between producers and a
black reporter that didn't stop until black actress Lynne Thigpen
nearly leaped out of her seat to scream, ``You cannot ask every
black actor or every writer to write icons _ to write only
representations of the black community!''
</P>
<P>
   The reporter agreed, but said that neither should television
constantly ask writers to make African-Americans the villains.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who had remained silent through it all, said: ``Geez, we
never got this kind of discussion about `Coach,' &UR; '' referring to
the sitcom about a football coach. ``I think it's going to be an
interesting year.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be. NBC's mid-September broadcast of the Summer
Olympics will push back the official start of the 2000-2001 season
to October, but expect some networks like UPN to debut some series
in August and September. Another oddity compared with years past is
that there's simply less new programming.
</P>
<P>
   With two movie nights, ``Monday Night Football'' and four hours
of ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire,'' ABC had room for just 2 1/2
hours of new fare. Its Saturday night ``Thrillogy'' having failed,
NBC is resorting to movies. That means there are just 31 new shows
this fall on the six networks, down significantly from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Comedies are in short supply, which proves again that the sitcom
format is going through a serious drought, although David Alan
Grier could have a breakthrough with NBC's ``DAG,'' if the writing
improves. Grier, who plays a secret service agent guarding the
first lady (Delta Burke), was hilarious during his panel discussion
_ humor that, thus far, has not translated on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Additional episodes will reveal whether The WB's ``Gilmore
Girls,'' which has the makings of a terrific family series, has the
heart, prickly edges and good, frank writing that's evident in the
pilot. Having lost WGN's stable of stations, The WB is down in
audience numbers from last season and is now behind UPN in total
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   UPN's best bet is ``Girlfriends,'' a sassy, quickly paced comedy
about four black women.
</P>
<P>
   Which brought to mind ``Spike Girls,'' the drama about female
cops going undercover as beach volleyball players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't bring myself to (B.S.) you,'' UPN president and CEO
Dean Valentine said, after trying to come up with a more diplomatic
answer. Finally, he said what many reporters were feeling about
much of what we'd seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just bad.''

 UNDATED: and you choose. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And more and more Americans are choosing to remain uninvolved,
Putnam argues. Venerable national clubs and organizations such as
the Lions, Masons, PTA, NAACP, American Legion and the American
Association of University Women have been bleeding membership since
their peaks (most often before 1960).
</P>
<P>
   The Rotary Club of Fort Worth _ the third-largest Rotary Club in
the world _ has managed to buck the trend: The club is down only 38
members since its peak membership of 735 in 1989-1990. But that's
changing. A 10 percent drop in membership annually is average for
most Rotary clubs, says the Fort Worth club's executive director,
Neva Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rotary the world over is declining in membership,'' Williams
acknowledges. ``It's a real issue, and everybody is trying to find
the right key to work.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   No one factor has caused Americans to disengage, but Putnam sees
the main culprit as this: The postwar generations are simply less
community-oriented than their parents and grandparents. They're
more materialistic, less patriotic, more cynical and less
politically interested, according to the mountains of data that
Putnam researched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is the experience of living through the great
national challenge of (World War II). That formed the grandparents
in a way that none of us has ever been exposed to,'' says Putnam.
War is obviously not a solution, he stresses, ``but we do need to
find some, I think, moral equivalent of that _ some challenge that
younger generations will feel unites us.''
</P>
<P>
   The generations are divided by more than wartime experience.
Kids today have to deal with questions of sexuality, drugs and
careers much sooner than their parents did, notes Joyce Williams,
chairman of the department of sociology and social work at Texas
Woman's University in Denton. ``Because of exposure to the media,
the Internet and movies, young people are more sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   And probably more cynical. They're certainly less trusting, the
research shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to teach kids how to not trust strangers for their own
protection,'' Williams adds, ``but on a certain level, we teach
them not to trust anybody because we want them to survive.''

   Of her grown children, both in their 20s, Neva Williams says,
``They have a different feel than my generation did. School spirit
was nothing to them and to me it was everything. ... Outside of
work, they're not as involved (in the community).''
</P>
<P>
   Neva Williams, who thrived on the interactions dorm life
provided during her college years, was surprised to find that ``the
big thing'' for her daughter's generation was to room alone _ and,
if possible, not in the dorm.
</P>
<P>
   And what of our physical surroundings? Is it possible that strip
malls and freeways have contributed to civic disengagement and
social isolation? Putnam allows that metropolitan sprawl is a
factor, but other cultural observers are far more adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I see it, the central issue is that we have turned
virtually every town in America into a place that is no longer
worth caring about,'' says James Howard Kunstler, the author of
1996's ``Home From Nowhere.'' Kunstler has for nearly a decade been
one of the most outspoken critics of suburban development. In his
opinion, the insidious effects of ugliness can't be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   In Kunstler's utopia, stately architecture would replace the big
box aesthetics of Wal-Mart and Target. Wide sidewalks, public
transportation and mixed-use developments would encourage people to
leave their cars behind. And the rebirth of the public space would
inspire citizens to reclaim their civic voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing we call the public realm is also the physical
container of our civic life,'' Kunstler stresses. ``It is the
dwelling places of our community life ... and when you degrade it
and turn it into a universal car slum, you injure and degrade the
quality of our collective civic life.''
</P>
<P>
   TWU's Williams believes Putnam may be overstating the extent of
disengagement. Like some of Putnam's strongest critics, she
suggests that the professor's findings may be too focused on the
lifestyles of white, middle-class and upper-middle-class
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demographic changes in the population are probably more
important than he made them out to be,'' she says. ``With the
influx of Southeast Asians and continual growth and migrations of
the Latino population, we're just more culturally diverse, and it's
hard sometimes to build common bridges across those kinds of
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Crain is less optimistic. She recently traveled as part of a
U.S. State Department delegation to Skopje, Macedonia, to aid the
process of democratization and was asked by members of the local
women's union about voter turnout in Fort Worth. So she told them.
In the May school-board and crime-district election, less than 5
percent of eligible voters went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The women were horrified, says Crain, who thinks she knows why
so few citizens showed interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think, `I'm not hungry, I'm not angry, my quality of
life is not threatened, so my participation is irrelevant,''' she
says. ``We're a consumer society, and until something impinges on
our ability to freely consume, we'll stay apathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam did discover one positive trend that goes against the
grain. The research seems to show that, in the 1990s, teens and
people in their early 20s volunteered substantially more than in
generations past. He's planning a national summit for later this
year, Old Guard Meets Vanguard, as an opportunity for civic-minded
young leaders to connect with and learn from older generations. His
Web site, www.BowlingAlone.com, provides a forum for what Putnam
hopes will evolve into a national debate about re-engaging the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, my role is to be sounding an alarm and say to
people, `This isn't your problem, it's our problem (as a society),'
'' he says. ``There are enormous strengths in this country. It's
not that we don't have problems, but there is a lot of really
creative thought going on about how to fix this, and I'm learning
myself.''

HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT NO. 2 SPOT?
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a funny thing about vice presidential nominations. Hardly
any politician professes to want the office; yet few have ever
turned it down when it's actually offered.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's nod to Richard Cheney is a case in point. So,
quite possibly, will be Vice President Al Gore's selection of a
running mate. Don't be surprised if it, too, produces someone who's
indicated previously that he had no interest in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Often the vice presidential selection is part of an effort to
balance the ticket for broader voter appeal. Bush's teaming up with
Cheney offers no geographic diversity, but it does provide an
otherwise missing dimension of Washington experience.
</P>
<P>
   In that, it's reminiscent of Bill Clinton's choosing Al Gore, or
Jimmy Carter's picking then-Sen. Walter Mondale. Mondale of
Minnesota did bring a Northern balance to the ticket headed by a
Southern governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-Cheney combination offers American voters two Texas
oilmen. What it adds to Bush's self-description as a
``compassionate conservative'' is a heavy emphasis on the latter
word.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could doubt Cheney's credentials as a thoroughgoing
conservative. His opposition to clean-air and clean-water
legislation offers a clue, his closing of military hospitals
another.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has opposed even the mildest forms of gun control, such
as bans on armor-piercing bullets or imported plastic handguns that
foil metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   He has voted against Head Start, the Equal Rights Amendment,
college assistance grants _ even against childhood inoculations. He
wants to abolish the Education Department. In recession years, he
opposed extending unemployment compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney is no moderate.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush were trying to attract moderates, an obvious choice
would have been Sen. John McCain. Bush seems more comfortable with
Cheney, who reassures the right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we shouldn't give the selection and its ideological bent
too much credence in predicting the election's outcome. Franklin D.
Roosevelt was overwhelmingly elected four times, picking three vice
presidents with practically nothing in common. Where might we find
three more disparate personalities than John Nance Garner, Henry
Wallace and Harry Truman?
</P>
<P>
   Historically, vice presidential nominees have had very little
impact on presidential elections. Only once in modern times has a
vice presidential choice probably made a crucial difference in the
results.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1960, when John Kennedy's selection of Lyndon B.
Johnson arguably brought Texas and enough other Southern states
into the Democratic column to capture the prize in that close
contest.
</P>
<P>
   There are several instances when the losing vice presidential
nominee seemed better known and more popular than the winner
(Sargent Shriver vs. Spiro Agnew in 1972, for example, or Lloyd
Bentsen vs. Dan Quayle in 1988.) Voters were focused on the top of
the ticket. They wanted Richard Nixon instead of George McGovern,
George Bush instead of Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   So just how important is the vice presidency, or the person who
occupies it? Only as important as the president wants it to be?
Garner, after serving as vice president, said the job wasn't worth
``a bucket of warm spit.'' Johnson, while in that office, once told
me that he considered being in the House or Senate a much more
effective and desirable position.
</P>
<P>
   When business interests implored William McKinley to embrace
Theodore Roosevelt as his vice presidential nominee, it wasn't to
magnify Roosevelt's influence; it was to get the popular young
trustbuster out of their hair as governor of New York. The vice
presidency seemed a harmless post to chain him to.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, news people asked President Eisenhower to name one
prominent national accomplishment of his vice president, Richard
Nixon, during their eight years in office. The old general replied,
with what seemed like uncharacteristic tactlessness, that if they'd
give him a week he might think of something.
</P>
<P>
   Then why all the flap about who gets the nod? Just how important
is the vice presidential choice? Important enough to stop and
reflect that we might be electing a president without realizing
that we are.
</P>
<P>
   Five men in the 20th century (Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin
Coolidge, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford) became
president simply by being vice president when a presidential
vacancy occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Try to imagine how differently history might have played out if
Roosevelt had died with Garner or Wallace, instead of Truman, in
the No. 2 spot. It staggers the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Vice presidents are important, not because they affect elections
but because they could affect history.
</P>

PROFITING OFF OTHERS' LOSS

<P>
   Foot scrapings from ``railroad killer'' Angel Maturino Resendiz:
$9.99.
</P>
<P>
   Crime-scene photos of Charles Manson murder victim Sharon Tate:
$62.
</P>
<P>
   A letter written by Darlie Routier, the convicted child killer
from Rowlett: $20.
</P>
<P>
   On eBay and other online auction sites, so-called
``murderabilia'' can create the same kind of bidding frenzy as
Beanie Babies or Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   But the practice has drawn the wrath of some victims' rights
advocates, who contend that it is wrong for the sellers to make
money off the notoriety of brutal crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're of the opinion they shouldn't go out and murder, rape
and rob and then turn around and make a profit off it,'' said Andy
Kahan, director of the Mayor's Crime Victims Assistance Office in
Houston. ``From a victim's perspective, I can't think of anything
more nauseating and disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   To persuade others to join in the fight, Kahan has purchased
dozens of items on eBay, including hair samples of Maturino
Resendiz and letters from Henry Lee Lucas, who was on Texas' Death
Row until his sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1998. He
shows his collection during seminars and speeches because he says
displaying the items is more powerful than merely talking about the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are surprised to learn that such sales are legal, he
said. In 1991, New York's so-called Son of Sam law, enacted to curb
profiting from crime after New York serial killer David Berkowitz
was offered numerous book deals during the late 1970s, was struck
down by the Supreme Court. That decision cast into question similar
laws in other states, Kahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with eBay, based in San Jose, Calif., said they don't
plan to prohibit the sales of such items unless they violate prison
regulations or state law. But the company also does not want the
site used as a means to profit from the notoriety of a crime or to
promote violence, said Rob Chesnut, the company's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, regulating the site is difficult because eBay does not
review items before they are put up for bid, Chesnut said. The
company has more than 4.5 million items up for auction on any given
day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a forum that people use to sell items,'' he said. ``We
don't review items. We don't possess items. People simply place an
item out on the site.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the company does not plan to fight legislation that
would limit the sale of crime-related items, proposed restrictions
present some interesting questions, Chesnut said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, should eBay be prohibited from selling items from
a convicted burglar? What about a killer's autobiography?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing everything we can to bring the issue out,'' said
Kahan, who will push Texas lawmakers next year to pass a bill
similar to one being considered in California that would seize the
profits made by a criminal or a third party from crime-related
items.
</P>
<P>
   Banning the practice may be difficult. The Washington State
Court of Appeals recently ruled that former schoolteacher Mary Kay
Letourneau, who was convicted of child rape after becoming pregnant
by a 13-year-old student, may earn royalties from books, movies and
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the American Civil Liberties Union, who have
spoken against California's bill, said they would generally oppose
such a regulation because it infringes on First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government shouldn't be in the business of regulating bad
taste,'' said Michael Linz, a Dallas lawyer who is a cooperating
attorney with the ACLU. ``They should allow free commerce unless
that commerce is somehow going to be shown directly to injure
people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the criminals get any money from the sale
of such items. Although Kahan said he has seen letters from some
criminals asking that money from the sales be placed in their
prison accounts, he also received a letter from a man who was angry
that items related to his crime were being sold without his
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Darlie Routier's attorney Stephen Cooper said he does not
believe his client had any idea that one of her letters would be
sold on eBay. The item, described as a handwritten letter
``beautifully written by Darlie,'' appeared briefly on eBay
recently from a seller with the user ID ``Supernaught.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper speculated that Routier, a prolific letter writer, may
have responded to a letter of support from the seller, not knowing
it would be sold on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darlie is doing nothing to make money off her predicament, I
can guarantee you that,'' Cooper said. ``I field all the offers. I
turn them down at her specific and unwavering instruction, and
we've had a lot of money thrown her way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Supernaught'' did not respond to an e-mail request for an
interview. But the seller is one of the most active in
crime-related items, with more than 1,000 listings in the past
month, most related to crime. He recently sold footage of the
Columbine school shooting for $14.95 and serial-killer letters for
$5 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Robison, the mother of recently executed Texas killer Larry
Robison, said she is certain that her son never authorized the sale
of a poem that appeared on eBay in January, about the time of his
execution.
</P>
<P>
   The poem was probably copied from Robison's Web site, said Lois
Robison, who believes she has the original copy at her home in
Burleson, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had everything he wrote copyrighted so no one could use it.
It appalls me people would try to benefit from that, to use it in a
hurtful way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners are not supposed to give out hair or fingernail
samples, and letters glorifying their crimes would be intercepted,
said Larry Todd, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice. In May, prison officials had to intervene when a Death Row
inmate who killed three people tried to sell five seats to his
execution on eBay. The company quickly removed the listing.
</P>
<P>
   Kahan acknowledges that restricting the sales of such items
would present legal problems. But he thinks legislators will be
open to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that will always be challenged until the day
the earth ends,'' he said.

 &HT;    Future wrestling stars pay dues in 'indie' rings
 &HT;    By Andrew Chow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The leagues carry ominous-sounding names: Outlaw.
Hardcore. Violent.
</P>
<P>
   The performers' names sound even worse: Filthy the Clown.
Reckless Youth. Suicide Solution.
</P>
<P>
   And almost weekly somewhere in southwest Ohio, you can find them
in local gymnasiums, VFW halls and National Guard armories taking
punches, jumping off ring posts, sometimes even rubbing their
opponent's head on ropes laced with barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   All the while dreaming of one day becoming the next pro
wrestling superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never give up,'' said Phil ``Mr. Saturday Night'' Mamula
of Dayton, who wrestles with Unified Championship Wrestling, a
loose association of local wrestlers who put on shows. ``But it's
the same odds that an inner-city kid has of making it to the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of independent wrestling, a world of big
dreams and little money. For fans, ``indie'' wrestling is an
inexpensive, immediate alternative to professional wrestling
organizations such as the World Wrestling Federation and World
Championship Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independents are where all the big stars are coming
from,'' said J.L. Thrush, a former performer with Unified
Championship Wrestling. ``Like in the old days, you'd claw and
crawl your way up to the feds (major wrestling federations). It
takes a lot to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past five years, indie wrestling has taken off here
and elsewhere, growing with the popularity of professional
wrestling. And almost every weekend, hundreds of local spectators
pay about $10 to watch choreographed matches between their favorite
stars. Some performers are a pale reflection of their pro wrestling
counterparts; others, backed by years of training and practice,
come very close to measuring up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fighting,'' said a smiling 8-year-old Jacqueline
Wilkinson, who accompanied her uncle to a recent match at Piqua's
National Guard armory. ``But my mom and dad told me it's not
real.''
</P>
<P>
   The action may be orchestrated, but the dreams are real.
</P>
<P>
   ``In five years, I hope to be with one of the major wrestling
organizations ... on a national level with people who don't just do
this as a hobby,'' said Conley Stanley, a 23-year-old man who
performs as ``The Future'' Logan Caine.
</P>
<P>
   Pro wrestling is big business. Industry leader WWF recently
reported fourth-quarter income of almost $13 million, thanks to
merchandising, live events and cable TV shows that draw millions of
viewers several times each week.
</P>
<P>
   The independent scene is much different, organized mainly by
die-hard fans who take it upon themselves to find local talent,
venues and promotional opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Locally, we have a good, strong fan base,'' Mamula said. ``We
draw a crowd of 250 to 300 regularly, guaranteed, for every show.
I've seen as many as 3,000 at one show. It's all about how much
time you have to prepare and promote the show.''
</P>
<P>
   In Thrush's view, only a handful of wrestlers have what it takes
to make it to the top. Two Ohio candidates are Stanley and Chris
Spradlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them have hearts for the sport,'' Thrush said. ``It's
their talent _ their charisma, how they wrestle, the whole package.
If you don't have that, you won't amount to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   By day, Stanley is a mild-mannered clerk in a downtown Dayton
law office.
</P>
<P>
   By night, perhaps 11 times a month, Stanley dons a black
metallic spandex singlet and becomes the alter-ego local fans know
as ``The Future'' Logan Caine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel like Superman,'' said Stanley, as he prepped
for a show. ``I go from my day job, where I'm the low guy on the
totem pole, to the wrestling ring, where I'm the center of
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley knows first-hand what it takes to make it big. His big
brother, Al Sarven, is WWF star Al Snow, whose gimmick had him
taking orders from a severed mannequin head.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley ``is following in his big brother's footsteps,'' said
his mother, Alvada Stanley. ``Early on, Con could tell you the
stats of any wrestler you wanted to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers collected wrestling magazines and were avid fans of
wrestling on TV. As he grew older, Stanley played football and was
active in organized wrestling and Muse Machine, an arts awareness
organization. He talked with his father about becoming a pro
wrestler before breaking the news to his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me, I tried to discourage him,'' she said. ``But no
matter what I said, he was going to follow his heart to be a
wrestler. He has this natural ability to entertain.''
</P>
<P>
   Success in a wrestling career will be a struggle, she added,
``but I feel he's got the talent to go into one of the
federations.'' For now, Stanley is one of about 15 performers who
wrestle for Heartland Wrestling Association, a Cincinnati group
formed five years ago by former pro wrestler Les Thatcher. In
addition to organizing matches, Heartland runs a a six-month
training camp for aspiring wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ``Les Thatcher's Main Event Pro Wrestling Camp,'' the
camp is held in Heartland's gym in Cincinnati and offers supervised
training four days a week. The cost is $2,500. Students from around
the country and even Europe have completed their initial training
at the camp. This year, Heartland entered into a development
contract with the WCW, meaning the professional league will send
prospective talent to Thatcher's school for training.
</P>
<P>
   Over five years, the school has averaged about 50 students a
year, half of whom are from the greater Cincinnati and Dayton
areas, said Marty Adams, who in addition to working with Heartland
co-hosts a radio show Wednesday evenings.
</P>
<P>
   This year, enrollment has doubled, thanks to the WCW contract
and national exposure on MTV's ``True Life'' documentary series and
ABC's newsmagazine ``20/20 Downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In six months they get just the basics,'' Adams said. ``It
takes years and years and years of finding the right gimmick and
developing the right mike skills to get them to the level of
someone like (WWF star) Stone Cold Steve Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarven, for example, worked the indie circuit for about 12 years
before being discovered by Extreme Championship Wrestling and the
WWF, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Such success is the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything is possible, but the odds of that happening _ you
might as well go play the lotto,'' Adams said, noting a rising
number of wannabe pros. ``It's a very tough business to break into
nowadays.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling's popularity has brought critics, as well, who see a
tendency toward more and more violent extremes and worry about the
influence it might have on children. The May 1999 death of pro
wrestler Owen Hart, 34, who fell to his death during a wrestling
show, also focused media attention on the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Spradlin now primarily wrestles under the name Chris Hero,
having caught criticism and ridicule, as well as national
attention, with his first name, Wifebeater.
</P>
<P>
   Spradlin, 20, changed his name when a women's group in Wisconsin
raised the issue after seeing ``Wifebeater'' on a promotional ad.
Spradlin said the name was not intended to advocate domestic
violence, that it was derived from the white tank top undershirts,
sometimes called ``wifebeaters,'' he wears as his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   After the Wisconsin match, however, the name was the talk of
such TV shows as ABC's ``Politically Incorrect'' with Bill Maher
and MTV's ``The Tom Green Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Spradlin's mother, Mary Lou, concedes she never cared much for
the Wifebeater name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Chris, you're going to get a lot of static with
that,'' she said. ``But I loved (the attention). Just that little
bit of adversity led to untold coverage nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention has taken Spradlin around the country, garnering
him a spot with controversial rap group Insane Clown Posse on its
coast-to-coast ``Juggalo'' wrestling tour. Earlier this year,
Spradlin took his act overseas, where he taped several shows for a
German TV wrestling program.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Spradlin performs primarily in and around the Midwest,
most recently in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   His mom remembers accompanying her son on trips with his Boy
Scout group, including one outing to a pro wrestling show when
Spradlin was about 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just loved it,'' she said. ``We met several of the
wrestlers, and he spoke to them personally. I think that's where
the impetus was.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school in 1998, Spradlin spent $2,500
for training at a renowned wrestling camp in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He loves his sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can compare it to _ telling a story
through your actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it gets bad press and deserves it,'' he added, ``like
the groups in New Jersey that use weed wackers on people's
stomachs. That's just really bizarre. I didn't pay $2,500 to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, stunts that intentionally aim to cause bleeding injuries
_ known as ``extreme'' or ``hardcore'' wrestling _ have sometimes
gotten top billing on the local indie circuit as well.
</P>
<P>
   The need for shock value has driven some performers to land on
tacks, broken glass and tables _ stunts both Spradlin and Stanley
say they just don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff hurts. I don't do any of that,'' Stanley said. ``To
make someone buy your match, you don't have to cut yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The extreme wrestling audience ``wants to see entertainment.
Wrestling is secondary,'' Adams said. ``There has to be a line
drawn, especially with kids not having proper training and trying
to do these kinds of things. That's the worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Many wrestlers say they are keenly aware of the influence they
have on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what makes it possible _ fans and kids,'' said
wrestler T.J. Powers, 40, as he signed autographs for eager young
fans at a recent show. Powers, his wife and their five children
live in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Powers, part of the ``High Rollers'' indie wrestling tag-team,
said the business ``has gotten crazier'' since he began performing
18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes down to the independents, it's a whole different
world,'' Powers said. ``You might have to travel five, six hours to
make little or nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoters, too, stand to gain little from local indie shows,
which can cost between $1,500 and $2,000 to put on, Adams said.
Ticket prices are typically between $5 and $10, with attendance
ranging from 50 to as many as 700, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indie wrestlers, meanwhile, are usually paid between $25 and
$75.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the independent scene, if you're running the operation
right, you have to pay insurance and a state (athletic) commission
fee, and have your own professional ring and truck,'' Adams said.
``A lot of shows, by the time all your expenses are paid, you're
left with only a couple hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be in it for the money,'' he continued. ``It's a
labor of love for us.''

VIRUS-BASED TREATMENT FOR CANCER ADVANCES IN TRIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif.)  (Science Times) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A novel form of cancer treatment, based on a defective virus
that can grow only in cancerous cells, has passed another milestone
by showing promise in treating patients with recurrent head and
neck cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is based on a deep insight into the nature of
cancer cells and will, if it works, become one of the first
practical contributions to cancer therapy of the theoretical
knowledge that has long been accumulating.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, known as Onyx-015, has been used in a Phase 2
clinical trial, a test in which a small number of patients are
treated.
</P>
<P>
   A larger number of patients are now being recruited for a final,
Phase 3 trial, which will determine whether the treatment is
effective enough for clinical practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Phase 2 results, reported in Tuesday's issue of Nature
Medicine, involved 30 patients with head and neck cancer, most of
whom had already failed surgery or radiation treatments. Patients
in whom this kind of cancer recurs are considered incurable.
</P>
<P>
   In 63 percent of the patients treated with a combination of
Onyx-015 and chemotherapy, the tumors shrank by 50 percent or more,
and in eight of these 19 responding patients the tumors disappeared
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treated patients at seven different centers and we all saw
some pretty striking results,'' said Dr. Fadlo R. Khuri of the
University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston,
speaking for himself and the other physicians involved in the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Khuri described himself as ``cautiously optimistic'' about the
treatment, but said a larger trial was necessary. ``Many things
look wonderful in Phase 2 but not in Phase 3,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The trial has confirmed that Onyx-015 grows and replicates in
cancer cells but apparently not in the ordinary cells of the body.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many features of the virus' behavior that remain
to be understood. In Phase 1 tests, Onyx-015 given by itself had
lasting effects in only 15 percent of head and neck cancer
patients. The reason may be that the cancers are solid tumors,
infiltrated by normal cells, and in many cases injections of the
virus may not have reached all parts of the tumors.
</P>
<P>
   A lesson from the Phase 1 tests was that the virus was much more
effective when given in combination with chemotherapy. In the Phase
2 trial, patients received chemotherapy to the whole body while the
tumors were injected directly with the virus. The cause of death in
most patients was from other tumors that could not be injected.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Everett E. Vokes, a head and neck cancer specialist at the
University of Chicago, said that the survival time of the patients
in the study was ``very encouraging.'' Onyx-015, he added is a
``very promising, intriguing, genetically based agent.'' He
suggested that the virus and the chemotherapy might be effective in
combination because the virus was killing the cells in the center
of the tumors while the chemotherapy was attacking those on the
periphery, which the virus did not reach.
</P>
<P>
   Another head and neck cancer specialist, Dr. David Pfister of
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said the Onyx-015 concept
was important but that a larger trial was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the virus to attack tumors was conceived of by Dr.
Frank McCormick, now director of the University of California at
San Francisco Cancer Center. McCormick is a co-founder of a
company, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, that supplies the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The first trials were with head and neck cancer because the
virus was expected to work particularly well with that type of
tumor. McCormick now believes the virus may be able to infect
almost all types of cancer cell. Other trials of Onyx-015 are now
in progress with liver metastases, ovarian and pancreatic cancer,
and general advanced cancers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Onyx-015 is an adenovirus, one of the causes of the common cold,
with a damaged gene. In a normal adenovirus, this gene swings into
action as soon as the virus has entered a cell and makes a product
that inactivates a vital cell component called the p53 protein. The
role of p53 is to prevent a cell from dividing if its DNA is
damaged or if the cell is under viral attack.
</P>
<P>
   In many types of cancer cells, the p53 gene is damaged by
mutation. McCormick's insight was to realize that though Onyx-015
could not grow in normal cells, because it could not inactivate
their p53 protein, it could grow in cancer cells that had already
disabled their own p53 gene.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the defective virus was in principle the
long-sought agent that could discriminate between normal and
cancerous cells, killing only the latter.
</P>
<P>
   One puzzle with tests of Onyx-015 is that the virus kills cancer
cells with an intact p53 gene as well as its expected target, the
cells with mutated p53 genes. McCormick believes he now knows the
reason, which is that all cancer cells have to inactivate the p53
protein in one way or another or the tumor cannot grow. Some tumor
cells develop mutations in the p53 gene itself, but others
inactivate the p53 protein indirectly: they sabotage a second gene
whose product, called p14, is required by the cell to keep the p53
protein in active state.
</P>
<P>
   ``P14 now explains perfectly a major difficulty which we
couldn't understand,'' McCormick said. Onyx-015 may therefore be
effective against a wide range of tumor types, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   A commentary in Nature Medicine hails the new Onyx-015 result as
a victory for the beleaguered field of gene therapy. But the two
concepts are quite different. In gene therapy new genes are
inserted into cells, often using a virus as the vector to deliver
the genes. Onyx-015 is not a vector and carries no extra genes.
``It's not gene therapy, it's completely opposite,'' McCormick
said.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the commentary, Dr. W. French Anderson, a gene
therapist at the University of Southern California, said he viewed
the two methods as related because they were handled by the same
regulatory committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Phase 2 head and neck cancer trial is the most advanced of
the various tests of Onyx-015 now under way. Though promising, the
small number of patients is not yet proof it works. Still, the
results were impressive to Khuri. ``I work in an area where you
don't cure many people. You learn to relish the victories and this
one had a few more victories than usual.''

 &HT;    Veteran wrestling announcer dies
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sad news hit the professional wrestling community on past Friday
when long-time announcer Gordon Solie was found dead in his New
Port Richey, Fla., home. Solie, 71, died of brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of wrestling fans in Florida and Georgia, Solie
was the voice of professional wrestling. He was the lead announcer
for Championship Wrestling from Florida from 1960-87, and Georgia
Championship Wrestling from 1980 until it became World Championship
Wrestling in 1993. It was at Georgia Championship Wrestling that
Solie's career took off as the show was telecast throughout the
United States on Ted Turner's superstation TBS.
</P>
<P>
   Solie was know for his scratchy voice and vivid descriptions of
the mayhem in the ring. But it was that scratchy voice, the result
of many years of smoking. Smoking put an end to Solie's career in
1993 after he underwent surgery for throat cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wrestling Federation continues to beat down World
Championship Wrestling. In WCW's backyard _ Atlanta _ the WWF will
have a larger crowd for Monday's ``Raw is War'' than WCW had for a
recent ``Nitro.''

   PATTERNS: Antibiotics, When Patients Want Action
</P>
<P>
   The desire of patients for a tangible outcome from a trip to the
doctor and the desire of harried doctors to move on to the next
patient are two of the most powerful factors behind the misuse of
antibiotics, according to a study by researchers at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that culture and economics play a large role in the
overconsumption of antibiotics in this country,'' said Dr. Jerry
Avorn, the lead author of the survey article, which appeared last
month in The Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   By prescribing antibiotics, a doctor signals to a patient that
the condition is treatable and that the patient is being cared for,
Avorn wrote. ``This perspective helps to explain the `drug hunger'
that many symptomatic patients bring to the physician visit, which
they feel satisfied only by receiving a prescription.''
</P>
<P>
   For doctors feeling the time constraints of managed care,
writing such prescriptions, even for conditions they suspect are
viruses (and not affected by bacteria-killing drugs), is an
effective way to bring an office visit to a close without
disappointing or angering patients, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Add the pressure from drug companies advertising and consumers
stressing the need for the latest in drugs, and ``it is not
surprising that the small voice of therapeutic restraint and
concern about microbial resistance is so difficult to hear above
the din.''
</P>
<P>
   PROGNOSIS: A Higher Risk for Babies Born at Night
</P>
<P>
   Very few babies die during the first week of life. But for some
reason, the risk is higher for babies born during the night than
those born during the day, according to a German study published on
Friday in The British Medical Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by researchers at the Phillips University of Marburg,
reviewed records from nearly 400,000 normal, low-risk deliveries in
an effort to substantiate similar findings from earlier studies in
Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Daytime births, defined as those between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m.,
outnumbered night births by 231,939 to 148,991.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-seven of those infants died in the first week of life. But
the death rate for night-born babies was close to twice that of
daytime deliveries. When the field was narrowed to infants who died
of asphyxia, the difference in mortality rates was close to four
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a result of staff's increased physical and mental
fatigue during the night,'' the researchers wrote. ``Overreliance
on less experienced staff may be another important reason.''
</P>
<P>
   CONSEQUENCES: Clues to Ecstasy's Effects on Addicts
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy of the brain of a chronic abuser of the drug ecstasy
suggests that it may work by causing violent fluctuations in the
brain chemical serotonin, according to a report last week in
Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   Animal studies of ecstasy, an amphetamine derivative, have found
it can trigger a sudden release of serotonin, which has a powerful
effect on mood. Dr. S.J. Kish of the Center for Addiction and
Mental Health in Toronto said users of the drug reported increased
awareness of emotion and heightened feelings of intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers led by Kish compared serotonin levels of the
brains of 11 people who had not used drugs with those in the brain
of a man who had died at age 26 after using ecstasy heavily since
the age of 17. ``The levels of serotonin and another chemical
associated with serotonin were 50 to 80 percent lower in the brain
of the ecstasy user,'' Kish said. ``This is the first study to show
that this drug can deplete the level of serotonin in humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy users commonly appear lethargic and depressed after the
drug wears off, including the addict in the study, whose friends
said he appeared depressed and had slow speech and reaction time
after binges.
</P>
<P>
   Further research, Kish said, may show whether supplementing
serotonin levels might help those seeking to go through withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   PERCEPTIONS: Man, Superman, Clark Kent and Woman
</P>
<P>
   A new study of male body images found that the average young man
wants to look like Superman and thinks that women want men to look
like Superman, while women really want men to look like Clark Kent.
</P>
<P>
   The study, in the August issue of The American Journal of
Psychiatry, focuses on what researchers call ``muscle dysmorphia,''
a syndrome in which men become obsessed with fears that they are
small and frail _ in many ways the flip side of anorexia nervosa.
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by Dr. Harrison Pope of the McLean Hospital in
Boston, sought to compare the responses of 200 young men in Boston,
Paris and Innsbruck, Austria, who were not bodybuilders, to get a
sense of how they compared their perceptions of their own bodies to
an ideal.
</P>
<P>
   The men were shown an image of a male body on a computer screen
and asked to alter it in terms of fat and muscle until it reflected
first, their own bodies, second, how they would like their bodies
to look, and finally, the body type they thought women found most
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, their images of their own bodies were roughly
accurate, Pope wrote. But that does not mean they like them. In all
three countries, the ideal body type chosen carried an average of
28 pounds of muscle more than the men possessed. And on average,
the men supposed that women would like an additional two pounds of
muscle on top of that.
</P>
<P>
   But when the researchers asked women to use the same device to
select the ideal male body type, what they came up with ``a very
ordinary looking male body.''
</P>
<P>
   HYPERTENSION: When the White Coats Befuddle Doctors
</P>
<P>
   Doctors call it ``white coat hypertension'' when a patient's
nervousness during an office visit results in a misleadingly high
blood pressure reading. But sometimes the opposite is true, and a
study published in The Archives of Family Medicine suggests that
more people than thought may be escaping diagnosis because of what
its authors called ``white coat normotension.''
</P>
<P>
   To test their theory, researchers from the University of British
Columbia and the University of Akron chose 319 people believed to
be healthy, and compared five office blood pressure measurements
with ambulatory measures, that is, readings taken away from the
office over a period of 10 to 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   They found that almost one in four of the patients had
white-coat normotension: Their ambulatory measures showed high
blood pressure that had not appeared in the office readings.
</P>
<P>
   These patients were more often men who were older, drank more
alcohol and included more ex-smokers than the group's average. But
the psychologists on the team were unable to identify any
definitive mental trait that would give a clue about who was at
risk for underdiagnosis or why.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggested that physicians should feel confident
only about office readings that were clearly at one end of the
scale or another. ``Given the apparently high prevalence rates of
both types of misdiagnoses, practitioners need to consider
seriously that between one-third and one-half'' of office blood
pressure readings are wrong, they wrote.

triumphant return to power here of the traditional mainstream
Republican establishment that was banished by Ronald Reagan's
ideologically driven troops 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is a younger, southwestern branch of the old eastern elite
that was dominated by Wall Street barons, Ivy League
internationalists and the well-bred GOP country club set where
Bush's father, the former president, and grandfather, a Connecticut
senator, had their political roots. And it is still full of former
Reagan backers, but they are now more practical than they
originally were. And not as noisy.
</P>
<P>
   The convention redirects the party away from the divisive social
issues and anti-government fervor of Reagan's tenure toward
familiar conservative economic policy that protects the interests
of the rich without terrifying the rest of the country.
Conversations with Reaganite delegates indicate they are supporting
Bush not out of devotion but out of a practical feeling that he
might actually win. The GOP has backed off the demand that
diversity die and that everyone fit into a single mold dictated by
the far right. We are back to pragmatism and compromise, thank
goodness. It is the only way to govern.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan era, in which governing seemed an afterthought, is
over.
</P>
<P>
   The old Repugblican establishment barely exists on the Eastern
seaboard any more. The likes of New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller
are ghosts of the past. GOP strength has shifted to the South and
West, where Bush is a perfect fit for the new GOP, a son of the
elite reborn in the new region, speaking a fresh tongue but filled
with the old values and a respect for big money and limited
government.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Reagan will be the guest of honor at a social event here
Tuesday but she will not deliver an emotional speech to cheering
delegates as she did at Bob Dole's 1996 convention, which was still
controlled by Reagan lieutenants. Mike Deaver, a Reagan White House
adviser, was quoted as saying she decided to leave her ailing
89-year-old husband to come to Philadelphia because she felt it
would be ``one of the last chances to keep the Reagan prairie fire
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   For the former first lady, it is too little too late. The fire
has gone out. There will be no Patrick Buchanan or Pat Robertson at
Bush's convention to stir up right-wing passions over so-called
``cultural wars'' against working women, ethnic minorities, gays,
immigrants and people who think they lead decent lives without
waving a Bible. Religious right followers still have enough
influence to force Bush to stick to the intolerant anti-abortion
position Reagan imposed on the party in 1980 as well as the newer
anti-gay stand. But that's about all they are getting here.
</P>
<P>
   Bush learned from his father's mistakes in losing his 1992
re-election bid and is imitating on the right President Clinton's
successful restructuring over the past eight years of a Democratic
Party that had moved too far to the left. Revenge is sweet,
particularly when you can bug the opposition with its own tactics.
It means putting a pretty face on a very conservative agenda. It
also means no controversy and a world of generalities.
</P>
<P>
   Bush claims to be a ``different kind of Republican.'' The
difference, however, is between himself and Reagan, not himself and
the Republican establishment that nurtured the elder Bushes. It is
a difference in style and emphasis more than one of conservative
outlook. The selection of former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney
exposed the right-wing core of a campaign that Bush is trying to
sell as one of reasonable moderation. Cheney, remember, incredibly
declared in 1994 in the face of the financial chaos in the health
care industry that ``there is no health crisis'' in America.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bush adopted the ``different kind'' line from Clinton,
who hid behind it during his own 1992 campaign. And Clinton
recognized the steal. ``That's the message isn't it?`` he scoffed
recently. ``Blur, blur, blur.'' It takes one to know one.
</P>
<P>
   The convention's pollyanna atmosphere is so bland, however, that
there is a great deal of talk about the declining importance of
this quadrennial event. It is meant to introduce Bush to all those
voters who haven't been paying attention to the campaign thus far.
And first impressions are indeed important.
</P>
<P>
   But he is bathed in such a rosy glow that we cannot really know
who he is, beyond the fact that he's not Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans eager to take back the White House, that is
enough. But the rest of us will still be left to wonder whether he
is just pulling a fast one.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Bush's ploy is smart politics. A dull convention
is a good convention from the nominee's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   But it drives the media nuts. The absence of news is not
wonderful for television ratings and newspaper sales. Heck, the
paid commericals being put out by both Democrats and Republicans
are more interesting than the convention speeches.
</P>
<P>
   So is this the last convention hurrah? Not since 1968 has a
convention had a good floor battle worth watching. In recent
decades the presidential nominees have been obvious long before the
delegates gathered.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still a purpose for the gathering. It's an
opportunity for like-minded political souls to commune with one
another, to rub elbows with their leaders and to feel a sense of
involvement in the coming crusade.
</P>
<P>
   A week is clearly becoming too long a stretch for this sort of
political socializing, however. Perhaps two days would suffice. One
day to review the platform and another to review the two
candidates. Maybe broadcast television, which has limited its
coverage to one hour each night, would rediscover the charms of
political discourse if there weren't so much of it. In this case,
less might be more.

A NEW ALTERNATIVE TO TONSILLECTOMIES: SHRINK, DON'T CUT
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is no longer routine, as it was in the 1950s, for children to
have their tonsils removed to prevent persistent infections. But
for the estimated 500,000 Americans who still do undergo
tonsillectomies each year, one thing has not changed: The procedure
is a painful one that leaves people with difficulty swallowing for
up to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Somnus Medical Technologies, a small medical device company
in Sunnyvale, Calif., has won Food and Drug Administration approval
for an alternative to tonsillectomy it claims will be less painful
and allow for a quicker recovery. The idea is to shrink the tonsils
rather than cut them out.
</P>
<P>
   Experts caution that the technique is still highly experimental
and not likely to be widely adopted until more testing is done.
</P>
<P>
   Tonsillectomies hurt because they leave a raw surface exposed
after the tonsils are cut out. A small percentage of patients
suffer from dehydration, because they cannot swallow for days, or
from postoperative bleeding. While newer techniques, like use of a
laser instead of a knife, have been developed for removing tonsils,
they have not done much to reduce pain or recovery time because
they still leave a surface exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Somnus' technique involves inserting tiny needle electrodes into
the tonsils to deliver radio frequency energy. The energy burns the
tissue in a controlled way, killing cells and causing the tonsils
to gradually shrink from within.
</P>
<P>
   This minimizes pain and bleeding, the company said. The
operation, which takes less than an hour, can be done under local
anesthesia, whereas tonsillectomies are often performed under
general anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done this procedure and people have gone back to work the
next morning, which is unheard of for a tonsillectomy,'' said Dr.
Lionel M. Nelson, an ear, nose and throat doctor in San Jose,
Calif., who is the medical director of Somnus. ``I had one guy eat
a sandwich a couple of hours after I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is not totally painless. Susan Holden, an
administrative assistant in San Jose who had the procedure
performed in late 1998, said it felt afterward as if she had strep
throat, with dry mouth and pain in talking or eating certain foods.
But she said the swollen tonsils she frequently endured before the
operation had not come back.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors express caution.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure has been tested only on adults, not children, who
account for about four-fifths of tonsillectomies. The company is
planning trials on children, but for them, the procedure would be
performed under general anesthesia, eliminating one of the
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Even for adults, only Nelson has tried the technique, and he has
performed it on 12 people. He has published one paper covering nine
patients who were followed after the operation for 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to follow up patients for several years to see if the
tonsils are going to regrow or not,'' said Dr. Nira Goldstein,
assistant professor of otolaryngology at the State University of
New York Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. She is a member of a
committee dealing with tonsils for the American Academy of
Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, since Somnoplasty, as it is called, does not
completely remove the tonsils, it might not be applicable as a
treatment for recurrent tonsil infections. It would be used mainly
for people whose breathing is obstructed by enlarged tonsils,
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Such patients now roughly equal the number of patients who
undergo tonsillectomies to treat infections. While antibiotics have
reduced the problem of infections, there is growing awareness of
sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing is interrupted numerous
times at night, putting a strain on the heart and making it
difficult to get a restful night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Somnoplasty is already used to treat sleep apnea and snoring by
shrinking the tongue, nasal tissue or the soft palate. But
Goldstein and others said since there was an extra risk in using
the procedure on tonsils because they are very close to the carotid
artery, which carries blood to the brain. Doctors must be certain
the vibrations caused by the radio frequencies will not harm that
artery.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lawrence W.C. Tom, an otolaryngologist at Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia, who is also a member of the academy
tonsil panel, said Nelson's scientific study was ``very limited.''
But he added, ``If it works as they say it does, it has a lot of
potential.''

PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN MEANS LITTLE TO RESIDENTS OF BORDER COLONIAS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JAY ROOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ For the nation's political establishment, these
are exciting times. The nominating conventions are under way. Vice
presidential candidates are being picked and vetted. Ads are
hitting the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   But here in dusty Ranchitos 359, an impoverished ``colonia'' on
Texas 359 outside Laredo, convention fever has not taken hold.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as far as Dolores Estrada is concerned, Philadelphia and
the Republican National Convention might as well be on the moon.
She is equally unimpressed with the Democrats, despite their recent
claims that Gov. George W. Bush is to blame for the decades-old,
grinding poverty here.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada, 40, is more worried about her dwindling supply of
water, which she stores in four 55-gallon drums in front of her
house and refills every few days _ or whenever she can afford to
pay someone a few dollars to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she thought that a Bush presidency would bring
progress, Estrada said that she was unaware that he was even
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that until you told me just now,'' said Estrada,
whose children endure 105-degree temperatures without so much as a
fan. They have no electricity, no car. Their toilet is a foul and
sweltering closet that sits over a hole in the ground outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is (Bush) going to come here?'' she asked, expressing interest
only long enough to get in a word about her pressing needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush wants to be president, and he wants us to vote for
him,'' she said, ``he needs to bring us water.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not an uncommon refrain. Running water and sewer service
are a luxury in the state's 1,500 or so ``colonias,'' which,
translated from Spanish, means ``colony,'' or subdivision, and has
come to denote squalor.
</P>
<P>
   The 400,000 people who live in them are among the poorest
residents in the United States, virtually untouched by the
prosperity that is touted on the campaign trail and heralded on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Though major improvements have been made in the ``colonias''
over the last decade, progress has been slow in coming, and those
who live here suffer high rates of preventable disease,
particularly hepatitis, tuberculosis and a plethora of intestinal
maladies.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the nation enjoys historically low unemployment
rates, poverty and joblessness continue to run extremely high along
the border. Of the 10 most poverty-stricken counties in the United
States, four are located on the Texas-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Rosemary Welsh, a Laredo-based nun who is one of Webb
County's best-known advocates for ``colonia'' residents, said
elected leaders display a stunning lack of urgency to clean up the
pockets of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder why it just doesn't get done,'' said Welsh, who
oversees a clinic that provides care for ``colonia'' residents.
``You'd really think that we'd have water everywhere in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have used the wretched conditions along the border to
tar Bush, saying he should have done more to help ``colonia''
residents. The Democratic National Committee recently put out a
video on the ``colonias,'' complete with run-down shacks and
shabbily clad children. It is entitled, ``This Is George W. Bush's
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   But state Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, who has authored some of
the legislation addressing ``colonia'' issues, said the attacks are
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something you can just turn on a faucet and say it's
taken care of,'' Cuellar said. ``I've been dealing with the
``colonias'' for a long, long, long time, and I know the depth of
the problem is just the tremendous amount of dollars that we need
to address the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   SLOW PROGRESS: ``Colonias'' began to form during the 1950s, when
agriculture began to boom at the same time farmers and ranchers
largely quit providing housing to their laborers.
</P>
<P>
   For those seeking the dream of home ownership and escape from
high rents, a small lot could be purchased for about $50 down and
low monthly payments _ albeit with extremely high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Many were told by developers that water and sewer service would
be coming soon. It never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Now tens of thousands of residents must haul their own water,
sometimes from wells 10 or 20 miles away. Homes usually have
outdoor privies for bathrooms and cesspools to treat sewage, though
some residents can afford septic tanks, usually crudely made.
</P>
<P>
   State and local governments have stepped in with laws to halt
the growth of ``colonias''_ mostly by making it illegal to sell
small plots of land without water and sewer service _ and by
providing money to bring in water and septic lines.
</P>
<P>
   But the projects aren't cheap, and they don't get done
overnight. Among the challenges are obtaining easements on
``colonia'' roads, which the residents own. Turf battles between
city and county officials have also caused delays.
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly 10 years since a group of ``colonias'' in
Laredo's Webb County was designated as eligible for state water and
wastewater funding, said Webb County Commissioner Judith Gutierrez,
whose district includes many of the ``colonias.''
</P>
<P>
   She expects state water board officials to finally approve next
month a $23 million project to bring service to 15 ``colonias'' _ a
cost of about $18,000 per household.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even when the work is completed, half of the 48
``colonias'' in Webb County _ collectively containing about 17,000
people _ will still not have water or sewer service, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   For those not included in the project, Gutierrez said, funding
is ``not even on the radar screen right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the number of ``colonia'' residents continues
to grow, as many of them are driven from booming Laredo by
ever-rising housing costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've noticed that when we take house-to-house surveys from
one year to the next, the population is always different,'' said
Juan Vargas, Webb County's economic development director. ``And it
is always an increase.''

<P>
   Convinced that their elected representatives are in the pockets
of special interests, Americans in the 24 states that allow ballot
initiatives are trying to take the law into their own hands on
issues from bilingual education to universal health care.
</P>
<P>
   But the very legislators the citizen-lawmakers are trying to
circumvent are making it difficult for them to get their issues on
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Petition drives in various states have come up short of
legislative requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, the state's League of Women Voters recently abandoned a
two-year effort for a constitutional amendment that would prevent
politicians from gerrymandering congressional and Ohio General
Assembly districts.
</P>
<P>
   The League had marshaled a coalition of 14 organizations,
including the Ohio AFL-CIO, to gather the 335,000 signatures needed
for the amendment that would have given citizens instead of
politicians the power to draw new district lines after the 2000
Census.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to collect enough signatures last year, the League
redoubled its efforts to put the issue on the ballot this November.
</P>
<P>
   But the League quietly halted its initiative in June, saying
``it became apparent that the amount of funding needed to collect a
sufficient number of signatures and then to conduct a media
campaign for its passage was not forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's relatively stringent requirements for ballot initiatives
almost necessitate the hiring of paid signature gatherers at a rate
of up to $1.25 per valid signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a citizen's right to get something on the ballot, yet
it's so difficult to do it. How much of a right is it?'' asked Anne
Smead, past president of the League.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO reached the same conclusion on two other ballot
questions it had pledged to work for: whether women should be paid
the same as men for equal work and whether patients should be
allowed to sue HMOs. It was a decision that AFL-CIO spokesman Kent
Darr described as sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at the money we thought we would have to spend and
the money we thought would be spent against us, and we bailed
out,'' Darr said.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of Washington, health-care providers hoping to put
a proposal for universal health care on the ballot collected as
many as 12,000 signatures a week in the final stages of their drive
but fell short of the necessary 220,000 signatures. They are
starting again from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the legislature is in the pocket of the insurance
companies, doctors are in a bad place, and patients are in a bad
place,'' said Dr. Stuart Bramhall, a psychiatrist spearheading the
universal-care initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, proponents of a patients' bill of rights
managed to get the needed signatures, only to have the Legislature
respond by passing a watered-down version of the reforms. Dr.
Timothy McCall, head of the committee promoting the initiative,
which remains on the November ballot, said the Legislature's
last-minute bill weakened support for the initiative and may
confuse voters.
</P>
<P>
   Initiative proponents occasionally find a sugar daddy.
California and Michigan have school voucher issues on the Nov. 7
ballot, thanks to well-heeled backers: venture capitalist Timothy
Draper in California and Amway President Dick Devos in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Draper supports the proposal to offer $4,000 of tax money per
child attending private or parochial school in California,
regardless of parental income. Devos is backing a Michigan
initiative that would provide vouchers for students in high schools
with graduation rates of less than 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the National Education Association and American Federation
of Teachers campaigning against the initiatives in both states, the
California contest may cost more than $50 million, about evenly
divided between those for and those against the measure. Greg
McNeilly, a spokesman for the Michigan initiative, said his side
will spend at least $5 million but still expects to be outspent by
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Money isn't the only obstacle for sponsors of ballot
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Dane Waters, president of the Washington-based, nonpartisan
Initiative and Referendum Institute, cites a number of ``assaults''
on the initiative process:
</P>
<P>
   -- Several states have passed legislation requiring all petition
circulators to be residents of the state and, in some cases, to be
registered voters themselves. This prevents trained teams of paid
circulators from coming into a state to gather signatures.
</P>
<P>
   -- Missouri shortened the period for gathering signatures
without reducing the number that are required to get an issue on
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   -- Wyoming added a requirement that a percentage of signatures
must be gathered from voters in at least two-thirds of Wyoming
counties. Because many Wyoming counties are sparsely populated,
this adds to the burden of getting the required number of
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nebraska passed legislation stipulating that a constitutional
amendment must be approved in two separate elections.
</P>
<P>
   -- Oregon increased by 50 percent the percentage of signatures
required to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Petitioners sometimes hurt their own cause by drafting poorly
written initiatives. Courts have halted a number of initiative
efforts because of faulty wording and, in one case, extraneous
markings on petition sheets.
</P>
<P>
   In July the Colorado Supreme Court knocked off the ballot a
measure to limit bilingual education because the measure's title
and summary gave the impression that parents would have a choice
between bilingual classes and English immersion classes when, in
fact, most children would have been required to join mainstream
classes after a year of bilingual education, the Denver Rocky
Mountain News reported.
</P>
<P>
   Also in July, the Arkansas Supreme Court invalidated a proposal
to abolish property taxes, ruling that the amendment was misleading
and confusing. The decision came two days after proponents turned
in 103,000 signatures, 30,000 more than necessary to put the issue
on the ballot, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Waters' Initiative and Referendum Institute cited a
Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling that ``any extraneous marking on
a petition sheet whatsoever -- even a couple of dots or accidental
pen scratches -- invalidates every signature on that sheet.''
</P>
<P>
   Courts also have limited the places where petitions can be
circulated. The Washington Supreme Court, for instance, upheld the
practice of making grocery stores off limits to petition
circulators.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle for petitioners is the U.S. Postal
Service's June 1998 ban on circulating petitions outside post
offices, Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ban makes collecting signatures in less-populated counties
difficult, if not impossible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute is trying to persuade the U.S. Postal Service to
repeal the ban but anticipates having to challenge the restriction
in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a diminishing number of initiatives reaching the
ballot because of the increasing difficulty,'' Waters said. ``We're
not seeing as many mom and pop initiatives. With the trend toward
more signatures being required in less time and other restrictions,
only well-financed special interests can use the initiative
process.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell is sympathetic to
petitioners' complaints but says ``there is bound to be tension
between direct democracy and the republican form of government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians, Democrats and Republicans, are quick to remind
you that ours is a representative form of government,'' he said.
``As a defensive move, most legislative bodies tend to ratchet up
the criteria and the requirements in order to protect their turf.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell said elected officials have a right to set the bar
relatively high for ballot initiatives, but they sometimes
overreach. Limiting signature gatherers to residents or even
registered voters in a state is one restriction that goes over the
line in Blackwell's view, because only registered voters in the
state can legally sign the petitions and vote on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell said elected officials would be wise to deal with the
reasons the public has lost faith in them, particularly by being
willing to confront controversial issues. ``Elected leaders are
timid in their leadership,'' he said. ``They don't want to make
hard choices or tough decisions. It is relatively easy for the
legislative bodies to put a referendum on the ballot and duck the
tough issues.''

   For a long time, Jewish Republicans were to electoral politics
what the quark was to particle physics: They existed in theory but
no one had really seen one. Or, as one lonely Jewish Republican
said a few years ago, all the Jewish Republicans in the country
would fit into a telephone booth.
</P>
<P>
   It was a joke, but no one in the party was laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, when an electoral cycle rolled around, Jewish
voters could be relied upon to go solidly, sometimes
overwhelmingly, for Democrats, often delivering the margin of
victory.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, Jewish Republicans -- yes, they're out
there, just like quarks -- are almost bubbling with confidence over
the prospect of drawing their co-religionists to the GOP fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have made great headway in creating a different
perception of the Republican Party within the Jewish community,''
said Cheryl Halpern, national leader of the Republican Jewish
Coalition. ``I think Gov. (George W.) Bush will pull a third of the
Jewish vote nationally. That would make me very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Halpern, a former Democrat from Livingston, N.J., for eight
years has guided the RJC, the only national organization of GOP
Jews. She remains optimistic even though the political calculus
shows her mission this fall to be as daunting as attracting gay
voters to the party, for example, or African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   That, Jewish leaders say, is because Halpern and the RJC have to
sell Jewish voters on a candidate who last December famously
proclaimed Jesus as his favorite political philosopher and who once
suggested that only Christians will go to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, few recent nominees have been as vocal as George W. Bush
about their Christian faith and in a way that can make
non-Christians -- especially Jews -- nervous.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1994 interview about salvation only for Christians,
for instance, Bush made matters worse by joking with a reporter
before a trip to Israel that he planned to tell Israelis they're
``going to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Then last November, the Texas governor raised eyebrows in the
Jewish community by urging Pat Buchanan, the Republican firebrand
who has been viewed as soft on Nazis and tough on Jews, not to bolt
the party.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this year, he had to clarify remarks praising the
Nation of Islam and saying the group -- whose leader, Louis
Farrakhan, has frequently outraged Jews with his statements --
would qualify for federal money through his proposed faith-based
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Bush irked Jewish leaders again by proclaiming
June 10 as Jesus Day because ``people of all religions recognize
Jesus Christ as an example of love, compassion, sacrifice and
service.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff definitely makes Jews plenty nervous,'' said David
Twersky, editor of New Jersey Jewish News and a keen observer of
Jewish political life. ``They don't like the religious right. It
scares them.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Jewish political attitudes are largely the product of
the history of persecution of Jews in the Old World at the hands of
Christians and their experience in America as poor immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, Jews (with the exception of many in the small Orthodox
branch) have traditionally been for unions and social justice
causes and against breaching the church-state wall, which they see
as the first step toward Christian hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   That thinking bolsters Jewish support for abortion rights and
rejection of prayer in public schools. Meanwhile, strong Jewish
communal solidity has helped pass these liberal political attitudes
almost undiluted down the generations, long after most Americans
Jews became affluent and well-educated, developments that led many
other Democrats to go Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Halpern and her group are confident they can overcome this
history and the doubts among their fellow Jews, enough so that the
group recently changed its name from the cryptic National Jewish
Coalition to the four-square Republican Jewish Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   No doubts there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because someone is devoutly Christian does not necessarily
make them hostile to the Jewish community,'' said Matt Brooks,
executive director of the RJC.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks conceded, however, that Bush's statements ``play
unfortunately on certain fears and biases that exist among certain
parts of the Jewish community that Democrats use to their political
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brooks insisted that Bush and other Republican candidates
will do better than usual with Jews in November because of what he
calls ``the changing face of the Republican Party'' this year.
``The whole notion of compassionate conservatism and the less
strident rhetoric appeals to Jewish voters,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   The RJC's goals for this fall are modest, and they would have to
be. Democrats regularly get more than three-fourths of the Jewish
vote, and President Bill Clinton topped 80 percent twice, an
extraordinary feat in a three-way race. Presumptive Democratic
nominee Vice President Al Gore also remains popular with Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP has good reason to go after Jewish votes. The
election is likely to be close, and while there are just 6 million
U.S. Jews, they are concentrated in crucial states such as
California, Florida, New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans -- including New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman,
New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan -- attracted a third of the Jewish vote or more, they won.
But those candidates are all social moderates who offered Jewish
voters a certain comfort level.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Republican handlers would like is to get back to the
35 percent (of the Jewish vote) that Bush's father got in 1988''
when he won the presidency, Twersky said. ``Personally, I'd be
rather surprised if they broke that barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brooks knows the challenge ahead and is coy when
it comes to predictions of what Bush could get.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than '96,'' he laughed. That, of course, was the year
Bill Clinton got 82 percent of the Jewish vote.

   Boy Twins, Girl Twins
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are twins more likely to be one sex or the other? What about
conjoined or Siamese twins?
</P>
<P>
   A. According to the Mothers of Twins Clubs, a national
organization, slightly more than half of all twins born are male.
</P>
<P>
   In conjoined or Siamese twins, the picture is complicated both
by their extreme rarity and by their very low overall survival
rate, which is variously given at 5 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even among twins, conjoined twins account for only about 1 in
200 deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Conjoined twins are always identical, because they always come
from a single fertilized egg, and so are always the same sex. The
developing embryo splits within two weeks of conception, but is
only partly separated and continues to mature into two infants that
are connected to a greater or lesser degree. Many die at birth and
many have severe birth defects. About 35 percent survive just one
day.
</P>
<P>
   However, historical studies of about 600 sets of conjoined twins
over five centuries list more than 70 percent of the surviving
pairs as female.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, according to the National Center for
Health Statistics, there has been a sharp rise in multiple births
over all, associated with the two overlapping and related trends of
older age at childbearing and increased used of fertility-enhancing
therapies, many of which have multiple pregnancies as a side
effect.

<P>
   Follow the crack of the Liberty Bell as far as the eye can see
and there he is, alone on a park bench in the middle of
Philadelphia, as obscure as he wants to be. ``Getting a little
vitamin D,'' he says when I reach him, and lifts his face to the
first sun either of us has seen after 15 hours on a bus, riding the
interstate through the night and into this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He's as obscure as he wants to be _ except for all those tour
buses parked on the other side of the square, his in particular,
with the tops of two '49 Buick Roadmasters erupting through the
roof and a license plate that reads POCAHONTAS. For a while we talk
about the allure of the road (``I like it,'' he says, ``I mean, I
miss my family, but. ...'' and then shrugs, a concession not an
apology), the music he listens to (``I don't play that much pop
these days, mostly Beethoven, Wagner''), about his recent CD,
``Silver and Gold'' (his first studio recording in four years). We
talk about the eight-disc archival box set he's preparing for
release this fall, covering his ascent from obscurity in the
mid-'60s to 1972, when he had Billboard's No. 1 album of the year;
and the two tours he's staging, one on his own and one with three
old friends, who, 30 years ago, were the biggest band in America.
</P>
<P>
   Time has finally cornered him long enough to monumentalize him,
it seems; but we'll see. Once he wrote songs with titles like
``Journey Through the Past'' _ barely conscious efforts to conquer
the present and cheat the future _ and he has always given a very
good impression of a man running from his place in musical history
as if it were a tomb. When we make our way to the hotel where the
bus is parked, a fan works up the nerve to ask for an autograph,
but Neil Young says, ``No, I don't do that,'' and walks right on
by, breaking his stride not even a little.
</P>
<P>
   Until I actually step on board, everyone assures me the
Pocahontas is a sanctuary never breached. Back beyond the special
well designed for Ben, his 21-year-old son with cerebral palsy who
watches the highway from his wheelchair, Young sprawls on his huge
bed. ``I was playing in a club in Fort William,'' he begins, ``and
we're doing a song called 'Farmer John,' and toward the end of it
we started jamming. ...''
</P>
<P>
   This is way back. This is back in the autumn of 1964 with a band
called the Squires, in Canada, where Young was reared in the little
town of Omemee with its ``blue, blue windows behind the stars'' and
where at the age of 3 he slipped into a nearby lake and nearly
drowned. This is back before his early days as part of a Motown
band with Rick James, back before his long exodus to L.A. in a
hearse looking for Stephen Stills, whom he would find only at the
last minute in a Sunset Strip traffic jam, before they formed
Buffalo Springfield. This is before ``After the Gold Rush'' and
``Harvest'' put him on the map in the early 1970s, and before the
subsequent 28 albums that have kept him on and off the map ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   This is way back, before a crumbling spinal disc in 1971 and
before the epilepsy, which still haunts him onstage. This is before
the afternoon he fired his lead guitarist for an uncontrolled
heroin problem that took the guitarist's life that very night, and
before the subsequent music that Young recorded in a
tequila-flooded exorcism of grief and guilt. This is before the
Thermidor of late-'70s punk, when one rock icon after another fell
before its guillotine of cultural relevancy, and Young was the one
'60s artist not only spared by the revolution but also embraced as
a kindred spirit.
</P>
<P>
   This is back before the nitwitted lawsuit filed against him in
the '80s by the head of his record label, David Geffen, for not
making true ``Neil Young'' records, before the '90s, when Kurt
Cobain quoted him in his suicide note, before he became the only
artist in the year 2000 that one could possibly imagine sharing a
concert bill with, say, Merle Haggard on the one hand and Nine Inch
Nails on the other. This is back before he became rock's Man That
Time Forgot, making music at once primordial and futuristic,
homegrown and surreal, traditional and insurrectionist, beguiling
and cataclysmic _ before he became, with his distinctive voice and
racked Mojave-storm guitar, a one-man vortex for folk, country,
blues, psychedelia, grunge, electronica, symphonic sweep, metallic
squall.
</P>
<P>
   Way back, playing ``Farmer John'' when he wasn't yet 20, Young
remembers, the music got really wild. ``I had never played like
that before. We were just slamming it. We played the song without
the song, we played what the song was about,'' and in that moment
his musical identity was born. If rock has always been driven by
two impulses, the utopian and the anarchic, many of its most
enduring figures have straddled the two: Chuck Berry, Elvis
Presley, John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young. It's the
utopian Neil whose records people buy in droves. But with songs
like 1995's sonic Imax ``I'm the Ocean,'' or the brilliant
``Powderfinger,'' about a young frontier boy killed in an explosion
of survivalist pride and madness (``Then I saw black, and my face
splashed in the sky''), it's the anarchic Neil who howls into the
zeitgeist and alters it.
</P>
<P>
   He likes it when the zeitgeist howls back. With Crazy Horse, a
band just cacophonous and primal enough to capture ``Farmer John''
on record with Young a quarter-century after Fort William, he makes
a point of recording around a full moon, when ``a lot of mechanical
things go wrong, technical difficulties, things that usually work
don't work.'' And in the congenitally enlightened company of
Crosby, Stills and Nash, unabashed utopians who have always sounded
a little funny singing ``Down by the river I shot my baby,'' Neil
Young is Baader-Meinhof: when he performs ``Rockin' in the Free
World'' in Philadelphia, it seems he simply won't let go of the
song, until it becomes clear the song won't let go of him.
</P>
<P>
   From out of the conflict between utopia and anarchy has emerged
moral ambiguity and complexity. In 1970, when he wrote ``Ohio''
following the murder of four students by National Guardsmen at Kent
State University, his rage was more instinctive than political:
``My lyrics get personal about it,'' he acknowledges. ``I'm
singing: 'What if you knew her and saw her dead on the ground? How
could you run when you know?''' But that anger was also answered a
few years later by ``Campaigner,'' when alone among major spokesmen
for the counterculture he expressed compassion for a disgraced
president who lost everything (``Even Richard Nixon has got
soul''); and conspicuously over the years he has refused to adopt
any ideological line. At one time or another he has supported
Ronald Reagan and Jesse Jackson. His ideal ticket in 2000 is
Gore-McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The utopia of his early music succumbed to anarchy most
spectacularly during an unhinged 1973 tour that was his rude answer
to superstardom. The shows would routinely climax with Young
screaming, ``Wake up!'' at his audiences as the '60s crashed down
around him in a rain of dead junkies; now, at the back of the
Pocahontas, all he can manage to say of the period is, ``I'm glad I
made it through it,'' before a pall settles over the interview.
Whenever Young ``tried to get away from success,'' his manager,
Elliot Roberts, remarks of the period, ``it just turned into a
bigger success,'' which wasn't just confusing but mortifying, since
success wasn't particularly subtle about its human toll. Young went
on to chronicle the deaths of the people around him in a series of
anti-drug songs _ ``The Needle and the Damage Done,'' ``Tired
Eyes,'' ``Tonight's the Night'' _ that were all the more
authoritative for the way they were reportorial rather than
judgmental, never denying for a moment the attraction of excess and
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't like people telling me what to do,'' he explains
almost offhandedly. ``I didn't like people telling me if I made
more records like 'Harvest,' I would be successful. That's when I
came up with the concept of destroying what I created in order to
move on. I wanted to do what I called audio verite.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and looks out the window. ``At a certain point,
trained, accomplished musicians'' _ which is to say, not him _
``hit the wall. They don't go there very often, they don't have the
tools to go through the wall, because it's the end of notes. It's
the other side, where there's only tone, sound, ambience,
landscape, earthquakes, pictures, fireworks, the sky opening,
buildings falling, subways collapsing. ... I don't know too many
musicians who try to go through the wall.'' He stops for a moment.
``I love to go through the wall,'' as if you ever doubted it for a
moment.
</P>
<P>
   In the collective memory of his longtime audience, he may
forever be the brooding figure reclining alone in the shadowy
gatefold of ``After the Gold Rush.'' But in fact virtually everyone
who has ever known him attests to his humor _ sometimes zany,
sometimes wry, mischievous. Over six feet tall, he has an easy yet
determined stride that encompasses all his contradictions: zen yet
a little obsessive, open yet a little unapproachable, lurching
toward his ambitions yet held back by his wariness of having to
explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   During a disgruntled taping with Crosby, Stills and Nash of
``Storytellers,'' the VH-1 series in which songwriters relate the
stories behind their songs, he paces the small stage like a caged
animal and cracks, ``I thought the song was supposed to tell the
story.'' And when I bump into him in a hotel lobby one afternoon
after failing to pin him down for an interview, and he assures me,
``I'm really not avoiding you, I'm just waiting until I feel more
alert,'' personally I feel quite certain he's avoiding me. But I'm
in the curious position of respecting him all the more for it.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Elliot Roberts was just a 22-year-old from the Bronx
managing Buffalo Springfield when Young abruptly stopped a
rehearsal one afternoon to demand Roberts be fired on the spot. ``I
was shocked,'' Roberts recalls. ``It blew my mind.'' For days he
wandered L.A. stunned, trying to figure out what hit him, only for
Young to appear suddenly one night at 2 a.m. to explain he was
leaving the band and wanted Roberts to manage him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he had plotted it all out,'' Roberts now laughs. ``I
thought, Wow, cool _ this guy is as devious as I am.'' To those who
have watched him over the years, Young comes off as a mastermind of
unpredictability. But sometimes he can appear less integrated and
more genuinely divided against himself than people think. The
utopian-anarchic ``schizophrenia'' (Young's word) of his music
reveals both a Spontaneous Neil and a Control-Freak Neil, each real
and each peering over the other's shoulder, each trying to correct
the other's misjudgments, each averting the other from perceived
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better example of this than the recent misadventures
of Young's authorized biographer. After signing a contract with
both Young and Random House, Jimmy McDonough, a journalist, spent
eight years writing, researching and interviewing more than 300
people, all with Young's cooperation. But when McDonough delivered
a manuscript at the end of 1998, Young suddenly _ according to the
publisher _ ``sabotaged'' the book by withholding his approval of
it, and Random House dropped the biography. In the Young camp,
nobody will comment for the record about why he killed the project.
But the unofficially stated reason _ that McDonough submitted the
book to Random House before submitting it to Young and thereby
breached the contract, betraying Young's trust _ sounds flimsy.
McDonough is now suing him for $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The melodrama of Neil Young's early life reached critical mass
in November 1978 with the birth of his second son _ by his wife,
Pegi _ and the subsequent realization that, like Young's first son,
Zeke, by the actress Carrie Snodgrass, Ben had cerebral palsy.
Zeke's case is mild (he is 27 and works as a sound engineer on a
number of his father's projects), but Ben is a quadriplegic. Young
would later recount walking out of the hospital and ``looking at
the sky, looking for a sign, wondering: What did I do? There must
be something wrong with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But cerebral palsy is a twist of fate, not of genetics _ Young's
daughter, Amber, doesn't have the disease. If all this weren't
overwhelming enough, not long after Ben's birth, Pegi was found to
have a brain tumor, from which, at the time, she had only a 50-50
chance of recovering. So in the early '80s, the man whose obsession
with his music was supposedly all-consuming set the music aside to
devote himself to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of thoughts in my mind at that time,'' he
says now, ``that I wasn't ready to share with the world,'' and the
matter of Ben's health was so personal that in 1982, when Young
released a strange album called ``Trans'' with electronically
distorted vocals, few knew it grew out of an effort to communicate
with his speechless son by computer. During the rest of the decade,
Young's music seemed at loose ends on a series of recordings that
in hindsight appear redeemed as stylistic explorations of an
artistic identity in turmoil _ out of which ultimately emerged one
of his best albums, ``Freedom,'' in 1989. He then spent the '90s
making one important record after another.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon in Philadelphia, when we had once again scheduled
an interview and he had once again vanished, I found out he had
gone to a school for children with cerebral palsy. Along with Pegi,
Young is a major supporter of such a school in California, and
during tours he often arranges for young people with the disease to
see the shows. I was annoyed that I hadn't been with him to get the
scene at the school for the story; in true Neil Young fashion, it
even happened during a full moon, when an elevator at the school
suddenly malfunctioned and the singer hovered for several
precarious minutes between floors. But then it occurred to me that
99 out of 100 rock stars would have jumped at the chance to drag me
along and put their humanitarianism on display, and that like so
much else with Young, maybe this was private, too.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, you know, he just wings it. Sometimes it's not a
matter of a personal code (which he obviously has), or a
Machiavellian ploy (of which he's clearly capable); it's a matter
of impulse. Standing in the middle of a shopping-center parking lot
on the highway to Cleveland, waiting for the bus to refuel, Young
is talking about spending some time with his family after the tour
on the volcanic Big Island of Hawaii, when a young woman pulls up
in a pickup truck. She leans over and rolls down the window on the
passenger side, and on her face is the disbelief of her own eyes.
``Are you who I think you are?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who do you think I am?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you Neil Young?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he finally answers.
</P>
<P>
   Suspended between astonishment and opportunity, she sputters,
``Would you sign your name for me?''
</P>
<P>
   She scrambles to find something for him to write on. I'm
remembering the autograph hound outside the hotel in Philadelphia.
Now this woman in a pickup truck on her way to get her kid from
school maybe, or coming home from a job waiting on tables, in the
middle of a Wal-Mart parking lot that everybody knows is nowhere,
happens to peer through her windshield to see, standing over on a
small square of grass waiting for his dog to relieve himself, the
full-moon genius of rock 'n' roll. And then she makes two
decisions: the first, to have faith in what her eyes tell her; and
the second, to confront it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he says. He steps up to the truck, leans in and
scrawls his name on whatever she has offered him, a gut reaction to
the purity of her wonder; and then as she drives away, with a story
she'll tell for the next 50 years, he goes back to contemplating
volcanoes and the sea, and the tropical winds where utopia and
anarchy converge.
</P>
<P>
   As he now seems eternally young, in earlier days Young was old
before his time. ``I'm getting old,'' he sang in his most famous
song, ``Heart of Gold,'' written when he was 24. In Phoenix, after
another show, as the others in the band celebrate with friends
backstage, Young sits alone in a dark, hushed room with a few
candles burning low nearby, nursing his back with an ice pack; he
seems every one of his 54 years. Earlier onstage he lost himself in
a deranged ``Down by the River'' as he had with ``Rockin' in the
Free World'' in Philadelphia, the Man That Time Forgot shredding
time to ribbons. But back here in the dark he's the Man That Time
Remembers, and it's remembering him in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   So for a while we make small talk that he probably finds more
awkward than his graciousness allows him to admit. And then I
finally leave, after he has just ``slammed '' one more time through
the wall of age, the wall of fear, the wall of passion, to the end
of the night. As if you ever doubted it for a moment, he loves to
go through the wall, beyond the end of notes.

   REPUBLICAN CONVENTION

</P>
<P>
   GOP-RDP-NYT (Philadelphia) _ A convention roundup: Republicans
open their convention, beginning what party leaders hope will be a
highly scripted four- day celebration of George W. Bush; the first
real business came when the delegates approved a platform that
reaffirms the party's staunch position opposing abortion while
adopting Bush's compassionate conservative positions; according to
a New York Times/CBS News poll of delegates, the Republicans here
are far more conservative than average Republican voters, but Karl
Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush campaign, played down the
dichotomy between the delegates and the message in an interview
Monday on ``Political Points,'' a joint production of ABCNEWS.com
and The New York Times on the Web. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-PLATFORM _ Maintaining the promise of a friction-free
convention, delegates to the Republican National Convention swiftly
adopt a platform that adheres to most of the party's core
conservative principles but softens some of the edges on other
issues, in keeping with George W. Bush's effort to project a more
compassionate image.

   ISRAEL-PERES (Jerusalem) _ At the moment Monday when the
announcement of the first of the two Knesset votes for Israel's
next president made it all but certain that he had lost the last
major battle of his 60-year political career, Shimon Peres, Noble
laureate, three-time prime minister and one of the most enduring
standard-bearers for Middle East peace, remained proudly, though
unobtrusively, in character. The result, with 60 votes for Moshe
Katsav, 57 votes for Peres, and three blank ballots, brought
groans, slumped shoulders and moist eyes among parliamentarians
backing Peres' bid to become Israel's eighth president. To those
who know him well, the 76-year-old statesman appeared ashen, but in
the simplicity of his manner and words he did nothing, despite the
moment's pain, to bely his reputation for courtliness and courage.

short for laser in-situ keratomileusis, has quickly grown into a $3
billion-a-year industry, with 750,000 Americans expected to choose
the surgery this year. Intended to correct nearsightedness, the
procedure can now treat farsightedness as well. With 1.2 million
American customers expected next year, Lasik is becoming the issue

evolution and genetics, Argentine ants are taking over California
while forming what scientists believe could be the biggest ant
colony in the world, stretching over 600 miles from San Diego to
San Francisco. The ants in this so-called supercolony are nearly
identical genetically so that different colonies do not fight one
another the way they do in their homeland. As a result they are
using a united family front to win territory from native ants. By

 LAREDO, Texas: always an increase.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `LIES. PURE LIES': If all goes as planned, the 15 thirsty
``colonias'' targeted in the Webb County project will have water in
three years, maybe four, county planning officials say.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Ranchitos 359, where Estrada lives.
</P>
<P>
   Another is ``colonia'' San Carlos, where 81-year-old Marcelina
Alvarez has been living in a plywood and particle-board home,
without plumbing, for the last 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   A first-generation American born near Robstown, Alvarez retired
from her job canning asparagus years ago, and now lives with a
granddaughter and five great-grandchildren. She is lucky to have an
indoor toilet _ fed by water buckets _ which empties into a
cesspool outside. The family pays $100 to have it cleaned twice a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some have that unpleasant task performed every month, but
Alvarez calls for the vacuum truck only once every six months,
which could explain the overpowering stench wafting up from the
haphazardly covered, underground container.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez has heard that water service is coming, but she has
heard that before. She said she'll believe it when she sees it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come saying they're going to do this, they're going to do
that,'' she said, her voice trailing off as she brushed flies from
her face and ants off the table. A granddaughter, Irasema Sanchez,
chimed in: ``They're lies. Pure lies.''
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH WORRIES BRING CHANGE: Dirty water and poor sanitation are
blamed for the high incidence of infectious disease along the
border.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Texas Health Department study, between 10 percent
and 48 percent of ``colonia'' children ages 1-12 have been infected
with hepatitis A, a disease affecting the liver. It is often
transmitted through water contaminated by human feces.
</P>
<P>
   Adult rates are much higher, officials say. An estimated 70
percent or more of the adults in the ``colonias'' of Webb County
have been infected, according to Rogelio Garcia, acting director of
the Laredo health department.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, according to the State Health Department's Division of
Tuberculosis Control, a person living in a border county has twice
the chance of contracting TB compared with someone living elsewhere
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you see it, taste it, feel the grit in your teeth, I
don't think you can truly understand the kind of conditions of the
people who live here and try to survive and raise their children,''
said Dr. Maurice Click, a physician who has worked extensively in
Webb County's ``colonias'' and has advocated a more active state
response.
</P>
<P>
   A chief problem is that people build unsophisticated pit
latrines that tend to flood when it rains. So bacteria are washed
all across the ``colonias,'' causing disease that is often
transported to other cities and states by migrant workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   LEGISLATIVE ACTION: The threat of disease migrating beyond the
border was one of the primary reasons for a series of legislative
actions that began in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, $600 million in state, local and federal money has
been directed toward the ``colonias,'' mostly for providing water
and sewer service to residents there, state figures show. Estimates
for providing those services to all ``colonia'' residents range
from $1 billion to $2 billion, which doesn't include other
infrastructure needs such as roads, streetlights and trash service.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 years, 15,000 residents have been provided with both water
and sewer service, according to figures from the Texas Water
Development Board, which oversees the infrastructure projects.
About 80,000 residents have received either water or sewer service.
</P>
<P>
   Less clear is how many of the 400,000 ``colonia'' residents
currently have running water and sewer connections. The office of
the Texas secretary of state estimates that about 86 percent have
water and about 12 percent have sewer service, up from 77 percent
and 1 percent, respectively, in 1992. Various academic sources
report slightly lower rates of water service and slightly higher
rates of sewer service.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, most agree progress has been made, though not all
agree who should take the credit. Gutierrez, the Webb County
commissioner, said former Gov. Ann Richards was more directly
involved in helping ``colonias'' and faulted Bush for never
visiting one during his trips to South Texas and El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the Texas George Bush talks about,'' she said.
``I've never seen him in the `colonias.'''
</P>
<P>
   She also complained that the ``colonia'' ombudsman for Webb
County _ one of six people assigned by the state to oversee
``colonia'' relief efforts _ was ineffective and unfamiliar with
the area. The ombudsman was recently fired, but the secretary of
state's office declined to say why.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, said he is proud of his record on ``colonias,''
and aides point to figures showing that most of the household water
hookups in the last decade have occurred since he took office in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a fantastic record. We'll have (hooked up) thousands
of people who heretofore had no water or sewer at their homes by
the time my administration is over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   `LITTLE PEOPLE': The political sniping means little back in
Ranchitos las Lomas, off Highway 59 on the outskirts of Laredo.
Here no plans exist to bring water, let alone sewer service. It is
just too far from the water source, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents here pay 50 cents for 250 gallons of water that
is clean but not always odor-free. But Norma Martinez, a
36-year-old social worker, pays $5 to have it trucked to her house.
</P>
<P>
   The ``colonia'' has no stop signs or streetlights, and when it
rains, the school bus doesn't come, so her children must walk three
miles back home on a sheet of mud that sticks to their shoes and
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because we're far away, we're like an abandoned
`colonia' out here,'' she said. ``We're little people.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   I felt the screaming jolt, the split-second whine. Out in the
field behind the farmhouse, I was a curious child, too close to an
unsupervised, snarling buzz saw. One minute my left hand was tanned
brown from the Canadian summer, with slender fingers stained from
wild strawberries. One bump and one scream of the buzz saw later,
it was a bloody, mangled mess.
</P>
<P>
   That night Dr. Trefry cut it off. It was 1947. I was 14 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   I loathed my handless arm. For weeks I wouldn't even look at it
_ the monster arm that made me different. I tested out cans and
can'ts: Will boys like a 14-year-old girl with just one hand?
Braiding pigtails, playing the piano, tying shoes _ can I do it
with just one hand?
</P>
<P>
   I hated _ still hate _ the everyday game of ``let's pretend'':
people looking, looking twice, then pretending they didn't notice.
I wanted them to say, ``What happened to your hand?'' I wanted them
to make it ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   In a can-do family, my daddy saw me looking out at a world
defined by what I could not do. Daddy agonized. I was his youngest
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   He was braiding my pigtails, wrapping the ends in rubber bands
one day. ``Shall I tell you a secret, Mary, sweetheart?'' he asked.
``When Bertie first heard that you lost your hand, do you know what
he said to me?''
</P>
<P>
   I waited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bertie told me, `Now Mary can't ride her bicycle.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bertie was my little brother, not yet 7. I suspected he was
eyeing my new British Raleigh with its hand-grip brakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And do you know what I said to him?'' Daddy paused. ``I told
him, `Well, I don't know why not.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why not'': I tacked the words in my heart like a
banner. And not just the words, but his believing in me.
</P>
<P>
   Mother, who wouldn't let any Taylor hide behind the nonsense of
``I can't,'' enrolled me at the college up the street for Hammond
organ lessons. I would play the keyboards with one hand and two
feet. And excuses about not doing dishes? ``A Taylor never says `I
can't,''' she would remind me as she lined me up with the rest. And
then she sat me down and taught me to crochet.
</P>
<P>
   When I lost my hand, the preacher's wife hoped out loud that God
would grow it back. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   But he gave me daily triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, I have I-wish-I-had-my-hand days. I hate
eat-while-standing refreshments of every kind. If my one hand holds
the saucer, what hand will bring the cup of coffee to my lips?
</P>
<P>
   I hate every bottle cap that I can't open with just one hand.
And necklaces that I can't latch with just one hand. And bracelets
that won't slip on.
</P>
<P>
   I've had nightmares. After I wrenched my good shoulder a while
ago, my ultimate nightmare awoke me with cold sweats: my one and
only hand immobilized. I have no spare. I shudder at what-if's:
What if I couldn't dress myself? Drive to work? Wipe my bottom?
Write? Or feed myself? The aching terror of being dependent haunts
me.
</P>
<P>
   But you know what? It was hard to beat the high of seeing my
daughter skipping to church in her Easter Sunday dress that I
sewed. Or setting a record at the auction with a quilted wall
hanging that I pieced.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere deep inside, my cheering section shouts and stomps and
waves each time I do something someone thought I couldn't. When I
pinned my daughter's diapers. When I made the college volleyball
all-stars. When I tie my shoelaces. When I set my hair in curlers.
Small victories.
</P>
<P>
   Something cheers inside.

<P>
   One of the joys of living with pets is catching a glimpse of
what makes them tick. What we learn about our pets from experts,
friends, and, especially, our own observations _ sometimes
surprises us but ultimately helps us take better care of them. With
long-running contact, however, we sometimes come to take our pets
for granted. That's when we may miss a clue to understanding pet
behavior. Here are some situations that deserve a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   To communicate with our pets we need to listen as well as talk
to them. Does a dog howl, for instance, from loneliness? A dog that
is isolated from its family, either canine or human, may indeed cry
out for company, just as wolves locate one another in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   With their heightened pack identity, beagles especially are
prone to plaintive howling when left alone. But some breeds, like
my schipperke, Momo, who is rarely left all alone, just can't
resist replying to other dogs' howling. It is another throwback to
their wolf heritage: The pack sings as one recreationally early in
the morning and in the evening to initiate the hunt. In Momo's
case, the daily one o'clock firehouse siren inspires him to warble
along and other neighborhood dogs often join in the vocalizing.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first signs of illness for any animal is loss of
appetite. But is your cat sick or just a finicky eater? If it turns
food away, make sure first that there isn't a health problem by
asking your vet. After that, look on food preference as a
potentially serious problem in itself.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``CatWatch,'' the newsletter of the Cornell
University Feline Health Center in Ithaca, N.Y., some cats would
rather starve than eat food they don't like, and preferences can be
set as early as six months. Kittens raised on a varied diet develop
democratic palates.
</P>
<P>
   Housebreaking dogs calls for the use of a crate, but is it
really true that dogs never soil their crate? Most animals try to
keep their sleeping area clean, but that doesn't mean you can count
on it. Puppies have to learn control, and they can't be expected to
wait for unreasonably long periods. A puppy should be taken outside
immediately after eating and drinking, and no adult dog should have
to wait longer than 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   No dog _ adult or puppy _ should be held in a crate for more
than four hours at a stretch. The crate should be large enough for
the dog to stand, turn around and lie down comfortably, but not so
large that there will be room set aside for eliminating.
</P>
<P>
   And when the dog is in the yard, how best to fence it in?
``Invisible,'' that is, electric- or sonar-producing fences, keep
the landscape clear and may cost less than traditional fencing.
Pain, however, is the tool. Even if, as some argue, the pain may be
mild, you must decide if you desire these conditions for your pet's
overall well-being.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the fences are rendered ineffectual when dogs dash
through them in hot pursuit of a squirrel or another dog, then
won't come back for fear of the shock that awaits them. If you
don't want to erect a wooden fence, try planting evergreens around
your property, then linking them with barely visible garden wire.
</P>
<P>
   Taking your dog with you on outings is fun, but the dog should
ride inside the cab if you drive a pickup truck. Sudden braking,
swerves or bumps in the road can send a dog flying out of the back
of the truck and airborne debris can also cause injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If absolutely necessary,'' recommends Michael Kaufmann, the
American Humane Association's director of educational programs, in
Englewood, Colo., ``a dog can be put in a crate that is securely
fastened to the truck bed.'' Some states have laws against dogs
riding in the backs of trucks.
</P>
<P>
   For cats, outdoor adventures often include vigorous tree
climbing. Cats love to sink their claws into rough bark and shoot
straight up the trunk. Sometimes, though, they glue themselves to a
branch and refuse to come down. The reason is not that they're
afraid of the height, but that their anatomy is better suited to
ascent than descent.
</P>
<P>
   John Hermanson, associate professor of biomedical sciences at
Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine, in Ithaca,
N.Y., explains, ``Squirrels and some other arboreal mammals have
specialized capabilities that allow them to rotate their ankles
nearly 180 degrees while climbing head-first down the trunk of a
tree.'' Since cats don't have this ability, you may have to haul
out the ladder to help them down. You can try benign neglect first:
Cats often creep down by themselves without the stress of people
surrounding them.
</P>
<P>
   One situation fraught with tension is a dogfight. Even though
your dog may be on a leash, someone else's may not be. Or two dogs
might be playing seemingly peacefully in the park when_ without
warning _ a fight breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first instinct _ to try to break up the fight by yelling
or grabbing our dogs _ is not the correct solution,'' warns Michael
Kaufmann of the AHA. In the intensity of the moment, your own dog
could inadvertently bite you; yelling only heightens the emotional
turmoil. Instead, drop your leash and pause.
</P>
<P>
   Most dogfights, however terrifying, last only seconds. But if a
small dog is being victimized or if the fight doesn't end promptly,
try spraying the dogs with a hose, swinging a big stick or throwing
clothing into the fray to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the inner workings of our pets, the one we may least
understand is the powerful, seemingly interpsychic connection
between them and us. Rupert Sheldrake examines the ways animals
tune in to our behavior in his book ``Dogs That Know When Their
Owners Are Coming Home'' (Crown; 1999; $25).
</P>
<P>
   According to Sheldrake, the bonds between our companion animals
and ourselves may be so strong that they create a ``morphic
field,'' a physical connection that enables them to locate us
across distances and to anticipate our actions even before we
consciously know them ourselves. The deeper our bonds, it seems,
the more we learn about the nature of life itself.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In August 1957, the first New Hampshire Antiques Show _
sponsored by the New Hampshire Antiques Dealers Association _ was
held in two small rooms in Concord's New Hampshire Highway Hotel.
Seventeen dealers displayed Windsor chairs, hand-carved decoys,
pewter chargers, step-back cupboards and other American treasures.
</P>
<P>
   According to East Hebron, N.H., dealer Howard Oedel, one of the
event's founders and still an exhibitor, the show attracted a
lively following right from the beginning. ``The original group was
small,'' Oedel recalls, ``but enthusiasm was high and the caliber
of objects exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of those pioneers could have imagined that 43 years later,
the NHADA New Hampshire Antiques Show _ now held in the Center of
New Hampshire Holiday Inn in Manchester _ would still be going
strong, attracting thousands of enthusiasts annually and sparking a
weeklong celebration of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the antiquing highlight of the summer,'' says collector,
appraiser and ``Country Living'' contributing editor Helaine
Fendelman, who has attended the show for nearly 20 years. ``There
are so many things to see and so many dealers to speak with. Simply
observing the wide range of objects is an education process in
itself''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the variety of items offered for sale _ painted
furniture, trade signs, folk portraits, redware pottery, and
colorful quilts to name but a few _ regulars share a sense of
excitement about seeing so many high-quality pieces in one place.
</P>
<P>
   ``People plan vacations around this show and travel long
distances to get here,'' says Judith Milne, co-owner of Judith &AMP;
James Milne Antiques in New York City, and a first-time exhibitor
at the NHADA New Hampshire Antiques Show. ``It's one of the major
destinations on the antiquer's calendar: New York City in January,
Philadelphia in April and New Hampshire in August.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, New Hampshire's Antiques Week begins on August 5 with
a live auction and ends with the week's cornerstone event, the
65-dealer NHADA New Hampshire Antiques Show, August 10 to 12. The
week's events include the Americana Celebration Antiques Show on
August 8 and the Mid-Week in Manchester show on August 9 and 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wait all year long for this show,'' says Rye, N.H.,
dealer Russ Goldberger, a nine-year participant, along with his
wife, Karen. ``Exhibitors often hold on to their best pieces for a
good part of the year to bring them here.''
</P>
<P>
   What people consider to be their ``best'' has changed over the
years. Oedel notes that when he started doing the show 43 years
ago, ``art pottery, Dedham pottery and ephemera weren't really
collected; today they're in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   At last year's show, some of the top-quality items included
Victorian alphabet blocks, blue-and-white transferware, Hitchcock
chairs, green-glass apothecary bottles, a circa 1880 folk art
birdhouse and 18th- and 19th-century pewter.
</P>
<P>
   While novices and seasoned attendees alike know that it's a good
idea to arrive at an antiques show early for the best chance to
score the great items, Goldberger advises checking back
periodically throughout the show's run, explaining that most
dealers park antiques-filled trucks nearby so they can restock
their booths as pieces sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're interested in American country antiques, this event
is something you need to experience at least once in your life,''
Goldberger says. ``But don't be surprised if you start coming back
year after year.''
</P>
<P>
   PLANNING YOUR TRIP
</P>
<P>
   While in Manchester, you will not fail to see the Amoskeag
Mills, built in the 19th century. This complex of brick buildings
still stretches for a mile along the Merrimack River and was once
the largest textile factory in the world. The mill buildings now
house dozens of other industries.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester has an excellent fine art museum, the Currier Gallery
of Art, with collections of American decorative art and paintings
by significant Americans ranging from 19th-century portraitist Ammi
Phillips to such 20th-century artists as Andrew Wyeth, Edward
Hopper and Georgia O'Keefe.(Web site: www.currier.org)
</P>
<P>
   The Zimmerman house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright belongs to
the Currier and is open Friday through Monday. Visitors must take a
guided tour ($7) with advance reservations required. (603-626-4156)
</P>
<P>
   Nearby Concord, with a population of just over 36,000 people,
has been the capital of New Hampshire since 1808. The state
Legislature _ with 424 representatives, the largest in the nation _
still meets in its original chambers. The New Hampshire State
House, built in 1819, has exhibits about the state's history and is
open year-round.
</P>
<P>
   South of Manchester is America's Stonehenge _ 4,000-year-old
granite slabs of unknown origin. Their alignment suggests to
scientists that they were part of an ancient calendar constructed
by people who had sophisticated knowledge of the movements of the
sun, moon and stars. (Admission: $7.95. For more information, call
603-893-8300.)
</P>
<P>
   Accommodations in the Manchester area range from the 250-room
Center of New Hampshire Holiday Inn (603-625-1000) to cozy country
inns like the four-room Stillmeadow B&AMP;B (603-329-8381.) For a free
New Hampshire visitors' guide call 800-386-4664.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the antiques shows offer food on site. In addition,
two dealer favorites in Manchester are Cafe Pavone (603-622-5488)
and Shorty's Mexican Roadhouse (603-625-1730).

RADIO TELESCOPE WILL BE BUILT TO LISTEN FOR SIGNALS FROM SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (Science Times) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two gifts totaling $12.5 million have cleared the way for the
development of what is being described as the world's most powerful
radio telescope designed specifically to listen for signals that
may be coming from civilizations elsewhere in the galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   The SETI Institute of Mountain View, Calif., a private
organization conducting research to determine whether intelligent
life exists beyond Earth, announced Tuesday that the money would be
used to begin work on a proof-of-concept version of the telescope.
Under current plans, the telescope, a cluster of many 12-foot dish
receivers, would be ready for full operation in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The principal gift, of $11.5 million, came from Paul G. Allen, a
Seattle investor, one of the founders of Microsoft and a
philanthropist of scientific research. The project is being renamed
the Allen Telescope Array. A $1 million donation by Dr. Nathan P.
Myhrvold, former chief technology officer of Microsoft, is to be
used to build an electronics laboratory for analyzing data gathered
by the telescope.
</P>
<P>
   The telescope is to be built at the Hat Creek Observatory, 290
miles northeast of San Francisco on a site operated by the
University of California at Berkeley. The total cost of the
immediate project is estimated at $26 million, but in concept, the
telescope array can be regularly modified with improved technology
and expanded by adding hundreds of mass-produced dish antennas over
a 2.5-acre area.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers said the Allen Telescope should enable them to
examine up to a dozen target stars simultaneously in the search for
extra-terrestrial intelligence and to detect signals over an
extremely wide range of frequencies. At the same time, other
astronomers could be using the telescope for non-SETI observations.
A recent study on astronomy by the National Academy of Sciences
praised the concept as innovative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really beautiful win-win situation,'' said Dr. Jill
Tarter, research director at the SETI Institute.

 &HT;    BREAST CANCER TREATMENTS LACKING FOR ELDERLY
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN

<P>
   WASHINGTON - Women over 80 often do not get full treatment for
early stage breast cancer, according to a study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Women over 80 were 16 percent less likely than younger women to
be referred to a radiation oncologist upon the discovery of breast
cancer, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where a lumpectomy was performed _ conserving much of
the breast _ women over 80 were 3.4 times less likely to receive
follow-up radiation therapy, the study indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Women who do not receive radiation therapy after a lumpectomy
have a 40 percent chance of a cancer recurrence within 10 years,
the study said. Women at 80 have an average life expectancy of
slightly more than nine years.
</P>
<P>
   That means ``a good portion of them stand a chance of the cancer
coming back and it's much more difficult to treat'' a second time,
said Dr. Jeanne S. Mandelblatt, who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 718 female patients was conducted by the Lombardi
Cancer Center at Georgetown University Medical Center and included
researchers from 29 hospitals. It was financed by the federal
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and published in today's
(ITAL) Cancer (END ITALICS) journal.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not determine why older women receive less
aggressive treatment, but Mandelblatt said it may be because
``there are potentially some age biases in treatment. The
physicians may feel that older women don't expect to live long.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason may be that physicians are uncertain what is the
best clinical treatment for older women because, until recently,
women over 80 have been excluded from clinical trials, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As in previous studies which have found a racial disparity in
treatment, this one found indications that black women seemed to be
less likely than white women to receive radiation after a
lumpectomy.

   When Asteroids Grow Up
</P>
<P>
   It is a fine line, sometimes, between fame and obscurity. Take
the case of the celestial object known as 1999 UX18. One day it's
an asteroid, just another bit player meandering around the solar
system. The next day it's a star.
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, a moon. Astronomers at the University of Arizona and
the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory have determined that the
small object, thought to be an asteroid when it was discovered near
Jupiter last year, is in fact an outer satellite of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The object was one of many observed by the University of
Arizona's Spacewatch program, which uses a 36-inch telescope to
look for comets and asteroids. It was cataloged by the
Smithsonian's Minor Planet Center and pretty much forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   But a staff member of the center, testing new software last
month, thought he came across another observation of the object in
the Spacewatch data. He tried to come up with a solar orbit for the
object that would account for the various observations. When he
could not, it dawned on him that perhaps he was wrongly assuming
that the object was orbiting the Sun. Perhaps it was actually
orbiting Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   That turned out to be the case, although its orbit, like those
of the other outer satellites, is highly irregular and millions of
miles from the planet. And the object is so small _ about three
miles in diameter, perhaps _ that it is difficult to see. But the
astronomers hope to make another set of observations to confirm
their finding. And if it is confirmed as a moon, 1999 UX18 will
eventually get a name worthy of its billing.
</P>
<P>
   Undoing Fish Evolution
</P>
<P>
   Astyanax mexicanus, a fish found in Mexico, is an unusual
creature. It exists in two forms: sightless cave dwellers that have
degenerate orbs in place of eyes, and those that live in surface
streams and have normal eyes. The two are thought to have diverged
from a common ancestor within the past million years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, scientists at the University of Maryland have uncovered
clues to how they evolved differently. They report in the journal
Science that the eye lens plays a critical role in the development
(or degeneration) of the eye.
</P>
<P>
   In the cave-dwelling variety, eyes begin to develop in the
embryo, but the lens quickly degenerates and other eye tissues like
the cornea, retina and pupil develop in only rudimentary form. But
when the researchers implanted lens tissue from the sighted variety
into a cave-dweller embryo, a large eye with a distinct cornea,
pupil and iris developed. It is as if the researchers were able to
undo a million years of evolution in one fell swoop.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are conducting further experiments to determine
exactly how the lens tissue sets off eye development. The work may
eventually help in understanding the genetic factors behind certain
forms of sight loss in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Those Talkative Beans
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to find something nice to say about lima beans, other
than that they are easy to spear with a fork. But researchers in
Japan have uncovered a reason the vegetable may be worthy of new
respect. Limas, it turns out, are good communicators.
</P>
<P>
   Like some other types of plants, a lima can let its neighbors
know when it has been attacked by a pest such as a spider mite. The
action of the mite munching on the plant releases volatile
compounds that are carried through the air to neighboring lima
plants, which then prepare chemical defenses against infestation.
</P>
<P>
   While it had been known that limas could do this, the exact
mechanism had remained unclear. The Japanese researchers, reporting
in Nature, discovered that the volatile compounds activate five
defense genes in an uninfested plant.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the plants can differentiate between a mite
infestation and physical damage that might be caused, say, by being
stepped on. The compounds released by a damaged plant are ignored
by its neighbors.

BIG STAR, BIG FLOP? NOT IF BETTE HAS ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Bette Midler was addressing journalists via
satellite from a vacation spot in Florence, Italy, when a
questioner referred to a guest star in Midler's new comedy series
as Nathan Lane. He meant Danny DeVito and apologized profusely for
the gaffe. Too late. Damage was done. Executive producer Jeffrey
Lane, sitting in a hotel ballroom here facing reporters, buried his
face in his hands while director Andrew D. Weyman simply rolled his
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Midler looked befuddled and panicked, as though she'd somehow
been officially passed the mantle of The Big Star Jinx.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Lane stands as the latest and greatest casualty in the
networks' pitiful record of unsuccessful television ventures
involving big-name stars, and it's apparent that Midler, a
self-proclaimed ``TV virgin,'' wants to stay as far away from that
vibe as humanly possible.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck. ``Bette'' is slated for an October premiere on
CBS, and like Nathan Lane's ``Encore! Encore!,'' which seemed
doomed from the start, this sitcom is already going through cast
changes. Lindsay Lohan, the young actress playing Midler's
daughter, is gone after her parents decided not to move their
family from New York City to Los Angeles, where the series will be
shot.
</P>
<P>
   During the critics press tour, CBS was able to screen a
rough-cut 22-minute pilot episode, which shows Midler in her
current career paradox _ an aging actress fighting a
youth-obsessed, male-dominated business that's heartless at its
core. Known for her extraordinary _ and seemingly boundless _
energy and effervescence, Midler is at her animated best, using her
gifts for physical comedy and quite the wicked tongue to rip at the
surface phoniness of Hollywood. She even disses cinematic peers
like Sally Field. (There's a scene where Midler promises to beat
her to a pulp.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Bette,'' at least in its early form, is surprisingly thin
as a laugh-out-loud comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Lane says they will re-shoot some scenes, and Midler
appears sincere and passionate about making a sitcom that
challenges viewer expectations. But the series, which also stars
Kevin Dunn as Midler's understanding husband, Roy, and Joanna
Gleason as her agent and best bud, Connie, already looks
formula-driven, and like another misstep by a network that thinks
signing a big name to a sitcom deal means the work is done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're well aware of the notion that big-name stars merely
parachute into a series and everything supposedly falls into place
from there,'' Lane says. ``I can assure you, that hasn't been the
case here.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Midler: ``A lot of people came in and pitched very typical
sitcom situations. (The scripts) were a divorced mother with a
child struggling, a woman whose husband runs out on her and leaves
her holding the bag. The only person who really captured my voice
is Jeffrey Lane ... and when you can't do that, it makes it hard.
I've seen some who have tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Was she speaking of ``The Geena Davis Show,'' perhaps? Airing on
ABC, the series written around the Oscar winner offers the
well-worn premise of a fast-track career woman (Davis) who moves in
with a widower (Peter Horton) and his two children.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dialogue that's about as irreverent as ``Full
House,'' Horton, in his first comedy, is as stiff as a metal door.
He told critics during the show's panel that he was uncomfortable
within the setup/punch line sitcom formula, which explains it, but
I can't image the viewing audience cutting an actor slack for
learning on the job. Davis is far more fluid, which helps, since
she is in nearly every frame of the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   But the romantic chemistry between the two is nonexistent, and
there's nothing particularly interesting about the series that will
keep viewers from turning elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some things to do still,'' Davis says after her
panel, which got a polite reception from critics. Cast changes are
already under way.
</P>
<P>
   It's apparent that shows built around big-name stars are, from
the start, developed differently, and that's the problem. Instead
of beginning with an idea or premise and then working toward the
casting and the development of good scripts, networks often start
with an established star and work backward toward the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Networks continue to roll the dice on such productions because
the payoff could be huge, if successful. NBC did such a thing with
Bill Cosby in the '80s. Cosby had three straight series bombs
before ``The Cosby Show'' hit with audiences and saved a network's
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Davis, ABC is banking on Gabriel Byrne in the sitcom
``Madigan Men'' and Andre Braugher in the drama ``Gideon's
Crossing,'' about a dedicated doctor in a teaching hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``All too often,'' says Garth Ancier, president of NBC
Entertainment, ``you have someone else who has been a star on
television returning to television, and the audience is just not
that excited about seeing them. And they would rather discover
their own stars in a new way or see people used in a different way.
And it's certainly an expensive way of getting attention. Because
generally in the case of Davis, you're putting up 22 episodes at
$200,000 an episode as guarantee to do business with that star. And
then you develop the show after that.''
</P>
<P>
   When it works, the network programmer and producer look like
geniuses; when it doesn't ...
</P>
<P>
   In ``Encore! Encore!,'' which featured Nathan Lane as a
world-famous Italian opera star who returned to the family vineyard
in Napa, Calif., to sulk after his career abruptly ended, Ancier
says, ``As talented as Nathan Lane and the cast were, there was a
fundamental flaw structurally in doing a show set in a vineyard in
Napa Valley. Boy, is it hard to tell stories in Napa County, for an
ex-opera star.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC might be having the same problems with Michael Richards, the
first ``Seinfeld'' star to return to television in series form. The
pilot for ``The Michael Richards Show,'' with Richards cast as a
modern-day bumbling detective, has already been sent back to the
lab for re-shooting. Talking with Richards, who is a producer on
the series, didn't clear up much.
</P>
<P>
   When someone compared his start with that of Nathan Lane,
Richards responded, and rather tersely, ``Can't see how that
compares to us. We know exactly what we're doing, where we're
headed.''
</P>
<P>
   That must have been a recent phenomenon, since NBC had nothing
to show critics except for a short trailer of Richards driving down
a Los Angeles street and bursting into loud song to drown out a car
horn that won't go off. That was it.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Midler is far ahead of the game. And she's
returning to the early tradition of some TV sitcoms in which stars
play themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from that tradition, actually,'' says Midler, who, as
in the show, has one teen-age daughter. ``I'm probably the last
person in show business who does. I mean, my age is right and I
remember all those people as being, you know, real lights in my
life when I was a kid. So, yeah, we're close to getting this thing
in pretty good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ``Roseanne's'' John Goodman and his team of
producers. They have yet to come up with a title for his Fox
series, let alone how the basic concept will develop. It's about a
gay man and his son, but that's all we know since no pilot was
screened.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, slumped between his two producers during a news
conference, gave little indication that he was awake, let alone
bursting with creative ideas over his first lead vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Joking (at least one would hope), a producer finally asked the
crowd, ``Got any ideas?''

THE AVENGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Republicans are putting on smiley faces to avoid
the mistakes of Houston in 1992, when a conservative message more
chilling than compassionate turned voters away from the GOP.
Democrats are launching attack ads to rewrite the script from 1988,
when a Republican vice president won election by turning a harsh
spotlight on a Democratic governor's record. For both sides,
Campaign 2000 is a lot about avenging the past.
</P>
<P>
   How nasty will that make the politics of the present?
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of this campaign were planted 12 years ago, when
George Bush senior ran against Massachusetts governor Michael S.
Dukakis. The Bush team used Dukakis's liberal record to scare
voters, encountering scant resistance from the Democrats until it
was too late. Four years later, President Bush lost his shot at
reelection, after diatribes by hardline party conservatives at the
national convention pushed enough voters toward the Democrats to
send Bill Clinton to the White House for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Now the son of the former president is running for the country's
top office. As Republicans package George W. Bush for maximum
national consumption, Democrats are trying to untie the bow on the
glittering Bush giftbox before it leaves the City of Brotherly
Love.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee began the process on Sunday,
using a trade union hall as a base of operations for daily press
conferences. The first one featured a ``truth squad'' from the Lone
Star State which attacked the Bush record in Texas and then
unveiled hardhitting political ads.
</P>
<P>
   A succession of Texans blamed their governor for a host of ills,
including hungry Texan children denied breakfast because of Bush's
refusal to use already-allocated federal funding, air pollution so
bad ``we have soccer Moms who can't let their children play,'' and
even for the arthritis suffered by one very eloquent preacher who
rattled the rafters when he warned ``The Bushes are coming, the
Bushes are coming. We can't take it all over the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic ads attacking Bush and his running mate, Richard
Cheney, have a classic Willie Horton feel to them. They duplicate
the ominous-sounding tone that was used so brilliantly against
Dukakis in 1988, when Republicans turned a Massachusetts prison
furlough program into a litmus test on public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Democrats have not forgotten 1988. Many Gore campaign
operatives first learned the hard way about the power of negative
campaigning, from their Dukakis experience. But is their own
mastery of the politics of the smear a solution for the Bush who is
running against them in 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. The Democrats' problem is articulated quite
clearly by Molly Beth Malcolm, the chair of the Texas Democratic
Party: ``George Bush is a really nice guy,'' acknowledged Malcolm
at Sunday's DNC press conference. ``He was reelected because he was
popular.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duke was never really popular in the sense that voters
wanted to hang out with him. Supporting him was more like
swallowing medicine because you have to, not because you want to.
Bush, on the other hand, looks and sounds friendly. Painting him as
cold, callous, and uncaring will be a harder sell than it was with
the Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the difficulty of changing Governor Bush from a likable,
if slightly wild and crazy, Texas boy into an evil emperor, Vice
President Gore has a problem Vice President Bush never had. His
name is Bill Clinton. In 1988, George Bush was running to succeed
Ronald Reagan, practically a political icon. In 2000, Al Gore is
running to succeed a president whose personal flaws overshadow the
story of his political success.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons why the politics of 1988 may not work
for the Democrats in 2000. With so much negativity in Washington
over the last decade, it is hard to believe voters want more on the
campaign trail. But if Democrats give it to them, Republicans will
definitely give it back.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the main question for Campaign 2000 will be: How low can
they go? The politics of revenge has no limits.

W CRACKS THE WHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT 
c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PHILADELPHIA -- Behind the unity lies The Whip, the other
``W'' dominating this Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   On public education, The Whip cracked and all the delegates ran
to the center. On abortion, The Whip didn't crack and all the
delegates ran to the right. On immigration, The Whip cracked and
all the delegates ran back to the center.On gay rights, The Whip
didn't crack and all the delegates ran to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he gets here, George W. Bush is demonstrating that
happy, unified national conventions are not simply decreed. They
happen because they are fine-tuned; they are less the result of
power being exercised and more the result of a delicate balancing
act.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is elected president, it will all hold together. If he
loses, it will disintegrate in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   But on closer examination, the moves the Bush campaign has made
here demonstrate the nature of Bush's hold on the Republican Party,
as well as the nature of its hold on him. The party has yielded to
Bush on a good deal of domestic policy, but he has stayed true to
the conservative faith on tax cutting and social policy. It isn't a
formal pact but a tacit understanding, as the pre-convention
maneuvering by the Bushies among the more ideological rank-and-file
showed.
</P>
<P>
   Education and immigration are core Bush concerns, both on the
substance and as symbols that he really is a different kind of
Republican. Not a Democrat, mind you, but he has departed from
Reaganite dogma by supporting the US Education Department's
continued existence as well as more money for its basic aid
programs. He has also steered clear of the conservative movement
for so-called school choice; his own proposal would provide
vouchers only for the portion of school costs taken by federal aid
(less than 10 percent), and would only go directly to parents of
kids at a ``failing'' school after that school had ``failed'' for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Bush's well-known views, there was a serious effort
to stiff him in the party's platform committee. The leader, Cheryl
Williams of Oklahoma, asserted The Gipper's legacy, arguing that
locally controlled education was a bedrock goal of ``our
revolution'' and had been so for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Left alone, the committee and the convention would have voted
with her, but the Bush platform big shots, Senator Bill Frist of
Tennessee and Representative Sue Myrick of North Carolina, quickly
mobilized committee members, a solid majority of whom were picked
only after they pledged to follow campaign guidance. When The Whip
cracked, it wasn't debating points that moved them to vote down a
change, it was discipline.
</P>
<P>
   On immigration, this is again a core Bush matter, in fact a good
clue to his basic decency as a person. Unlike the party of four
years ago _ chastened by disaster in diverse California and no
longer home to Pat Buchanan _ this year's GOP is prepared to
welcome legal immigrants in the Reagan spirit. The Bush platform
draft did so, and also dropped the '96 language calling for
withdrawal of automatic citizenship rights for the children of
illegals.
</P>
<P>
   The one vestige of Anglo chauvinism remains language. Against
Bush's wishes, they insisted on another in-your-face call for
English to be officially recognized as the US tongue, but The Whip
was cracked and the word ``official'' was deleted from the
exhortation.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite happened on social issues. A reception for gay
Republicans got token Bush recognition only _ conservative
talkmistress Mary Matalin. And The Whip never cracked when the
delegates went to work on the Bush platform draft.
</P>
<P>
   The center of public opinion has thankfully shifted in the last
eight years, most notably leading to Bush's own support of
President Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy and Al Gore's
forthright support of a complete end to official bigotry. But Bush
did nothing here when his delegates insisted on declaring
homosexuality ``incompatible'' with military service.
</P>
<P>
   Worse was the passivity of the Bush campaign when they also
insisted on denying sexual preference any legal protection or
standing _ an open invitation for employers and landlords to
discriminate.
</P>
<P>
   The Whip was also hidden while abortion rights were being
shredded. The Bush acquiescence to the retention of the platform's
Reagan era call for a no-exceptions Constitutional amendment and
for the appointment of only right-to-life judges is well known. And
his selection of running mate Dick Cheney underscores his hardline
opposition to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of efforts by a small group of pro-choice GOP women
was thus pre-ordained, but there was a revealing end to the ritual
late Friday night. An astute move by pro-choicer Candy Stone of New
Jersey forced two votes in committee, one to ``recognize and
respect'' Republicans who disagree, the other to ``welcome'' those
on all sides of the issue to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Recognition and respect was of course voted down by the Bush
forces. But in a confused moment the committee approved the
welcome, 56-36. Suddenly horror swept the room as the Bushies
realized their error. A second vote was quickly arranged, and by a
show of hand the welcome was withdrawn in favor of the traditional,
intentionally demeaning ``tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, platforms are nearly meaningless, but watching
nominees micromanage them shows their priorities. The lesson this
year is that Bush's domestic policy stands matter to him, but that
he is willing to countenance anti-gay discrimination and to work to
end abortion rights. Gentler perhaps, but not kinder.

GOOD TICKET PLANS STILL AVAILABLE FOR SYDNEY OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 6) 
 By JOSEPH SIANO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time, something that many Olympic athletes compete against, has
turned out to be a friend to Americans thinking of going to the
Summer Games in Sydney next month. Those who have waited before
buying package tours to the Games, which officially open Sept. 15
and continue to Oct. 1, will find cheaper plans than were available
several months ago _ in some cases, the savings are about 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   At least one U.S. tour operator has cut prices on his premium
packages by nearly half, while the main tour seller has come up
with lower-priced packages to help fill rooms on Sydney's distant
outskirts that might otherwise stay empty.
</P>
<P>
   Cartan Tours, (800) 818-1998, on the Web at www.cartan.com, the
official distributor of Olympics tickets in this country, says that
it has sold out all of its packages with accommodations in Sydney
during the middle week of the three departures Cartan offers, but
they are still for sale for the first and third weeks. Those
packages _ which include six nights' accommodations in a four-star
hotel, daily breakfast, round-trip air fare from the West Coast and
tickets to events on five days _ start at around $6,850 a person,
double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cartan has not trimmed the prices of these packages,
Don Williams, its vice president for sales and marketing, said that
weak demand for hotel rooms in the Blue Mountains _ about 90
minutes by train from the main Olympic site in Sydney _ led the
company to create one-week packages for $3,349 a person, double,
available each week of the Games. ``Because the properties were
outside Sydney, people weren't responding to them,'' Williams said
in a telephone interview July 18. ``And these are properties we had
secured and paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   As of mid-July, he said, Cartan had sold complete Olympic
packages to 3,000 people, and had filled tickets-only orders for
another 7,000 customers. ``We're still holding a good supply of
tickets, but we have to supply the families of the American
athletes,'' Williams said. Trials to determine the American track
and field team, for example, were going on as he spoke. But he
added that the public could still buy tickets for most events
except the opening ceremony, the gold-medal men's basketball game
and most swimming finals. Prices range from about $35 for
preliminaries in many sports to around $265 for finals.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Cartan, the Sydney organizing committee's Web site,
www.olympics.com, is also an outlet for ticket sales. Tickets
bought on the Web must be picked up by the person who ordered them,
and only at a box office in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Tuchman, president of Tuchman Sports Enterprises, a New
York City company specializing in sports tours for corporate
clients, has been finding the Olympic-tours sales race somewhat
tougher than Cartan. ``Since the program started a year ago,
package-tour sales have been lower than we expected, he said,
attributing the weak response to the long flight to Sydney (almost
15 hours nonstop from Los Angeles), the fact that the Games are
starting just as the school year begins _ restricting trips by
families _ and the fact that many of his corporate clients would
rather wait a few weeks and go to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've cut our prices practically in half,'' Tuchman said.
Since these were created for corporate-level clients, who generally
seek higher levels of comfort and convenience, the costs still are
relatively high, though competitive with Cartan's deals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Tuchman's Silver Package includes round-trip air
fare from Los Angeles, six nights in a one-bedroom apartment in the
Woolloomooloo area of Sydney and tickets to a minimum of six events
over five days; in addition, there are four nights in New Zealand
(two in Christchurch and two in Auckland). It's now $7,560 a
person, double occupancy, after starting at $14,850. A package with
seven nights in Sydney, with tickets to at least nine events in
five days, but no New Zealand trip, is $8,495 a person, double; it
originally was $16,695.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that if you wait until mid-August, companies like
mine are going to drop their prices even further,'' Tuchman said.
Contact his company at (877) 621-5243; www.esuperfan.com.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. tour operators still have a good selection of
rooms left, travelers who want to make all their own arrangements
will have to be savvy hotel hunters. The best bet is the
residential accommodation program run by the Ray White real estate
agency, (61-2) 9262-3700 or on the Web at www.raywhite.net, the
only such program sanctioned by the Sydney Olympic committee. The
simplest homes rent for $54 to $118 a night per bedroom, depending
on location; the most luxurious are $139 and up per bedroom per
night.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who want to buy extra tickets once they arrive in Sydney
should find many available, according to Rachel Crowley, a
spokeswoman in Los Angeles for the Australian Tourist Commission.
``The organizers are expecting that approximately a million tickets
will be available as the Games begin,'' she said in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   John O'Neill, the ticketing communications manager for the
Games, said that some ``super tickets,'' premium-priced tickets to
the most popular events, may be released for sale later on. And big
spenders can buy private boxes in the three main arenas. For about
$109,000, for example, you get a box seating 14 people for every
event in the main stadium, with private dining, air-conditioning, a
telephone and a TV.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, last-minute ticket shopping can yield gold-medal
results. Two weeks before the 1980 Winter Games in Lake Placid,
N.Y., I was still able to buy a ticket for the game on the morning
of the final day of the hockey tournament. Thinking that this game
would determine the bronze medal winner _ about the best shot
anyone would give the U.S. team before the Games _ I was satisfied.
As it turned out, I did see the Americans play _ and beat Finland
to clinch the gold medal.

AMERICAN INFLUENCES HELP REDEFINE PRACTICE OF YOGA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Science Times) 
 By ANN POWERS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ Many of America's masters recently descended upon
the Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health here for a conference on
``The New American Yoga.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually anyone who has bought a book or video, attended a
workshop, or unfurled a mat in a major studio would have recognized
someone here. This was as close to a summit meeting as yoga has
come.
</P>
<P>
   Erich Schiffmann of Los Angeles, the star of a best-selling yoga
video featuring Ali McGraw, declared the conference a ``power
spot.'' Sharon Gannon and David Life, the founders of the favored
rock star hangout, Jivamukti Yoga in Manhattan, came to teach and
stump for animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans like the Bay Area's Rama Jyoti Vernon mingled with
younger masters like Baron Baptiste, who teaches power yoga on
ESPN. Other yoga teaching stars included Rod Stryker, Don
Stapleton, Judith Lasater, Todd Norian and John Friend.
</P>
<P>
   The group represented the scope of approaches, from sweaty
``strong'' yoga to tension-melting restorative poses, that are
taking yoga beyond the confines of the counterculture to the
mainstream of American fitness. They came to stretch and breathe
with eager students in the weekend's daily classes, but more
important, they came to discover what their approaches had in
common, and how they might add up to a definition of American yoga.
</P>
<P>
   These leading lights had one thing in common: none were of
Indian descent. Most had studied with Indian masters, including the
now-elderly triumvirate of BKS Iyengar, K. Pattabhi Jois, and Sri
TKV Desikachar, whose principles of precision, heat and healing
still dominate the discipline. But as they devised their own
styles, the Americans mixed their knowledge with native experience
to create the wide-ranging approach that has caught on today.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '60s and '70s, a number of swamis came to the U.S., and
there was an emphasis on the spiritual side of yoga,'' said Kathryn
Arnold, editor of Yoga Journal, the unofficial organ of American
yoga, in an interview during the conference. ``The philosophy was
more integrated into the asana practice,'' she said, referring to
posture. ``They've all gone away, basically, or they've really
aged. And there's been this inheritance of the yoga by the
Americans themselves. And so we are redefining it. ''
</P>
<P>
   Indian teachers still influence American yoga. Integral, the
school led by Swami Satchidananda from his ashram in Yogaville,
Va., has dozens of schools nationwide. Bikram Choudhury's hot yoga
technique is popular in Hollywood. Yet like American Buddhism, the
yoga shaped by Western-born teachers has its own attributes. Its
practical, world-friendly character is having an impact on
Americans who would never visit an ashram.
</P>
<P>
   Yoga Journal says that 12 million people practice hatha yoga,
the physical limb of a system that also includes ethics, breath
work and meditation. Instructors here have combined different
strains of Indian yoga to suit modern American tastes. Many have
been drawn by the athletic ashtanga-based styles that have become
popular here.
</P>
<P>
   Others prefer gentler therapeutic styles like Kripalu. Americans
are sticking to their yoga mats long after tae-bo videos have been
buried in the closet. Indeed, yoga is so popular that a group of
longtime leading practitioners, the Yoga Alliance, has formed to
explore criteria for certification.
</P>
<P>
   To say American yoga is just aerobics with chanting misses a
large reason for its popularity. For many, the practice is
spiritual, or at least psychological. Books like Schiffmann's
``Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving Into Stillness'' are as
popular as old-fashioned self-help tomes. People who once turned to
therapy now seek inner peace from teachers who simultaneously help
them tone their abs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bifurcation in the psychotherapy world, as a result
of managed care in this country,'' said Stephen Cope, a Kripalu
teacher, psychotherapist and the author of ``Yoga and the Quest for
the True Self.'' ``You've got managed care, very focused on
medication, with short-term time limits on psychotherapy. Then you
have this whole stream of people, the so-called worried well, with
their spiritual quests, their desire to be fully alive, their
attempts to be in better relationships. Where are they taking that?
They're not taking it to psychotherapy any more, because they can't
afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Americans use the yoga mat as a therapist's couch, and often, as
a church pew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our culture really likes the physical stuff,'' said John
Abbott, the publisher of Yoga Journal. ``We're all ingrained from
the earliest age that it's good to do exercise. And then you find
this, wow, this is more than exercise. This is something about
living.''
</P>
<P>
   The ecumenical approach that so well serves American attitudes
is new in yoga. In the 1960s and 1970s, yoga practitioners came in
two varieties. Either they were health nuts at the YMCA,
uninterested in yogic philosophy, or they were serious disciples
who took Indian names, wore bright or white robes, and followed
gurus.
</P>
<P>
   But the guru paradigm has largely crashed and burned.
Communities like Kripalu, whose guru, Amrit Desai, left in scandal
in 1995 after 20 years, are having to reinvent themselves. Kripalu
has thrived as a self-defined post-guru community, training
hundreds of nonsectarian teachers per year. The model based around
a charismatic leader often led to egotism and corruption and
students fled disillusioned. In addition, many Americans grew wary
of adopting a culture that was not their own. ``Most of the major
ashrams did fall,'' said Sudhir Jonathan Foust, Kripalu's director
of curriculum. ``Maybe because of the sensitivity of these
particular cultures, they were the first to fall. But they weren't
the only ones. In the Catholic Church, in synagogues, in schools,
no question in government _ it's almost like our society won't
tolerate that structure any more. Which has set us up for this new
paradigm of experimentation.''
</P>
<P>
   As secular America has opened up to new notions of the inner
life, through therapeutic practices and New Age conjectures, the
seekers of the counterculture have been coming down to earth. These
two paths met in the middle in the physical practice of yoga,
especially as it was transmitted to today's leading teachers by
Indians like B.K.S. Iyengar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just coming out of the '60s change-your-consciousness
thing, and many of us were in our heads, and wanting to meditate,
and reach samadhi,'' said Patricia Walden, a renowned teacher and
longtime student of Iyengar, referring to enlightenment. ``Iyengar
was like, `Stand on your feet. Feel your feet.' He was so
practical. His famous quote was, `How can you know God if you don't
know your big toe?'''
</P>
<P>
   The major question for American yoga is how to reconnect God and
that big toe.
</P>
<P>
   The Kripalu conference often felt like a strictly religious
gathering, with chanting, meditation, and talks like Schiffmann's,
which extrapolated on basic Eastern ideas of nonduality, and
Gannon's, a discourse on the relationship between ahimsa, the Hindu
ethic of nonharming, and animal rights. The last question Foust
asked the gathered teachers, at a closing panel, was, ``Do you
believe enlightenment is possible?'' Everyone answered yes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the teachers stood united in anti-sectarianism. ``There's
more of a cross-pollination of the practices,'' Abbott said. ``In
the Indian tradition, gurus have their yoga and only their yoga.
Here, there's good communication among teachers, and the students
feel comfortable going from one place to the other. That's very
American, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists may consider the turn away from ashrams and
gurus a caveat to the capitalist truism that whatever sells is
good. Friend addressed this accusation in his keynote speech,
standing up for eclecticism on the grounds that any spiritual
influence is better than none at all. Yet he pointed out that
teachers and students both needed to challenge themselves to go
deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wear a deity on your T-shirt or have one in your home,
maybe find out what it means,'' Friend joked, hinting at the
proliferation of blue-skinned Krishna prints on today's fashion
runways.

INTERLOPER ANTS BUILD A SUPERCOLONY IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
  (Science Times) 
 By JON CHRISTENSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ In a quirk of evolution and genetics, Argentine ants
are overwhelming native California ants while forming what
scientists believe may be the biggest ant colony in the world,
stretching more than 600 miles from San Diego to north of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The ants in this so-called supercolony are so genetically
similar that different colonies do not fight with one another the
way they do in their homeland. As a result, they are using a united
family front to win territory from native ants.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, where they are known as sugar ants, different
nests of the fiercely territorial ants fight with one another,
competing for food and space. An ant that wanders into the
territory of another colony just 50 yards away will quickly be torn
apart by workers, which recognize the peculiar odor of a rival. But
in California, scientists found that they could take a worker from
San Diego and put it in a colony from San Francisco and it would be
welcomed like a kissing cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Using the same DNA fingerprinting techniques used in paternity
cases, scientists at the University of California at San Diego
looked at the genetic differences between ants in Argentina and
California. They discovered more than twice as much genetic
diversity among Argentine ants in their native range compared with
those in California.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports and museum samples showed that Argentine ants
first came to the United States aboard ships carrying coffee and
sugar from South America during the 1890s. The scientists concluded
that the relatively small immigrant populations created a ``genetic
bottleneck,'' choking off genetic diversity. The small founding
populations represented less than half the genetic diversity of the
species.
</P>
<P>
   That has made almost all Argentine ants in California similar
enough that they can no longer distinguish between close kin and
ants from other nests, a critical mechanism in the evolution of
social insects. So instead of defending separate territories, the
ants behave like a single fluid colony in their new territory.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Argentine ants appear to have mellowed out among
themselves in California and are mostly just a nuisance to humans,
they ruthlessly kill and displace native ants, some of which are 20
times as large as the Argentines. The effects of the invasion
ripple through the ecosystem. Some plants, like tree poppies,
depend on native ants for seed dispersal. And large native
harvester ants make up more than 90 percent of the diet of coastal
horned lizards, commonly known as horny toads and a candidate for
the endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
   Ted J. Case, a biologist at the University of California at San
Diego, has spent much of his career studying population changes
among reptiles on islands and in isolated patches of natural
habitat like parks in suburban California.
</P>
<P>
   When a statewide survey of reptiles and amphibians found a
precipitous decline in the population of coastal horned lizards,
Case thought that changes in the lizard's food base might be
involved. So he pulled together a team of scientists and students
to study the tiny Argentine ants, which are about a fifth of an
inch long.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA detective work capped a five-year investigation of the
ecology, behavior and genetics of the ants. By comparing Argentine
ants in their native and invaded ranges, the scientists solved an
intriguing puzzle in the increasingly important field of invasion
biology. Most invasive species move into a territory that has been
opened up by changes in habitat and local extinction of native
species, Case said. But in the case of Argentine ants, a genetic
change set off changes in behavior and colony structure that
enabled the invader to conquer new territory by eliminating native
species.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the huge supercolony of Argentine ants in
California continues to pose an unsolved riddle about the evolution
of so-called unicolonial insects, which act as single colonies over
large areas. And it raises the creepy possibility of an insect
world dominated by invasive unicolonial species.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists play down that possibility. The loss of genetic
diversity is generally considered to be detrimental to the survival
of a species, said Neil Tsutsui, a graduate student who did the
genetics research in Case's laboratory. The loss of kinship
recognition is an even bigger problem for social insects, he said.
The only way female workers, which make up the bulk of the colony,
can ensure that their genes are passed on to future generations is
by protecting closely related queens. So it is assumed that workers
work only for queens that share their genes. But if workers cannot
distinguish between their kin and any other ants, they end up
working for the whole supercolony. And then there is no way for
natural selection to favor any one queen and her workers over any
other in the colony.
</P>
<P>
   If unicolonial insects were successful in the grand sweep of
evolutionary time, Case said, they would probably appear more
often. Unicoloniality may be useful in the short term, as it is for
Argentine ants and some other invasive ants, he said, but in the
long run it appears to be an evolutionary dead end because social
behavior could not evolve.
</P>
<P>
   That is little consolation for residents of Southern California,
where the small dark brown and black Argentine ants are the No. 1
pest that extermination companies are called upon to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, it took a week for researchers to even find the
ants in Argentina. ``It was eye-opening to see how inconspicuous
they were in Argentina,'' Case said. ``Even in areas where they're
relatively common, they're not dominant. They're not a pest. So
then the question was, what has enabled them to be so successful
here?''
</P>
<P>
   In California, the researchers have no trouble finding ants to
study. There are Argentine ants invading the chaparral-covered
ocean bluffs around the University of California at San Diego.
There are Argentine ants scurrying along cracks in sidewalks on
campus. And there are Argentine ants swarming by the elevator on
the ground floor of the biology building.
</P>
<P>
   Although colleagues have joked that the researchers have aided
and abetted the invasion, Case's lab keeps its ants under strict
control, in plastic tubs coated with a slippery Teflon-like
substance that ants cannot climb. The lips of tubs are coated with
a sticky substance that traps any ants that might find a trail to
the top. In the lab, different colonies of Argentine ants are
connected by plastic tubing to common foraging areas _ tubs with
water and food.
</P>
<P>
   By not fighting among themselves, Argentine ants in the
supercolony gain a competitive advantage over other ants, said
David Holway, a postdoctoral researcher who designed experiments to
test the supercolony's advantage over colonies that fight with one
another. The experiments showed that Argentine ants that cooperated
with one another produced more than three times the brood and more
than twice as many workers as colonies that fought with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments also showed the advantage the supercolony ants
had over native ants. The Argentine ants get to food faster,
overwhelm rivals with sheer numbers of workers, and defend their
territory with chemical weapons they spray on opponents. ``The
Argentine ants win in a few days,'' Andrew Suarez, a graduate
student, said with grim admiration. Suarez's family came from
Argentina, and his grandmother put up the research team members
when they studied the ants there.
</P>
<P>
   He said the experimental results helped explain why some parts
of California that were once home to as many as 20 different
species of ants now contained as few as two: Argentine ants and a
native species that is active in the winter, when the Argentine
ants are less active.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say, 'Big deal; you're just replacing some ants
with others,''' Suarez said. ``But the thing is, you're displacing
20 species. And all the roles they play are wiped out: dispersing
seeds, pollinating plants, providing food for other animals. All
the functions are totally lost when Argentine ants move in.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and neighbors often ask the researchers how to deal with
Argentine ants in their homes. Because their research indicates
that lack of moisture is the only factor that seems to limit the
spread of Argentine ants, they suggest a simple solution: replacing
lush lawns with desert landscaping. ``You wouldn't have them if
there were native plants and cactus and San Diego looked like it
should,'' Suarez said.
</P>
<P>
   In their research papers, the scientists have also suggested
that more Argentine ants could be introduced to California to
increase their genetic diversity so that the ants would again fight
with one another and contain their own populations. But they
conceded that it was an academic idea unlikely to be practical. Any
introduced populations would probably be quickly wiped out by the
supercolony, Tsutsui said.
</P>
<P>
   Case's laboratory is collaborating with scientists at Clorox who
are studying the chemicals that ants smell to identify nest mates.
If they could create a chemical that identifies ants as enemies of
the supercolony, they might be able to spray the chemical on half
of the colony and let the Argentine ants fight to the death.
</P>
<P>
   Another more grim possibility is that another invasive species
could offer some competition for the Argentine ants. In the
southeastern United States, imported red fire ants seem to have
limited the spread of Argentine ants. The fire ants come from the
same South American habitat as the Argentine ants. And they are
also an invasive unicolonial species. But unlike Argentine ants,
which spread slowly without help from humans and took a century to
spread throughout most of coastal California, fire ant queens and
winged males take nuptial flights and establish new far-flung
colonies. They have invaded California just in the last few years.
And they are even meaner than Argentine ants.
</P>
<P>
   Case is chagrined to see another invasive species come to
California. Especially one that bites, he said. But he and his
colleagues are also students of invasions and species change. And
the coming showdown between Argentine and fire ants will offer
another opportunity to study an invasion as it happens.

CRUISE SHIPS AND THE DISABLED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Canada, Bahamas)   (For release Sunday, August 6)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, Tammy Stevens of Jacksonville, Fla., who
uses a wheelchair, booked a three-night cruise to the Bahamas
aboard Premier Cruises' Oceanic, a 35-year-old ship sailing out of
Port Canaveral. Although she said she was assured by her travel
agent and the line that her cabin aboard the Oceanic, also
identified as the Big Red Boat I, was wheelchair-accessible, she
found it was not.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said she wrote Premier to complain and was given a
certificate for a 50 percent discount on a future cruise. After
that, she began to look for a lawyer. Her subsequent legal action
passed a watershed on June 11, when the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Atlanta ruled that the Americans With Disabilities Act applies to
``places of public accommodation'' aboard cruise ships, even
foreign-flagged cruise ships if they are in U.S. ports or waters.
</P>
<P>
   This marked the first court decision in which the provisions of
the disabilities civil rights act, which is just 10 years old, were
declared to apply to foreign-flag vessels owned by foreign
corporations. The only American-flagged ocean cruise ship, the
Independence, owned by American Hawaii Cruises, was declared a
``place of public accommodation'' under the act last year by a
court in Hawaii. The Justice Department says it has not received
complaints about ferries, lake and river vessels in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida decision comes years, probably at least five, before
the Department of Transportation and the Department of Justice are
likely to complete any guidelines for accessibility on oceangoing
ships. On this basis, among others, Premier's lawyers are asking
for a rehearing by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opinion as written,'' the Premier petition said, ``will
have a significant effect on virtually the entire cruise and
shipping industry, a major revenue source for the State of Florida
and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the court has misinterpreted the ADA to apply to
vessels,'' said Gary E. Davidson, a lawyer for Premier in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers on both sides acknowledge that the 3-0 ruling by a
panel of the appeals court is unlikely to be reheard, and it is
possible that Tammy Stevens vs. Premier Cruises may go to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelchair accessibility on cruise ships is a complex issue.
About the time Stevens took her cruise, a federal agency known as
the Access Board was forming an advisory committee to discuss what
sort of rule might be proposed. The committee includes
representatives of the cruise industry, and such consultations are
drawn out. The committee is scheduled to report to the Access Board
on Nov. 17. The board will then ponder a recommendation to the
Department of Transportation. After more public comment, a rule
would become final. If the pattern in other areas _ hotels, for
example _ is followed, ships entering service after a certain date
would have to meet the criteria right away and older ships would
get longer to make ``readily achievable'' adaptations.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Beatty, who calls himself project manager for the Access
Board, points out conflicts likely to impede proposed rules. Safety
laws for ships require ledges and sealable barriers to keep water
from flowing everywhere if the hull is pierced. No one wants to
reduce safety at sea, yet the difficulties for wheelchair users are
apparent when one notes that the formal name of the Access Board is
the Architectural Barriers and Transportation Compliance Committee.
Further, Beatty said, you could create a series of protective
devices that would be pointless if the boat heeled, as a sailboat
inevitably does and even a big cruise vessel sometimes may.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty and others note that market forces have brought improved
accessibility, mainly on new vessels, built with an awareness that
future customers are to be found among graying baby boomers.
Elevators, selected cabins with extra-wide entrance and toilet
doors, roll-in showers and closets with pull-down rods are found on
new ships. Older ships are hard to fix, and as the ADA unfolded in
the '90s, retrofitting proved the most difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The Oceanic, built in 1965, is an older ship. In her complaint,
Stevens said she saw an ad for a three-night cruise aboard the
Oceanic and decided to buy a cruise for her mother, herself and two
other family members for Mother's Day. She said in an interview she
was told there were four ``handicapped cabins,'' one of them
wheelchair accessible, and it was booked for Mother's Day. Stevens
shifted her date to get the cabin, and said she had to pay more
than the advertised starting price of $349 for it. The
accessibility was limited to a ramp over the ledge on the bathroom
door, she said, but the toilet was so close to the door that she
could not get to it in her wheelchair. She was forced to use a
bucket or have her guests lift her onto the commode, she said, and
bathe from a bucket or be lifted into and out of the shower.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' lawyers, Jennifer L. Augspurger and Arlene Karin Kline
of Boca Raton, initially sued for deceptive practices under Florida
law and for an injunction under the federal disability law. The
Department of Justice supported a revised complaint. Officials
there and advocates for the disabled consider the facts in the case
appropriate for a court test of the applicability of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 complaint identified Premier as a Canadian corporation,
but Davidson said that the line was a Cayman Islands corporation
then, and is now a Bermuda corporation. The Big Red Boat I
continues to list itself as Bahamian, one of the more popular
``flags of convenience'' used by virtually all oceangoing cruise
vessels visiting the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Premier has been discussing the case with other companies and
the International Council of Cruise Lines, an association
representing 17 lines in the North American market. A spokeswoman
for this organization said no conclusion had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board recently
renewed efforts to get cruise ships to enhance their smoke
detectors so they emit a sound in the area where smoke is found. At
present, fire alarms register on the navigation bridge, and a
general alarm is sounded by an officer there. The safety board said
that in 1996 and 1997 fires the time elapsed led to six deaths and
77 injuries from smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea
required that smoke detectors be installed by 1997, but not that an
alarm sound in the area. In 1997, the safety board recommended the
change, to no effect, and an effort before an international body
earlier this year failed. Jim Hall, the safety board chairman, said
that the cruise companies had failed to deal in good faith with the
problem of cruise ship fires, which ``continue to occur with
troubling regularity.''
</P>
<P>
   The cruise line council said the sensitivity of the detectors
would lead to false alarms, and passengers might ignore a real
alarm. It said there were ``technical and operational drawbacks''
to the recommendations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I've just turned up Powell when a young woman
flags me from the front of Max's. She's in her 30s and wears a long
white coat. Some man is standing to the side of her, talking, with
his hands in his pockets. I pull up and she turns from him and gets
right in. Where to, miss? I ask her. She looks at me and seems very
flustered.
</P>
<P>
   ``What in the hell did he think I looked like?'' she says. We
are still stopped. I look at her in the rearview. ```I'm just
standing there, minding my own business,'' she says, ``when this
guy comes right up to me and tells me he'll pay me $60'' for a sex
act.
</P>
<P>
   I don't say a word, but I shake my head side to side. Then she
tells me the hotel she wants to go to.
</P>
<P>
   I tell her I think it's an unfortunate incident. ``Do I look
like a hooker?'' she says. No, I tell her, but you were standing in
a spot where they are sometimes, particularly at this hour. ``This
is the first time that has ever happened to me in my life,'' she
says. We arrive at the place and she pays me. As she starts to
exit, I tell her, ``Miss, I'm not telling you this to ruin your
evening, but this hotel was once a house of prostitution _ around
1900. Or so the story goes.'' She doesn't say a word, gets out and
goes right in the door.
</P>
<P>
   There's one thing that's obvious when you're driving a taxi: I
hear views. On just about everything. This lets me question whether
my own thoughts have any merit. Some people are always unhappy.
Others are so happy all the time you think they're a little out of
it. Younger people are generally happier than older people. Women
seem to be happier than men. I see so many down-and-out souls and
wonder what keeps them going. I see severely handicapped people
living in the street and wonder what kind of society tolerates
that. I see people actually living on quarters and wonder how
that's possible. I put 240 hours a month on this job to pay my
bills, but I have a lot of energy. I see that a lot of society
doesn't. What if I run out of energy?
</P>
<P>
   It's been an exhausting morning. I head to my favorite gas
station before going in. If you think prices are high at your pump,
you should see what the cab companies charge us.
</P>
<P>
   I pull in and look for an open spot. I'm never the only cab
there. I yell out my pump number for the guy to turn it on and I
start thinking about how much I'm looking forward to going home to
rest. Suddenly this young man yells from the next pump over, ``Taxi
driver! Hey, taxi driver! I want to talk to you.'' He comes toward
me. He's wearing a red Pendleton shirt and scans the place as he
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxi man,'' he says once he's by my cab, ``you know you're out
there on the streets at night with many strange people. You need
protection.'' I ask what kind of protection he's talking about. He
looks around, then opens his shirt. He points to this huge knife
still in his waistband. What's that? I ask him. He pulls it out and
gives it to me. I take it out of the sheath. It's about a
foot-and-a-half long with a saw blade and jagged teeth on one side
and a razor edge on the other. The handgrip has stainless steel
knuckles built in.
</P>
<P>
   He takes it back. ``They give you trouble,'' he says, then he
circles my gut with it. ``Or two slices, one on each side of the
neck, takes a man down. I want twenty for it.'' I take it back.
Sold, I tell him, and throw it on my front seat. I tell him it's
the type of knife Maximus needed in the arena in ``Gladiator.'' The
movie, you know? ``I haven't seen that one,'' he says. In an
instant, he's gone. I pay for the gas and exit. Later, I look
closely at the blade. It says, ``Frost Cutlery. Surgical Steel.''
Who knows where he got it? But it fits in my briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   I'm in the bus zone dropping three young men off at the Mitchell
Brothers when a young dancer there comes out and gets in my cab.
Just as she does, one of the security men at the place flags an
out-of-town cab, calls her over and tells her, ``Get in this cab.''
I jump out and tell him he can't do that. It's illegal for
out-of-town cabs to pick up fares in this city and you know it, I
tell him.
</P>
<P>
   A tall young man in a green coat says, ``Mind your own business.
We're security here so take off.'' Of course he uses stronger
language. The second guy starts laughing and says, ``We do it all
the time because you
</P>
<P>
   guys are such scum.'' The younger one starts approaching me in a
menacing manner when his buddy calls him off. We're scum? That's
what you call us after bringing thousands of fares to this place?
The guy in the green coat kicks my cab. I'm pissed as I drive off.
I suppose I could stop by a police station, but instead I just jot
a note down on my SFO stubs and forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm driving in an area I used to live in a few years back. As I
approach Laurel shopping center, a young boy in front of Noah's
Bagels puts his hand up. He can't be more than 12. ``Jackson near
Fillmore,'' he says, jumping in. We take off and I ask how it's
going. ``It was going pretty good until I did some bad Web trades
on my dad's account.'' I ask him what happened. ``I bought a bunch
of stocks this morning, like Qualcomm, Etoys, and they all went
down badly.'' I ask if he's trading on the Internet. Yes, he tells
me. I ask him if his dad knows he's doing this. ``No, not yet. He
won't be home till Monday. Can you make a left up here, then a
right on Washington? I want to drive by my mom's first.''
</P>
<P>
   On Washington he asks me to slow down. ``She's not home,'' he
says as we pass this house at a crawl. We turn back. I ask him how
bad the hit was. ``About $16,000,'' he says. I ask if he has
liquidated the trades yet. ``No, I'm going to wait to see what
happens tomorrow.'' I tell him that's his second mistake. We stop,
he pays me and says, ``They've never gone down on me before.'' I
tell him he should tell his dad, then I wish him luck. He'll need
it.

HOW CLEAN IS THE SURF? IT'S OFTEN HARD TO KNOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.J., Calif.)   (For release Sunday, August 6)  
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three years after the Environmental Protection
Agency launched a broad program to better protect the public from
the hazards of sewage and other pollution at beaches, there has
been only scattered progress on a number of fronts.
</P>
<P>
   With the summer recreation season now at its peak, it is still
difficult for people in many places to find out at a particular
time whether the local water is clean enough for safe swimming.
Some states have improved notification procedures and some have
tightened standards for testing water for pathogens, but others
have not.
</P>
<P>
   Many people never consider that the surf may not always be clean
enough to swim in, and data collected by the EPA shows that
problems are widespread. In its latest annual survey of both coasts
and the Great Lakes region, the agency found that state and local
authorities closed or posted warnings at 459 beaches at least once
last year _ almost one out of four of the 1,891 beaches surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency's data showed that
California had 182 beaches reporting at least one closure or
warning during 1999. That's far more than the runners-up, Florida
with 48 and Illinois with 46. New Jersey had 19, and New York 11.
But state-to-state comparisons are difficult, because different
states have different rules for testing the waters and responding
to the test results.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said that the percent of beaches with polluted water
was ``essentially the same as last year.'' Amy Gambrill, an
official in the agency's water office, said the main problem was
bacteria in the water coming from sewage overflows and runoffs
after storms.
</P>
<P>
   Many beaches are frequently contaminated when untreated sewage
flows into the ocean, carrying a variety of bacteria, viruses,
protozoa and parasites that can cause illnesses ranging from
diarrhea to hepatitis. The contamination can last for several days
after each overflow.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the agency has been trying to accomplish for the
last three years to protect the public remains undone. About a
third of the local jurisdictions surveyed have not yet adopted the
EPAs criteria for monitoring water quality, which call for testing
five times a month for E. coli (at freshwater beaches, such as the
Great Lakes) and enterococcus bacteria (in ocean waters). At 5
percent of beaches, the water is sampled only after heavy rains or
known spills.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the agency will propose tighter standards against
sewage overflows. It recently completed its final storm-water
regulations to better control runoff after heavy rains. Both steps
should lead to fewer spills.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has also ordered the agency to come up with
new offshore ocean water-quality standards, similar to those that
govern freshwater rivers and lakes. By next spring the EPA expects
to complete new guidelines for states on beach water quality. But
all these regulations will take time to go into full force.
Meanwhile, Congress has not acted on legislation, under
consideration for several years, that would require state and local
governments to follow uniform standards and make public
announcements whenever beach waters are polluted.
</P>
<P>
   In most parts of the country there is no simple and reliable way
for vacationers to find out about water quality at individual
beaches. The EPA generally recommends that people call the local
department of public health or state department of natural
resources. Agency officials said that people should avoid swimming
shortly after heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Beaches Council, a nonprofit organization, has what it
calls a Blue Wave program under which it has certified 30 beaches
in seven states as meeting its criteria for water quality and other
standards. The organization works with state and local
environmental authorities to verify compliance and lists certified
beaches at www.cleanbeaches.org.
</P>
<P>
   Some states _ notably California, under a new state law _ are
expanding their monitoring of beach waters and creating systems for
letting the public know when the water is not safe, both by making
announcements in the news media and by posting current data on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   But without uniform requirements under federal law, these
systems are spotty at best.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, for example, several counties post the results of
bacteria sampling at their most popular beaches at
www.doh.state.fl.us/environment/beach/default.html. But there is no
law or source of money to allow for a statewide program, according
to Robert Nobles of the state's health office.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA also has a Web site, and for years has been promising to
post current water conditions nationwide there, giving everybody a
single place to check for water conditions. But agency officials
said it was likely to be at least another year before that happens.
Meanwhile, the Web site contains only data from the annual survey
of beaches _ something that is of little use to somebody planning a
weekend getaway.

&HT;     FEAR CAN RUIN A CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DALE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Being afraid of spiders or snakes or even your
own shadow might not hurt your career, but what if you're afraid
that you're simply not good enough - or that people will resent you
if you speak up? Those sorts of fears can hamper or even destroy a
career.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of inadequacy is the most common such pitfall, management
psychologist and executive coach Alan Downs says in his recently
released book, ``The Fearless Executive.'' Downs, a former San
Francisco resident who used to be in charge of executive
development at Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto, outlines seven common
fears in his book:
</P>
<P>
   Inadequacy: You simply don't have the talent to do the job, so
you are constantly trying to prove to others that you're
infallible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The executive driven by a fear of inadequacy is blinded to the
humanity of others, choosing to view them as objects, or modules,
to be moved about the game board of the organization - a game he is
determined to win at all costs,'' Downs writes. ``No one, including
infallible executives, can get ahead without enlisting the help of
others, so these executives may turn on considerable charm,
sympathy or understanding if necessary to win over someone as a
useful ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the pawn has served his purposes and is of no further
use, he may be coolly discarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Rejection: Your bosses won't accept you, so you'll be stifled in
your attempts to move up. Even presidents can be hampered by this
fear, Downs says, because they're afraid of being rejected by
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem arises when you go beyond desiring approval and
are consumed by the fear of rejection,'' Downs writes. ``You clamp
down on your relationships and refuse to allow anything to
transpire that might cause you to be rejected. Your need for
approval becomes overwhelmingly strong, even stronger than your
desire to do good business.
</P>
<P>
   ``You trade off your own person to become the executive you
think others want you to be. You discard your own talents and
passion in order to play a role that you mistakenly believe will
win the approval of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarcity: Scrambling madly to protect what you already have, and
thinking that possibilities are finite. These are executives whose
main strategy is simply to slash costs rather than taking risks to
grow the business, and those who think they are diminished somehow
if a colleague succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Reality: Thinking there is a quick fix to complex problems.
Downs says executives will sometimes bring in consultants
unnecessarily, figuring they can come up with a painless solution
even though no such thing really exists.
</P>
<P>
   The unknown: Executives will stick with the status quo rather
than facing the uncertainty of change.
</P>
<P>
   Authority: Those who accept authority without question, bending
over backward to appease authority figures and giving up
responsibility for their own success.
</P>
<P>
   Aging: Assuming that your abilities will diminish with age, and
you will become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Downs said that the fears of inadequacy and
rejection are not only the most common, but the most destructive to
executives. He said those who feel inadequate often won't directly
address that fear, but will dig themselves in deeper by trying to
move around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than admit that you've made a mistake, you'll just keep
pouring money into that same hole,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Downs added that many executives will hire consultants to
protect themselves from what they perceive as their own inadequacy.
``It behooves the consultant to feed that feeling of inadequacy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, consultants sometimes can help those with a
fear of rejection. The consultants, rather than the executive, can
challenge the conventional wisdom, so the executive doesn't have to
worry about being the bearer of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   He said the fear of authority is probably the hardest to
overcome because it is often deep-seated from childhood. And
everyone has someone to answer to, whether it's a rank-and-file
worker responding to a supervisor or a CEO answering the board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   With all the fears, he urges readers to acknowledge whatever
irrational beliefs underlie the fear, try to push past the fear and
take positive action in the direction of the fear. For people with
the fear of authority, for example, he suggests making a list of
the strengths and weaknesses of their authority figures, showing
those people as human beings with the same sorts of flaws as
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Downs said everyone has fears, but he hopes the awareness of the
fear can help people concentrate on building their strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a little bit of each of the fears is healthy. It
pushes you to examine what you're doing. It's also been said that
someone without any fear is a sociopath. There's some truth to
that.''

   PATTERNS: Antibiotics, When Patients Want Action
</P>
<P>
   The desire of patients for a tangible outcome from a trip to the
doctor and the desire of harried doctors to move on to the next
patient are two of the most powerful factors behind the misuse of
antibiotics, according to a study by researchers at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that culture and economics play a large role in the
overconsumption of antibiotics in this country,'' said Dr. Jerry
Avorn, the lead author of the survey article, which appeared last
month in The Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   By prescribing antibiotics, a doctor signals to a patient that
the condition is treatable and that the patient is being cared for,
Avorn wrote. ``This perspective helps to explain the `drug hunger'
that many symptomatic patients bring to the physician visit, which
they feel satisfied only by receiving a prescription.''
</P>
<P>
   For doctors feeling the time constraints of managed care,
writing such prescriptions, even for conditions they suspect are
viruses (and not affected by bacteria-killing drugs), is an
effective way to bring an office visit to a close without
disappointing or angering patients, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Add the pressure from drug companies advertising and consumers
stressing the need for the latest in drugs, and ``it is not
surprising that the small voice of therapeutic restraint and
concern about microbial resistance is so difficult to hear above
the din.''
</P>
<P>
   PROGNOSIS: A Higher Risk for Babies Born at Night
</P>
<P>
   Very few babies die during the first week of life. But for some
reason, the risk is higher for babies born during the night than
those born during the day, according to a German study published on
Friday in The British Medical Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by researchers at the Phillips University of Marburg,
reviewed records from nearly 400,000 normal, low-risk deliveries in
an effort to substantiate similar findings from earlier studies in
Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Daytime births, defined as those between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m.,
outnumbered night births by 231,939 to 148,991.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-seven of those infants died in the first week of life. But
the death rate for night-born babies was close to twice that of
daytime deliveries. When the field was narrowed to infants who died
of asphyxia, the difference in mortality rates was close to four
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a result of staff's increased physical and mental
fatigue during the night,'' the researchers wrote. ``Overreliance
on less experienced staff may be another important reason.''
</P>
<P>
   CONSEQUENCES: Clues to Ecstasy's Effects on Addicts
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy of the brain of a chronic abuser of the drug ecstasy
suggests that it may work by causing violent fluctuations in the
brain chemical serotonin, according to a report last week in
Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   Animal studies of ecstasy, an amphetamine derivative, have found
it can trigger a sudden release of serotonin, which has a powerful
effect on mood. Dr. S.J. Kish of the Center for Addiction and
Mental Health in Toronto said users of the drug reported increased
awareness of emotion and heightened feelings of intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers led by Kish compared serotonin levels of the
brains of 11 people who had not used drugs with those in the brain
of a man who had died at age 26 after using ecstasy heavily since
the age of 17. ``The levels of serotonin and another chemical
associated with serotonin were 50 to 80 percent lower in the brain
of the ecstasy user,'' Kish said. ``This is the first study to show
that this drug can deplete the level of serotonin in humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy users commonly appear lethargic and depressed after the
drug wears off, including the addict in the study, whose friends
said he appeared depressed and had slow speech and reaction time
after binges.
</P>
<P>
   Further research, Kish said, may show whether supplementing
serotonin levels might help those seeking to go through withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   PERCEPTIONS: Man, Superman, Clark Kent and Woman
</P>
<P>
   A new study of male body images found that the average young man
wants to look like Superman and thinks that women want men to look
like Superman, while women really want men to look like Clark Kent.
</P>
<P>
   The study, in the August issue of The American Journal of
Psychiatry, focuses on what researchers call ``muscle dysmorphia,''
a syndrome in which men become obsessed with fears that they are
small and frail _ in many ways the flip side of anorexia nervosa.
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by Dr. Harrison Pope of the McLean Hospital in
Boston, sought to compare the responses of 200 young men in Boston,
Paris and Innsbruck, Austria, who were not bodybuilders, to get a
sense of how they compared their perceptions of their own bodies to
an ideal.
</P>
<P>
   The men were shown an image of a male body on a computer screen
and asked to alter it in terms of fat and muscle until it reflected
first, their own bodies, second, how they would like their bodies
to look, and finally, the body type they thought women found most
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, their images of their own bodies were roughly
accurate, Pope wrote. But that does not mean they like them. In all
three countries, the ideal body type chosen carried an average of
28 pounds of muscle more than the men possessed. And on average,
the men supposed that women would like an additional two pounds of
muscle on top of that.
</P>
<P>
   But when the researchers asked women to use the same device to
select the ideal male body type, what they came up with ``a very
ordinary looking male body.''
</P>
<P>
   HYPERTENSION: When the White Coats Befuddle Doctors
</P>
<P>
   Doctors call it ``white coat hypertension'' when a patient's
nervousness during an office visit results in a misleadingly high
blood pressure reading. But sometimes the opposite is true, and a
study published in The Archives of Family Medicine suggests that
more people than thought may be escaping diagnosis because of what
its authors called ``white coat normotension.''
</P>
<P>
   To test their theory, researchers from the University of British
Columbia and the University of Akron chose 319 people believed to
be healthy, and compared five office blood pressure measurements
with ambulatory measures, that is, readings taken away from the
office over a period of 10 to 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   They found that almost one in four of the patients had
white-coat normotension: Their ambulatory measures showed high
blood pressure that had not appeared in the office readings.
</P>
<P>
   These patients were more often men who were older, drank more
alcohol and included more ex-smokers than the group's average. But
the psychologists on the team were unable to identify any
definitive mental trait that would give a clue about who was at
risk for underdiagnosis or why.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggested that physicians should feel confident
only about office readings that were clearly at one end of the
scale or another. ``Given the apparently high prevalence rates of
both types of misdiagnoses, practitioners need to consider
seriously that between one-third and one-half'' of office blood
pressure readings are wrong, they wrote.

 &HT;    BUSH SPEECH WILL 'RESPECT' DEMOCRATSBy JENA HEATH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Gov. George W. Bush will take subtle aim at the
Democrats Thursday when he delivers his prime-time speech before
the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will needle his opponents a little but he will treat them
with respect,'' Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes told reporters
Monday. ``He will not engage in the kind of trash-and-burn attack
style politics that we've become so sick of out of Washington,
D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the speech will include Bush's theme of restoring
dignity and honor to the White House _ a gentle jab at the scandals
that have plagued the Clinton administration. He will also contrast
his proposals on a variety of issues, including providing
prescription drug coverage for the elderly _ a theme the campaign
has been emphasizing more lately and one poll show plays well with
voters _ with the Clinton administration's record, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in six swing states on the way to Philadelphia, Bush
has subtly intensified his criticisms of the current
administration. He frequently tells the large and enthusiastic
crowds that the nation is being led by a man who doesn't know
``what the meaning of the word is is,'' a reference to the Monica
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush would not use that line in the convention
address, which she described as, ``a very positive and uplifting
speech. It's a leadership speech.'' The speech reads about 30
minutes without interruption and will be similar to the one Bush
has been delivering at campaign rallies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At a Bush rally in Dayton Monday, the tone was upbeat with
criticism of Clinton limited to issues. That was in stark contrast
to the day before, when a string of Bush introducers in Hamilton
County, the Republican heart of Ohio, lambasted Clinton using some
of the most vitriolic language on the campaign trail yet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife, Laura _ who kicked off the convention Monday
with her own speech _ gathered at the Cincinnati home of Bill and
Kathie DeWitt late Sunday afternoon for a practice session.
DeWitt's family once owned the Cincinnati Reds baseball team and he
helped Bush buy the Texas Rangers. Longtime friends Mercer and Gaby
Reynolds were also there along with other DeWitt family members.
</P>
<P>
   All told, 12 people gathered in the DeWitt living room where
they cleared out some furniture and set up a podium so that Bush
and Laura could run through their speeches using a teleprompter. It
was the fourth time Bush has read his speech through and about the
second time he has practiced with the teleprompter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Bush is becoming more comfortable with the
teleprompter, Hughes said: ``I hope. I think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura woke at about 5 a.m. Monday to do a round of morning talk
show interviews and later could be seen on the convention floor
preparing for her prime time speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she's a little nervous about her speech but she's
looking forward to it,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters at Dayton International Airport, Bush
said the practice session went `` pretty good.'' He said that he
did not help Laura with her speech and that they didn't watch each
other practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see her speech on first delivery,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush headed to the airport to say goodbye to Laura, who was
headed to Philadelphia, and to greet their twin daughters, Jenna
and Barbara, 18, who are traveling with their mother. The couple is
leaving it to the girls to decide if they will appear on stage
during his speech. The couple has been careful to guard the twins'
privacy. They appeared on stage the night of the New Hampshire
primary and on Super Tuesday night but have mostly stayed out of
the limelight.

A STROLL DOWN WOOLLAHRA'S QUEEN STREET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 6)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Visitors to the Olympics who need an antidote to the events and
the crowds can spend a few hours wandering along Queen Street in
Woollahra. The quiet, tree-lined area is filled with antiques
stores and a few smart restaurants. Much of Sydney has become
overwhelmed with new building and brash architecture, but
Woollahra, one of the early settlements of the colonial city, has
retained its original terrace houses, shady trees and village
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, Queen Street, the main thoroughfare of
Woollahra, about 10 minutes by car or bus from the city center, has
become the fashionable antiques haunt for Sydney's new wealthy,
their decorators and connoisseurs. A showcase, the street is not a
place for bargains, although by American standards the prices are
fair and quite bearable. The emphasis is on English and European
furniture, silver, jewelry and porcelain, although interest in
Australiana surfaces from time to time. Sydney people tend to be
enthusiastic about Australian painters, particularly their
renditions of the outback landscape, but less so about early
colonial furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The storekeepers on Queen Street are friendly and knowledgeable.
Many live on the surrounding streets of Woollahra or in neighboring
Paddington, another area dominated by 19th-century terrace houses
with its own array of galleries. Habitues of Queen Street are eager
to retain the ambience of small shops, which include an
old-fashioned butcher and a fruit and vegetable store nestled among
the windows that glisten with burnished cherry-wood desks,
sparkling silver, handsome porcelain and Art Nouveau jewelry. So
far Queen Street, unlike Kings Road in London, has not been invaded
by brand name clothing stores and music outlets.
</P>
<P>
   One way to tackle a buying or browsing excursion would be to
start at the top where bustling four-lane Oxford Street gives way
to peaceful Queen Street. Almost immediately on your left, you will
find the Charles Hewitt Gallery, a source of antique prints and a
haven for contemporary Australian artists and photographers.
Hewitt, who is also a specialist in period and modern picture
framing and furniture, prides himself on showing up-and-coming
Australian artists as well as established painters. During the
Olympic period, he has chosen two Australian artists: Jacqui Comer,
whose semi-abstract canvases focus on aerial views of the
Australian landscape, and David Naseby, who interprets the
Australian outback in bold, stark colors and forms. His stockroom
is filled with the work of other Australian artists, including Tim
Snowdon's evocative still-life paintings.
</P>
<P>
   A few doors farther along the street is Anne Schofield Antiques,
a boutique with a fine collection of antique jewelry from the
Georgian period to the 1920s and '30s. Schofield, who has been in
business since the late 1960s, is known as the doyenne of her field
in Australia. Glamorously adorned with some of her jewelry, she
presides behind the glass counters, happily explaining the finer
points of a string of Tahitian pearls or the clarity of the
diamonds in a '30s Cartier bracelet. The store itself is a bijou: a
small room in the colors of the jewels and crowned by a pair of
enormous crystal chandeliers from Czechoslovakia. A serious dealer,
Schofield's inventory ranges from the spectacular (an 1850 English
diamond necklace for $70,000) to the decorative (Indian gold disc
earrings for $700) and a few less expensive bracelets and lockets,
at $1.72 Australian to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite side of Queen Street, you will find G.L.
Auchinachie &AMP; Son, where Ian and Gina Auchinachie are the second
generation to run the family antiques business. Here, the range is
enormous, in both price and style. The Auchinachies specialize in
early English furniture, and will sell you a set of eight mahogany
Sheraton dining room chairs that costs $27,000. Or they will gladly
sell a piece of Victorian needlework for $60. They have a stock of
English country chairs with rush seats and oak dressers. They ship
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the center of Queen Street is the charming Michael A.
Greene Antiques, where a trove of more reasonably priced and
carefully selected jewelry, silver and porcelain is displayed in
easy-to-see cases. The owners, Michael and Victoria Greene, know
and love their wares, most of which are small and easy to pack.
Sometimes, one will spot a coveted item such as a crocodile-leather
traveling toiletry trunk fitted with the original glass bottles and
containers. Always on hand: sterling silver napkin rings,
candlesticks and boxes. The jewelry case abounds in affordable
pins, lockets and bracelets. The shop also specializes in the 1920s
and '30s ceramics of the English designer Clarice Cliff.
</P>
<P>
   For antique books, McCormick's is known in Sydney as a
top-of-the-line dealer in colonial manuscripts and books on the
early voyages to Australia. This upstairs shop also deals in
prints, maps and period black-and-white photographs. If the prices
are a bit out of bounds, this is still a marvelous place to browse
carefully among rare volumes.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite of decorators is Hamish Clark Antiques, where there
is an eclectic mix of 18th- and 19th-century English furniture,
porcelain, desk-top bowls and boxes, and quilts.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Street is not just antiques. Cose, a small store in the
courtyard of Queens Court, is loaded with designer glassware and
china from Italy and France as well as unusual, finely made French
leather handbags and latest-look faux jewelry. Almost next door in
the courtyard is Leslie McKay Books, one of the best book stores in
Sydney, with a good stock of Australia's current generation of
fiction writers.
</P>
<P>
   A stroll through Queen Street would not be complete without
stopping for fuel. Caffe Agostinis in the Queen Street courtyard _
you cannot miss it because the tables with wide canvas umbrellas
spill outdoors _ is an informal spot with fresh ingredients and
reasonable prices. The owner, Margie Agostini (blond hair, white
chef's jacket) is usually in attendance in the open kitchen. She
serves a great salad of arugula, asparagus and avocado at lunch for
$6.15, and heartier fare in the evening: seafood, veal and chicken
dishes at about $11.50 (plus 10 percent tax). No alcohol is served
but you can buy a bottle of wine at the Woollahra Hotel across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Another pleasant restaurant is Bistro Moncur, where the noise
level is fashionably intense, with a clientele from the
neighborhood. As everywhere in Sydney, the fish is fresh, and there
is steak as well. Prices for a main course are $13 to $17.
</P>
<P>
   To finish off the shopping expedition, you can sink into a
comfortable chair or perch on a stool at the Woollahra Hotel, on
the corner of Queen and Moncur Streets. This traditional Australian
pub has been done over with sleek wood floors and handsome
furniture. To celebrate your good buys, a bottle of Australian
Petaluma Crozer champagne will be about $18.

 &HT;    REPUBLICANS GO HI-TECH IN PHILLY
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Since the image makers at the Republican National
Convention decreed that the speakers' podium would be a
politician-free zone on Monday night, the presiding politician was
safely kept three miles away.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, the convention's permanent
chairman, opened the session while standing in historic Carpenters'
Hall beside an actor dressed as Thomas Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   It was first of several closed-circuit high-definition video
feeds to be pumped into the jumbo screens the First Union Center.
And it underscored the fact that whatever this convention may lack
in the way of controversy, there's no shortage of technological
wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   In 34 days, the GOP planners have converted the Philadelphia
Flyers locker room into a high-tech super-secure nerve center to
handle the convention's formidable communication needs. The complex
houses enough computer power to handle the telephone system of a
mid-sized city.
</P>
<P>
   An internal network, known as an intranet, allows speeches,
platform texts and other documents to go online as soon as they are
ready, rather than having to wait to be duplicated and handed out
in paper form. Most news organizations covering the convention have
chosen to plug into the internal system.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the convention complex, all members of the
Internet-enabled public have been invited to become ``virtual
delegates.'' On Monday, registered users with fast online links
could watch, among other clips, the entire 45-minute speech that
Richard Nixon gave in Miami in accepting the party's 1968
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The convention Internet site also offers such amenities as an
online shop. (Three golf balls stamped with the convention logo go
for $11.95.)
</P>
<P>
   Large screens located throughout the complex let viewers watch
the proceedings remotely in high-definition video. But the
organizers decided not to compete with a number of news
organizations, including C-SPAN and America Online, that are
putting the convention on the Internet in streaming video.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, we approached both the Republicans and the Democrats
to offer to set up all their convention communications needs,''
said Stephen Rohleder, the Washington-based managing partner of
Andersen Consulting. ``We thought,'' Rohleder added, ``it would be
a fine way to advance the cause of e-government.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the Republicans, however, took up Andersen's offer.
</P>
<P>
   The hands-on job of coordinating a slew of telecom vendors and
Internet nodes at the GOP site fell to Andersen's Dean Griffin, who
serves as the convention's chief technology officer. As part of the
bargain, Andersen also contributed about $850,000 in services to
the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, 51, supervises the First Union site with a scrambled
radio-telephone system that appears permanently attached to his

 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    As a rule, Clint Eastwood likes to keep his feet on the ground,
or at least no higher aloft than a horse's back.
 &HT;    It all goes back to 1951, when as a young soldier hitching a
ride on a Navy plane back from Seattle to his base in California,
Eastwood took an unscheduled detour into the Pacific Ocean.
 &HT;    ``At those moments in your life, you're not really scared,''
Eastwood says. ``You just think about the next step. What can I do
to save this day?''
 &HT;    The plane went down, and the 21-year-old soldier spent the next
five hours fighting to stay alive in freezing, shark-infested
waters.
 &HT;    ``I felt like a pretty lucky punk on that day,'' the 70-year-old
actor says with a chuckle. ``But maybe something subconscious made
me want to stay on the nice, firm ground for the rest of my life.''
 &HT;    Well, until now, anyway. His new movie, ``Space Cowboys,'' takes
him about as far off the ground as anyone gets: Eastwood, who also
directed, plays a 70-year-old astronaut called back to NASA for one
last mission with three similarly aged former comrades, played by
James Garner, Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland.
 &HT;    Actually, Sutherland says, the flying scenes weren't nearly as
tough as a physical-exam scene which required all four to bare
their not-so-hardbodies.
 &HT;    ``I thought about asking for a butt double,'' Sutherland says,
grimacing. ``But at my age it sounded redundant _ my butt has just
naturally doubled!''
 &HT;    Appropriately, Eastwood has returned to Houston, where the film
was shot, to promote it with an appearance at the NASA Space Center
prior to the movie's nationwide opening on Aug. 4. Looking sinewy
and handsome in a grey suit jacket, matching shirt and tailored
beige pants, Eastwood has hair as silver as the space shuttle
parked outside.
 &HT;    Unlike many of the film's target audience, he says, he didn't
grow up dreaming of being an astronaut.
 &HT;    ``When I was a kid, they didn't have astronauts,'' he says. ``We
only had Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. My God, my age is showing!''
 &HT;    Sutherland and Eastwood were actually together the night that
men first walked on the moon.
 &HT;    ``Clint and I were in Yugoslavia making `Kelly's Heroes' (1970)
in 1969, sitting in a hotel watching a black-and-white television
when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon,'' Sutherland recalls.
 &HT;    Eastwood nods.
 &HT;    ``Unfortunately,'' he says, ``someone was speaking in
Yugoslavian over him when he said `One small step for man ... ' I
was sitting there going, `What did he say? What did he say?' We had
to read about it in another paper later.''
 &HT;    These days Eastwood rarely co-stars with his generational peers,
but he says he enjoyed the chance to work with seasoned veterans
such as Garner, Jones and Sutherland.
 &HT;    ``Most of us had met each other or known each other for a long
time,'' he says. ``These guys are old pros. So the first day you
just sit around and have a cigar and tell a few jokes. Pretty soon,
you are all there. And then you just go ahead and jump into a
scene.''
 &HT;    In other words, ``Space Cowboys'' was, like most Eastwood films,
shot without the extensive rehearsal that's the industry norm.
 &HT;    ``This is not an intellectual art form,'' the actor/director
says. ``It's an emotional art form, a gut-reaction art form. And
the more you allow your inner guts and emotion to drive you, the
more fun you can have with it all. If you try to think a scene to
death, it kind of beats you up.''
 &HT;    There was plenty else to beat them up, Eastwood adds, beginning
with the basic equipment of space flight.
 &HT;    ``The space suits make you weigh about 400 pounds,'' Eastwood
says. ``In outer space there's no weight, so they're not bad. In
gravity, however, they are almost impossible. You always feel like
you're about to tip and fall through the wall.''
 &HT;    It's only the latest hurdle in a legendary Hollywood career that
stretches back to his big break on television's ``Rawhide'' in
1959. Along the way he's played ``Dirty Harry'' Callahan, ridden
the spaghetti-Western range, co-starred with a chimpanzee _ twice _
and, oh yes, directed and starred in the Oscar-winning
``Unforgiven'' (1992).
 &HT;    After close to 50 years in the business, however, Eastwood says
that he thinks he's at his peak, at least as an actor.
 &HT;    ``I simply know more about life,'' he says matter-of-factly.
 &HT;    Eastwood admits to amazement at how long his career has lasted.
 &HT;    ``Every actor has that dilemma where they think their present
job is their last job,'' he says. ``I just never thought too much
about it _ I just kind of kept going.''
 &HT;    He shrugs.
 &HT;    ``You get a little bit of the brass ring,'' he adds, ``and you
get obsessed by work, which I am not now. And I thank God for
that.''
 &HT;    Helping the father of four avoid getting obsessed is his new
family life with his wife, newscaster Dina Ruiz, and their
3-year-old daughter.
 &HT;    ``If anyone wants to know what's the best part of aging,''
Eastwood says, ``it's losing that obsession for work and spending a
little more time with family and personal life. I'm spending more
time with family and friends, and I think that it's great fun.''
 &HT;    He was 67 when Morgan Eastwood was born on Dec. 13, 1996, and
Eastwood says he has no regrets.
 &HT;    ``It's great having a 3-and-a-half-year-old,'' he says. ``I keep
joking, `I didn't have any grandchildren, so I had my own
grandchildren.'
 &HT;    ``I guess it's unfair that the male gender can always have kids
at an older age,'' he adds, ``but I really appreciate it. I love
it. And I'm much more attentive to my kids now than I ever was
before.''
 &HT;    And, yes, the former Man With No Name does his share of the
babysitting.
 &HT;    ``I can tell you everything about Barney, every part of it,'' he
says cheerfully. ``But with Pokemon I had to draw the line a little
bit. I do know all the Scooby Doo tapes, backwards and forwards.
 &HT;    ``Don't tell anyone.''
 &HT;    He laughs.
 &HT;    ``Here's one good thing about aging,'' Eastwood says. ``You
suddenly don't take yourself so seriously.''
 &HT;    At 70, the actor says, life looks pretty good.
 &HT;    ``I'm still working,'' he says. ``I can still work in an
industry that still wants me. I'm just playing different roles than
we played 50 years ago _ and that's not bad.''
 &HT;    As for the future, he candidly admits that he isn't sure.
 &HT;    ``I get asked about the future of the film business and my part
in it,'' he says. ``And it's tough for me to anticipate where it's
all going, because this is the information age. Things are changing
so rapidly.
 &HT;    ``I think the future of films belongs to the next generation,''
he says. ``I've carried it as far as I can carry it. Now everyone
else is on their own.''

ALMOST FAMOUS: DONAL LOGUE DANCES ON THE BRINK OF STARDOM 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Donal Logue in a scene from ``The Tao of
Steve.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Donal Logue gathers no moss.
 &HT;    Over the past two years, Logue has acted in nine feature films,
a short digital video and two television pilots. And, somewhere in
between, he and his girlfriend welcomed into the world a son named
Flinn, now 17 months old.
 &HT;    The actor obviously has ignored the advice of his pal, fellow
thespian Bill Paxton.
 &HT;    ``Bill is a great guy with a great attitude,'' Logue says by
telephone from his Los Angeles home. ``But one thing he told me is,
`You're special, man, so don't be available for weddings and bar
mitzvahs.'
 &HT;    ``I understand that,'' the actor says. ``It's one take on
things. But if I had to hang up the phone now, go grease my hair,
put on strange glasses and become somebody else for a while, I'd be
psyched.''
 &HT;    OK, so Logue loves his craft. But you're probably still asking,
who is this guy?
 &HT;    He's a familiar face to a lot of people, actually. Jimmy the cab
driver in MTV's old ad spots? Logue. Quinn, the bad guy in
``Blade'' (1998)? Logue. The priest in ``Runaway Bride'' (1999)?
Shane Pencil in the Madonna spoof ``Medusa: Dare to Be Truthful''
(1992)? Tom Colton in the ``X-Files'' episode ``Squeeze'' (1993)?
Logue, Logue and Logue.
 &HT;    As for those aforementioned nine films, there was ``Runaway
Bride,'' ``The Big Tease'' and ``Takedown,'' all released in 1999,
as well as the 2000 titles ``Reindeer Games,'' ``The Patriot,''
``The Million Dollar Hotel,'' ``Steal This Movie!'' ``The
Opportunists'' and ``The Tao of Steve.''
 &HT;    Two of those movies, ``The Opportunists'' and ``The Tao of
Steve,'' are currently in limited release. Logue takes a supporting
role in ``The Opportunists,'' playing a working-class guy from
Queens, N.Y., who tries to improve his lot in life by pressuring a
reluctant ex-con (Christopher Walken) into making one more big
score.
 &HT;    ``It's a good little film,'' says Logue, a 34-year-old native of
Ottawa, Canada. ``When I was in New York and couldn't find work, I
just always wanted to be one of those actors who worked on the
street in cool, gritty independent movies. So this was my chance.
 &HT;    ``I also got to work with Christopher Walken,'' he adds. ``It's
his character's story, and it was nice to see Chris play a normal
guy.''
 &HT;    Not to give short shrift to ``The Opportunists,'' but
opportunity really knocks with ``The Tao of Steve.'' The offbeat
romantic comedy places Logue in the spotlight _ it's his
character's story this time. Logue plays Dex, once a college stud
and now, on the eve of his 10-year reunion, a portly kindergarten
teacher whose dating habits are based on the Tao of Steve, a
philosophy incorporating the musings of Lao-tzu, Groucho Marx and
Heidegger.
 &HT;    Dex's belief in the Tao of Steve is put to the test when he
meets Syd (Greer Goodman), a woman who designs scenery for the
Santa Fe Opera and rides motorcycles. And the more he gets to know
Syd, the less useful the Tao of Steve becomes.
 &HT;    The film, co-written by Goodman and Jenniphr Goodman and
directed by Goodman, elicited cheers at the Sundance Film Festival,
and was subsequently snapped up for distribution by Sony Pictures
Classics.
 &HT;    ``I related to the story on every level, as a guy who had to use
his humor and wit and anything else to do well in the Darwinian
process of hooking up with hot chicks when I was in high school and
college,'' Logue says. ``I'd also studied all these thinkers when I
was at Harvard. So many film scripts have pathetic references to,
say, Nietzsche. The people making `Tao of Steve' actually
understood the references they were making.
 &HT;    ``On the set, a lot of ideas were bouncing around between
Jenniphr and Greer, but it was very democratic,'' he adds. ``They
gave me a lot of rope, and I'd also fight for my own ideas
sometimes, and that was OK. Everybody's opinions were respected.''
 &HT;    Heading into release, the buzz is that ``The Tao of Steve''
could emerge as this year's indie sleeper, 2000's ``The Full
Monty.'' Logue likes the sound of that, but he's been there before
and seen his hopes dashed.
 &HT;    ``I'm very psyched that it got to the first stages of that
process, because so many of the `little films that could' that I've
done just never got over the hump,'' he says. ``I did one called
`The Size of Watermelons' (1996) with Paul Rudd. The audience
response to it was similar to `The Tao of Steve,' but it just never
got legs.
 &HT;    ```The Tao of Steve' got to Sundance and it's getting
distribution, but it scares the sh-t out of me what happens after
that,'' he says. ``By virtue of being on 3,000 screens, every major
film in America _ even `Rocky and Bullwinkle' _ gets seen by
someone. Little films start in a couple of cities and go to five
and, hopefully, build to more.
 &HT;    ``So I'm nervous and excited and interested in seeing what
happens,'' he concludes. ``I hope for the best, but expect that it
might not be `The Full Monty.' Could you imagine if it was?''
 &HT;    Later this summer, Logue will appear as part of the ensemble
cast in the Abbie Hoffman biographical feature ``Steal This
Movie!'' And in the fall he'll begin shooting ``Grounded for
Life,'' a television sitcom that Fox will keep on tap as a
midseason replacement.
 &HT;    If either ``The Tao of Steve'' or ``Grounded for Life'' catches
a bit of instant karma and breaks out, Logue could be whisked along
for the ride. Though the prospect of better roles in better
productions appeals to the actor, he once again waves a caution
flag.
 &HT;    ``Having a bit of a name might be nice, but I have no desire to
be a star,'' Logue says, pronouncing the final word as a diva-esque
``stahr.'' ``I get into arguments over this.
 &HT;    ``Some people think, `Well, stars want to be stars,''' the actor
says. ``Yeah, some do, but Kurt Cobain was a talented musician who
I don't think was built in such a way, inside, that he wanted to be
mobbed at the grocery store.
 &HT;    ``You can be an introverted, introspective person and enjoy
being an actor and have a gift for it,'' Logue says. ``I can be
introverted and extroverted. I like people. Right now, anyone I've
met who's recognized me has been very cool and pleasant.
 &HT;    ``I hope that won't change.''

STAND-UP COMICS: STAN LEE KEEPS THE CLOBBERIN' COMING

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of comic-book creator Stan Lee, amid
drawings of many of his creations.) 
 By PHILLIP ZONKEL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Stan Lee is ready for his close-up.
 &HT;    In June, the comic-book icon went to Malibu for the shooting of
his walk-on role in the new ``X-Men'' film, which opened July 14.
During a beach scene, as a hideously deformed mutant arises from
the ocean, Lee _ who, along with artist Jack Kirby, created the
X-Men back in 1963 _ has a two-second screen appearance as a
hot-dog vendor.
 &HT;    ``I used the Stanislavsky method,'' Lee says, furrowing his
brow. ``I tried to think like a hot-dog vendor, look like a hot-dog
vendor. I don't think you'd suspect for a minute that I'm not
really a hot-dog vendor.''
 &HT;    Do you want ketchup and mustard with that?
 &HT;    Condiments aside, the 77-year-old Manhattan native is arguably
the most influential comic-book creator of all time.
 &HT;    In 1940 the 16-year-old Lee joined Timely Comics, the precursor
to Marvel Comics, writing everything from horror stories and
Westerns to romances and war dramas. Two decades later he reignited
the faltering super-hero genre, sweeping Marvel Comics to the
industry forefront with his larger-than-life characters, who did
much more than leap tall buildings in a single bound.
 &HT;    By 1968 Lee had revolutionized the comic-book business, creating
such memorable series as ``The Amazing Spider-Man,'' ``The
Avengers,'' ``Daredevil,'' ``Dr. Strange,'' ``The Fantastic Four,''
``The Incredible Hulk,'' ``Iron Man,'' ``Thor'' and ``The X-Men.''
 &HT;    ``He was a prolific creator and really laid the foundation for
Marvel Comics,'' says Michael Dean, news editor of The Comics
Journal, an industry trade publication. ``They were so imitated by
other companies that you could say he laid the foundation for the
comics industry as it exists today.''
 &HT;    Not that Lee can be held responsible for the dark,
ultra-violent, hypersexual comic books that occupy much of today's
market.
 &HT;    ``I used to pride myself on the fact that every story I did
could be read by a very young child without the parent worrying
about it,'' says Lee, relaxing with his feet on his desk in his
office in Encino, Calif. ``I always try to put a little bit of
humor in. I don't like depressing stories. I don't like violence _
I like a lot of action, I like fight scenes, but to me there's a
difference between action and violence.
 &HT;    ``I tried to keep it clean enough and understandable enough for
young kids,'' he concludes, ``and yet intelligent enough and
engrossing enough for older readers. You walk a fine line.''
 &HT;    To judge by the popular success of his 1960s comics _ not to
mention their skyrocketing value as collector's items now _ Lee
seems to have found that balance.
 &HT;    ``I grew up reading these comics, and there's a definite voice
that was unique for the time,'' the 45-year-old Dean says. ``His
main idea was that they would be super-heroes with feet of clay.
They would have the same problems as real people _ Spider-Man had
problems with girls and at work.
 &HT;    ``What you see in the comics is a lot of effort to inject
serious literary elements,'' Dean says. ``You have internal
psychological conflicts within the characters, which you didn't
normally see before Stan Lee. He wanted to elevate the form a
little bit, but also knew how absurd that looked when you put it
alongside guys in costumes swinging from webs. So he established a
very camp tone _ sometimes it's very serious, but often he'll
puncture the story with little asides.''
 &HT;    That mix of serious drama and tongue-in-cheek humor is apparent
in director Brian Singer's hit movie ``X-Men,'' currently topping
the box-office charts. Lee had no creative input on the film _
though he has an executive-producer credit, Lee says, ``It's more
of an honorary title. I didn't have that much to do with producing
it'' _ but screenwriter David Hayter's story is adapted from
original ideas developed by Lee and by Chris Claremont, who wrote
the comic book from 1975 to 1991.
 &HT;    The basic premise of the movie, like that of the comic book, is
the notion that the United States isn't necessarily a land of the
free for people who are different from the norm. It's no
coincidence that Lee launched the comic in 1963, at the height of
the civil-rights movement.
 &HT;    ``There's a connection, but it was subliminal,'' Lee says. ``All
I was thinking about was how to come up with a good team of heroes
and a good team of villains that could have interesting adventures.
 &HT;    ``But when I started writing it, it seemed fun to do heroes with
special powers who not only aren't appreciated by the public, but
also are hated and harassed and hounded by the public,'' he
recalls. ``It occurred to me that that was quite a good metaphor
for bigotry and persecution, because they were being persecuted
just because they were different.''
 &HT;    Thirty-seven years later, Lee believes, those themes are still
relevant.
 &HT;    ``I'm sorry it's needed today. I wish it wasn't necessary, but
we all know it is,'' he says. ``I'm glad Brian Singer and David
Hayter made it a big part of the movie. It will give a depth that
the average action picture doesn't have.''
 &HT;    Lee stopped writing for Marvel on a regular basis in 1972,
moving up to the publisher's office. Five years later he began
writing the daily ``Spider-Man'' newspaper strip, which still is
syndicated in more than 500 newspapers.
 &HT;    In 1998, after 26 years as publisher, Lee left Marvel to join
media guru Peter Paul in launching Stan Lee Media. He left behind a
unique legacy: To date, more than 2 billion of his comic books have
been published in more than 75 countries and 25 different
languages.
 &HT;    A publicly held business, Stan Lee Media creates animation
franchises. The company's initial offering was a comic book
starring the Backstreet Boys as super-heroes. Lee also has joined
forces with his former arch-rivals, DC Comics, for ``Just Imagine
Stan Lee Creating,'' for which he's writing original stories
starring DC titans such as Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. The
first issues are expected by early 2001.
 &HT;    And now Lee, who won his first comic-book stripes back in the
days of World War II, has entered cyberspace. In February he kicked
off ``The 7th Portal,'' an Internet comic accessible at
www.stanlee.net. It features 14 new crimefighters and evil enemies,
his first new-character creations in more than 25 years.
 &HT;    In other words, at 77 Lee is busier than ever. The only thing
that would make him happier would be if he could stop writing.
 &HT;    ``I don't really like to write,'' he admits. ``Once I'm writing
it's OK, but it's so hard for me to sit down and begin. There are a
million things I'd rather do _ watch television, take a walk, talk
to my wife, ride a bike, do anything.
 &HT;    ``Writing is a lonely process,'' he says. ``I can't have any
distractions. I sit alone in my room and write.
 &HT;    ``I love it when it's finished,'' Lee says, brightening. ``Even
doing it isn't bad _ it's knowing you have to do it that's bad. But
once you're into it, it rolls out.''
 &HT;    But don't expect Stan Lee to put down his pen any time soon.
 &HT;    ``I love creating things,'' he says. ``To me, providing
entertainment of any sort is the most fun you can have. When the
public likes what you're doing, that's so rewarding.''

 (Includes a color slide of John Waters directing Melanie Griffith
in a scene from ``Cecil B. Demented.'') 
 By SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Call him ``the pope of trash,'' a moniker bestowed by none other
than American scatological icon William Burroughs. Call him ``the
duke of dirt.'' Call him ``trashmeister.''
 &HT;    Whatever you call him, John Waters was shocking audiences long
before the Farrelly brothers first struck box-office gold with
their wildly outrageous comedies.
 &HT;    Now the 54-year-old anti-establishment filmmaker, whose perverse
sense of humor and talent for cultural satire are as sharp as his
pencil-thin mustache, is taking on Hollywood itself in ``Cecil B.
Demented,'' opening nationwide on Aug. 11.
 &HT;    The action-filled, off-the-wall send-up stars Melanie Griffith
as a movie queen kidnaped by the crazed Cecil B. Demented (Stephen
Dorff) to star in a radical underground movie. The supporting cast
includes such Waters regulars as Ricki Lake, Patricia Hearst and
Mink Stole.
 &HT;    Waters got the idea for his latest effort from the gay newspaper
The Advocate.
 &HT;    ``They did an interview with me and called me `Cecil B.
Demented,''' he recalls. ``It made me laugh, and I took it as a
compliment. Then I began to think about creating a fictitious
super-hero who was willing to risk everything, even his life, to
make an anti-Hollywood propaganda movie.
 &HT;    ``It's got a lot of action scenes,'' he adds, ``which I've never
done before. I call it my `Die Hard for the Hollywood-Impaired.'''
 &HT;    While shootouts, fights and car chases abound in ``Cecil B.
Demented,'' the black comedy's biggest surprise is Griffith's
no-holds-barred spoof of the stereotypically spoiled, difficult
Hollywood diva.
 &HT;    ``I knew I had to get a real A-list actress to play the part,''
Waters says. ``I think Melanie was very brave to take on that whole
persona of the star bitch. She has a really good sense of humor
about herself, which is why she's survived the ups and downs of
making films.
 &HT;    ``After she saw the script, I went to her house for a meeting,''
he continues. ``It was right up the street from where O.J. used to
live, which gave me a nightmare vision as I drove by. Then I
knocked on her door, and Melanie answered wearing skintight
black-leather jeans, a T-shirt with a skull on it, and no make-up.
 &HT;    ``I thought, `There's my girl.'''
 &HT;    Griffith dove wholeheartedly into the tasteless, foul-mouthed
spirit of the film.
 &HT;    ``I told her she was a Waters girl and she had to go for it,''
the director says. ``We did have a little negotiation over her
fringed hair, false eyelashes and mascara. Let's just say we talked
about that more than her swearing.''
 &HT;    Ironically, Waters admits that he had more qualms about one
outrageous moment than Griffith did.
 &HT;    ``There's a scene where she's giving Ricki Lake, who plays her
assistant, a hard time,'' he recalls, ``and Melanie says something
like, `I'm in the presidential suite where Nixon and his wife
stayed _ find out if Pat Nixon got f--ked here.'
 &HT;    ``My uncle was undersecretary of the interior for Nixon,'' the
director says, ``and I suddenly thought, `If he sees this, he's
really going to get mad.' But I left it in.''
 &HT;    Griffith has praised Waters as a filmmaker who ``doesn't give a
sh-t,'' but he doesn't quite see that as a compliment.
 &HT;    ``I do give a sh-t what people think,'' he says. ``Otherwise, I
don't think I'd have been making movies for 36 years. I do care,
and bad reviews are more painful than good reviews. I guess you
could say my list of people whose opinions are important to me is
selective.''
 &HT;    The film's radical moviemakers are wont to spout anti-industry
slogans such as ``Hey, hey, MPAA, how many movies do we have to
censor today?'' _ but, ironically, Waters had less trouble than
usual with the Motion Picture Association of America and its
ratings board.
 &HT;    ``We got an R for `Cecil B. Demented,''' he says, ``for `crude
sexual content, violence, drug usage and language.'
 &HT;    ``I hate it when they say `language,''' he adds. ``That's just
poor English. Why don't they just come out and say `bad language?'
Anyway, an R for a John Waters film is certainly nothing to get
excited about. I was happier when they gave the re-release of `Pink
Flamingos' an NC-17.''
 &HT;    As with all his films, from the enduring cult favorite ``Pink
Flamingos'' (1972) to ``Hairspray'' (1988), ``Serial Mom'' (1994)
and ``Pecker'' (1998), ``Cecil B. Demented'' was shot in the
director's native Baltimore, where some of the town's oldest and
most famous movie palaces were the setting for attacks on
everything from high concession prices to emotionally simplistic
family films.
 &HT;    Going to movies isn't as much fun as it used to be, Waters
believes.
 &HT;    ``More than anything, I'm bothered by people who talk during a
screening,'' he says. ``I got in a big fight the other day because
someone was yakking nonstop in `Scary Movie.' I loved it when
someone in the film got killed for talking in a theater _ it was
like art imitating life.
 &HT;    ``I also hate people who bring babies,'' he adds. ``I actually
said to one couple with a kid who started crying, `Couldn't you get
a baby sitter?' They said, `Sorry, no.' Like it was my problem.''
 &HT;    Waters drew on his own experience to depict the bargain-basement
world of Cecil B. Demented and his no-budget productions.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't have made `Pink Flamingos' without some financial
help from my father _ and thankfully he never saw it, because I
know he would hate it,'' Waters says. ``I actually went over budget
_ I had planned to spend $10,000, and it cost $12,000.
 &HT;    ``I was doing films on a shoestring and on the run,'' he
recalls. ``I guess my worst experience was getting arrested while
we were doing `Mondo Trasho' (1969) with Divine. It was a scene
where she's driving in a big red Cadillac, and she passes this
hitchhiker and imagines he's nude. So we had this naked guy
standing by the side of the road, and somebody called the cops.
 &HT;    ``We ran and Divine got away,'' Waters says, ``which doesn't say
much for the Baltimore cops, since she weighed about 300 pounds.
They caught me, and I was charged with conspiracy to commit
indecent exposure. I got off, but I remember having to show all my
films to the district attorney, which was a memorable moment.''
 &HT;    Ironically, Waters tells the story of Cecil B. Demented at a
time when his own career has been edging into the mainstream, with
his recent films enjoying larger budgets and wider audiences.
 &HT;    ``Even though I'm spoofing Hollywood movies, I'd have to say
Hollywood has not been horrible to me,'' he admits. ``I've had some
executives say, `I love your movies, but I couldn't risk my job by
giving you the money to do one.' I understand that. I'm not going
to give them a huge hit.''
 &HT;    As for his enduring reputation as, to quote one critic, ``the
arbiter of blatant, graphic tastelessness,'' Waters doesn't shy
away from it.
 &HT;    ``I plead guilty,'' he says, ``but I'd like to put one adjective
before those words: `joyous.' I can think of movies that are
tasteless and vile, but they aren't witty and they aren't very
funny. I've done comic obscenity and joyous obscenity.
 &HT;    ``I'm not Cecil B. Demented,'' he concludes with a shrug. ``But
if he were real and made a movie, I'd be the first to buy a
ticket.''

`SPACE' CASE: CLINT EASTWOOD HEADS INTO ORBIT

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Clint Eastwood with Tommy Lee Jones,
Donald Sutherland and Courtney B. Vance in a scene from ``Space
Cowboys.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    As a rule, Clint Eastwood likes to keep his feet on the ground,
or at least no higher aloft than a horse's back.
 &HT;    It all goes back to 1951, when as a young soldier hitching a
ride on a Navy plane back from Seattle to his base in California,
Eastwood took an unscheduled detour into the Pacific Ocean.
 &HT;    ``At those moments in your life, you're not really scared,''
Eastwood says. ``You just think about the next step. What can I do
to save this day?''
 &HT;    The plane went down, and the 21-year-old soldier spent the next
five hours fighting to stay alive in freezing, shark-infested
waters.
 &HT;    ``I felt like a pretty lucky punk on that day,'' the 70-year-old
actor says with a chuckle. ``But maybe something subconscious made
me want to stay on the nice, firm ground for the rest of my life.''
 &HT;    Well, until now, anyway. His new movie, ``Space Cowboys,'' takes
him about as far off the ground as anyone gets: Eastwood, who also
directed, plays a 70-year-old astronaut called back to NASA for one
last mission with three similarly aged former comrades, played by
James Garner, Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland.
 &HT;    Actually, Sutherland says, the flying scenes weren't nearly as
tough as a physical-exam scene which required all four to bare
their not-so-hardbodies.
 &HT;    ``I thought about asking for a butt double,'' Sutherland says,
grimacing. ``But at my age it sounded redundant _ my butt has just
naturally doubled!''
 &HT;    Appropriately, Eastwood has returned to Houston, where the film
was shot, to promote it with an appearance at the NASA Space Center
prior to the movie's nationwide opening on Aug. 4. Looking sinewy
and handsome in a grey suit jacket, matching shirt and tailored
beige pants, Eastwood has hair as silver as the space shuttle
parked outside.
 &HT;    Unlike many of the film's target audience, he says, he didn't
grow up dreaming of being an astronaut.
 &HT;    ``When I was a kid, they didn't have astronauts,'' he says. ``We
only had Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. My God, my age is showing!''
 &HT;    Sutherland and Eastwood were actually together the night that
men first walked on the moon.
 &HT;    ``Clint and I were in Yugoslavia making `Kelly's Heroes' (1970)
in 1969, sitting in a hotel watching a black-and-white television
when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon,'' Sutherland recalls.
 &HT;    Eastwood nods.
 &HT;    ``Unfortunately,'' he says, ``someone was speaking in
Yugoslavian over him when he said `One small step for man ... ' I
was sitting there going, `What did he say? What did he say?' We had
to read about it in another paper later.''
 &HT;    These days Eastwood rarely co-stars with his generational peers,
but he says he enjoyed the chance to work with seasoned veterans
such as Garner, Jones and Sutherland.
 &HT;    ``Most of us had met each other or known each other for a long
time,'' he says. ``These guys are old pros. So the first day you
just sit around and have a cigar and tell a few jokes. Pretty soon,
you are all there. And then you just go ahead and jump into a
scene.''
 &HT;    In other words, ``Space Cowboys'' was, like most Eastwood films,
shot without the extensive rehearsal that's the industry norm.
 &HT;    ``This is not an intellectual art form,'' the actor/director
says. ``It's an emotional art form, a gut-reaction art form. And
the more you allow your inner guts and emotion to drive you, the
more fun you can have with it all. If you try to think a scene to
death, it kind of beats you up.''
 &HT;    There was plenty else to beat them up, Eastwood adds, beginning
with the basic equipment of space flight.
 &HT;    ``The space suits make you weigh about 400 pounds,'' Eastwood
says. ``In outer space there's no weight, so they're not bad. In
gravity, however, they are almost impossible. You always feel like
you're about to tip and fall through the wall.''
 &HT;    It's only the latest hurdle in a legendary Hollywood career that
stretches back to his big break on television's ``Rawhide'' in
1959. Along the way he's played ``Dirty Harry'' Callahan, ridden
the spaghetti-Western range, co-starred with a chimpanzee _ twice _
and, oh yes, directed and starred in the Oscar-winning
``Unforgiven'' (1992).
 &HT;    After close to 50 years in the business, however, Eastwood says
that he thinks he's at his peak, at least as an actor.
 &HT;    ``I simply know more about life,'' he says matter-of-factly.
 &HT;    Eastwood admits to amazement at how long his career has lasted.
 &HT;    ``Every actor has that dilemma where they think their present
job is their last job,'' he says. ``I just never thought too much
about it _ I just kind of kept going.''
 &HT;    He shrugs.
 &HT;    ``You get a little bit of the brass ring,'' he adds, ``and you
get obsessed by work, which I am not now. And I thank God for
that.''
 &HT;    Helping the father of four avoid getting obsessed is his new
family life with his wife, newscaster Dina Ruiz, and their
3-year-old daughter.
 &HT;    ``If anyone wants to know what's the best part of aging,''
Eastwood says, ``it's losing that obsession for work and spending a
little more time with family and personal life. I'm spending more
time with family and friends, and I think that it's great fun.''
 &HT;    He was 67 when Morgan Eastwood was born on Dec. 13, 1996, and
Eastwood says he has no regrets.
 &HT;    ``It's great having a 3-and-a-half-year-old,'' he says. ``I keep
joking, `I didn't have any grandchildren, so I had my own
grandchildren.'
 &HT;    ``I guess it's unfair that the male gender can always have kids
at an older age,'' he adds, ``but I really appreciate it. I love
it. And I'm much more attentive to my kids now than I ever was
before.''
 &HT;    And, yes, the former Man With No Name does his share of the
babysitting.
 &HT;    ``I can tell you everything about Barney, every part of it,'' he
says cheerfully. ``But with Pokemon I had to draw the line a little
bit. I do know all the Scooby Doo tapes, backwards and forwards.
 &HT;    ``Don't tell anyone.''
 &HT;    He laughs.
 &HT;    ``Here's one good thing about aging,'' Eastwood says. ``You
suddenly don't take yourself so seriously.''
 &HT;    At 70, the actor says, life looks pretty good.
 &HT;    ``I'm still working,'' he says. ``I can still work in an
industry that still wants me. I'm just playing different roles than
we played 50 years ago _ and that's not bad.''
 &HT;    As for the future, he candidly admits that he isn't sure.
 &HT;    ``I get asked about the future of the film business and my part
in it,'' he says. ``And it's tough for me to anticipate where it's
all going, because this is the information age. Things are changing
so rapidly.
 &HT;    ``I think the future of films belongs to the next generation,''
he says. ``I've carried it as far as I can carry it. Now everyone
else is on their own.''

`A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY': EGOS IN A DREAM HOUSE `WITHOUT EGO'
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her charming 1989 memoir, ``Sleeping Arrangements,'' Laura
Cunningham created an indelible portrait of her 1950s childhood in
the Bronx. She conjured up a working-class world built on an
absurdly grandiose scale: a world where apartment buildings
sprouted Babylonian turrets and Egyptian friezes, and streets
aspired to be wide Parisian thoroughfares, a now vanished world
that once nurtured a young girl's romantic dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's latest book is a kind of bookend to ``Sleeping
Arrangements'': It chronicles the author's journey from the
cacophonous streets of the city to the bucolic, bug-infested hills
of upstate New York and her ongoing love affair with a farmhouse
that she and her ex-husband bought 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though often as engaging as ``Sleeping Arrangements,'' ``A Place
in the Country'' lacks that earlier book's easy, organic shape: It
reads less like a memoir than like a series of overlapping (and
occasionally repetitive) magazine pieces. Some of the chapters are
small, comic essays chronicling a city dweller's bumbling efforts
to master the rudiments of country living: ``Green Acres'' meets
``A Year in Provence.'' Other chapters are more elliptical,
melancholy accounts of Cunningham's attempts to grapple with health
concerns and a failing marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The opening portions of the book recapitulate much of the
material from ``Sleeping Arrangements,'' recounting the author's
girlhood in the Bronx. Her early peripatetic life with her mother,
it seems, instilled in her a craving for a real home: For the first
four years of her life, Cunningham recalls, she and her mother
sought shelter in relatives' overcrowded apartments, camping out in
foyers, entryways, even under dining room tables. It was while
sharing a three-room apartment with five other people that her
dream of living in a stand-alone house took root, a dream shaped by
her immigrant grandmother's memories of a country place, a dacha,
back home in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   After an interlude in the suburban wilds of Tuxedo Park, N.Y. (a
community she satirized in her 1980 novel, ``Third Parties''),
Cunningham and her husband embarked on a 10-year search for the
perfect country house: ``I did not want,'' she writes, ``a house
with a mistaken identity _ a Mediterranean villa or an adobe house.
I wanted a house that sprang naturally from its roots; a native
place, a home farm,'' a house, in other words, ``without ego.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they found their dream house several hours north of
the city: a pale yellow colonial named The Inn, set on 13 acres, at
the very center of what had once been a great estate. To one side
lived Lord and Lady Hodgson, who had been selling off bits of the
family estate over the years; to another side was a dairy farm
owned and operated by a father and son team, Abner Bower Sr. and
Abner Bower Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Like many former city dwellers, Cunningham and her husband soon
succumbed to the ``have to'' mindset of ``the obsessive country
place revisionist.'' Cunningham's passion became turning a cistern
that had been boarded over for more than a century into a swimming
pool, a project that would entail removing all the old water (which
contained, she estimates, some five dozen rat skulls per 5,000
gallons), coating the pit with sealer and then refilling it with
new water.
</P>
<P>
   As for her husband, Cunningham writes, he became obsessed with
stocking their ``farm'' with animals: a menagerie that soon came to
include two demented goats named Lulu and Lulubelle who devoured
50-pound sacks of Goat Chow like bags of potato chips, a half-dozen
foul-smelling geese, 38 irritable chickens and a puffed-up rooster
named Mr. Chicken who ``ate about a hundred dollars' worth of
chicken feed a day'' and soon grew so large that he looked like
``an ad for a chicken or a person in a chicken suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Adept at poking fun at her and her husband's city-slicker
dreams, Cunningham also gives us some delightful portraits of the
people who became their neighbors and friends. She tells us about
the Smithsons, another couple from the city, who stocked their pond
with $10,000 worth of koi fish and installed a zen waterfall. She
recalls Lord Hodgson phoning to apologize for ``the poor color of
the foliage this year'' and hoping ``to do better for you next
fall.'' And she memorializes the estate's late caretaker, Cecil
Green, who for almost 60 years presided over the grounds, tending
to the boilers in winter, the gardens in summer and the year-round
mending of the fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Cecil,'' she writes, ``I know windmills once stood
behind my house, that potatoes grew in the yard, and that the
foundation that walls my tennis court was once part of a great
dairy barn. `Mice chewed matches,' was how Cecil explained the fire
that burned down the barn long before my time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of her own 18 years in the country, Cunningham
says she has witnessed the gradual demise of a way of life. Nearby,
she notes, malls ``were replacing mountains, spawning satellite
strips like lunar landing stations, almost overnight.'' Modular
houses were popping up like mushrooms in the fields, and light
pollution was blanching the nighttime skies. By the turn of the
millennium, Lord Hodgson had sold his manor house to the followers
of an Indian swami, who had once visited the estate in the 19th
century. And the Bowers, too, put their dairy farm on the block.
Their farm equipment was sold at auction, the cows trucked away to
a new home.
</P>
<P>
   A New York City psychiatrist bought the Bowers' farm for just
over a million dollars and within days had workmen tearing down
silos and installing lacquered doors. Cunningham, a city girl who
by now had logged more years in the country than in New York, began
thinking of borrowing some cows from a farmer down the road: She
says she could no longer envision life without them.

   ECOM-SMALL-BUSINESSES-ON-WEB _ Small businesses are increasingly
becoming a big deal when it comes to business-to-business
transactions on the Internet. A myriad of dot-com companies are
developing marketplaces and services to give small businesses the
same opportunities available to large corporations. For example,
the Internet enabled Malcolm Carmichael to eliminate inventory and
bookkeeping paperwork for the five convenience stores he operates
near Laurel, Miss. Joe Ryan, a private investigator in the
Cincinnati area, has cut his office-supply expenses in half by

ALMOST FAMOUS: DONAL LOGUE DANCES ON THE BRINK OF STARDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Donal Logue in a scene from ``The Tao of
Steve.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Donal Logue gathers no moss.
 &HT;    Over the past two years, Logue has acted in nine feature films,
a short digital video and two television pilots. And, somewhere in
between, he and his girlfriend welcomed into the world a son named
Flinn, now 17 months old.
 &HT;    The actor obviously has ignored the advice of his pal, fellow
thespian Bill Paxton.
 &HT;    ``Bill is a great guy with a great attitude,'' Logue says by
telephone from his Los Angeles home. ``But one thing he told me is,
`You're special, man, so don't be available for weddings and bar
mitzvahs.'
 &HT;    ``I understand that,'' the actor says. ``It's one take on
things. But if I had to hang up the phone now, go grease my hair,
put on strange glasses and become somebody else for a while, I'd be
psyched.''
 &HT;    OK, so Logue loves his craft. But you're probably still asking,
who is this guy?
 &HT;    He's a familiar face to a lot of people, actually. Jimmy the cab
driver in MTV's old ad spots? Logue. Quinn, the bad guy in
``Blade'' (1998)? Logue. The priest in ``Runaway Bride'' (1999)?
Shane Pencil in the Madonna spoof ``Medusa: Dare to Be Truthful''
(1992)? Tom Colton in the ``X-Files'' episode ``Squeeze'' (1993)?
Logue, Logue and Logue.
 &HT;    As for those aforementioned nine films, there was ``Runaway
Bride,'' ``The Big Tease'' and ``Takedown,'' all released in 1999,
as well as the 2000 titles ``Reindeer Games,'' ``The Patriot,''
``The Million Dollar Hotel,'' ``Steal This Movie!'' ``The
Opportunists'' and ``The Tao of Steve.''
 &HT;    Two of those movies, ``The Opportunists'' and ``The Tao of
Steve,'' are currently in limited release. Logue takes a supporting
role in ``The Opportunists,'' playing a working-class guy from
Queens, N.Y., who tries to improve his lot in life by pressuring a
reluctant ex-con (Christopher Walken) into making one more big
score.
 &HT;    ``It's a good little film,'' says Logue, a 34-year-old native of
Ottawa, Canada. ``When I was in New York and couldn't find work, I
just always wanted to be one of those actors who worked on the
street in cool, gritty independent movies. So this was my chance.
 &HT;    ``I also got to work with Christopher Walken,'' he adds. ``It's
his character's story, and it was nice to see Chris play a normal
guy.''
 &HT;    Not to give short shrift to ``The Opportunists,'' but
opportunity really knocks with ``The Tao of Steve.'' The offbeat
romantic comedy places Logue in the spotlight _ it's his
character's story this time. Logue plays Dex, once a college stud
and now, on the eve of his 10-year reunion, a portly kindergarten
teacher whose dating habits are based on the Tao of Steve, a
philosophy incorporating the musings of Lao-tzu, Groucho Marx and
Heidegger.
 &HT;    Dex's belief in the Tao of Steve is put to the test when he
meets Syd (Greer Goodman), a woman who designs scenery for the
Santa Fe Opera and rides motorcycles. And the more he gets to know
Syd, the less useful the Tao of Steve becomes.
 &HT;    The film, co-written by Goodman and Jenniphr Goodman and
directed by Goodman, elicited cheers at the Sundance Film Festival,
and was subsequently snapped up for distribution by Sony Pictures
Classics.
 &HT;    ``I related to the story on every level, as a guy who had to use
his humor and wit and anything else to do well in the Darwinian
process of hooking up with hot chicks when I was in high school and
college,'' Logue says. ``I'd also studied all these thinkers when I
was at Harvard. So many film scripts have pathetic references to,
say, Nietzsche. The people making `Tao of Steve' actually
understood the references they were making.
 &HT;    ``On the set, a lot of ideas were bouncing around between
Jenniphr and Greer, but it was very democratic,'' he adds. ``They
gave me a lot of rope, and I'd also fight for my own ideas
sometimes, and that was OK. Everybody's opinions were respected.''
 &HT;    Heading into release, the buzz is that ``The Tao of Steve''
could emerge as this year's indie sleeper, 2000's ``The Full
Monty.'' Logue likes the sound of that, but he's been there before
and seen his hopes dashed.
 &HT;    ``I'm very psyched that it got to the first stages of that
process, because so many of the `little films that could' that I've
done just never got over the hump,'' he says. ``I did one called
`The Size of Watermelons' (1996) with Paul Rudd. The audience
response to it was similar to `The Tao of Steve,' but it just never
got legs.
 &HT;    ```The Tao of Steve' got to Sundance and it's getting
distribution, but it scares the sh-t out of me what happens after
that,'' he says. ``By virtue of being on 3,000 screens, every major
film in America _ even `Rocky and Bullwinkle' _ gets seen by
someone. Little films start in a couple of cities and go to five
and, hopefully, build to more.
 &HT;    ``So I'm nervous and excited and interested in seeing what
happens,'' he concludes. ``I hope for the best, but expect that it
might not be `The Full Monty.' Could you imagine if it was?''
 &HT;    Later this summer, Logue will appear as part of the ensemble
cast in the Abbie Hoffman biographical feature ``Steal This
Movie!'' And in the fall he'll begin shooting ``Grounded for
Life,'' a television sitcom that Fox will keep on tap as a
midseason replacement.
 &HT;    If either ``The Tao of Steve'' or ``Grounded for Life'' catches
a bit of instant karma and breaks out, Logue could be whisked along
for the ride. Though the prospect of better roles in better
productions appeals to the actor, he once again waves a caution
flag.
 &HT;    ``Having a bit of a name might be nice, but I have no desire to
be a star,'' Logue says, pronouncing the final word as a diva-esque
``stahr.'' ``I get into arguments over this.
 &HT;    ``Some people think, `Well, stars want to be stars,''' the actor
says. ``Yeah, some do, but Kurt Cobain was a talented musician who
I don't think was built in such a way, inside, that he wanted to be
mobbed at the grocery store.
 &HT;    ``You can be an introverted, introspective person and enjoy
being an actor and have a gift for it,'' Logue says. ``I can be
introverted and extroverted. I like people. Right now, anyone I've
met who's recognized me has been very cool and pleasant.
 &HT;    ``I hope that won't change.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Men with fantasies and women with hopes have always managed to
connect. Now sites that draw on those dreams have exploded across
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest growth appears to be in sites that promote
international marriages, Internet versions of the 19th-century
mail-order-bride business. More than 200 such sites exist in the
United States alone, with earnings for some estimated at as much as
$2 million a year, although other operators cite much lower
figures.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the number of marriages between American men and foreign
women who met through online matchmakers has doubled in the last
decade, totaling 4,000 to 6,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The international online-matchmaking services are thriving
largely because of increased Internet access worldwide, low
overhead, low start-up costs and an abundance of eligible foreign
women, 100,000 to 150,000 of whom advertise themselves on
e-matchmaking sites each year.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s most mail-order brides came from the Philippines,
where the economy was in shambles. Today more than half of the
online mail-order-bride businesses cater to men seeking mates from
Russia and Ukraine, countries in steep economic decline where, not
coincidentally, women make up more than 80 percent of the
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why most such sites are heavy on postings like this
one, from Nataliya, a 29-year-old, divorced nonsmoker from Russia:
``I am tender, caressing dantist with unusual sense of humor. I
have daughter with appearance and character of angel ... I am
looking for man ... not greedy, tender, not tedious.''
</P>
<P>
   Nataliya has been ``viewed'' 655 times since November on
www.cherry-blossoms.com, the site operated by the Hawaii-based
Cherry Blossoms Inc., which has been in the mail-order-bride
business for 26 years. Cherry Blossoms used to rely solely on its
expensively printed catalogs, says Mike Krosky, president of the
company. Today, however, 50 percent of its business comes from the
Internet, compared with only 15 percent to 20 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a mate from another culture is not unusual _ the United
States is home to millions of cross-cultural marriages. What is new
is the increasing sophistication of international e-matchmakers in
their delivery of services.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies use the same features found on other e-commerce
sites, such as electronic shopping carts. Critics contend that this
approach underscores the suggestion, always present in the bride
business, that the woman is being bought _ a fantasy that, they
contend, contributes to high rates of divorce or abuse after
reality sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever lies at the heart of the transaction, the competitive
advantages _ and the profits _ for site owners arise from their
ability to provide clients with more than merely a woman's address.
</P>
<P>
   The Cherry Blossoms site, for example, boasts a database of more
than 16,000 women, which can be sorted by country of origin,
education, age, eye color, race, height, weight, religion, number
of children and whether she is a smoker or a drinker. A visitor
types in his criteria, and head shots of women who fit that profile
appear on the screen. Double-clicking on a head shot produces a
full-body shot, a biography and vital statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But at Cherry Blossoms and other leading sites, the address
database is merely a portal to a menu of services that are intended
to extract money at nearly every step a client takes toward the
altar.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry Blossoms, like other established sites, begins by
charging a client when he requests an address. Starting at $75,
Krosky's company offers a membership fee that provides a client
with 15 addresses. At the high end is the ``Premier Guaranteed
Membership,'' which, at $595, includes 100 addresses, plus two
``individualized searches'' of the database, which Krosky conducts
on the client's behalf, one-to-one coaching with Krosky _ himself
married three times, most recently to a woman from the Philippines
whom he met through his own business _ and an online photograph and
biography which, Krosky says, guarantees a client ``60-plus
letters'' from women.
</P>
<P>
   Other innovations include e-mail forwarding. A client can
request that his photograph or a love letter be hand-delivered in
three to five days, rather than in two to three weeks by
international mail.
</P>
<P>
   One of Krosky's competitors, Scanna International
(www.scanna &QC; .com), adds a link to Flower and Gift International
(www.smartlink.net &QC; /ais/flower). There the delivery of roses, a box
of chocolates and a card costs a customer at least $155, and can
also include _ at additional cost, of course _ a snapshot of the
woman receiving her gift. Another rival, Euroladies
(www.euroladies.com), offers three-way conference calling with an
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Both Euroladies and Scanna offer the fiancee a visa-preparation
kit. At the top of the price scale are organized tours to Russia
and Ukraine, offered by Euroladies and Scanna. Euroladies
guarantees that men will meet more than 800 women in 10 days for
$3,000 to $5,000, including hotel and airfare. Scanna offers a
referral to Anastasia Tours, which offers tours for the same price
as Euroladies. Anastasia's tours include introductions to 600 to
1,000 women and a 10-percent discount ``when you bring a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if true love does not last, the e-matchmaking sites are
ready to help: Some men are repeat customers, returning to the same
Internet site on which they had found a previous, now-ex wife.

appear on the screen. Double-clicking on a head shot produces a
full-body shot, a biography and vital statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But at Cherry Blossoms and other leading sites, the address
database is merely a portal to a menu of services that are intended
to extract money at nearly every step a client takes toward the
altar.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry Blossoms, like other established sites, begins by
charging a client when he requests an address. Starting at $75,
Krosky's company offers a membership fee that provides a client
with 15 addresses. At the high end is the ``Premier Guaranteed
Membership,'' which, at $595, includes 100 addresses, plus two
``individualized searches'' of the database, which Krosky conducts
on the client's behalf, one-to-one coaching with Krosky _ himself
married three times, most recently to a woman from the Philippines
whom he met through his own business _ and an online photograph and
biography which, Krosky says, guarantees a client ``60-plus
letters'' from women.
</P>
<P>
   Other innovations include e-mail forwarding. A client can
request that his photograph or a love letter be hand-delivered in
three to five days, rather than in two to three weeks by
international mail.
</P>
<P>
   One of Krosky's competitors, Scanna International
(www.scanna &QC; .com), adds a link to Flower and Gift International
(www.smartlink.net &QC; /ais/flower). There the delivery of roses, a box
of chocolates and a card costs a customer at least $155, and can
also include _ at additional cost, of course _ a snapshot of the
woman receiving her gift. Another rival, Euroladies
(www.euroladies.com), offers three-way conference calling with an
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Both Euroladies and Scanna offer the fiancee a visa-preparation
kit. At the top of the price scale are organized tours to Russia
and Ukraine, offered by Euroladies and Scanna. Euroladies
guarantees that men will meet more than 800 women in 10 days for
$3,000 to $5,000, including hotel and airfare. Scanna offers a
referral to Anastasia Tours, which offers tours for the same price
as Euroladies. Anastasia's tours include introductions to 600 to
1,000 women and a 10-percent discount ``when you bring a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if true love does not last, the e-matchmaking sites are
ready to help: Some men are repeat customers, returning to the same
Internet site on which they had found a previous, now-ex wife.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   For a private investigator near Cincinnati, it means a chance to
find better prices on office supplies and T-shirts. To the owner of
five convenience stores in Mississippi, it opens doors to
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, small businesses may seem like small potatoes, but
as a whole, they are increasingly seen as a big deal when it comes
to business-to-business transactions on the Internet. A myriad of
dot-com companies are developing marketplaces and services to give
small businesses the same opportunities available to large
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, the whole world can be your territory,'' said Bruce
Richardson, a senior vice president at AMR Research Inc., an
industry and market analysis firm in Boston specializing in
e-business strategy and infrastructure. ``You know the saying, `On
the Internet, no one knows you're a dog.' It's sort of been the
great equalizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, Internet-based business exchanges,
e-marketplaces and free and fee-based business services have
proliferated for small and midsize businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the field is ``not out of diapers,'' said Thomas M.
Koulopoulos, the president and founder of Delphi Group, an advisory
company specializing in business and technology. He and other
analysts think it will be three to five years before these
exchanges become serious e-commerce operations.
</P>
<P>
   But as with most things related to the Internet, time is of the
essence as marketplaces vie to organize the buyers and sellers that
will determine the success of these ventures. While big businesses
with well-established supply chains have an advantage, the sheer
magnitude of small business _ there are 5.5 million businesses with
fewer than 500 employees in the United States _ makes them an
attractive group to organize.
</P>
<P>
   The likely result, Koulopoulos said, ``is a pecking order, a
hierarchy of exchanges.''
</P>
<P>
   At the top are exchanges controlled by big corporations, such as
automakers, which broaden into smaller business sectors that are
just beginning to form. The creation of such markets is viewed as
an opportunity to fundamentally change the way small businesses
operate.
</P>
<P>
   But while the potential is there, many small businesses lack the
equipment and ability to participate fully. For companies trying to
establish marketplaces, that can mean providing a little help.
</P>
<P>
   For example, GlobalSupplyNet.com, a company that organizes the
janitorial supply industry, is providing some of its clients with
computers and initially allowing them to use the service for free.
</P>
<P>
   They see the highly fragmented business as the perfect target.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a $32 billion industry, and they're all little players,''
said Steven Odzer, the company's founder. ``These people want to
use the Internet, but they have no one to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   While organizing marketplaces is the main goal of many
companies, many small businesses are entering the marketplaces
piecemeal, often as buyers looking for better prices on supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Ryan, a private investigator near Cincinnati with a
family-run business called Investigative Concepts, turned to
Mondus.com, an e-marketplace geared to small and midsize
businesses, to see whether he could save money in purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   Mondus allows businesses to obtain competitive quotes on goods
and services. Ryan estimated that he saved about half of what he
normally spent on items such as envelopes and stationery.
</P>
<P>
   For Malcolm Carmichael, the vice president of a family-owned
business that operates five convenience stores near Laurel, Miss.,
the Internet has offered a means to eliminate the voluminous
paperwork for inventory and bookkeeping. The task was eating up
hours of manpower and keeping the company from expanding.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael said he had looked at stand-alone systems to link his
stores, but they would have cost $50,000 to $80,000 to build, not
including upkeep. But through a recent Internet offering,
Storereport.com, he has accomplished the same connection for $99 a
month for each store with an investment of less than $4,000 in
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Storereport is a good example of the ambitions being built on
the small-business market. Bill Scott, who created the site, wants
to do more than link stores to process their paperwork. His goal is
to create a Web market to serve oil marketers and gas-station and
convenience-store operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had 35,000 convenience stores online, we'd be in a
position to do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Scott has five customers with 20 convenience stores,
most of which also sell gasoline. He hopes that his expertise in
technology will help him organize the market, but competition will
most likely be fierce. Five other groups, including the National
Association of Convenience Stores, would like to do the same thing,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finding an established group to build on is becoming
increasingly important for companies setting up
business-to-business operations. While analysts estimate that more
than 600 business exchanges are operating on the Internet, they
predict that number will shrink to fewer than 100 by 2001 because
independent exchanges have found it hard to attract and control
business.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the doors being opened, the jumble of offerings and
shifting playing fields can make it difficult for small businesses
to find what works for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part is finding these sites,'' said Maria
Barreros, the business development manager at KNC Marketing, the
company Investigative Concepts used for its T-shirt purchase on the
Mondus site.
</P>
<P>
   Barreros has sold excess inventory on eBay and scoured
government purchasing sites. But it can still be difficult to find
what you need, she said, and it's easy for a small business to get
overlooked when selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my boss believes that if we're not in this within the
next couple of years, we'd be out of business,'' Barreros said.
``But at this time it hasn't made a big impact.''

STAND-UP COMICS: STAN LEE KEEPS THE CLOBBERIN' COMING

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of comic-book creator Stan Lee, amid
drawings of many of his creations.) 
 By PHILLIP ZONKEL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Stan Lee is ready for his close-up.
 &HT;    In June, the comic-book icon went to Malibu for the shooting of
his walk-on role in the new ``X-Men'' film, which opened July 14.
During a beach scene, as a hideously deformed mutant arises from
the ocean, Lee _ who, along with artist Jack Kirby, created the
X-Men back in 1963 _ has a two-second screen appearance as a
hot-dog vendor.
 &HT;    ``I used the Stanislavsky method,'' Lee says, furrowing his
brow. ``I tried to think like a hot-dog vendor, look like a hot-dog
vendor. I don't think you'd suspect for a minute that I'm not
really a hot-dog vendor.''
 &HT;    Do you want ketchup and mustard with that?
 &HT;    Condiments aside, the 77-year-old Manhattan native is arguably
the most influential comic-book creator of all time.
 &HT;    In 1940 the 16-year-old Lee joined Timely Comics, the precursor
to Marvel Comics, writing everything from horror stories and
Westerns to romances and war dramas. Two decades later he reignited
the faltering super-hero genre, sweeping Marvel Comics to the
industry forefront with his larger-than-life characters, who did
much more than leap tall buildings in a single bound.
 &HT;    By 1968 Lee had revolutionized the comic-book business, creating
such memorable series as ``The Amazing Spider-Man,'' ``The
Avengers,'' ``Daredevil,'' ``Dr. Strange,'' ``The Fantastic Four,''
``The Incredible Hulk,'' ``Iron Man,'' ``Thor'' and ``The X-Men.''
 &HT;    ``He was a prolific creator and really laid the foundation for
Marvel Comics,'' says Michael Dean, news editor of The Comics
Journal, an industry trade publication. ``They were so imitated by
other companies that you could say he laid the foundation for the
comics industry as it exists today.''
 &HT;    Not that Lee can be held responsible for the dark,
ultra-violent, hypersexual comic books that occupy much of today's
market.
 &HT;    ``I used to pride myself on the fact that every story I did
could be read by a very young child without the parent worrying
about it,'' says Lee, relaxing with his feet on his desk in his
office in Encino, Calif. ``I always try to put a little bit of
humor in. I don't like depressing stories. I don't like violence _
I like a lot of action, I like fight scenes, but to me there's a
difference between action and violence.
 &HT;    ``I tried to keep it clean enough and understandable enough for
young kids,'' he concludes, ``and yet intelligent enough and
engrossing enough for older readers. You walk a fine line.''
 &HT;    To judge by the popular success of his 1960s comics _ not to
mention their skyrocketing value as collector's items now _ Lee
seems to have found that balance.
 &HT;    ``I grew up reading these comics, and there's a definite voice
that was unique for the time,'' the 45-year-old Dean says. ``His
main idea was that they would be super-heroes with feet of clay.
They would have the same problems as real people _ Spider-Man had
problems with girls and at work.
 &HT;    ``What you see in the comics is a lot of effort to inject
serious literary elements,'' Dean says. ``You have internal
psychological conflicts within the characters, which you didn't
normally see before Stan Lee. He wanted to elevate the form a
little bit, but also knew how absurd that looked when you put it
alongside guys in costumes swinging from webs. So he established a
very camp tone _ sometimes it's very serious, but often he'll
puncture the story with little asides.''
 &HT;    That mix of serious drama and tongue-in-cheek humor is apparent
in director Brian Singer's hit movie ``X-Men,'' currently topping
the box-office charts. Lee had no creative input on the film _
though he has an executive-producer credit, Lee says, ``It's more
of an honorary title. I didn't have that much to do with producing
it'' _ but screenwriter David Hayter's story is adapted from
original ideas developed by Lee and by Chris Claremont, who wrote
the comic book from 1975 to 1991.
 &HT;    The basic premise of the movie, like that of the comic book, is
the notion that the United States isn't necessarily a land of the
free for people who are different from the norm. It's no
coincidence that Lee launched the comic in 1963, at the height of
the civil-rights movement.
 &HT;    ``There's a connection, but it was subliminal,'' Lee says. ``All
I was thinking about was how to come up with a good team of heroes
and a good team of villains that could have interesting adventures.
 &HT;    ``But when I started writing it, it seemed fun to do heroes with
special powers who not only aren't appreciated by the public, but
also are hated and harassed and hounded by the public,'' he
recalls. ``It occurred to me that that was quite a good metaphor
for bigotry and persecution, because they were being persecuted
just because they were different.''
 &HT;    Thirty-seven years later, Lee believes, those themes are still
relevant.
 &HT;    ``I'm sorry it's needed today. I wish it wasn't necessary, but
we all know it is,'' he says. ``I'm glad Brian Singer and David
Hayter made it a big part of the movie. It will give a depth that
the average action picture doesn't have.''
 &HT;    Lee stopped writing for Marvel on a regular basis in 1972,
moving up to the publisher's office. Five years later he began
writing the daily ``Spider-Man'' newspaper strip, which still is
syndicated in more than 500 newspapers.
 &HT;    In 1998, after 26 years as publisher, Lee left Marvel to join
media guru Peter Paul in launching Stan Lee Media. He left behind a
unique legacy: To date, more than 2 billion of his comic books have
been published in more than 75 countries and 25 different
languages.
 &HT;    A publicly held business, Stan Lee Media creates animation
franchises. The company's initial offering was a comic book
starring the Backstreet Boys as super-heroes. Lee also has joined
forces with his former arch-rivals, DC Comics, for ``Just Imagine
Stan Lee Creating,'' for which he's writing original stories
starring DC titans such as Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. The
first issues are expected by early 2001.
 &HT;    And now Lee, who won his first comic-book stripes back in the
days of World War II, has entered cyberspace. In February he kicked
off ``The 7th Portal,'' an Internet comic accessible at
www.stanlee.net. It features 14 new crimefighters and evil enemies,
his first new-character creations in more than 25 years.
 &HT;    In other words, at 77 Lee is busier than ever. The only thing
that would make him happier would be if he could stop writing.
 &HT;    ``I don't really like to write,'' he admits. ``Once I'm writing
it's OK, but it's so hard for me to sit down and begin. There are a
million things I'd rather do _ watch television, take a walk, talk
to my wife, ride a bike, do anything.
 &HT;    ``Writing is a lonely process,'' he says. ``I can't have any
distractions. I sit alone in my room and write.
 &HT;    ``I love it when it's finished,'' Lee says, brightening. ``Even
doing it isn't bad _ it's knowing you have to do it that's bad. But
once you're into it, it rolls out.''
 &HT;    But don't expect Stan Lee to put down his pen any time soon.
 &HT;    ``I love creating things,'' he says. ``To me, providing
entertainment of any sort is the most fun you can have. When the
public likes what you're doing, that's so rewarding.''

 (Includes a color slide of John Waters directing Melanie Griffith
in a scene from ``Cecil B. Demented.'') 
 By SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Call him ``the pope of trash,'' a moniker bestowed by none other
than American scatological icon William Burroughs. Call him ``the
duke of dirt.'' Call him ``trashmeister.''
 &HT;    Whatever you call him, John Waters was shocking audiences long
before the Farrelly brothers first struck box-office gold with
their wildly outrageous comedies.
 &HT;    Now the 54-year-old anti-establishment filmmaker, whose perverse
sense of humor and talent for cultural satire are as sharp as his
pencil-thin mustache, is taking on Hollywood itself in ``Cecil B.
Demented,'' opening nationwide on Aug. 11.
 &HT;    The action-filled, off-the-wall send-up stars Melanie Griffith
as a movie queen kidnaped by the crazed Cecil B. Demented (Stephen
Dorff) to star in a radical underground movie. The supporting cast
includes such Waters regulars as Ricki Lake, Patricia Hearst and
Mink Stole.
 &HT;    Waters got the idea for his latest effort from the gay newspaper
The Advocate.
 &HT;    ``They did an interview with me and called me `Cecil B.
Demented,''' he recalls. ``It made me laugh, and I took it as a
compliment. Then I began to think about creating a fictitious
super-hero who was willing to risk everything, even his life, to
make an anti-Hollywood propaganda movie.
 &HT;    ``It's got a lot of action scenes,'' he adds, ``which I've never
done before. I call it my `Die Hard for the Hollywood-Impaired.'''
 &HT;    While shootouts, fights and car chases abound in ``Cecil B.
Demented,'' the black comedy's biggest surprise is Griffith's
no-holds-barred spoof of the stereotypically spoiled, difficult
Hollywood diva.
 &HT;    ``I knew I had to get a real A-list actress to play the part,''
Waters says. ``I think Melanie was very brave to take on that whole
persona of the star bitch. She has a really good sense of humor
about herself, which is why she's survived the ups and downs of
making films.
 &HT;    ``After she saw the script, I went to her house for a meeting,''
he continues. ``It was right up the street from where O.J. used to
live, which gave me a nightmare vision as I drove by. Then I
knocked on her door, and Melanie answered wearing skintight
black-leather jeans, a T-shirt with a skull on it, and no make-up.
 &HT;    ``I thought, `There's my girl.'''
 &HT;    Griffith dove wholeheartedly into the tasteless, foul-mouthed
spirit of the film.
 &HT;    ``I told her she was a Waters girl and she had to go for it,''
the director says. ``We did have a little negotiation over her
fringed hair, false eyelashes and mascara. Let's just say we talked
about that more than her swearing.''
 &HT;    Ironically, Waters admits that he had more qualms about one
outrageous moment than Griffith did.
 &HT;    ``There's a scene where she's giving Ricki Lake, who plays her
assistant, a hard time,'' he recalls, ``and Melanie says something
like, `I'm in the presidential suite where Nixon and his wife
stayed _ find out if Pat Nixon got f--ked here.'
 &HT;    ``My uncle was undersecretary of the interior for Nixon,'' the
director says, ``and I suddenly thought, `If he sees this, he's
really going to get mad.' But I left it in.''
 &HT;    Griffith has praised Waters as a filmmaker who ``doesn't give a
sh-t,'' but he doesn't quite see that as a compliment.
 &HT;    ``I do give a sh-t what people think,'' he says. ``Otherwise, I
don't think I'd have been making movies for 36 years. I do care,
and bad reviews are more painful than good reviews. I guess you
could say my list of people whose opinions are important to me is
selective.''
 &HT;    The film's radical moviemakers are wont to spout anti-industry
slogans such as ``Hey, hey, MPAA, how many movies do we have to
censor today?'' _ but, ironically, Waters had less trouble than
usual with the Motion Picture Association of America and its
ratings board.
 &HT;    ``We got an R for `Cecil B. Demented,''' he says, ``for `crude
sexual content, violence, drug usage and language.'
 &HT;    ``I hate it when they say `language,''' he adds. ``That's just
poor English. Why don't they just come out and say `bad language?'
Anyway, an R for a John Waters film is certainly nothing to get
excited about. I was happier when they gave the re-release of `Pink
Flamingos' an NC-17.''
 &HT;    As with all his films, from the enduring cult favorite ``Pink
Flamingos'' (1972) to ``Hairspray'' (1988), ``Serial Mom'' (1994)
and ``Pecker'' (1998), ``Cecil B. Demented'' was shot in the
director's native Baltimore, where some of the town's oldest and
most famous movie palaces were the setting for attacks on
everything from high concession prices to emotionally simplistic
family films.
 &HT;    Going to movies isn't as much fun as it used to be, Waters
believes.
 &HT;    ``More than anything, I'm bothered by people who talk during a
screening,'' he says. ``I got in a big fight the other day because
someone was yakking nonstop in `Scary Movie.' I loved it when
someone in the film got killed for talking in a theater _ it was
like art imitating life.
 &HT;    ``I also hate people who bring babies,'' he adds. ``I actually
said to one couple with a kid who started crying, `Couldn't you get
a baby sitter?' They said, `Sorry, no.' Like it was my problem.''
 &HT;    Waters drew on his own experience to depict the bargain-basement
world of Cecil B. Demented and his no-budget productions.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't have made `Pink Flamingos' without some financial
help from my father _ and thankfully he never saw it, because I
know he would hate it,'' Waters says. ``I actually went over budget
_ I had planned to spend $10,000, and it cost $12,000.
 &HT;    ``I was doing films on a shoestring and on the run,'' he
recalls. ``I guess my worst experience was getting arrested while
we were doing `Mondo Trasho' (1969) with Divine. It was a scene
where she's driving in a big red Cadillac, and she passes this
hitchhiker and imagines he's nude. So we had this naked guy
standing by the side of the road, and somebody called the cops.
 &HT;    ``We ran and Divine got away,'' Waters says, ``which doesn't say
much for the Baltimore cops, since she weighed about 300 pounds.
They caught me, and I was charged with conspiracy to commit
indecent exposure. I got off, but I remember having to show all my
films to the district attorney, which was a memorable moment.''
 &HT;    Ironically, Waters tells the story of Cecil B. Demented at a
time when his own career has been edging into the mainstream, with
his recent films enjoying larger budgets and wider audiences.
 &HT;    ``Even though I'm spoofing Hollywood movies, I'd have to say
Hollywood has not been horrible to me,'' he admits. ``I've had some
executives say, `I love your movies, but I couldn't risk my job by
giving you the money to do one.' I understand that. I'm not going
to give them a huge hit.''
 &HT;    As for his enduring reputation as, to quote one critic, ``the
arbiter of blatant, graphic tastelessness,'' Waters doesn't shy
away from it.
 &HT;    ``I plead guilty,'' he says, ``but I'd like to put one adjective
before those words: `joyous.' I can think of movies that are
tasteless and vile, but they aren't witty and they aren't very
funny. I've done comic obscenity and joyous obscenity.
 &HT;    ``I'm not Cecil B. Demented,'' he concludes with a shrug. ``But
if he were real and made a movie, I'd be the first to buy a
ticket.''

   All-time high temperatures will be in jeopardy in a few places
across the Great Basin Tuesday as heat intensifies under the
auspice of very warm high pressure aloft. Daily records will
probably fall in parts of Utah, Idaho, Nevada and interior
California, while thunderstorms sprout over mountains in response
to the uneven heating of valleys and peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated but potent thunderstorms will menace eastern Montana
and western North Dakota near a warm front. Meanwhile, locally
heavy rains will douse the central Gulf Coast as sluggish
thunderstorms erupt.
</P>
<P>
   Hit-or-miss clusters of thunderstorms will produce locally heavy
rains over the sultry Middle Atlantic states. Locally heavy rains
are also possible over upstate New York and southern New England.

   Warnings were in effect Monday for the island of Oahu as
Tropical Storm Daniel, which sprung to life off the coast of Mexico
on July 23, passed north of Hawaii. Since 1950, only three
hurricanes have directly affected Hawaii. In all three cases, Kauai
was the only big island to be hit. Hurricane Iniki and Hurricane
Iwa, both of which formed over the central Pacific in 1992 and 1982
respectively, lashed Kauai, although, technically, Iwa's eye did
not quite come ashore. In 1950, Hurricane Dot hit Kauai, making it
the only eastern Pacific hurricane to hit the Hawaiian Islands in
half of a century.

DEATH-DEFYING ACT: BUTTERFLY THRIVES ON A POISON VINE
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rap sheet could scarcely be more shocking. Poisoning with
cyanide. Cannibalism. Molestation of minors. But wait, there are
extenuating circumstances. The perpetrator is highly intelligent,
with a brain more than twice as large as normal. He is remarkably
elegant, if that's an excuse. He leads an unusually industrious
life. And he is not a party to this society's moral code, being but
a butterfly with perhaps one of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Heliconius butterflies live in the tropical forests of Central
and South America aside from one species, Heliconius zebra, which
has taken a liking to Florida. The adults have distinctive rounded
wings with colorful stripes. Most butterflies fly at full speed to
escape predators. But heliconians saunter from flower to flower,
flaunting their bright hues, as if they hadn't an enemy in the
world. The adult butterflies favor flowers known as forest
cucumbers but as caterpillars they feed on the leaves of a family
of vines that produce one of the most gorgeous flowers next to
orchids, the passion flowers.
</P>
<P>
   In the forest, everything that is strikingly beautiful is
sinister. The creatures that dare display themselves have hidden
defenses. The Heliconius butterflies can afford to be nonchalant
because their tissues are stuffed with cyanide.
</P>
<P>
   A curious fact is that the passion vines on which they feed are
also packed with cyanide-laden chemicals known as cyanogens,
although of a different kind than the cyanogens the butterflies
make. As soon as hungry mouths start chewing the vine's leaves, its
cells release an enzyme that breaks out the cyanide. Cyanide is a
universal poison that interferes with cells' respiration.
</P>
<P>
   A common interest in the poisoner's art is just one of many
links that bind the insect and the vine together. Lawrence E.
Gilbert of the University of Texas has been studying Heliconius and
passion flowers since 1969 and has explored many features of their
interactive biology. He and two colleagues, Helene S. Engler and
Kevin C. Spencer, have now begun to work out the chemical
interaction between the two. They reported in Nature last month
that one species of the butterfly, Heliconius sara, can convert the
principal cyanogen of its food plant to a source of nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists suspect that the vigorous interaction between the
vine and the butterfly over millions of years may have been a
driving force in each group's evolution. There are some 600 species
of passion vine in the New World, and 40 species of Heliconius. It
may be that the vines diversified first, buttressed by their
cyanide defense mechanism against the usual plant eaters.
</P>
<P>
   Then the butterflies broke the cyanide code and found they had a
rich range of food plants more or less to themselves. ``The
standard pattern is that a plant develops a novel chemical defense
and does well for a while, diversifying, and then some lucky group
of insects is able to overcome that defense, which allows them to
undergo a parallel radiation,'' said Andrew V.Z. Brower, an
entomologist at Oregon State University.
</P>
<P>
   Even though its prime defense was breached by the butterfly, the
passion vines fought back in other ways. Gilbert has found that
their leaves are very variable in shape, as if to disguise
themselves from hunting heliconians.
</P>
<P>
   Most remarkably, some species of vine have developed a defense
system of faux eggs. Female butterflies, if they see what appears
to be an egg on a new stem, will avoid it and lay elsewhere. The
false eggs, essentially yellow bumps on a leaf, exploit a dark
feature of Heliconius butterfly: Its caterpillars are cannibals.
Since they eat only the vine's young shoots, which are large enough
to support only one larva to maturity, the first caterpillar to
hatch will eat all the other eggs on its shoot.
</P>
<P>
   The vines have developed the faux eggs by adapting another
defense mechanism, nectar-dispensing glands that encourage ants to
take up residence on the leaves and repel intruders.
</P>
<P>
   The vines may be smart but the heliconians, to hear Gilbert
describing his favorite insect, are veritable Einsteins among
lepidoptera. Most butterflies lead what may seem pretty pointless
lives: they munch away furiously as caterpillars, hoping to turn
into pupae before birds or the dreaded ichneumon wasp discover
them, but live just a few days as adults. Apart from sipping
nectar, they are incapable of feeding.
</P>
<P>
   The heliconians have transcended this pointless life through a
simple but revolutionary advance. The butterflies have learned to
feed on pollen by sucking it into their tongues and secreting an
enzyme that digests the nutritious grains. This means they can live
for months. It also allows them to transfer much feeding effort
forward from the vulnerable caterpillar stage to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   If they can find enough pollen, female butterflies will keep
laying eggs until their skin and wings fray. Not for heliconians
the nectar-sex-and-hedonism routine of other butterflies. These are
busy insects. They stake out home territories, which they patrol
every day, checking out every vine in the neighborhood. The females
look for any new shoots produced by the passion vines. Both sexes
search for the brief-lived flowers of another sort of vine, the
forest cucumber, which provides the pollen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very effective at learning their habitat,'' Gilbert
said. ``Pollen feeding gives them a long life span, so once they
find a host plant they can relocate it. You see Heliconius
butterflies cruise in as if they know exactly where they are going.
So we'll see the same individual butterfly checking out the same
host plant for months.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Though no one knows too much about the organization of insect
brains, heliconians have a larger than usual ``mushroom body,'' a
region of the brain thought to be involved with memory.
</P>
<P>
   The male butterflies have put their minds to at least one
reprehensible purpose _ cradle-snatching. They have even invented
to a new crime, which might be called cradle rape. The butterflies
are so eager to find mates that they locate female pupae and perch
on them, sometimes four males to a pupa, until the female emerges,
obliged in her first instants of adult life to manage mating at the
same time as she is trying to unfurl her wings.
</P>
<P>
   Some species of heliconians have taken this aggressive
suitorship to a further extreme: they probe into the pupa and
fertilize the female before she has even emerged. These attentions
are lethal for females of heliconian species that do not practice
pupal mating, and have the useful result of preventing other
species from sharing the same food plant.
</P>
<P>
   Pollen feeding has been exploited by heliconians for more than
just nutrition. Long ago, maybe, the butterflies learned how to
convert the amino acids from the digested pollen into chemicals
known as aliphatic cyanogens. Spencer, a plant toxin chemist who is
now senior scientific adviser for the Safeway supermarket chain in
Britain, said this might have been the breakthrough that enabled
the butterflies to feed on the otherwise poisonous passion vines.
In developing their own cyanogen metabolism, they were somehow able
to neutralize the different kind of cyanogens produced by the
vines, Spencer suggested.
</P>
<P>
   If so, this may explain another key step in the butterfly's
evolutionary past, its development of mimicry. The heliconians may
first have mimicked a poisonous species in a related family of
butterflies without being poisonous themselves, an imitation known
as Batesian mimicry.
</P>
<P>
   Once they learned how to brew cyanide from pollen, they made
their own tissues toxic and developed the higher art of Mullerian
mimicry, in which poisonous species resemble one another. Many
Heliconine species exist as pairs that mimic one another. The
presumed advantage of Mullerian mimicry is that fewer individuals
are expended in teaching predators the virtues of avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   While evolving the narcissistic art of mimicking one another,
the heliconians have also been engaged in a furious evolutionary
arms race with the passion vines. The vines have evolved a witch's
brew of different cyanogens to fend off the butterflies, and each
new chemical may have required the heliconians to develop a new
stratagem to cope with it. One species of passion vine, Passiflora
auriculata, produces no fewer than five different cyanogens, a
perilous cocktail for the caterpillars of Heliconius sara, the
species that has learned how to eat the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Engler has now found that the caterpillars can detoxify the
principle cyanogen, a complex chemical called epivolkenin, and
convert its cyanide into useful nitrogen. Each step in this
intricate chemical battle, Spencer says, has evolved as a
tit-for-tat escalation between each species of heliconian and the
passion vine species that is its host plant. This relentless
chemical warfare may have been a factor in the present profusion of
species on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, who has spent 30 years studying the visible biology of
the heliconians and passion vines, hopes a whole new level of
interaction will emerge from study of the chemistry and genetics of
the system.

   LAREDO, Texas _ For the nation's political establishment, these
are exciting times. The nominating conventions are under way. Vice
presidential candidates are being picked and vetted. Ads are
hitting the airwaves. But here in dusty Ranchitos 359, an
impoverished ``colonia'' on Texas 359 outside Laredo, convention
fever has not taken hold. Indeed, as far as Dolores Estrada is
concerned, Philadelphia and the Republican National Convention
might as well be on the moon. She is equally unimpressed with the
Democrats, despite their recent claims that Gov. George W. Bush is
to blame for the decades-old, grinding poverty here. By JAY ROOT.

   PHILADELPHIA _ This city will never escape its history. Nor its
reputation. As the natives would say, you got yer Ben Franklin. You
got yer George Washington. But the name everybody remembers first
is yer Santa Claus. ``This is the city that booed Santa Claus,''
said Steve Harmon, a former Dallas radio personality now at a
budding Philadelphia country music station. ``People here know all
about that.'' That was at halftime of a Philadelphia Eagles pro
football game in 1968, not as long ago in memory as the city's last
national political conventions in 1948. This week, the nation will
see whether the same Philadelphia that bitterly despises the Dallas
Cowboys will boo or cheer two guys from Texas: George W. Bush and
Dick Cheney. By BUD KENNEDY. Story has moved in ``p'' political

programs ``in living color.'' After Thursday, Republicans hope to
be known as the ``full color'' party. By BOB RAY SANDERS. Story has

neighborhood of Dallas. It was summer 1964, and Eastland and some
buddies decided to stage a carwash to raise money for Barry
Goldwater's Republican presidential bid. But red tape threatened
when the ``local constabulary'' wouldn't let them carry political
signs on a busy corner. That's where politics came in. By KAREN

   PASADENA, Calif. _ TV series built around big-name stars are,
from the start, developed differently, and that's the problem.
Instead of beginning with an idea or premise and then working

   GOP-RDP-NYT (Philadelphia) _ A convention roundup: Republicans
open their convention, beginning what party leaders hope will be a
highly scripted four- day celebration of George W. Bush; the first
real business came when the delegates approved a platform that
reaffirms the party's staunch position opposing abortion while
adopting Bush's compassionate conservative positions; according to
a New York Times/CBS News poll of delegates, the Republicans here
are far more conservative than average Republican voters, but Karl
Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush campaign, played down the
dichotomy between the delegates and the message in an interview
Monday on ``Political Points,'' a joint production of ABCNEWS.com
and The New York Times on the Web. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-PLATFORM (Philadelphia) _ Maintaining the promise of a
friction-free convention, delegates to the Republican National
Convention swiftly adopt a platform that adheres to most of the
party's core conservative principles but softens some of the edges
on other issues, in keeping with George W. Bush's effort to project
a more compassionate image. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-ASSESS-NYT (Philadelphia) _ A political analysis by R.W.
Apple Jr. on the modern convention and how it got there. 1,100
words.

   DNA-VOLUNTEERS (Undated) _ A California startup company called
DNA Sciences is starting a Web site on Tuesday to recruit people to
donate their DNA to help find genes that cause disease. The
company, which has DNA double helix discoverer James D. Watson as a
director and Netscape founder James H. Clark as an investor, hopes
to get 50,000 to 100,000 people to contribute by appealing to their
altruism. The new effort reflects a major change taking place in
genetics: With the unraveling of the human genome, studies to link
genes to disease are starting to be done on an unprecedented scale,
involving far more people than ever before. In the past, scientists
usually found disease-causing genes by studying a few families or
some isolated village with a high prevalence of the particular
disease. Now, they need to survey many more patients and controls
to find statistical correlations between genes and disease or
between genes and drug effectiveness. By Andrew Pollack.

   ISRAEL-PERES (Jerusalem) _ At the moment Monday when the
announcement of the first of the two Knesset votes for Israel's
next president made it all but certain that he had lost the last
major battle of his 60-year political career, Shimon Peres, Noble
laureate, three-time prime minister and one of the most enduring
standard-bearers for Middle East peace, remained proudly, though
unobtrusively, in character. The result, with 60 votes for Moshe
Katsav, 57 votes for Peres, and three blank ballots, brought
groans, slumped shoulders and moist eyes among parliamentarians
backing Peres' bid to become Israel's eighth president. To those
who know him well, the 76-year-old statesman appeared ashen, but in
the simplicity of his manner and words he did nothing, despite the
moment's pain, to bely his reputation for courtliness and courage.
By John F. Burns.

<P>
   POP-LYRICS (Undated) _ In the 1980s and early '90s major music
labels held themselves up as free-speech champions as they fought
against pressure groups attacking specific songs. But today, as the
record-buying audience grows even younger, political pressures
persist, and the music business continues to consolidate as well as
fight battles on the Internet front, those free-speech claims have
decreased and an array of song-lyric review and editing procedures
have become routine. Artists are routinely asked to re-sing lyrics,
edit out particular words and even excise entire songs from albums.
Changes made to songs for radio play are often far more extensive
than the simple editing required to make them conform to federal
regulations. By Neil Strauss.

<P>
   NJ-GOVERNOR (Newark, N.J.) _ U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli said on
Monday that he will not seek the Democratic nomination for New
Jersey governor, stating that his effort over the past few weeks to
achieve party unity had failed.

<P>
   When delegates yelled ``Gong!'' and booed McCain, Huffington
said, it demonstrated just how different the Shadow Conventions are
going to be from this week's Republican National Convention and the
upcoming Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed that if you're going to have an open convention, you
can't control everything. It's not scripted,'' she said. ``People
hear things they may not agree with. You're not just preaching to
the choir.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Shadow Convention focused on the first of its
three major issues: How big money is corrupting politics. The war
on drugs and the growing gap between rich and poor Americans will
be the subject of coming sessions.
</P>
<P>
   While the days will be filled with serious discussions, satire
rules the evenings. Huffington and comedian Al Franken and other
irreverent observers provide running commentary on live feeds from
the real conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's serious speakers ranged from movie star Billy Baldwin,
president of the Creative Coalition, to ``Granny D'' _ 90-year-old
Doris Haddock, who walked from Pasadena, Calif., to Washington,
D.C., in a 14-month hike for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Bolton, minister of the Alston Chapel Holy Church in
Pittsboro, N.C., led the audience in singing an altered civil right
spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't gonna let big money turn me around, turn me around,''
they sang. ``I'm gonna keep on marchin' up the freedom way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby, Rob. R. Barron (a.k.a. Bo Chagnon of Atlanta) wore
a top hat and tuxedo and a button for ``Billionaires for Bush (Or
Gore).''
</P>
<P>
   Chagnon said the Shadow Convention is ``wonderful'' because it
is highlighting the growing divide between the nation's haves and
have-nots, while both major party convention are controlled by the
haves.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Common Cause and Public Campaign, the Shadow
Convention is being held in a University of Pennsylvania auditorium
decorated with red, white and blue balloons. Instead of displaying
the names of states, signs saying ``Disillusioned'' or
``Disappointed'' or ``Downsized'' distinguish sections of
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do better as a nation. That's why we're here at the
Shadow Convention,'' declared Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank y'all for what y'all are doing,'' said Rep. Mark
Sanford, R-S.C., praising ``the notion of building a convention
around the power of ideas rather then the power of influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanford and McCain are the only Republican members of Congress
to venture across town from the GOP convention to speak to the
alternative. Their messages blended into the common theme that big
campaign contributions from corporations and unions have corrupted
the political process and disheartened rank-and-file voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe that because they are not major contributors,
they have no access and their votes don't count,'' said Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side, many corporate leaders ``are tired of the
shakedown'' from politicians, said Charlie Kolb, president of the
Committee for Economic Development, a non-partisan group advocating
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are sick and tired of being sick and tired,'' agreed
Asia Russell, a leader of Act Up Philadelphia, an advocacy group in
the fight against AIDS.

MCCAIN UBIQUITOUS AS BUNTING AT GOP CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BUD KENNEDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Tuesday will be Day Two of the Sen. John McCain
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   With nobody here yet to shush him _ though Laura Bush might try
_ McCain has been talking on every street corner and shaking hands
at every Philly cheese steak stand, leaving no microphone silent as
he campaigns for Most Popular Ex-Candidate at the Republicans'
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, he's giving the keynote speech in prime time
after ``Judging Amy.'' Last night, he opined on ``Larry King
Live.'' All last weekend and all week, he has been tailed by
gaggles of reporters hanging on his every word, except when the
words are ``George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush doesn't get here soon, McCain may start moving in with
Laura. He's already making big-time moves on the Republican
nomination in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, everybody here is desperate to see a presidential
candidate. On Sunday night, 600 wavering Republican delegates and
even 10 members of Congress turned out to toast the arrival of a
widely promoted third-party candidate, Captain Morgan of The
Seagram Co.'s Rum Loyalists' Party.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he's the only politician who outdrew McCain. However,
the Republicans may have been attracted by the unfulfilled promise
of an appearance by ``Playboy'' ``playmate'' and vice presidential
candidate Kalin Olson (Miss August 1997) of Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Without benefit of playmates, McCain still attracted 70
reporters to ride along as he made his grand entrance to
Philadelphia aboard his ``Straight Talk Express'' campaign bus from
Arlington, Va., with three more buses in the caravan.
</P>
<P>
   He was starring on ``Face the Nation'' Sunday. He was
autographing his book, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' at the Bourse
building. He was welcoming his former delegates in a teary-eyed
televised farewell at the Hotel Sofitel.
</P>
<P>
   He even spoke to a warm welcome Sunday at a ``shadow''
counter-convention for college students at the University of
Pennsylvania. The audience of several hundred students, described
as laden with nose rings and tattoos, clapped and chanted his name
_ turning hostile only when McCain said Bush ``is the candidate who
offers change.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he starred in an MTV special from the Hard Rock Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   I'm amazed that he wasn't at City Hall for the assembly of the
World's Largest Hoagie.
</P>
<P>
   They could have used the bologna.
</P>
<P>
   Once, McCain called Bush a ``Pat Robertson Republican'' and said
the governor's knowledge of foreign affairs consisted of trips to
the International House of Pancakes. Now, he compliments Bush's
``inclusive'' campaign, and he had better brag on Bush for at least
several sentences tonight.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has professed no pretensions. ``The last time I looked, I
was a United States senator,'' he said aboard his
once-and-possibly-future campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   But he also joked to the ``New York Post'' that he was watching
out for a ``grenade from Texas.'' He added: ``Seriously, I believe
Governor Bush sees this in a positive light.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush saw McCain in a positive light, the senator would be
here on the ticket instead of Dick Cheney. That brings to mind last
week's McCain attempt to upstage the future nominee, when his
friends floated the rumor that he ``might'' accept the second spot
on the ticket when no such deal was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, the omnipresent McCain popped up hosting a
blue-ribbon panel discussion on foreign affairs. For a discussion
featuring six former secretaries of state, reporters walked into
the Philadelphia Convention Center press room asking anxiously,
``Where's the McCain speech?'' ``Did I miss McCain?'' ``What time
is McCain?''
</P>
<P>
   Not a single nose ring was in sight as he joked, ``Since I've
withdrawn from the campaign, my reception is getting warmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this keeps up, I'm going to demand a recount.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure whether to take McCain seriously. Or Captain
Morgan.

&HT;     CATHOLIC LEAGUE URGES GORE TO CANCEL PLAYBOY MANSION
FUND-RAISER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND   
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Catholic League on Monday urged Vice President
Al Gore to cancel a Democratic fund-raiser scheduled for next month
at the Playboy mansion in Los Angeles, saying it is ``offensive''
and ``disconcerting.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., who Gore has tapped to be vice
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has planned an
invitation-only Aug. 15 reception during the Democratic convention
for her political action committee, Hispanic Unity, at the mansion
of Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   That date coincides with the Feast of the Assumption, a Catholic
Holy Day that commemorates the taking into heaven of Mary.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hold an event on this date at a place that celebrates the
denigration of women is particularly offensive to Catholics,'' said
William A. Donohue, president of the Catholic League, the nation's
largest Catholic Civil Rights Organization. ``To top it off, since
most Hispanics are Catholic, it is sending a message that is doubly
objectionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue said Playboy writers have made ``disparaging'' remarks
about Catholics and noted that the magazine has contributed to
Catholics for Free Choice, a pro-abortion group denounced by the
bishops in 1993 and 2000. He urged Gore in an open letter released
Monday to cancel the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to do so would be to send a message to Catholics that is
disconcerting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanchez, 40, has refused to back down, insisting the
reception will continue as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Anderson, a spokeswoman for Sanchez, said it would be held
outside the grounds of the Hefner mansion in a tent. ``There will
not be playmates attending this event,'' Anderson said. ``We are
only using the mansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has objected to the venue of the event, but has stopped
short of publicly calling for Sanchez to change it.
</P>
<P>
   Hefner and his daughter, Christie Hefner, CEO of Playboy
Enterprises, have given $1,500 to Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Scully, a spokesman for the Catholic League said it
isn't enough for Gore to voice disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good enough that Gore said he isn't going, he ought
to cancel it,'' Scully said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, D-R.I., chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said the Playboy party
``sets a bad public image`` for his party.
</P>
<P>
   He told National Public Radio he will discourage his colleagues
from attending, saying the event ``totally contradicts what our
party stands for in terms of equal rights, civil rights for all
people and respecting the human dignity of every individual.''
</P>
<P>
   The Playboy Foundation, six corporations and a 40-member host
committee are underwriting the event. About 600 people are expected
to pay $5,000 each to attend and Hefner is expected to drop by.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Gov. George W. Bush, who got his current
government job by picking four issues and hammering on them ad
infinitum, will use an expanded version of the same strategy to try
to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope he has matured and grown, so it's five (issues), not
four,'' Karl Rove, Bush's long-time strategist, said Monday as the
Republican National Convention got under way.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 Texas gubernatorial race, the Big Four issues were
juvenile justice, welfare, education and tort reform. For the next
100 days, Bush will work to put the focus on education, Social
Security and Medicare, tax cuts, military overhaul and what Rove
calls ``the next step in welfare reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Stand by for overkill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At about the time that you begin to get really sick of (the
five issues), the American people will say, `You know what? Bush is
talking about five things and we ought to give him a chance to do
those things,''' said Rove.
</P>
<P>
   The path that Bush is confident will be his road to the White
House also includes help from the other side. Every Al Gore attack
is a boost, say Bush aides who believe the electorate is in the
mood for positive campaigns and will punish those who go negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will respond if attacked,'' said Rove, ``but I think the
American people after the last eight years, and for a lot of other
reasons, are at a point where they would prefer to learn more about
the candidates and their respective agendas. ... What matters this
year is less the punch that the counterpunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stayed positive in both his gubernatorial races. But he
showed a negative side this year when Sen. John McCain of Arizona
made some strong showings in the presidential primaries, including
running a radio ad accusing McCain of voting against money for
cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Rove declined to identify the cancer ad as counterpunching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Counterpunching is when a charge is leveled and the rejoinder
both answers the charge and elevates the debate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush strategy looks good on paper, according to University
of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato. But it's never been
road-tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question is to what degree will they respond to Gore's
negativity,'' he said. ``That's critical. It's hard for me to
imagine Bush would willingly play Dukakis,'' who wasn't aggressive
enough against former President Bush and lost the 1988 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will they merely counterpunch? Will they launch their own
attacks?'' he asked. ``If the answer is no, Gore has a good
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made it clear. And if not I'll make it clear even more
emphatically, we will counterpunch. We will not sit supinely by and
absorb the blows, let them distort the record and go on. We will
come back and we will come back hard. People will respond to that
better than they will the initial assault,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush strategy also will be heavy on the candidate's image as
a guy you'd like to have lunch with, a factor long cited by even
his political foes in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this myth that the Democrats want to run the campaign
on issues and we want to run it on personality,'' said Rove.
``That's half-right. ... We want to run it on personality AND
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The dual approach is calculated to score well for Bush among
three groups his team has targeted as pivotal: suburbanites,
Catholics and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides are defining suburbanites as men and women in
slightly older suburbs. They generally align as what Rove calls
``weak Republicans or unaffiliated independents.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes his five-issue campaign plays right into what's on
these voters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been working on Catholics ever since McCain and others
tried to nail him for speaking at Bob Jones University in South
Carolina, a school with anti-Catholic teachings.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic factor this year is multiplied by their
disproportionate numbers in some key states, including the
industrial Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush probably has to carry the suburban and Catholic votes
to win the White House, he merely has to make a strong showing
among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   There are relatively few Hispanics in many of the swing states,
but Hispanics will be important in California and Florida. A
California win probably would guarantee victory.
</P>
<P>
   The overall strategy is geared to a bottom line that Bush now is
just 44 electoral votes short of the 270 needed for victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of opportunities from which to get the
additional 44,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to preparing for the day-to-day campaign, Bush aides
are working toward key moments, such as the debates scheduled for
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our debate strategy can be summed up in one word: Survive,''
he said. ``We hope to survive Governor Bush's necessary appearance
in debates against the world's most pre-eminent debater, a man who
is more proficient at hand-to-hand debate combat than anybody the
world has ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   As the real battle draws near, Team Bush _ backed by polls
showing their man surging _ is convinced the candidate has the
right five issues, the right style and the right message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election is far from over,'' said Rove. ``This race is
going to be, by Labor Day, single digits one way or the other.
There are going to be points after the Democratic convention where,
in all likelihood, we are going to be behind.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rove knows there is no masking a strategist who believes he
has hit on just the right strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize if I sound overconfident,'' he said. ``I'm the
most anxiety-ridden guy you've ever met in your life.''

TWO MEETING HOUSES, BUT WHAT A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
 By BOB RAY SANDERS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It's a long way from the 1,000-seat Arch Street
Meeting House, a half block from where Betsy Ross sewed the first
Stars and Stripes in 1777, to the 22,000-seat First Union Center
across town.
</P>
<P>
   Not in distance. But in time. And purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting house was built in 1804 by the Religious Society of
Friends (or Quakers). It sits on property that Pennsylvania founder
William Penn had set aside about a hundred years earlier as a
burial ground for members.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20,000 people are interred there, many of them having
died from a series of yellow fever epidemics in the late 18th
century.
</P>
<P>
   It's hallowed ground.
</P>
<P>
   The First Union Center is home to the Philadelphia 76ers
basketball team, the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team, other
big-time sports and entertainment events and, for this week only,
the Republican National Convention. The $210 million arena has 126
private suites and 14 club boxes.
</P>
<P>
   It's something to see, but there's nothing holy about it.
</P>
<P>
   How I wish the people gathered at First Union Center could learn
something from the folks who still assemble at the nearly
200-year-old Arch Street Meeting House. After all, Republicans came
back to Philadelphia _ their very first convention was held here in
1856 _ to remember, reflect and reportedly to reaffirm some of the
ideas and principles of the Founding Fathers and mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Sudofsky, a receptionist and tour guide at the meeting
house, proudly and reverently told a curious North Texas visitor
about her meeting there last week.
</P>
<P>
   She explained that although the weekly, monthly and annual
meetings at the house are scheduled, they are not planned,
conducted or otherwise orchestrated. In fact, most of the worship
``service'' (for lack of a better word) is held in absolute
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my meeting a week ago, we started in silence,'' she said in
a tone just above a whisper. ``We were silent for almost 15 minutes
when this melifluous voice sang the first verse of ``Amazing
Grace.'' There was another 10 minutes of silence, and then six- or
seven-minute messages, all building on this idea of God's glory.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused, then continued: ``Some more silence, and then this
equally beautiful voice sang the last verse of ``Amazing Grace''
and tied it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the crowd of 100 had appointed the speakers or
singers, she told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it completely spontaneously,'' she said. ``We felt a
closeness to God, and a closeness to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole meeting was unprogrammed.''
</P>
<P>
   Unprogrammed?
</P>
<P>
   There is no way the thousands of folks meeting at First Union
Center this week could go ``unprogrammed.'' Even the ``surprises''
have been carefully planned.
</P>
<P>
   Everything has been timed, rehearsed and evaluated for its
effectiveness before a national audience. There is no room for
spontaneity. Even the thousands of red, white and blue balloons are
netted in place high above the convention floor waiting for their
precise cue to float down to the screaming crowd after Gov. George
W. Bush makes his acceptance speech as the Republican nominee for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Before I left the house, Sudofsky proudly told me about how the
Quakers had treated the Indians, and their slaves (before slavery
was banned by the group in 1776), and the part the Friends played
in the Underground Railroad to help liberate blacks. She spoke of
how they had welcomed other religious groups, even those that had
been abusive to Quakers in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were inclusive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what the Republican are trying to be here: inclusive.
The Republican National Committee even dedicated a giant mural last
weekend to the people of Philadelphia, honoring Harriet Tubman and
those brave men and women who operated the Underground Railroad. It
towers above Chestnut Street, and it is magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   It was a very nice gesture by the GOP. But, of course, it had
been programmed.

BUSH STRATEGIST OUTLINES ELECTORAL MAP &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)
 &HT;    By STEWART M. POWELL and CHARLES J. LEWIS
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio Republican George W. Bush, vowing to be a
populist president who ``stands by your side,'' headed toward the
GOP convention Monday buoyed by his campaign's calculation that he
leads in enough states to be within 44 electoral votes of winning
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cautioned enthusiastic campaign audiences across Ohio
against overconfidence, warning that his edge in state-by-state
polls across the nation could slip once Vice President Al Gore
storms out of the Democratic convention in mid-August.``I want to
remind you, the polls may look good today that's the good news,''
Bush told several thousand invited partisans gathered beneath
rain-threatening skies on the campus of the University of Dayton, a
150-year-old Roman Catholic college.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is the election isn't tomorrow. We've got a lot
of work to do and I'm looking forward to doing the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike Dewine, R-Ohio, echoed the cautionary tone. ``Make no
mistake about it this is going to be a tough race,'' Dewine warned,
urging GOP loyalists in the bellwether state of Ohio to turn out to
vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush and Dewine were urging caution, Bush's chief political
strategist, Karl Rove, told reporters at the GOP convention in
Philadelphia that state-by-state polls show Bush ahead in enough
states to put him just 44 votes shy of the 270 electoral votes
needed to capture the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said Bush has rolled up an electoral edge in state-by-state
polls that include Alaska, the swath of states from California's
Sierra Nevada mountains across the Plains to the Missouri River,
most of the South and Indiana. Rove said his calculation showed
Bush leading in polls in states with a total of 226 electoral votes
just 44 votes shy of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an embarrassment of opportunities for the Bush
campaign'' because so many states look like they could go for Bush
in November, Rove boasted to reporters in Philadelphia, site of the
GOP convention that opened Monday. He said Bush's electoral
strength in other states, including Washington state and some
Midwestern states, provides ``a lot of opportunities from which to
get the additional 44 (electoral votes) to make up for any that we
may lose'' in the West or the South.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker Eskew, a Bush campaign spokesman based at the GOP
convention, emphasized the campaign's snapshot of the
state-by-state electoral calculus could change at any time. ``We
feel those electoral votes are ours today but that's today,'' Eskew
said. ```The count could change at any time and probably will.'''
``We're 44 votes shy in this accounting but if you take Washington,
Oregon, California, Iowa and Missouri or some combination of those
states you're getting to where you need to be,'' Eskew said.
``Ideally, you want a comfortable margin of victory but 270 is the
magic number.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates seek to win the national popular vote
but under the Constitution, American presidential elections are
decided state-by-state, with each candidate's showing in a state
determining whether that candidate wins that state's electoral
votes on a winner-take-all basis. The number of electoral votes is
the total number of congressmen and senators in each state. Bush
continues to lead Gore in nationwide public opinion surveys,
including a Los Angeles Times survey released Monday that showed
likely voters favoring Bush over Gore, 51 percent to 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Green Party candidate Ralph Nader drew 4 percent. Reform Party
candidate Pat Buchanan drew 1 percent. The survey had a margin of
error of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   An electoral vote count maintained by the political newsletter
Hotline based in Washington, D.C., paints an even brighter picture
for Bush, with statewide polls in 41 states since March giving Bush
the lead in 32 states with 357 electoral votes and Gore the lead in
9 states with 131 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on the campaign trail and Rove in Philadelphia both noted
Bush's early strength in the five states in which the prospective
GOP nominee is carrying out a pre-convention barnstorming tour
toward the convention, including Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky,
Missouri and Arkansas. `
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen huge crowds,''' Bush told a rally in Dayton before
traveling to the state capitol in Columbus for an evening rush-hour
rally. ```These are states that Republicans have not done well
lately in but that's going to change come November.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a Republican has not carried any of the five states
visited by Bush in his pre-convention warm up at least since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, saying Bush was in ``reasonably good shape'' in states
such as Ohio and Missouri, said that the GOP candidate is even
leading in traditionally Democratic West Virginia. President Ronald
Reagan was the last Republican to carry the state in his
re-election landslide in 1984. Rove asserted that Bush is
positioned to become the first Republican to win the state in an
open presidential election without an incumbent on the ballot since
1928.
</P>
<P>
   ```This is not going to be an election that you could today
characterize as coming down to New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Michigan and Illinois
</P>
<P>
   the traditional battleground states,'' Rove emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said Bush hoped to cement his electoral edge by targeting
three groups of swing voters:
</P>
<P>
   Suburban men and women who are traditionally some-time
Republicans or unaffiliated independents, who live in slightly
older suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholics, who make up large blocs of voters in each of
the swing states.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics, who are present in significant numbers in a small
number of battleground states and have weak ties to the Democratic
party and are influential, depending upon turnout.

`AMERICAN HIGH' IS TRUE REALITY TV &HT;    w/optional trims
 &HT;    By MIKE McDANIEL 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    ``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother,'' it has been argued before, are
<TEXT>
not reality shows. They are game shows produced under controlled
and contrived situations.
<P>
   There's something a bit false about ``The Real World,'' too.
That show features young people (aspiring actors, most of them)
``forced'' to live the good life in luxurious digs for three
months.
</P>
<P>
   If you want reality, check out ``American High,'' debuting
Wednesday on Fox. It's the closest thing to reality TV we're going
to get, short of hooking us all up with cameras and mikes and
telecasting ourselves 24-7 _ and how deadly dull would that be?
</P>
<P>
   ``American High'' is not dull, but it can be deadly. It is also,
in turns, delightfully and horrifically real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if I was going to do this, I might as well put my
full self into it and totally reveal everything I was thinking,''
Morgan Moss said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan is one of 12 suburban Chicago high school students who
agreed to be videotaped for the 10-month project. Camera crews
followed them from class to class and also at home, and the
students also shot video themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So what viewers get is a tightly edited collection of moments
from the lives of 12 very real young people. And one of those
moments, courtesy of Morgan in Episode 2, shows Morgan's home life
from his perspective. It's not a pretty picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clean your room right now,'' his mother shouts.
</P>
<P>
   His father calls him ``an obnoxious kid'' and ``a lousy
student.''
</P>
<P>
   His little brother shoots him the finger.
</P>
<P>
   And Morgan turns the camera on himself and lashes back. His word
for his parents is an expletive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure what to do and how to get into it,'' Morgan
said. ``I started talking, and I just got into it. Once I was able
to say what was on my mind, I didn't really feel embarrassed at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's father, Alan Moss, was sheepish in his reaction to his
son's video outburst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured that this was going to be something that was going
to be very special for Morgan,'' the elder Moss said. ``We were
just going to be ourselves, and what falls out is going to fall
out.''
</P>
<P>
   But having seen what his son has shot, ``We sit there and shake
our heads. It's sort of in for a penny, in for a pound.''
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild for this nonfiction drama is Oscar-nominated
filmmaker R.J. Cutler (``The War Room'' and ``A Perfect
Candidate''). It was his idea to show what life for a group of high
school students was really like, to collect stories and somehow
make a drama series out of them. He chose Highland Park High School
outside of Chicago because ``we wanted a suburban school'' and ``I
knew people there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of (the last) school year, we invited all the
seniors interested in participating, and their families, to come to
an assembly,'' Cutler said. ``We explained what we were doing and
why.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Cutler's producers taught a course in documentary
filmmaking, which the participating students took. Ground rules
included a pledge that no one would be filmed without his or her
permission and that rough cuts would be available to participants
and their families before they were aired.
</P>
<P>
   (As a kind of payment to the school, producers ``left behind a
bunch of video equipment,'' Cutler said.)
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 students applied to be part of the project, a
number whittled down to 25, then 12. The project resulted in 2,800
hours of film, which is being edited into 13 half-hours for showing
on Fox. The first two episodes run at 8 and 8:30 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis is on real, and the students appear to have no
qualms in revealing what's inside their heads. That makes the
project illuminating and troubling at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch the show, it's kind of like, whoa, my life,''
said Sarah Mages, the only junior of the bunch. (The others are
seniors who are entering college this fall.) ``All the things we
say are obviously true because we said it, but it's like a shock to
watch your life on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not embarrassed of my feelings. I think one of the
greatest parts about the show is we're all honest with our
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah's life vividly contrasts with Morgan's. She lives a quiet,
introverted life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's one of the coolest parts of the show,'' she
said. ``I hope there are other kids going through the same kind of
issues I'm going through, who'll look at me and say, `Wow, you
know, she's OK.' Like, even though she's lonely, she lives her
life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sarah's is not completely lonely. There's a romance between her
and another teen participating in the video project, Robby Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   Robby, like Morgan, has no problem opening up in front of a
camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was because I was so (mad) at school and adults and
... people that just don't understand kids, yet are bossing us
around and telling us what to do,'' he said. ``That's why I opened
up, because I want things to change. I want them to realize that we
might be 17 or 18, but we've got a lot going on in our head _ more
so than anyone thinks, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Other participants include Brad, Robby's best friend, who is
openly gay; Mike, a football star; Anna, who's got a crush on Mike;
Allie, whose home life includes a father with a pregnant mistress;
Tiffany, an African-American at the mostly white school; Suzie, a
self-described opera diva; Salima, Brad's confidante; Pablo, a poet
with a wild party streak; and Kaytee, writer of funny love songs.
</P>
<P>
   Drug issues come up in Episode 5. The topic of sex is also
discussed. Robby, for example, talks about how Brad broke the news
to him that he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look in someone's eyes, when they've told you a
secret that's been hidden for 17 years _ it was just this total
solitude and loneliness,'' Robby said. ``When I looked in Brad's
eyes, it was the kind of look _ like feelings that were in his eyes
_ that no one should ever have to feel.''
</P>
<P>
   The students found the video experiment a rewarding experience.
What about the parents?
</P>
<P>
   In the first episodes, ``Morgan sets his credo,'' said Alan
Moss. ``I don't think we (he and wife Mary) were at all surprised
by it. I mean, you got to remember, it's 18 years of living on this
roller coaster with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The videos validated the parents' feelings about their son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could look at each other, kind of nod and say, `Yeah, I
suspected that was in there,' or `I knew that was going to come out
at some point.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, this thing was a wonderful thing for Morgan because
my contention has always been, `If we can just get this kid to
survive high school, he's going to become who he needs to be.' And
high school is something that needs to be survived.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody doesn't work the way Ozzie and Harriet used to work.
I've seen five episodes now, and I'm incredibly pleased to see how
honest he was. Some of it's disturbing, but I don't think there's
much he could do that would surprise us, in terms of doing
something totally off the edge. Because he's been pushing the
envelope since he was in day care.''

AUSTRALIA'S OLYMPIAN PURSUIT OF THE ARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 6)  
 By SUSAN GOUGH HENLY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Australia has well-deserved credentials as one of the great
sporting nations of the world, but its reputation in the arts is a
more recent phenomenon. For visitors to the Olympic Games, the
Sydney Olympic Arts Festival, with its roster of dance, music, art,
theater and film, offers an enticing bonus, a way to appreciate the
rich and diverse culture of this antipodean nation and place
Australia's artistic achievements in an international context. The
six-week-long festival actually starts a full month before the
Games commence, to set the stage and to showcase the full scope of
arts offerings.
</P>
<P>
   At daybreak on Aug. 18 on Congwong Bay in La Perouse, southeast
of the city, the dawn call of the Eora people _ the Aboriginal
tribe of the Sydney area _ begins a day of welcoming the world to
the festival. The Aboriginal opera singer and actor Deborah
Cheetham will join other female singers in arias accompanied by
local musicians playing traditional instruments. These ceremonies,
entitled ``Tubowgule'' (pronounced TIE-bah-gool), meaning ``The
Meeting of the Waters,'' continue at noon in the Royal Botanic
Gardens with traditional male dancing, body painting and story
telling, all of which pay respect to ancestral traditions.
</P>
<P>
   As dusk falls, the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House is the
setting for the climax of the welcoming ceremony, choreographed by
Stephen Page, artistic director of Australia's leading indigenous
performing arts group, the Bangarra Dance Theatre. Dancers and
children will be accompanied by Marc Newson's dramatic lighting of
the opera house in aqueous patterns.
</P>
<P>
   This is one episode of his four-part ``subliminal lighting''
installation, ``Energy of Australia,'' which will transform the
Opera House every night during the Festival. In this first
installation, the desired effect is that the 21st century will seem
to disappear into the earliest times of Australia's first
inhabitants. All three of the ``Tubowgule'' events are free.
</P>
<P>
   This sense of drama and spectacle permeates the festival,
according to Leo Schofield, the festival's director. ``I felt that
it was important to mount events of scale since the Olympic Games
are the most important international festival of all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the first musical event, on Aug. 19, is Mahler's Symphony
No. 8, the Symphony of a Thousand, at the SuperDome in the heart of
the Olympic Park. ``I see this symphony as the invocation of the
creative spirit and, as such, I hope it will be a cultural
highlight,'' Schofield said.
</P>
<P>
   Edo de Waart conducts the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, which will
be joined by an international roster of soloists, including
Alessandra Marc, Elizabeth Connell, Jane Henschel, Vinson Cole and
massed choirs from Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Britain. ``It is
a little quirky, too, staging a classical symphony in a sports
stadium, but it is important to make the link between sport and art
and to emphasize that the arts festival is part of the action, not
elitist and separate,'' Schofield added.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic arts festivals were enshrined in the modern Olympic
Games ethos by Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who revived the Games in
the late 19th century. ``Olympism,'' Coubertin said, ``is the
concept of strong physical culture, based in one part upon the
spirit of chivalry and, for the other, upon aesthetic
sensitivity.'' Thus in both the ancient and early modern Olympic
Games a country might win gold not only for discus throwing but
also for poetry.
</P>
<P>
   While this sentiment appears a little naive in our high-stakes
sports world and while it would be politically imprudent to find
judges for artistic events today, Sydney's full-scale Olympic Arts
Festival is a salute to the baron's aims. On the eve of the opening
ceremony of the competition, Sept. 14, the festival and the games
will be united in the Olympic Torch Galas at the Sydney Opera
House. The ballet superstar Sylvie Guillem will appear with stars
of Opera Australia and the Australian Ballet at the Opera Theater,
while the tenor Andrea Bocelli will perform at the Concert Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic torch will arrive at the opera house en route to the
Olympic Stadium, and as the torchbearer runs up the steps, the
opera house itself will appear to burst into flames in another of
Newson's installations.
</P>
<P>
   So what are the festival's themes? ``I wanted to emphasize the
celebratory nature of this international event,'' Schofield said.
``And considering the fact that many visitors are not English
speaking, I placed a strong focus on dance and music. There is also
a highlight on youth at the dawning of a new century.''
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the performing and visual arts events are
Australian, with some remarkable indigenous Australian work. These
are benchmarked against a diverse array of international talent.
Here are some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   There is an embarrassment of riches in the dance offerings, from
Pina Bausch and her Tanztheater Wuppertal's ``Masurca Fogo,'' from
Aug. 30 to Sept. 3 at the Capitol Theater, to Graeme Murphy's epic
``Mythologia,'' performed by the Sydney Dance Company and the
60-member Sydney Gay and Lesbian Choir from Aug. 19 to 26, also at
the Capitol. Lin Hwai-Min's Cloud Gate Dance Theater performs
``Nine Songs'' (which begins with the image of a magical

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Swinging onstage at Broadway's New Amsterdam Theater,
Christopher Jackson belts out his opening number in the musical
``The Lion King'' while suspended by a rope 25 feet above the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   As Simba, a role for which he is the understudy and will take
over permanently this month, he must convincingly move with the
strength and grace of the lion he portrays.
</P>
<P>
   Down the block at the Martin Beck Theater, Michael Berresse woos
his leading lady in the revival of ``Kiss Me, Kate'' by lithely
scaling a three-story balcony like a kid on a jungle gym.
</P>
<P>
   These days the Broadway musical's modern choreography is far
more rigorous and physical than the song and dance era of Ethel
Merman or Carol Channing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more athletic and aerobic,'' said Kathleen Marshall,
the choreographer. ``You have the phenomenon of people going to the
gym, developing stronger, leaner silhouettes and more muscular
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   More strength means more opportunities for choreographers to
create challenging routines that highlight a performer's skills.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing Berresse's background as a gymnast and diver, Marshall
crafted the climbing sequence in ``Kiss Me, Kate'' with him in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been very physical and I've developed athletes'
habits,'' Berresse said. ``In truth, Broadway dancers are
professional athletes and they are finally being recognized as
such.''
</P>
<P>
   Choreography may be faster and more hard-hitting because the
world itself is moving faster than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as records keep getting broken in sports and athletes run
faster and jump higher than they did 30 years ago,'' Marshall said,
``dancers are able to do more, bringing a new level of athleticism
to their work.'' A 1996 Olympic gymnast, Aliane Baquerot, made her
Broadway debut this year as Linda Manero in ``Saturday Night
Fever'' and says a disciplined sports background is a help in this
almost nonstop dance show. ``You find a lot more acrobatics today
instead of just traditional musical theater-type dance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Kladitis, a producer who has been involved with the
theater since 1965 and is producing ``Saturday Night Fever,''
traces the trend toward more physical theater to the resurgence of
dance itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance and exercise bring on this rush that gets the audience
going, the kind of physical and sexual energy you might get when
you're exercising yourself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such brawny Broadway performances are not limited to dance,
however, as evidenced by the strenuous climbing and mock fighting
in the rock opera revival of ``Jesus Christ Superstar.'' Trained as
a dancer with the Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble, Lana Gordon,
portraying dual roles as a Disciple and Herod's Girl, tackles her
first nondance role with as much vigor as anything she has done en
pointe. ``People want to see action,'' she said, describing a scene
in which she hoists herself up a steep scaffold in one of the big
numbers. ``They don't want to see you just standing around.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for the new demands requires more than the traditional
voice and dance lessons and while most troupers get an ample
aerobic workout eight times each week, strength training,
stretching, yoga and even meditation play crucial roles. As a
former fitness trainer, Jackson knows his way around a gym and
trains a minimum of five times a week. ``It's a matter of survival
to stay in tip-top shape,'' he said, recalling a knee injury that
set him back three months. ``I train like an athlete because I
perform like one.''
</P>
<P>
   As Tommy Djilas in ``The Music Man,'' Clyde Alves, recipient of
this year's Fred Astaire Award for Outstanding Dance on Broadway,
reaches into his own sports history as a wrestler and gymnast and
soccer and hockey player to leap through his performance, capped by
a particularly memorable spread-eagle jump over a young cast
member. ``It takes more discipline to warm up and keep in shape
than before,'' said Alves, whose warm-up includes push-ups, sit-ups
and meditation.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon finds yoga offers a good balance between mind and body,
not to mention a tremendous vocal warm-up. She takes a class every
day. Pilates, the discipline of controlled stretching and toning
exercises beloved by dancers, keeps a large proportion of
performers limber and strong for the rigors of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The line between performance and pumping iron continues to blur
with the proliferation of Broadway-based aerobic classes cropping
up in gyms across the country. Cast members from ``Chicago,''
``Swing,'' ``Contact'' and ``Saturday Night Fever'' have all taught
health club patrons choreography from the shows in Broadway dance
series at fitness clubs.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares to take over the lead in ``The Lion King,''
Jackson figures he'll need to put on 5 to 10 pounds over the next
two months because of the show's intensity. ``It's not unusual for
me to drop a couple of pounds in just one show,'' he said.

TALE THAT INSPIRED AND SANK HERMAN MELVILLE UNDERGOING REVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1840s, as a whaling seaman not yet embarked on his
prodigious literary career, Herman Melville read Owen Chase's
``Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of
the Whale-Ship Essex.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he wrote in his own copy of the ``Narrative'': ``The
reading of this wondrous story upon the landless sea, &AMP; close to
the very latitude of the shipwreck had a surprising effect on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprising effect was to give Melville the inspiration for
the ending of ``Moby-Dick,'' the sinking, or ``the stoving,'' of
the Pequod by the white whale. In the fictionalized version there
is only one survivor, Ishmael. In the case of the Essex the 20-man
crew lived through the attack, but in the long, disastrous voyage
that followed, 12 of them died, some cannibalized by their
shipmates.
</P>
<P>
   The sinking of the Essex and the aftermath are brought
viscerally to life in Nathaniel Philbrick's ``In the Heart of the
Sea,'' which begins where ``Moby-Dick'' ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Essex was absolutely crucial to Melville's conception of
the novel,'' Philbrick said during a recent visit to New York from
his home in Nantucket, Mass. ``A book that we think of as such a
discursive wandering into the imagination has a ballast of real
fact that was very important to Melville. This could happen. This
did happen. That's what my book is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every year there are new books dealing with aspects of
Melville, and adaptations of his work on stage, in films or on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melville is in the air,'' said Philbrick, who has hit the
crest of that wave. His book is both a critical success and an
international best seller. For a time it was first on best-seller
lists in London and Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the increasing interest in Melville, Hershel Parker,
who is completing the second volume of his monumental biography of
the author, attributed it partly to ``a general desire to be
stirred, moved, exalted, ennobled by what we read,'' in particular
by Melville's mythic voyages. ``The boom is not over by any
means,'' he said. ``Only in recent years has Melville entered the
national consciousness beyond `Moby-Dick.'''
</P>
<P>
   Led by books like ``In the Heart of the Sea,'' he added, ``We
are ready to look at Melville as a participant in one of the great
American adventures: the whaling industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``In the Heart of the Sea,'' Elizabeth Hardwick's
``Herman Melville,'' an intense psychosexual analysis of the
author's art in the Penguin series of brief lives of famous people,
and Tim Severin's personalized expedition, ``In Search of Moby
Dick: The Quest for the White Whale,'' have recently been
published.
</P>
<P>
   Rinde Eckert's ``And God Created Great Whales,'' a bold
experimental musical starring Eckert as a composer attempting to
write an operatic version of ``Moby-Dick,'' had a brief run at
Dance Theater Workshop in June and is scheduled to re-open next
month off-Broadway. For the show Eckert has written _ and sings _
several songs that have the power of the novel.
</P>
<P>
   In the works is ``Melville's World,'' a book by Andrew Delbanco
that will be an ``effort to see the world Melville lived in through
his eyes'' and his ``incredibly penetrating intelligence.''
Delbanco, an author and critic who has been teaching Melville for
more than 20 years, plans to deal in the book with the novelist's
``response to the Civil War, industrialization, human sexuality and
changes in race and religion in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The fascination with Melville begins, of course, with
``Moby-Dick.'' In 1850 Melville moved from Manhattan to Pittsfield,
Mass., where he bought a farm he named Arrowhead. Two important
things happened while he was there. He met Nathaniel Hawthorne, who
became his friend and mentor, and, looking out the window of his
study toward the whalelike Mount Greylock, he completed
``Moby-Dick'' and dedicated it to Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   When his masterwork was published in 1851, Melville was only 32
and already the author of five novels, beginning with ``Typee'' and
``Omoo,'' popular adventure stories based on his life at sea.
Readers apparently had hoped for another ``Typee'' and were not
prepared for a daring metaphorical exploration of a man's obsession
with good and evil and his monomaniacal act of vengeance. The book
was unappreciated and sold few copies, in contrast to Hawthorne's
``Scarlet Letter,'' which was published the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Melville immediately followed ``Moby-Dick'' with the obdurate
``Pierre: or the Ambiguities'' and became increasingly bitter at
his lack of success. He also felt abandoned when Hawthorne moved
from the Berkshires to Concord, Mass. During the last two decades
of his life, Melville worked as a clerk in the Customs House in
Manhattan and gave up writing fiction, more or less becoming a
real-life counterpart to the passive clerk he wrote about in
``Bartleby the Scrivener.''
</P>
<P>
   During this time he was writing his epic poem, ``Clarel.''
</P>
<P>
   Long after the author's death, ``Moby-Dick'' was rediscovered
and became the foundation of his career and of American literature
itself. Acknowledging the book's neglect in the author's lifetime,
the English critic James Wood said: ``Melville wrote the novel that
is every writer's dream of freedom. It is as if he painted a patch
of blue sky for the imprisoned.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbrick, a former sailing journalist who has written several
books about Nantucket and is himself an expert on Melville, calls
``Moby-Dick'' ``the most profound book about America, whaling _ and
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He got the idea for ``In the Heart of the Sea,'' he said, while
cruising with his wife and children on a ship off the coast of
Maine. It was the summer of 1997 _ of ``The Perfect Storm'' and
``Into the Air'' and the movie ``Titanic.'' These were, he said,
``survival stories, and the ultimate survival story'' was the
Essex. ``It's a piece of American history,'' he said. ``Before the
Donner Party, there was the Essex disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His father, Thomas Philbrick, a professor of English, had told
the story of the Essex to him and his brother when they were
children, and diverse books had been written about it. Philbrick
was just finishing a book about the ``Native American legacy on
Nantucket,'' he said, and the epilogue referred to the Essex,
``tying it in with Melville's myth-making.''
</P>
<P>
   He wondered if the story could be approached in a new way,
profiting from contemporary information about areas like
oceanography and starvation. He gathered books and other documents
into what he described as his war room. While writing the book he
took a leave from his position as director of the Egan Institute of
Maritime Studies on Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing upon Chase's ``Narrative'' and Thomas Nickerson's
``Desultory Sketches,'' a first-person account by the cabin boy on
the Essex, he weighed one report against the other. It was from
Nickerson's monograph that he learned that Chase, the first mate,
had an opportunity to lance the whale after its first attack but
decided not to take the chance. The two narratives and other
first-person accounts were recently published in a book, ``The Loss
of the Ship Essex, Sunk by a Whale,'' edited by Philbrick and his
father.
</P>
<P>
   The tragic paradox of the Essex was that the captain, George
Pollard, recommended they head for Tahiti instead of remaining at
sea, but the crew was fearful of encountering cannibals and
overruled him. As Melville wrote in his annotations in his copy of
Chase's ``Narrative'': ``All the sufferings of these miserable men
of the Essex might, in all human probability, have been avoided had
they immediately after leaving the wreck, steered straight for
Tahiti, from which they were not very distant at the time. But they
dreaded cannibals.''
</P>
<P>
   Melville knew that missionaries had been on the island and that
it was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Heart of the Sea,'' published by Viking, is also about
Nantucket, the port from which the Essex and the Pequod sailed. At
the time, the early 1800s, the island's economy centered on
whaling. Young men signed on for periods of two or three years.
After several trips they could afford to retire. There was,
Philbrick said, a ``brotherhood of workers'' on whaling ships. At
the same time, in his book, he contemplates the fact that none of
the African-American seamen survived the Essex disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Although Melville had not been on Nantucket before he wrote
``Moby-Dick,'' he was able to give a knowledgeable history of the
island and he also borrowed many local names for his characters. In
his first visit, after the novel was published, he met Capt.
Pollard, who was then working as a night watchman. He was, Melville
wrote, ``the most impressive man, tho' wholly unassuming, even
humble _ that I ever encountered.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollard, Philbrick learned, was a ``short, fat, jolly man who
loved the good things in life but fasted every Nov. 20 in memory of
the Essex survivors.'' He believes that in many ways Pollard, in
his adjustment to the tragedy, was like Ishmael, and that Chase was
like Ahab, haunted forever by his experiences at sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Melville identified very strongly with Pollard,''
Philbrick said. In a sense both their careers were ``sunk by a
whale.'' He said that while writing his book he was keenly aware of
Melville's looking over his shoulder. ``I'd see him walking the
streets of Nantucket at night, waving at me,'' he joked,
</P>
<P>
   As for the title, he said he had looked up the word sea in a
biblical concordance and found ``in the heart of the sea'' in
Exodus. Explaining his interest, he said that he regarded the sea
as ``a frontier that was never civilized.'' He continued: ``You go
to the west and there are cities and railroads. You go to the sea
and we can pollute it all we want but it's still out there. It's as
close to an eternal frontier as we're going to get. There's nothing
better than the sea in ridding you of the illusion of mastery,'' as
man is forced to battle elemental forces beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I got into the Essex disaster,'' he said, ``the more
it seemed that in `Moby-Dick' there is a deep secret, a darkness
lurking. I really feel that's informed by the survival and the
suffering of the men of the Essex.'' He added, ``I remain impressed
with the dignity, stoicism and discipline of the Essex crew''
throughout their ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   In tribute to Melville he ends his book by recalling a scene
from ``Moby-Dick'' in which Ishmael sees a reconstructed skeleton
of a whale and realizes how ``vain and foolish'' it is to try to
comprehend such a creature by studying its remains. Melville
concludes, ``Only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully
invested whale be truly and livingly found out.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbrick suggests that after ``all hope, passion and force of
will have been expended, the bones may be all that are left'' _
except, of course, for books like ``Moby-Dick'' and ``In the Heart
of the Sea.''

ISRAELI POLITICAL SCENE HEATS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The worst heat wave in the history of the country
was nothing compared to the rising political temperature in
Israel's parliament Monday.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the stunning upset in the vote for president,
in which Iranian-born Moshe Katsav, a little known Likud lawmaker,
triumphed over Nobel Prize laureate and former Labor prime minister
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the mercury climbed to around 107 degrees outside,
conservative and religious parties in the air-conditioned halls of
the Knesset tried to ride the momentum from Katsav's victory and
drive Prime Minister Ehud Barak from office.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, Barak survived the ``no confidence'' vote, which
would have forced early elections.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, he bought time to build support for his efforts to
reach a comprehensive peace agreement that would end 52 years of
conflict with the Palestinians. But the vote for Katsav sent a
clear message that the going would be tough.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, with weather forecasters promising some
relief in sight, Israel watched the sun go down on the political
career of Peres.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the Labor party's icons, Peres, 76, was handpicked
to lead by Israel's founding father David Ben Gurion and was an
architect of the historic 1994 Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement
in Oslo, Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had put his support behind Peres for president, hoping he
would help him shore up national courage to clinch a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   The vote for president became a referendum on Barak's peace
moves with the Palestinians at Camp David, and Katsav's victory
made it glaringly apparent that Barak must now now face an all-out
campaign by the conservative and religious parties who feel he
compromised too much by offering to share sovereignty in Jerusalem,
and by ceding too much land in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   As Likud leader and legendary hawk Ariel Sharon told Israel
Radio just moments after Katsav's election to the largely
ceremonial post, ``This is a very important victory, a sign that
the people of Israel do not want the policy of Barak.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor and peace camp leaders, however, saw the vote _ Katsav won
by a margin of 63-57 in the 120-member Knesset _ as a betrayal of
what they say is a majority of Israeli citizens who want peace.
</P>
<P>
   At the Yakovi Brothers Appliances store on Emek Refaim Street,
one of Jerusalem's more upscale shopping boulevards, fans and air
conditioners were selling as fast as the owner, Samson Yakovi, 50,
could get deliveries from a warehouse. People were lined up 10 deep
at his store, buying anything that could proximate a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Yakovi was a bit distracted watching the voting in the Knesset
on a television set up outside his store. He was the only one
watching since just about everyone else in Israel believed Peres
was a sure bet to win. But then Yakovi let out a cheer that broke
the languid atmosphere of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend! Yes! Goodbye Peres!'' Yakovi yelled at the
television.
</P>
<P>
   His reaction to Katsav's victory says a lot about Israel today.
</P>
<P>
   Katsav, like Yakovi, is part of the ``second Israel,'' the wave
of Jewish immigrants from Arab and Islamic countries who arrived in
the early years of the state and formed a struggling underclass
that felt abandoned by the likes of Peres and his Labor party. This
voting bloc has become the backbone of the Likud. Katsav, 55, was
born in Iran and hails from humble roots. His family was assigned
to live in the ramshackle ``transit camps'' set up for new
immigrants after the 1948 war. He came of age in Kiryat Malachi,
one of Israel's development towns, where immigrants have struggled
with unemployment and government neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Yakovi, who was born just two weeks after his parents came to
Israel from Iran in 1950, also lived in a transit camp, which he
says has a lot to do with why he has loved Katsav since the young
mayor of Kiryat Malachi was elected to parliament in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, maybe there is a new job for Peres,'' said Yakovi,
unable to contain his laughter watching the voting results on
television and working the cash register at the same time. ``Maybe
he could become the president for the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Batia Labovich, 26, waiting to drop off a fan that needed
repair, couldn't contain herself and shot back at Yakovi, ``This
vote doesn't have anything to do with what people want in this
country. People want peace. Peres is educated, he is respected. And
now we have Katsav. No one knows who Katsav is, and no one cares.''
</P>
<P>
   Labovich, who is a math teacher and a member of the group Peace
Now, is far more reflective of the population that lives within the
wealthy enclave that straddle the shops and cafes of Emek Refaim.
The verbal clash between the store owner and the peace activist
with a broken fan says everything about the heated battle that is
just beginning in Israel, a country facing a fateful crossroads in
a long journey toward peace.

MONDAY'S SPEAKERS AT THE GOP CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the speakers on Monday evening's program:
</P>
<P>
   Condoleezza Rice
</P>
<P>
   Bush foreign policy adviser
</P>
<P>
   Condoleezza Rice is quarterback of Gov. George W. Bush's foreign
policy team, whose members have named themselves the ``Vulcans.'' A
statue of Vulcan, the god of metalworking in Roman mythology,
overlooks Rice's hometown of Birmingham, Ala. Of the foreign policy
team, Rice is the closest to Bush. He has said that he feels
comfortable asking her the most basic questions. An only child
raised in segregated Birmingham, Rice, 45, joined the faculty of
Stanford University in 1981, before becoming its youngest, first
female and first nonwhite provost.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole
</P>
<P>
   Former president of the American Red Cross
</P>
<P>
   A thirst for politics and a knack for leadership have made
Elizabeth Dole probably the most recognizable woman in the
Republican Party. Her appearance at the 1996 convention when she
introduced her husband, Bob Dole, was widely praised. She placed
second to Gov. George W. Bush in many national polls before
dropping out of the presidential race last year, and there had been
speculation that Bush had considered her as a vice presidential
contender. A native of Salisbury, N.C., she graduated from Duke
University with a degree in political science in 1958 and received
a law degree from Harvard in 1965. After marrying Sen. Bob Dole, a
Republican from Kansas in 1975, she worked for two Republican
presidents. In 1995, she left her job as president of the American
Red Cross to be at her husband's side during his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain
</P>
<P>
   Republican senator from Arizona
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is one of the Senate's most respected members.
Starting as a marginal candidate for president in 1999, McCain
emerged as a threat to Gov. George W. Bush in the primaries,
attracting independents and Democrats. Before dropping out in
March, he won primaries in New Hampshire and Michigan. McCain, 63,
was born in the Panama Canal Zone, the son of a naval officer. He
graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958 and was a pilot
during the Vietnam War. In 1967, his plane was shot down over North
Vietnam and he spent five and a half years as a prisoner of war.
After retiring from the Navy, McCain moved to Arizona, and was
elected to Congress in 1982. He won the first of his three terms in
the Senate in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Funderburk Ware
</P>
<P>
   Family Advocate
</P>
<P>
   Having raised a daughter on her own, Patricia Funderburk Ware
knows the difficulties and hardships of being a single parent.
Living in Raleigh, N.C., she saw lifestyles that led to teen-age
pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases _ issues,
she has said, that are particularly epidemic in black communities.
These concerns are the focus of her work as president of the
Preserving Family Well-Being Foundation, an organization that
addresses the problems facing black families.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Roosevelt 4th
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Activist
</P>
<P>
   The great-grandson of the 26th president, is an investment
banker and an environmental activist. Roosevelt, a managing
director at Lehman Bros. and resident of Brooklyn, was appointed by
Gov. George Pataki of New York to be a board member of the Hudson
River Trust in March 1999. The trust is responsible for designing,
building and operating the Hudson River Park to stretch along the
waterfront of the West Side of Manhattan from Battery Park City to
59th Street.

 &HT;    Female athletes get Esquire triple-coverage
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The August issue of Esquire ($3) celebrates strength and beauty
with three different covers and a 12-page portfolio of women
athletes who hope to win medals in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Featured on the covers are pentathlete Mary Beth Larsen, high
jumper Amy Acuff and triathlete Lokelani McMichael, who became the
youngest woman to compete in the Ironman at 18.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the photos are ``Dreams,'' the last unpublished short
story by Raymond Carver, and an interesting piece on Harvard Law
School grads who are leaving the profession in droves. One of the
four profiled is Chris Crain, who left a prestigious Atlanta law
firm to become co-owner of Southern Voice, the city's gay
newspaper. He has since bought gay newspapers in New Orleans and
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Crain says his parents do not accept his homosexuality and
cannot understand why he would waste a Harvard law degree. He still
wears his ring, however, at times when he feels challenged. ``Not
so anyone can see me,'' he says, ``but in my office with the door
closed. I look at it, and it makes me feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Simple solutions: After changing editors and taking a bashing
in the media, Real Simple ($2.95) continues on its mission to make
our lives less stressful. The August issue profiles three women who
have ``achieved balance'' in a busy world, including Leslie
Marshall, a writer who re-connected with nature on Georgia's
Cumberland Island after her 5-year-old daughter's brush with death
and the loss of her friend, John F. Kennedy Jr. Other articles
include guides to preserving your vacation snapshots, watching the
political conventions, and organizing your lingerie drawer. All
equally exciting.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Queen's court: Anna Kournikova is everywhere, it seems, except
in the winner's circle after a tennis tournament. The teenage star
has never won an official tour event, but here she is posing
seductively on the cover of GQ ($3). The accompanying article by
Adam Sachs is about as skimpy as Kournikova's outfits, revealing
nothing about her private life and very little about her
professional life. So what if she has a weak backhand? She
collected $15 million in endorsements last year. More substantial
reading can be found in Bob Drury's story of Jack ``The Turk''
Hasson, a Palm Beach jeweler who swindled Jack Nicklaus, Greg
Norman and other celebrities out of $80 million with fake
gemstones.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Making the list: If you want to know who's hot and who's not
(at least for this month), check out the September issue of Vibe
($3) for the 100 most influential people, places and things in
urban culture. Others in addition to cover subjects Dr. Dre and
Eminem include Tiger Woods, Oprah Winfrey, Russell Simmons,
Donatella Versace, VH1 Behind the Music and Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Makeover: New editor-in-chief Mandi Norwood makes her debut
with a revamped August issue of Mademoiselle ($2.99). Norwood says
the 65-year-old magazine has a new look and a new target audience _
``women in their twenties, on the hunt for fun and success, with
the time and money to spend on themselves.'' Planet Mademoiselle,
for example, is a section designed to spot trends such as make-out
parties for twentysomethings in Dallas, where young women pucker up
with complete strangers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Weeklies' watch: First, the trio from the $3.50 club: With the
Republican National Convention under way, both Time and Newsweek
devote covers to most things Bush. Time's ``convention special''
takes a look ``Inside the Bush Dynasty'' including George W.,
brother Jeb and patriarch George. Newsweek tags W. and running mate
Dick Cheney as ``The Avengers'' in its special. The Concorde crash
gets second billing in both. U.S. News &AMP; World Report takes a
different spin: How the 1948 convention _ or TV coverage of that
other Philly gathering _ ``changed politics forever.'' ... For
$2.99 each, you can learn why Harrison Ford is ``At Home on the
Range'' in a soft, summer issue of People while in Entertainment
Weekly, the cult phenom Phish gets a 10-page spread. EW also
borrows from TV Guide's marketing department by offering four
different covers showcasing band members. ... And finally in Sports
Illustrated ($3.99), a special double issue showcases a ``Where Are
They Now?'' update. On the cover: former Chicago Bear William
``Refrigerator'' Perry, who's now a ``brick-layin,' bass-hookin'
picture of contentment'' in Aiken, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pound for pound: Shape ($2.99) expands to a special double
issue in a bid to help readers fight the battle of the bulge.
Included: ``The Anti-Cellulite Workout,'' which concludes a mix of
cardio, resistance and flexibility training will help. Also this
month: Christy Turlington's tips on yoga beauty. ... YM (Young &AMP;
Modern, $2.99) also takes on pounds with a story on, ``Is Stress
Making You Fat?'' Also in this issue: ``Eating Right'' looks at
healthy eating, including poor picks and better bets at the school
cafeteria.

LOGGERS SIGN PACT WITH AFRICA'S GABON TO PROTECT TROPICAL FOREST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Map is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Nonsubscribers
can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036 or
888-346-9867.) By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ending a conflict over the fate of a forest rich in both wood
and wildlife, loggers, biologists and the government of Gabon have
agreed to keep bulldozers and chain saws out of a 1,900-square-mile
reserve with the highest density of large mammals ever recorded in
a tropical rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes a slight redrawing of the boundaries of
Gabon's Lope Reserve, subtracting 400 square miles of land on the
southeastern flank that holds the richest stands of valuable okoume
trees, and adding about 200 square miles of previously unprotected
terrain that includes remote upland forests that have only rarely,
if ever, felt the footfall of man.
</P>
<P>
   Several biologists working in the region say the net loss of
land is worth it. The area opened to logging had been farmed less
than 200 years ago and so is relatively recent growth. In contrast,
they say, the newly protected area, which was to have been cut by
Malaysian and French companies, is a priceless reservoir of
biological riches that is thought to have been essentially
undisturbed for the last 10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   More important, they say, the agreement _ signed last month by
the country's major logging companies, the government, and a
variety of private environmental groups _ finally brings meaning to
the word reserve, with the government and loggers committing for
the first time never to violate the new boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Lope Reserve has also been designated as the first candidate
for national park status in Gabon, a country that prospered through
oil in the past, but has been in economic decline recently and has
seen timber as the source of future wealth. Gabon straddles the
Equator and rises from Africa's west coast in a river-laced
patchwork of savannah, deep forest and mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Lee J.T. White, a zoologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society
in New York, who has studied Gabonese chimpanzees and rainbow-faced
mandrills, said the deal was a major boon for African wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   For years, he documented how logging was driving adjacent
chimpanzee groups into warfare. All around Central Africa, he said,
logging roads have provided quick access for hunters supplying the
exploding urban market for bush meat, killing everything from
snakes to gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   This practice results in what biologists are calling ``empty
forest syndrome,'' White said, in which snares and guns remove
almost every living thing, leaving a green but silent landscape
that appears intact but is in fact a zoological desert.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at least for the forests of Lope, he said, that threat is
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really want to set the precedent that every time a
logger says he wants to log in a reserve you're going to redesign
it willy-nilly,'' White said. ``But we've gone from a situation
where about two-thirds of the reserve was actually in logging
concessions to the point where we've lost some land but the whole
reserve is protected from logging forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is thrilled with the deal. Several environmental
groups in Europe remain opposed to logging in the region, saying
the logging companies, all based in Europe or Asia, have too much
economic power and the governments are too quick to cave in. They
say the larger international environmental groups that negotiated
the agreement, including the World Wildlife Fund, are far too
trusting.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Counsell, director of the British arm of the Rainforest
Foundation, said the net loss of preserve land still had the feel
of a giveaway, when the right thing to do would have been for the
government simply to enforce its laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that the new area is better,'' Counsell said. ``But
one can't help but suspect that it's more an indication of the
influence and power of some of the large logging companies in
Gabon. In some stage further down the line, who's to say that they
couldn't redraw the boundaries again?''
</P>
<P>
   Gabonese officials say the commitment is real.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Richard Onouviet, the minister of land
and water, described how representatives from differing camps,
including the World Wildlife Fund and Leroy Gabon, a French-owned
logging company, remained cloistered in negotiations for two long
meetings to find a suitable compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're preserving the ecological interests but permitting the
rational development of the country's forests,'' Onouviet said.
``The companies working here understand this is the policy of the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Biologists said the Gabonese shift to considering the ecological
consequences of forestry had come just in time to save the most
important parts of Lope, which were scheduled for clearing.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, logging companies, including Leroy Gabon, a
subsidiary of Isoroy, a large French forestry company, had invested
heavily in mills in Gabon needed to keep a supply of logs flowing.
They had logging rights to okoume stands near the reserve, and
after cutting those were pressing the government for the right to
log within the reserve. Okoume is prized in Europe and Asia because
it has a red grain and water resistance similar to redwood.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists had long criticized the government for
granting logging rights within the reserve. Starting around 1997,
some of the more radical European environmental groups began an
intensive public relations campaign attacking the big forestry
companies for imperiling a supposedly protected forest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the World Bank and other international lending
organizations were putting pressure on Gabon to improve its
environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   All this culminated in meetings in Gabon over the last few
months in which representatives of Isoroy and other companies said
they would agree to give up the rights within the reserve if they
received other logging rights in return _ and also if they were at
least allowed to cut the rich okoume stands in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists, including White, said this would be acceptable if
the highland forests were added to the reserve. For the logging
companies, the highlands present significant logistical challenges,
requiring expensive road construction and costly harvesting
methods.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson in all this, White says, is that when forests are
carefully studied, the priorities of biologists and loggers do not
always clash.
</P>
<P>
   White said the lands and water minister, Onouviet, had approved
a national forest inventory aimed at identifying other spots to
protect and eventually turning them into a network of national
parks.
</P>
<P>
   None of this guarantees success, White said, adding that for the
moment Gabon's wildlife agency had only 13 staff members for a
country the size of Colorado.

MARKET RIDES TECHNOLOGY WAVE UP 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices moved higher Monday, led by bellwether
technology issues, which took a beating for most of last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology and telecommunications market was oversold,''
said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose 103.99 points, or 2.8 percent,
to 3,766.99, with Intel, Cisco Systems and Oracle increasing. The
gain, the first in four sessions, reversed a bit of last week's 11
percent slide in the Nasdaq index. For the month, the Nasdaq fell 5
percent. So far this year, it is down 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, strong performances from financial stocks like
Citigroup pulled the Dow Jones industrial average up by 10.81
points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,521.98. Consumer stocks like Wal-Mart
and Procter &AMP; Gamble fell, limiting the rise in the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 10.94 points, or
0.8 percent, to 1,430.83.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gains, analysts and traders said major market
averages were likely to remain with a small range for most of this
week, and possibly the balance of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they said that economic reports due out Friday,
especially employment data for July, would be key determinants of
how stocks performed between now and Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything up to Friday is pretty much noise,'' said Bob
Gasser, head of U.S. equity trading at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Friday is critical. That data released then has the
ability to swing consensus about what the Federal Reserve Board
will do at the end of the month in one direction, or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Fed policymakers are scheduled to meet on Aug. 22 to determine

   Among individual stocks, Cisco Systems, which fell nearly 8
percent last week, gained 2 5/8 Monday, to 65 7/16. Intel, which
saw its market value decline by 6.6 percent last week, rose 2 3/16,
to 66 3/4. The price reflects a 2-for-1 stock split that was
effective Monday.

FIRING OF GENERALS MAY INDICATE MILITARY SHAKEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Vladimir V. Putin fired six generals Monday
in a move some said tightened his grip on Russia's military and
indicated that a wider shakeup could be coming.
</P>
<P>
   The generals were fired amid a bitter public feud between
Russia's top two military commanders, Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Anatoly Kvashnin.
</P>
<P>
   Media reports suggested that the dismissals signaled Putin was
considering removing Sergeyev from office as well. But military
analysts, noting that the generals were far removed from the top
command, called the sackings routine. Putin, they said, simply
wanted to appoint his own people to their posts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several weeks, Sergeyev and Kvashnin have argued
publicly over the role of Russia's nuclear forces in the nation's
defense strategy. Kvashnin has suggested that nuclear weapons be
downgraded in favor of developing the country's conventional arms.
Sergeyev, a veteran of Russia's nuclear rocket forces, called
Kvashnin's idea ``insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts have said the dispute is likely to end in the
ouster of one or the other of Russia's top two commanders. Putin
ordered the two men to jointly submit a reorganization plan for the
military, and the dispute appeared to settle down.
</P>
<P>
   But some media took the firings as a sign that Sergeyev may be
on the way out. Tuesday's edition of the newspaper Izvestia
speculated that Kvashnin was the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commander-in-chief has chosen Anatoly Kvashnin,'' Reuters
quoted an early edition of the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the defense minister must either demand from the Kremlin
an explanation of the mass dismissals of his subordinates, or
accept the challenge hurled at him and prepare for a quick
resignation,'' the paper wrote. ``The next few days will show
whether Vladimir Putin will hand over the Defense Ministry to his
favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pavel Felgenhauer, a Moscow-based defense analyst, said that
while tensions in the military certainly were high over the
Sergeyev-Kvashnin battle, the firings were less important than
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are second- and third-tier generals. They are not
strategic decision makers,'' Felgenhauer said. ``These firings are
not very consequential in the battle between Kvashnin and
Sergeyev.''
</P>
<P>
   News agencies here reported that all six generals served under
Sergeyev in the Defense Ministry bureaucracy, rather than under
Kvashnin in the General Staff.
</P>
<P>
   But Felgenhauer and others noted that one of the officers
dismissed, General Anatoly Sitnov, recently criticized the
government for allowing Russia's conventional weapons to
deteriorate, a position closer to Kvashnin's than Sergeyev's. The
RTR state television network quoted Sitnov as saying that Russia's
conventional forces will fall hopelessly behind other armies within
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Sitnov, who was Russia's defense procurement
chief, the other sacked generals were: Stanislav Petrov, the head
of radioactive, biological and chemical defense; Boris Dukhov, head
of antiaircraft forces; Nikolai Karaulov, the artillery and rockets
chief; Alexander Zobnin, head of funding and trade; and press
service head Anatoly Shatalov.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the generals had passed retirement age while four others,
including Sitnov, were promised new jobs in the military, RTR
television reported.
</P>
<P>
   The six all held their positions on an acting basis and had
routinely offered their resignations when Putin was inaugurated as
president in May, NTV television reported.

 &HT;    GOP convention off to a start
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republicans opened their convention Monday, beginning what party
leaders hope will be a highly scripted four-day celebration for
their presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush. The first real
business of the convention came when the delegates approved by
voice vote a platform that reaffirms the party's staunch position
opposing abortion while adopting Bush's ``compassionate
conservative'' positions on issues like education and immigration.
Bush has sought to prevent any issues from flaring into controversy
at this convention by keeping tight-fisted control of the
proceedings, including requiring speakers to follow pre-approved,
scripted themes.
</P>
<P>
   Party tries a makeover....
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to forget the Republicans have controlled Congress for
the past six years from watching the convention on television this
week. Remarkably, very few GOP members of Congress have been asked
to speak. Instead, the featured speakers include a wide variety of
unelected Americans: teachers, war heroes, small business owners, a
former welfare recipient, a senior citizen, a former Democrat,
entertainers and a professional wrestler. These speakers were
chosen, according to GOP officials, to present the country with
``the new face of the Republican Party.'' When asked why so few
congressional Republicans are speaking, Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.),
chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, said:
``This convention is about nominating George W. Bush to be
president; this convention is not about electing Republican members
of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ....but numbers never lie
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Convention delegates are mostly white,
middle-aged, college-educated, married males, according to an
Associated Press survey in which 89% of the delegates participated.
They range in age from 19 to 97. Many are politicians or lawyers.
About 83 percent are white and 71 percent have a college degree.
''They are the cream of the crop of the people who run the party,''
said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia politics professor.
''The delegation is not a mirror of America; it's a mirror of the
elite in America,'' he said. The Democratic Party requires each
state delegation to have equal numbers of men and women and to set
aside slots for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Powell to stress diversity, education in speech
</P>
<P>
   The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Colin
Powell heard catcalls at the 1996 Republican National Convention
when he pledged his support for abortion rights and affirmative
action. Delegates said he will be embraced this time, as George W.
Bush tries to reshape the party's image. Powell, who speaks
tonight, plans to tell delegates that education is the nation's
highest priority and will reaffirm his support of affirmative
action. Supporters say Powell's appearance before Republican
delegates who are 83 percent white will help Bush appeal to
moderate voters in battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush's time to shine
</P>
<P>
   Admitting a little nervousness, the wife of Gov. George W. Bush
said she hopes to give some insights into her husband in a speech
welcoming delegates to the Republican convention. ``I think I have
an opportunity to say things about George that other people don't
know about him or can't tell about him,'' Laura Bush said on NBC's
Today show. A former librarian and schoolteacher, Mrs. Bush said
she also will focus her remarks on education and literacy. Later
this week, Mrs. Bush will be feted at a luncheon by the Federation
of American Women where, in a twist, the Texas governor will be one
of the featured speakers on behalf of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Conventions sees its first arrests
</P>
<P>
   Police dragged eight non-violent demonstrators onto a bus today
after the protesters blocked traffic during the morning rush hour,
marking the first arrests related to the Republican National
Convention. The disruptions occurred as several groups of
protesters hit the streets at midday as delegates prepared to
attend their first session of the convention at the First Union
Center in South Philadelphia. The arrested demonstrators were
denouncing the Army's School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Ga.
Critics have blamed the school for human rights abuses in Central
American countries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ponders vice presidential pick
</P>
<P>
   While the Republicans have their big show in Philadelphia, Vice
President Al Gore is moving toward announcing his own running mate.
Eight days before Gore says he'll announce his choice, aides are
still saying only that he's considering a ``diverse list'' of fewer
than 10 people and hoping his choice takes a bit of the shine from
Bush's convention in the week before the Democrats gather in Los
Angeles. Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, Florida Sen. Bob Graham and
former Senate leader George Mitchell are often mentioned as still
in the running. But ``only Al Gore and Warren Christopher know who
is on that short list,'' said spokesman Chris Lehane, referring to
the former secretary of state who is helping Gore with the
selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans playing nice....
</P>
<P>
   Democrats probing for weaknesses to exploit at the Republican
National Convention are frustrated by the lack of dissension,
missteps and red-meat rhetoric they had hoped would undermine the
GOP. With Republicans stubbornly refusing to squabble among
themselves _ over abortion, their platform or George W. Bush's
selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate _ Democrats have been
reduced to implying that Arizona Sen. John McCain still harbors
some lingering animosity toward Bush, and trying to liken Cheney's
choice to George Bush Sr.'s pick of Dan Quayle as vice president in
1988. Still, Democrats acknowledge it is tough to demonize
Republicans who are bending over backward to appear nice. ``The
(Republicans) have put all their hard-liners up in the attic like
an uncle that you only let downstairs for Thanksgiving dinner
because he causes a scene every year,'' said Deomcratic strategist
Bill Carrick. ``I don't know that we're going to see a big bump out
of this, particularly if the Republican message is going to be:
'We're going to be nicer than the Democrats.' ``
</P>
<P>
   .. .Democrats crashing party
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are determined not to let the Republicans' big show go
off without stealing a bit of the spotlight. This week, the
Democrats will drive around town in a black bus emblazoned with the
words, ``Pictured here are all the working people George W. Bush
will fight for'' - and a photo of bare Texas scrubland. A daily
spin conferences will feature guests including Sen. Tom Harkin of
Iowa, and Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont. And a ``I Know What You
Did in Texas'' Web site will use eerie graphics to criticize Bush's
``scary record.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick, Lynne and now Mary
</P>
<P>
   The gay rights battle appears poised to enter the
</P>
<P>
   presidential campaign in an unlikely way. Republican vice
presidential nominee Dick Cheney has a lesbian daughter, and
friends report she has already put off grad school to play an
active role on the campaign trail. Until May, Mary Cheney, 31, was
the lesbian/gay corporate relations manager for the
once-notoriously anti-gay Coors Brewing Co., where she negotiated
with gay groups to drop their support for a Coors boycott. Many
believe that Cheney, who is fiercely close to her father, will do
the same to a ticket long antagonistic to gay rights. Vice
presidential nominee George W. Bush opposes workplace anti-
discrimination laws, supports a ban on gay adoptions and says he
wouldn't allow gays to serve openly in the military. Dick Cheney
has also had a dubious record on gay rights issues, voting in
Congress against the Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 1988, and being
a vocal opponent of open gay military service.
</P>
<P>
   All on the same page
</P>
<P>
   The GOP is taking steps to guarantee everyone at the Republican
National Convention is on message, including the delegates.
Convention officials are giving all the delegates their very own
copy of George W. Bush's speeches, policy speeches and campaign
fact sheets in the form of a 453-page book entitled, ``Renewing
America's Purpose.'' ``It's our road map of the governor's key
principles and policies,'' said Convention Chairman Andrew Card.
And for the more computer-savvy delegates there is also a CD-ROM
that includes all of Bush's TV campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan a no-show....
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 32 years, Pat Buchanan is not attending
the Republican National Convention. He plans to head to the beach
in Delaware for ``some writing and thinking'' - maybe even wegation
section is directly in front of the podium where Bush will accept
the party's presidential nomination Thursday. ``Obviously, there is
a very bright spotlight on Texas this year with our governor
running for president, with his vice presidential pick (having)
Texas ties,'' said Robert Black, spokesman for the Texas GOP.
</P>
<P>
   You're not in Kansas anymore
</P>
<P>
   The seats aren't bad ones, two dozen or so paces from the steps
that lead up to the podium at the First Union Center. Still, they
feel distant for the Kansas delegation. Just four years ago in San
Diego, when Bob Dole was the Republican presidential nominee,
delegates for Kansas, his home state, sat up front and stayed at a
luxury hotel in downtown San Diego. This year, the delegation is at
the Airport Marriott. The delegates believe that if Dole had
remained in the Senate, they might be closer to historic sites such
as the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. ``We're on our own now,
so we have to scratch and claw for everything we get,'' said state
GOP Chairman Mark Parkinson.
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready to rumble??
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly hostile struggle for power in the Reform Party
between the Pat Buchanan forces and the Ross Perot loyalists who
are supporting John Hagelin for the nomination moved past the point
of negotiable resolution at a rump meeting over the weekend with
the executive committee voting to disqualify Buchanan as a
candidate and the Buchanan faction dubbing the process ``illegal.''
The clash has intensified to such a degree that interim party Chair
Gerald Moan said he is beefing up security for the Aug. 10-13
national convention in Long Beach, Calif. He said he has received a
number of ``death threats,'' including a message on his voice mail
last night saying, ``You miserable piece of . . . . I'm going to
get you, don't worry, I'm going to get you in Long Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Girl power Alabama style
</P>
<P>
   The all-female staff at Alabama's Republican headquarters got
quite a chuckle recently when an agitated caller demanded to speak
to the office's highest-ranking male. That would be an unpaid
intern, a female staffer delighted in telling him. ``The person
you'll need to talk with is a woman named Twinkle,'' she said. The
caller hung up. Of all the organizing teams at this week's
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Alabama's alone
lacks a single male. ``Alabama is last in a lot of things,'' said
Lisa Myers, the party's finance director. ``In this, I guess we're
probably first. Besides, we're probably the only state party that
has nail polish remover in our first aid kit.''
</P>
<P>
   Star wars can wait, GOP enjoys the Car Wars
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler had crabcakes, the Dodge Copperhead and the
Temptations. General Motors favored barbecue, the Batmobile and
Hank Williams Jr. GOP delegates were the beneficiaries of huge
receptions thrown by the major automakers to curry favor with the
GOP's thirsty followers. DaimlerChrysler decorated Philadelphia's
Convention Center to look like a car dealership for its bash
honoring Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts. The GM party was heavier on
Southern accents -- barbecue, baked beans, ham sandwiches and
potato chips . ``I'm from Detroit,'' Michigan political operative
Jim Alexander said at the GM party. ``The food is better here but
the music was much better at Chrysler.''

PLAYWRIGHT'S NEW COMEDY MEETS ALL HER EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   cc,78p3 &QL; 
Around the time playwright Lisa Loomer was thinking about starting
a family, she was also developing an idea for a one-woman show. Her
proposed title: ``Why Bring a Child Into This Lousy World?''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your loaded questions, especially considering the
lengths to which Loomer knew people would go to have a child.
Hormone therapy and frozen eggs, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of reproductive technology was all around me,'' says
Loomer, who lives in Los Angeles. ``It's all so new and it's
opening up so many options for people and it's something society
has never dealt with before. I just thought it was a fascinating
issue of our times.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Loomer and her husband, composer Joe Romano, did
become parents of Marcello, now 2 1/2. And before his birth, Loomer
delivered a new play about the trials and tribulations of impending
parenthood. ``Expecting Isabel,'' which opens Wednesday at the Mark
Taper Forum, might have carried the title ``For God's Sake, Please
Let Me Bring a Child Into This Lousy World.''
</P>
<P>
   A comedy with definite satirical overtones, ``Isabel's'' heroes,
a 30-something husband and wife, go through an odyssey of nearly
Homeric proportions in their efforts to have a child. From a
barrage of assisted reproduction techniques through all manner of
support groups and the maze of adoption, Nick and Miranda nearly
destroy themselves and each other. All for a goal that, most of us
think, should be a snap. What could be more simple and more basic
than having a child?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, just about anything, the playwright says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be so simple. It is not simple now. Infertility is
a huge issue right now,'' says Loomer, who also co-wrote the
screenplay for last year's film, ``Girl, Interrupted,'' for which
Angelina Jolie won an Oscar as best supporting actress. ``The play
asks the question, `How do we decide who we can love because we
have all these seeming choices?' I don't really believe that. I
believe there's a lot of illusion of control in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, the arc of the female character in the play is she
goes from having the illusion of control in her life to having
faith. It's from control and fear to faith, and in my own journey
of becoming a parent, I found it came down to faith and love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Expecting Isabel'' is not, Loomer says, a mirror of her own
experiences or necessarily of any one person in her life. An
exhaustive researcher who plowed into issues of women's health in
creating her 1994 play ``The Waiting Room,'' Loomer collected
plenty of stories from people throughout the infertility and
adoption fields _ from doctors, lawyers, support group therapists
and would-be parents. ``People who saw it in Washington, D.C.,
would say 'Aargh! That's my story!' '' Loomer says.
</P>
<P>
   A Taper commission, ``Expecting Isabel'' premiered during the
theater's New Work Festival in 1997 before getting a staging at the
Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., in the fall of 1998, ultimately
capturing the American Theatre Critics Association's Award for best
play. The Taper also produced the world premiere of Loomer's ``The
Waiting Room'' in 1994. In that earlier work, Loomer tackled the
ways in which women historically have tried to enhance their
appearances _ through such practices as foot binding and breast
enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   Like that earlier work, ``Expecting Isabel'' occasionally uses
broad comic strokes to tell its story. Which is appropriate when
you're addressing such matters as rushing a cup of sperm to a test
site and fertilizing the egg from a hamster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play just treats the topic without a lot of reverence or
melodrama,'' says Julie White, who plays ``Isabel's''
``I-will-have-a-baby-at-any-cost'' heroine, Miranda. ``It tells it
in almost a circuslike way, but at the heart of it is this simple
and kind of sweet story that many people can relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   White says she can understand Miranda's mania, although the
actress personally never went through the perils of infertility
that her character encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this crazy stuff? Yes, I have friends who have done the
crazy stuff, who have used donor eggs and surrogate moms,'' says
White, the mother of a 13-year-old daughter. ``And I know people
who have adopted. In one case, with some friends of mine, it was
like, 'WE GOT YOU A BABY! YOU HAVE TO DRIVE TO SCOTTSDALE RIGHT
NOW!' '' They drove to Scottsdale and, the next thing you know, it
was like, 'Yow!' They had to stay overnight, and they put the baby
in a drawer.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friends, she says, were totally prepared and yet unprepared.
``No matter how you get children _ if you get them the traditional
way, if you adopt or if you go through all the fertility stuff,
it's still freakishly weird to have a child.'' Miranda and Nick
(who will be played by Tony Award winner Anthony Crivello) trade
off as narrators, and both occasionally come close to losing the
audience's sympathy. Their flaws are visible, says White, but
that's what makes them human.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to figure out Miranda's engine, her real engine of fear
so that she didn't just become a neurotic chick who has a lot of
food issues,'' said White. ``Yuk! Who wants to spend two hours with
that?
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's fun to see people working together and being in love.
I think you root for them even though you see their individual
flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   In conducting her research, Loomer said she heard stories of
couples whose relationships ended over efforts to have a child, and
others who slogged on for 10 years of infertility treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a huge advocate for adoption, and my feeling is that when
people want to become parents for adoption, they will, '' says
Loomer. ``I've heard of some people who have had tragedies along
the way, and some who haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the playwright has her own version of White's
``drive to Scottsdale now!'' story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a dear friend, and because I knew they wanted to adopt,
I mentioned it to an adoption facilitator,'' says Loomer. ``A baby
was born, and like three weeks later, these people became parents.
It has every variation of a human story.'' &QL;

CANADA SENDS WARSHIP TO SHADOW ROGUE FREIGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ A Canadian warship surged out of heavy
fog in the North Atlantic Monday in an attempt to force into port a
rogue US-owned freighter that for two weeks has refused to
relinquish a cargo of battle tanks and other combat gear
representing 10 percent of Canada's armored might.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night the HMCS Athabaskan, a Canadian naval frigate, was
shadowing the freighter GTS Katie at a distance of 1,000 yards,
close quarters in the treacherous sea and a clear attempt to
intimidate the merchant ship's captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want that vessel to have absolutely no doubt there is a
warship on its stern, with all that entails,'' said Alastair
Mullin, a spokesman for Canada's Defense Ministry. ``We want to
bring a quick resolution to this.''
</P>
<P>
   The belated show of force appeared to be working. The Katie was
steering a course toward Canadian waters, according to the
military. But Canadian officials acknowledged that the ship's
owner, a Maryland-based shipping company, was still refusing to
call an end formally to a strange deep-water standoff making
headlines on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 18, the cargo ship Katie has confounded and
embarrassed the Canadian government by refusing to surrender 580
battle tanks, armored personnel carriers, reconaissance vehicles
and large quantities of munitions, as well as a trio of Canadian
soldiers, being shipped home from a peacekeeping operation in the
Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's owner, Third Ocean Marine Navigation Co. of
Annapolis, Md., effectively took captive a substantial portion of
Canada's military arsenal in an attempt to settle a financial
dispute with a third party, a Canadian shipping firm. None of the
parties involved will discuss details of the dispute, but Canada
was first humiliated and then angered by attempts to make its
military hostage to a fight between businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Katie has been tracing huge circles in international waters
600 miles east of Halifax as diplomats and lawyers haggled over
fine points of maritime law in Ottawa, Washington, and other
centers. The Katie flies under a flag of convenience, registered in
the tiny Caribbean nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and to
complicate matters even more, the Soviet-built supercargo carrier's
crew is Ukranian.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, Canada's military brass had stood helplessly by as
the Katie ignored entreaties to surrender the military gear. But
late Sunday Canadian Aurora reconnaissance planes spied out the
freighter, and Monday the Athabaskan reached the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the Katie was steaming toward the Gulf of St.
Lawrence at a ponderously slow speed of 2 or 3 knots. The Canadian
Navy ordered the gargantuan freighter to increase speed to 12
knots, a rate that would bring the ship into port near Montreal by
the end of this week. The war gear was supposed to have been
unloaded on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dispute is not fully settled,'' Mullin acknowledged in an
interview from Ottawa. ``But Canada is making clear it will protect
its equipment and its personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of recent military spending cuts, Canada has to rely on
civilian shipping or air companies to transport its soldiers and
gear to peacekeeping assignments around the world.

   PHILADELPHIA _ Political tidbits from the Republican National
Convention:
</P>
<P>
   Different sides of the Republican party were on display Monday
in neighboring reception rooms at a Philadelphia hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In one, Reps. Bob Barr, R-Ga., and Dan Burton, R-Ind., received
awards for their pursuit of wrongdoing in the Clinton
administration. The award-givers were groups headed by committed
anti-Clintonites Floyd Brown and David Bossie, who worked for the
House investigative committee on which Burton and Barr serve.
</P>
<P>
   Barr received the ``Service Above Self'' award, Brown said, ``in
recognition of your willingness to sacrifice all in pursuit of
honesty and integrity in government.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those in attendance were Phyllis Schlafly, head of the
Eagle Forum, and Gary Aldrich, the former Secret Service agent who
wrote an expose of the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan, you point the way and I'll follow you,'' Barr said to
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   The other reception honored Teamsters leader James Hoffa, part
of the GOP's effort to break the Democratic stranglehold on the
labor vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republican luminaries, including former Speaker Newt Gingrich,
were all over that event.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one Republican who planted himself in front of
microphones and cameras at Hoffa's reception was Barr, who was late
to his own reception as a result.
</P>
<P>
   A plane towing a Confederate flag and an anti-Bush slogan flew
over the the Republican Convention and downtown Philadelphia on
Monday to protest the removal of a several plaques dedicated to
Texas Confederate veterans from the Texas Supreme Court building.
</P>
<P>
   The plane flew over the First Union Center, site of the GOP
convention, toting a 10-by-15-foot Confederate battle flag and a
banner reading ``Bush: Put the TX vets plaques back!''
</P>
<P>
   The protest, sponsored by the Southern Heritage Community, will
continue tomorrow with the plane again pulling a Confederate flag
with a different banner reading ``GOP: No votes for turncoats!''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Heritage Community is angry with Bush because he
removed the plaques from the Supreme Court building in Austin
without any public hearing or input because of a deal made with
Texas NAACP President Gary Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Political humor here isn't limited to Comedy Central's
``Indecision 2000.'' Ordinary-looking men handed out
official-looking delegate guides on street corners Monday. They
were snapped up by delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But inside, the pamphlets contained the satire of
modernhumorist.com.
</P>
<P>
   It began with a letter purportedly from Philadelphia Mayor John
Street: ``Dear Delegate, Welcome to Philadelphia! I'm glad you're
here to spend your money in the Place that Loves You Back.''
</P>
<P>
   The guide also contains horoscopes (``Aquarius: Uncertainty may
gnaw at your insides, but this is no time to question your support
of school vouchers'') and ads for dates (``Cindi: blonde, smokin'
figure, believes abortion is murder'') that offer ``30 percent off
with NRA membership''; and a ``1 for the price of 2'' coupon.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The City of Brotherly Love is showing much more affection to
visiting journalists than some past GOP conventions. At a lavish
press party Saturday night at the Convention Center, journalists
entered through an applauding and cheering gantlet of dozens of
volunteers. Not a single chant of ``No more lies'' was heard.

   Something seemed a little strange when the Los Angeles hip-hop
radio station Power 106 played a song from an album by pop's
biggest current star, the 27-year-old white rapper Eminem, that had
not yet been released as a single. Trying to mask offensive lyrics,
the station bleeped out a derogatory term for blacks but left in a
derogatory term for gays.
</P>
<P>
   On the so-called clean version of the full-length Eminem album,
``The Marshall Mathers LP'' (No. 3 on the pop charts after two
months as No. 1), the record label excised entire tracks to create
an alternative album that parents could buy for their children.
</P>
<P>
   In the remaining songs, the lyrics have been extensively edited
_ up to 60 times in a single song _ to eliminate references to
drugs, violence, profanity and hate speech. Most anti-gay slurs
have been removed, while a derogatory term for women remains,
cropping up scores of times on the album.
</P>
<P>
   These and countless other such incidents show a remarkable
change in the way record companies and radio stations now handle
explicit lyrics as well as the inconsistencies in these methods. In
the 1980s and early '90s major music labels held themselves up as
free speech champions as they fought against pressure groups
attacking specific songs. But today, as the record-buying audience
grows younger and political and business pressures on record
companies mount, an array of song-lyric review and editing
procedures have become routine.
</P>
<P>
   Artists are regularly asked to re-sing lyrics, edit out
particular words and even excise entire songs from albums. In
addition, changes made to songs for radio play are often far more
extensive than the simple editing required to make them conform to
federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Music, the nation's biggest record label, now has a
review board of employees representing different races and both
sexes. The board screens the lyrics of every record the company
releases for explicit language. As a result, recent albums by
rappers like Eminem, Dr. Dre and Juvenile have lyrics that are
bleeped or excised from all copies of their albums _ not just the
clean versions _ in a practice that has never existed to such a
degree in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although every major music label creates edited versions of
explicit singles for radio and clean versions of albums (which can
account for 10 to 15 percent of sales for an artist like Eminem),
those speaking for major labels outside the Universal system denied
having formal committees to review lyrics. Many music executives,
however, say review boards are widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting like we almost have a McCarthyism in the
business,'' said Phyllis Pollack, a press agent who has worked with
some of rap's most notorious groups, including NWA and the Geto
Boys. ``But the censorship isn't new; what's new is the fear and
the compliance going on to this extent. And I think a lot of
artists go along with it because they're afraid of being lost in
the corporate shuffle and falling out of favor with their labels.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Rosen, the president of the Recording Industry
Association of America, a trade group representing the major
labels, said that the attention paid to lyrics was not a matter of
McCarthyism but a means of balancing several different
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every label has a review board, or at least someone reviews
the music,'' she said. ``I think it's a combination of both not
wanting to stifle artists, but wanting what I feel is a very real
sense of corporate and social responsibility. The political
pressures are real, but I think just as importantly, executives and
artists care about the parenting issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives and experts cite many other possible reasons
for the increased vigilance. Some see it as a response to the
increasing cultural dominance of hip-hop, generally a more verbally
explicit genre than rock and pop.
</P>
<P>
   Others point to the increased share of the music market _ 10 to
20 percent for popular artists _ represented by chains like
Wal-Mart and Kmart, which refuse to carry albums with parental
advisory stickers. And some complain that the industry is giving
ground to conservative critics like William J. Bennett, the Rev.
Pat Robertson and Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. These shifts in the
handling of explicit content also come as record labels are seeking
government help in their war against unauthorized downloading of
music from the Internet, and high-stakes corporate mergers are
making many companies more financially and musically conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rhyme or reason to what we're made to do,''
complained a top executive at one major label who, like many
interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity
because he said he felt caught between artists' rights and the
demands of more conservative retailers.

LOVING BOND TIES BUSHES, FATHER AND SON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (1760 words, sted 1900, as budgeted)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ They were so confident then, and worldly. It was
1964, the spring of senior year at Andover, and the boys, already
accepted into college, were ready to let their hair down. A group
of them trooped into Boston, mostly to hang out or, in the phrase
of the time, to hang loose.
</P>
<P>
   Then one of the kids said his father was in town, and maybe they
ought to go over to say hello. And so in the middle of this lark,
this schoolboys' holiday, all those high-school seniors, almost but
not quite men, went over to a downtown hotel, and there in the
lobby, in front of all his friends, George W. Bush greeted his
father, George H. W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember this: He hugged his dad,'' says John E. Kidde, who
was George W. Bush's roommate at Phillips Andover that year. ``I
remember standing there saying: `Gee, I don't remember if my dad
has hugged me for years.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This week, here in the First Union Center, the son will receive
the embrace of the Republican Party and the presidential nomination
that the GOP twice has bestowed on his father. It is both the
party's gift and the family's inheritance. And the candidate who
will accept it Thursday night will take pains to make clear that he
is both his own man _ and his father's son.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night the father appears before a party that for the
fifth time in two decades will place a Bush on a national ticket.
And though the father has remained in the background, he still is
leaving footprints on the landscape of American politics. He played
an integral role in the selection of Dick Cheney, his former
defense secretary, as the Republicans' vice-presidential candidate.
His friends and advisers are the spine of his son's policy team.
His profile and performance are the buoys by which the son
navigates his own passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has been affected by my dad,'' the governor said in a
conversation earlier in the campaign. ``I love him a lot, admire
him. I've seen a good man go into politics and been by his side as
he lost three times, and he's still a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   The father was president during the dawn of the contemporary
era, the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the fall of the Communist
bloc, and the son is running in the first presidential election of
the new millennium, and yet there is nothing new age about the ties
between the two of them. Victorians with a romantic strain, the
Bushes are not a postmodern family.
</P>
<P>
   The only man to follow his father into the presidency, John
Quincy Adams, was more intellectual than his father; he mastered
seven languages and, according to William Henry Harrison, gathered
all that he knew from books. Not so George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is more intuitive than intellectual. He was no
student in college _ his route through Yale resembles nothing so
much as a glide pattern _ but his father believes he learned a lot
at home. They were lessons, the father said in an exchange of
letters over the past year with this Globe writer, that ``are the
same ones I learned from my parents, the same ones so many families
try to teach their own sons and daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the former president listed those lessons:
</P>
<P>
   ``Be honest. Give the other guy credit. Work hard. Be kind and
caring. Be willing to learn. On and on go these almost cliche-like
values, but they are real. They guided me. They will guide our sons
and daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the father wasn't always a former president, and the
son wasn't always an aspiring president. But in the early days,
when they were just Dad and George (or Georgie, as his father
called him then), their relationship wasn't much different than it
is today, a mixture of affection and epigrams that even the Bushes'
greatest detractors do not believe is artificial or confectionary.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter the father wrote to a friend in 1948, when the son
was but 2, he said: ``You should see Georgie now, nothing like
bragging about one's own kid. . . . Whenever I come home he greets
me and talks a blue streak, sentences disjointed of course but
enthusiasm and spirit boundless.''
</P>
<P>
   That could have been written Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The father and the son had the usual tensions, the
confrontations about bad behavior, the worried talk about girls,
the searching questions designed to give the father some insight,
however small, into what exactly the son was planning to do with
his life, if anything. ``Georgie aggravates the hell out of me at
times,'' the father wrote to his father-in-law, Marvin Pierce, in
the spring of 1955, when the son was only 8. But he added: ``At
times I am so proud of him I could die.''
</P>
<P>
   Proud, but a little worried. On the son's 29th birthday, the
father, then the US delegate to China, wrote to a friend about
George W.'s intention to move to Midland, Texas, and, ``starting a
little later in life than I did,'' try his hand at the oil
business. ``He is able. If he gets his teeth into something . . .
he will do just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what happened, more or less. The son may not have
walked the straight path but generally speaking he kept to his
father's route, which is no surprise to the people who knew them
both at a time when everybody thought the New England family that
would spawn a political dynasty was the Kennedys, certainly not the
Bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Young George was not much of a reader, but when his father sent
him a copy of ``The Conscience of a Conservative,'' by Barry
Goldwater, he read it. When his father spoke, he listened. One of
the things the father said came from his own father, Senator
Prescott Bush, a Connecticut Republican, and he transmitted it in a
letter to the four Bush boys two weeks before President Richard M.
Nixon resigned in the middle of the Watergate scandal: ``My Dad
felt strongly the firm obligation to put something into the
system,'' said the father, who had served as chairman of the
Republican National Committee under Nixon. ``He felt compelled to
give, to be involved, and to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   There was often a whisper of destiny in the family, and not only
when George H. W. Bush was the family patriarch. Senator Bush once
told a French diplomat that his son, then a young man, would be
president someday; it would be a quarter-century before anyone else
would take that notion seriously. Indeed, George H. W. Bush would
be defeated in a high-profile Senate race in Texas in 1970 and then
in a presidential nomination campaign in 1980 before finally
winning in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are putting too much emphasis on the importance to my
family of my defeats,'' the former president said in an earlier
exchange of letters with the Globe. ``We are a strong family in
victory or in defeat. No one likes to lose but time and again our
sons and Doro (his daughter) have shown that they never felt we
were `owed' one darn thing and that adversity in the political
arena could not weaken our family in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   But even outsiders thought the Bush family was special.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father was an inspiration to me, and I know he was an
inspiration to George,'' said Randall M. Roden, a trial lawyer who
knew the governor both in West Texas and at Andover. ``His father
is the way you see him: an energetic, likeable, patriotic person.
He played with us. He joked around with us. He did things with us.
This was a more interesting family than most in West Texas in those
days. They treated kids seriously. They would ask us questions and
listen to the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the governor's boyhood friends tell of being invited
to the Bush home and seeing pictures on the wall of his grandfather
with presidents. ``It was no big deal,'' said Don Vermeil, another
onetime Andover roommate. ``George is that way in general. He
doesn't make a big deal about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom S. Seligman, another Andover classmate, adds: ``To George's
credit he didn't brag. Never. You never got a sense that he was
from an important or illustrious family. George was just George.''
</P>
<P>
   But part of being George was knowing that his family was such an
important part of his life. The public knows it, too. Both
major-party presidential candidates carry the names of their famous
fathers. And yet nearly five times as many Americans believe that
George W. Bush relied on family connections to get ahead than
believe that Al Gore did, according to a poll released last week by
the Pew Research Center. As a result, former transportation
secretary Andrew Card, the onetime Bush Cabinet member who is
running the convention here, has said the party is being careful
not to let the Philadelphia festivities look like a Bush family
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the father is a former president, his role seems
outsized. But it wasn't only him. It was George W.'s mother, too.
Indeed, many Bush watchers believe that the governor's blithe
spirit and personal style come directly from Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt Bar is a huge influence in the governor's
life,'' said Alexander ``Hap'' Ellis, a Boston merchant banker who
is the governor's cousin. ``It's impossible to distinguish between
the effect of Big George and Bar. They're both hugely important,
which is why George W. is an extraordinary guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the father's achievements set a high standard for the
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wonder whether George suffered in the shadow of his
accomplished father,'' said Roden, the friend from West Texas and
Andover days. ``I don't think so. I do not think George feels
insecure or suffered in any way. I think he was loved and honored,
and the fact that he admired his father was a positive, not a
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer the father was asked in the exchange of letters
whether there was any motive of vindication in the son's effort to
succeed the very man who defeated his father. Here is the father's
answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``George's quest is not about vindication _ not at all. He
doesn't need to help `make things right for the Bushes.' Things are
right for Barbara and me, indeed for our whole family. Would we be
happy if he won? Of course, but it is not about vindication or
getting even. Believe me.''

 UNDATED: conservative retailers. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   J-Flexx, a rapper who has written No. 1 hits for Dr. Dre and
others, has another theory about the changing attitude toward
explicit content. ``I don't think the industry has such high
morals,'' he said. ``I think the industry goes to whoever's buying
the music. When gangsta rap was selling four or five years ago,
everyone was looking for something hard. But right now pre-teens
are buying the records, so the industry is looking at lyrics real
closely and catering to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases there are dozens, sometimes more than a hundred,
different versions of a popular single floating around, most of
them edited by individual radio stations with no contractual
relationship with the artist. But as artists like Eminem are
attacked for homophobic and misogynistic lyrics, critics are
noticing that those trying to clean up these lyrics are not doing a
consistent job.
</P>
<P>
   The sanitized songs, they say, are full of inconsistencies and
double standards that reveal as much about the sensitivities _ or
lack of them _ of the industry expurgators as they do about the
artists.
</P>
<P>
   One example is on the recent Eminem CD. A new song was added to
the cleaned-up version to replace one about domestic violence.
Titled ``Kids,'' it is a tongue-in-cheek anti-drug rap that
parodies the cartoon ``South Park.'' But while much of the hate
speech and references to violence and drug and alcohol abuse have
been cut out of the album (even to the extreme of removing all
instances of the words ``kill,'' ``hit,'' ``slit,'' ``shoot,''
``O.D.'' and ``Zig-Zag''), in this new song a student makes fun of
a teacher, laughing and saying, ``He's got AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disturbing to me that they even have to make a clean
version of a record and eliminate certain things,'' said Danny
Goldberg, founder of Artemis Records and the former president of
Mercury Records. ``But if retailers want to eliminate things that
offend some people, why does that not apply to language that's
offensive to gays and lesbians?''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Interscope Records and its parent company,
Universal, declined to comment on the Eminem inconsistencies or to
discuss anything related to the screening or editing of content.
But elsewhere, one top-ranking major label executive said that
creating a clean version of a record at his label was a haphazard
process with no rules and that it was usually done by an
unsupervised junior staff member at a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The finished product, the executive added, is something no one
at the label signs off on, in part because it is ``annoying to
listen to'' with all the missing lyrics, not unlike a cell phone
conversation in an area with bad reception.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Seomin, the entertainment media director of the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, said the music business had
been far less sensitive than other entertainment industries about
the concerns of gay people.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as radio stations and record labels acting responsibly,
it basically comes down to a different standard that is in place
for the gay and lesbian community, and also for women,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But these are not the only groups feeling overlooked by those
who edit songs. Many other minority group representatives, in
addition to parents associations, have their own complaints. And
rappers say they are singled out for lyric review, song editing and
parental advisory stickers more often than rock acts.
</P>
<P>
   When the Murderers, an African-American rap group, was told by
Universal to remove lyrics about violence against police officers
and gays from its forthcoming album, the rapper Ja Rule seethed. He
told reporters he was upset about the label's hypocrisy: why, he
asked, did executives make him remove slurs against gays and the
police but say nothing about the band's equally derogatory
references to blacks?
</P>
<P>
   Instances of record labels taking such precautionary measures go
as far back as the mid-'50', when Little Richard, in recording
``Tutti Frutti,'' is said to have worked with a hired lyricist to
clean up the risque lyrics of his live version. But many date the
modern era of creating clean versions to the obscenity complaints
generated by 2 Live Crew's 1989 album, ``As Nasty as They Wanna
Be,'' which was also released in an edited version called ``As
Clean as They Wanna Be.'' Three years later, the ante for labels
was upped by protests over the song ``Cop Killer'' by Ice-T's rock
band, Body Count; law enforcement organizations and Time Warner
shareholders pressured the label to remove it from the album.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bernstein, a spokesman for Universal, confirmed the
existence of a formal board that screens all lyrics before a record
with a parental advisory sticker can be released. Some of
Universal's subsidiary labels, like MCA, have also instituted
review panels, meaning that some records have to pass through two
committees before being released. The results, with lyrics
noticeably edited or obscured in every version, make it impossible
to hear a song as it was intended to be heard.

   This occurs on recent albums by Eminem, Dr. Dre and Juvenile. On
``What's the Difference,'' on Dr. Dre's ``Chronic 2001,'' a
computerized female voice is inserted to obscure a lyric in which
Dr. Dre venomously insults another rapper. On the Eminem record, at
least two small passages have been dropped: one sympathizing with
the Columbine killers in ``I'm Back,'' another a graphic insult
directed at his own family in the rap ``Marshall Mathers.'' On the
Juvenile record ``400 Degreez,'' for some reason the word
``homicide'' has been removed from ``Gone Ride With Me'' while all
other references to violence and gunplay on the album remain.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said Universal would neither disclose the names of
those on the review board nor permit interviews with them. But
executives at other record companies and at radio stations were
willing to discuss the editing process, and the consensus was that
there was no consensus. What can be played at night on the radio is
not the same as what can be played during the day; what's suitable
for a modern rock station might not float at an oldies station;
what's right for Manhattan might not fly in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Lyles, president of Def Soul Records (which includes
Sisqo, a rhythm-and-blues singer, and Redman, a rapper), said there
was one employee whose job was to pore over lyric sheets with a red
pen, circle the explicit lyrics, show them to him and then sit at
the computer covering up all offending words with sound effects to
create a clean version. In extreme cases, he said, he will ask an
artist to sing new lyrics, leaving the offensive words out. In a
new single by DMX and Sisqo, for example, the rappers went back
into the studio to change the chorus of ``what these bitches want
from a nigger'' to ``what you really want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some artists feel that's messing with their artistic
creativity,'' Lyles said. ``But that's limiting themselves. From
our side, we want them to get the maximum amount of airplay, and
it's our job as a record company to explain that to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But often a radio station will return a song to Def Soul anyway,
saying that it is still too explicit. Then the label will create an
even tamer rendition, which it refers to as a superclean version.
</P>
<P>
   Other stations, however, find record label editing too strict.
Oedipus, the program director at the modern rock station WBCN in
Boston, said he often ended up discarding a label's radio version
of a single and re-editing the song at the station to allow more
lyrics through. For example, he said, when his station decided to
play Eminem's ``Stan,'' he listened to the record company version
and then decided to make his own. ``They took out the part where he
says, `Shut up, bitch' when his girlfriend is in the truck, and we
didn't take that out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad taste is not against the law, so we let the audience
decide for itself,'' he said. ``The only decisions we make are ones
to protect the license.''
</P>
<P>
   A radio station may be fined by the Federal Communications
Commission if it broadcasts _ during hours when children may be
listening _ any of seven objectionable words, one of which was not
edited out of the revised version of the Eminem CD, or material
that is patently offensive as measured by contemporary community
standards, especially references to sexual or excretory functions
and organs.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, many of the changes made to create radio versions of
singles _ particularly new or excised lyrics that remove drug
terminology, derogatory terms and references to violence _ are not
necessary according to those broadcast provisions, though they may
be a relief to parents.
</P>
<P>
   In the retail world, executives pointed out, the parental
warning stickers affixed to records with explicit lyrics are put
there solely at the discretion of the record label, with no rules
determining lyrics' inclusion or exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   One manager of several rock bands, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he regularly sent advance copies of lyric sheets
and cover art to Anderson Merchandisers, the CD supplier to chains
like Wal-Mart and Kmart. Often, Anderson will suggest lyrics and
artwork that should be changed in a clean version; sometimes, if it
is just a matter of making one or two minor modifications, the
changes will be made to all copies of an album to avoid the expense
of creating a clean version, the manager said. But because the
resulting clean CDs often make it to Wal-Mart and Kmart without
being screened again, discrepancies still abound. This means, for
example, that the clean copies they carry of Eminem's ``The
Marshall Mathers LP'' still contain the word ``bitch'' while the
clean copies they carry of DMX's ``And Then There Was X'' edit out
the exact same word. (Anderson did not return several phone calls
for comment.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The solution isn't to impose standards,'' said Nina Crowley of
the Massachusetts Music Industry Coalition, a free speech
organization. ``It's to not expect labels and television and radio
stations to do your parenting for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowley pointed out an example of random editing from music
television programming that captures the inconsistencies plaguing
the whole process. In a VH-1 documentary about the rap producer Dr.
Dre, she noticed that the word ``nigger'' was obscured visually in
a lyric sheet but at the same time could be heard loud and clear in
the music. A VH-1 spokesman said the word had been left in by
mistake and has now been bleeped out.

GUAM, SAMOA DELEGATES JUST ISLANDS IN THE CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ If 90 percent of life is showing up, then score a
big one for Guam and American Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee may talk pretty to them, but
the delegations from these two Pacific hiccups made the 20,000-mile
round trip to the City of Brotherly Love on their own nickels, lots
of them. It took Tony Unpingco, speaker of Guam's unicameral
legislature, 32 hours to make it, and he is still waking up at 4
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Once here, this gang is not exactly in the eye of the storm. On
Sunday night, when all of the state delegations held their opening
receptions, Guam and American Samoa were sandwiched between the
Etruscans and Ancient Greeks at the University of Pennsylvania
Museum of Archeology and Anthropology. There were no lines at the
food table, no cross body blocks for positioning in front of the
bar. They could have been a small poetry group discussing Eliot.
</P>
<P>
   And while they have American passports, these people can't vote
for George W. Bush, their candidate, in the general election.
``We're the forgotten ones,'' said Unpingco. ``We have no
leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   So why come? The weather must be sublime in the Pacific and
there are no metal detectors there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is our favorite pastime,'' explained Fred Castro,
Guam's delegation leader. ``Tip O'Neill said that all politics is
local, and this is our island culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The man has a point. Turnouts for Guam's gubernatorial elections
routinely approach 90 percent, he said. American Samoa, by
contrast, comes in around 50 percent. When apprised of the gap, the
head of the American Samoan delegation, Tautai Faalevao, replied,
``Good for Guam'' and headed for the food.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, conventions have been the closest thing to
presidential voting for Guam. (It, like American Samoa, has four
Republican delegates.) This year, though, Guam is hatching a plan
to ape Dixville Notch, the New Hampshire hamlet that unveils the
first votes in that state's primary.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Guam will include a presidential straw poll with a
plebescite over its future status as an unincorporated territory,
and plans to trumpet the results 14 hours ahead of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   American Samoa, by the way, is an unorganized unincorporated
territory. Asked what that means, Faalevao replied, ``I have no
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Guam and American Samoa have a warm spot in their hearts
for the Republicans. Unlike the Democrats, who recognize them at
their conventions after all of the states have been heard from, the
Republicans include them alphabetically with the herd, explained
Castro. American Samoa comes after Alaska, and Guam comes after
Georgia. While such distinctions may appear trivial to others, they
loom large for these folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of respect,'' said David Sablan, Guam's
Republican Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush people apparently harbor a soft spot for them as well.
For the first time, the Pacific pair combined their offshore
electoral muscle with the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in ``Super
Weekend,'' held in late February after the Michigan primary.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of the vote were complicated by numbing time zone
differences, including the metaphysical stumper whereby Guam and
American Samoa are geographically four hours apart but officially
20 hours apart due to the international date line. In the end, Guam
voted on Sunday, while American Samoa voted with the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Guam and American Samoa are proud of the 26 delegates delivered
to Bush and maintain that the bloc stemmed the McCain tide after he
upset Bush in Michigan. ``We were the firewall,'' Castro said
proudly. ``Our vote meant a lot to George Bush.'' Added Faalevao,
``We put the territories on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of. Bush is a magic name out there anyway, due in part to
the World War II experience of Bush the elder. ``His plane went
down in the drink near Guam,'' Castro noted approvingly. And Bush
the younger was the only Republican to run campaign ads in Guam
newspapers. ``McCain didn't organize out here,'' he added, unaware
perhaps that McCain didn't do much on the mainland either.
</P>
<P>
   All such political palaver will fade later this week when the
pro wrestler known as ``The Rock,'' who is of American Samoan
descent, introduces House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a former
wrestling coach, at the convention podium.
</P>
<P>
   For one brief shining moment, the islands will rule. Now that's
worth a trip halfway around the world.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;     Advocates Say Poor Police Treatment of Deaf People Not So
Uncommon
 &HT;      (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) 
 &HT;     By JAMES PINKERTON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ The sheriff's deputies in Victoria still
maintain they had good reason to arrest Butch Pyle after he
rear-ended another motorist, appeared incoherent and admitted to
taking pills.
</P>
<P>
   But Pyle, 58, insists his real offense was being deaf and not
being able to communicate with the officers who arrested him for
driving while intoxicated as he drove home to the Texas border
after visiting his daughter in the summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Because he could not hear the officer's instructions, Pyle
claims he flunked two sobriety tests and spent three days in jail
when Victoria County jailers would not help him call a lawyer or
his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the guy would be in jail today if it weren't for a
fellow inmate who made a call for him,'' said Alan J. Rich, a New
York City lawyer who was co-counsel in a civil rights case Pyle
brought against the county.
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, a federal jury in Brownsville found that Victoria
County violated Pyle's rights and jurors awarded him $230,000. A
blood sample taken from Pyle showed he had no alcohol in his system
along with a less-than-intoxicating level of pain medication for a
recent shoulder operation. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``It means everything to me,'' said Pyle, a former heavy
equipment operator from the Rio Grande Valley city of La Feria.
Deaf since birth, Pyle has learned to speak and can be understood
without an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means I've helped all the deaf people in the country,'' he
said. ``I feel good now when I wake up in the morning, for the
first time in two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Pyle's courthouse victory, following a landmark settlement by
the Houston Police Department in March over the arrest of two deaf
men, has encouraged advocates for Texas' 1.7 million deaf and hard
of hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Too many routine police encounters, they note, result in arrest
and lengthy jail stays of hearing-impaired people because of a
police officer's failure to communicate or to provide translators
as required by the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say this, but it happens pretty often,'' said David
Myers, executive director for the Texas Commission for the Deaf and
Hard of Hearing in Austin. ``We hear about situations maybe once a
month, but there's probably lots of situations that we don't hear
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who is deaf, explained through an interpreter an incident
a year ago in northeast Texas where a deaf woman was arrested and
spent six weeks in jail before she was able to communicate with
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``From time to time we get calls from deaf people who are in
jail who have not been provided with an interpreter or any means to
communicate. So it's a big issue,'' said Wendy Wilkerson, director
of the Southwest Disability and Business Technical Assistance
Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Myers was called as a witness in Pyle's trial to rebut the
testimony of defense witness Cmdr. Albert Rodriguez, who heads the
Texas Department of Public Safety training academy in Austin.
Rodriguez testified that under the circumstances, Pyle's arrest for
DWI was proper and the Victoria County sheriff's deputy acted in
good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Pyle testified that he did not ask for an interpreter while he
was in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Pyle had asked us to make a phone call, we would have
done it in a heartbeat,'' said Kevin Cullen, the attorney who
represented Victoria County. ``If he had asked for an interpreter,
we would have brought him one because we have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers told the jury the ADA requires police departments and
other governments to ensure that there is effective communication
with deaf people they encounter. The law requires governments to
have a written ADA policy, to designate an ADA coordinator and to
ensure that the hearing-impaired can communicate with officers,
either through writing materials or qualified interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez told the court that the basic training required for
all peace officers provides limited instruction for interacting
with the hearing-impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said they teach them basic methods of identifying persons
with hearing loss, but they don't go into specifics of how to
ensure effective communication,'' Rich said. ``Things like making
sure your lips are easily visible, not turning away from a person
who needs to read your lips.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich contends police training of this type is vital ``so that
Butch (Pyle) and all the other (hearing-impaired) people across
Texas are not automatically going to go to jail simply because some
of their symptoms _ whether it's their speech or balance _ may be
similar to people who are actually intoxicated.''
</P>
<P>
   In the July 17, 1998, videotape of Pyle's field sobriety tests
shown to the jury, it is obvious Pyle could not hear the rapid-fire
questions and instructions from Victoria County Sheriff's Deputy
Anthony Daniels. Several times, Pyle placed his hand next to his
ear to indicate he could not hear, or he attempted to approach the
deputy so he could read his lips.
</P>
<P>
   Pyle's jury verdict is the latest in a growing effort by deaf
and hearing-impaired people _ along with the U.S. Department of
Justice and private attorneys _ to force police departments, jails,
prisons and even courts to afford them a level playing field in the
criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are, 10 years into the ADA, and deaf people are
getting service, they're starting to feel empowered, and they're
starting to demand their civil rights,'' said Deborah Gunter, owner
of Sign Shares, a Houston communication access company that
provides sign language interpreters.

TWO MEETING HOUSES, BUT WHAT A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BOB RAY SANDERS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It's a long way from the 1,000-seat Arch Street
Meeting House, a half block from where Betsy Ross sewed the first
Stars and Stripes in 1777, to the 22,000-seat First Union Center
across town.
</P>
<P>
   Not in distance. But in time. And purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting house was built in 1804 by the Religious Society of
Friends (or Quakers). It sits on property that Pennsylvania founder
William Penn had set aside about a hundred years earlier as a
burial ground for members.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20,000 people are interred there, many of them having
died from a series of yellow fever epidemics in the late 18th
century.
</P>
<P>
   It's hallowed ground.
</P>
<P>
   The First Union Center is home to the Philadelphia 76ers
basketball team, the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team, other
big-time sports and entertainment events and, for this week only,
the Republican National Convention. The $210 million arena has 126
private suites and 14 club boxes.
</P>
<P>
   It's something to see, but there's nothing holy about it.
</P>
<P>
   How I wish the people gathered at First Union Center could learn
something from the folks who still assemble at the nearly
200-year-old Arch Street Meeting House. After all, Republicans came
back to Philadelphia _ their very first convention was held here in
1856 _ to remember, reflect and reportedly to reaffirm some of the
ideas and principles of the Founding Fathers and mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Sudofsky, a receptionist and tour guide at the meeting
house, proudly and reverently told a curious North Texas visitor
about her meeting there last week.
</P>
<P>
   She explained that although the weekly, monthly and annual
meetings at the house are scheduled, they are not planned,
conducted or otherwise orchestrated. In fact, most of the worship
``service'' (for lack of a better word) is held in absolute
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my meeting a week ago, we started in silence,'' she said in
a tone just above a whisper. ``We were silent for almost 15 minutes
when this melifluous voice sang the first verse of ``Amazing
Grace.'' There was another 10 minutes of silence, and then six- or
seven-minute messages, all building on this idea of God's glory.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused, then continued: ``Some more silence, and then this
equally beautiful voice sang the last verse of ``Amazing Grace''
and tied it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the crowd of 100 had appointed the speakers or
singers, she told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it completely spontaneously,'' she said. ``We felt a
closeness to God, and a closeness to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole meeting was unprogrammed.''
</P>
<P>
   Unprogrammed?
</P>
<P>
   There is no way the thousands of folks meeting at First Union
Center this week could go ``unprogrammed.'' Even the ``surprises''
have been carefully planned.
</P>
<P>
   Everything has been timed, rehearsed and evaluated for its
effectiveness before a national audience. There is no room for
spontaneity. Even the thousands of red, white and blue balloons are
netted in place high above the convention floor waiting for their
precise cue to float down to the screaming crowd after Gov. George
W. Bush makes his acceptance speech as the Republican nominee for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Before I left the house, Sudofsky proudly told me about how the
Quakers had treated the Indians, and their slaves (before slavery
was banned by the group in 1776), and the part the Friends played
in the Underground Railroad to help liberate blacks. She spoke of
how they had welcomed other religious groups, even those that had
been abusive to Quakers in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were inclusive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what the Republican are trying to be here: inclusive.
The Republican National Committee even dedicated a giant mural last
weekend to the people of Philadelphia, honoring Harriet Tubman and
those brave men and women who operated the Underground Railroad. It
towers above Chestnut Street, and it is magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   It was a very nice gesture by the GOP. But, of course, it had
been programmed.

FAMILIAR FACES HELP CHENEY EASE INTO HIS ROLE AS A CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Dick Cheney kept it short, sweet and subdued for
a second day Monday in what is becoming his hallmark at the
Republican Party's national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, the GOP's choice for vice president, met with the
delegation from Wyoming, which he represented in the House of
Representatives for 10 years, at a private breakfast Monday, then
won cheers from delegates when he and his wife, Lynne, entered the
First Union Center to attend about an hour of the opening events.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a former secretary of defense, spent most of the day
holed up in his hotel working on the speech he was scheduled to
give on Wednesday night. Aides said he was writing it himself, but
would not discuss the themes.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview with CNN on the convention floor, Cheney
defended his conservative voting record in Congress, which had been
criticized repeatedly by Vice President Al Gore's campaign in the
last week. ``I don't think it has much impact,'' said Cheney, who
appeared on several Sunday morning news programs to counter
Democratic charges that his votes against the Head Start education
program, a ban on armor-piercing bullets and some environmental
protection measures were the mark of an extremist.
</P>
<P>
   The partisan barbs failed to matter to delegates here, who are
more conservative than most registered Republicans. ``I'm not going
to say I agree with 100 percent of his positions, but overall I'm
impressed with Cheney and his experience,'' said Beth Welbers, 41,
a delegate from Spring Valley, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney is breaking in slowly in this national campaign. Old
friends and political allies from Wyoming provided support at his
opening rally on Sunday, and the Wyoming delegates' breakfast
Monday morning was aboard ceremonial railcars of the Union Pacific,
for which he was a director until his selection as Bush's running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here in Philadelphia now, and we have a tremendous
opportunity,'' Cheney told the cheering delegation. ``We've been to
seven or eight conventions now, and I've never seen such a united
party.''
</P>
<P>
   The railroad setting evoked strong memories for Cheney. Cheney
recalled that while growing up in Nebraska, he spent vacations with
his grandfather, a Union Pacific cook who lived on a railcar that
followed the work crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a kid, 7 or 8 years old,'' Cheney said, ``there
was nothing more romantic in those days than living in a railroad
car.''

   BROWNSVILLE: language interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   Gunter said government leaders need to realize that making
accommodations that allow deaf people to function more
independently is cheaper in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``If deaf people are dependent on others, it costs society,''
she said. ``If they can take care of their own business, the cost
is much lower and it brings a better quality of life. It's not a
matter of being expensive, it's a matter of putting it into the
budget.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Justice Department announced it reached what it
considered a model settlement with the Houston Police Department
over complaints by two deaf men taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   The first was brought by Michael Joseph Edwards, a deaf man who,
because of a neurological condition, has a balance problem. Edwards
failed a field sobriety test, was arrested for public intoxication
and placed in jail where jailers ignored his request to arrange for
his medication. Edwards was brought before a municipal judge
several times without an interpreter, even though he had requested
one in writing.
</P>
<P>
   The second case was brought by Rashid Jade Gordon, a 19-year-old
man arrested on sexual assault charges and held in jail for 14 days
before he was provided an interpreter, said William Jonson, an
attorney with the federally funded Advocacy Inc., which represented
both men.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of the Gordon case, the city now has a contract
with an interpreter service and will provide an interpreter, or at
least they claim they will, if asked,'' Jonson said.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the Justice Department settlement, the Houston
Police Department, jail division and municipal court will adopt
written policies for the hearing impaired, designate ADA
coordinators and provide qualified interpreters. Houston police
must call an interpreter when a deaf person is arrested, tested for
sobriety, involved in a major accident, suspected of a felony or
asked to give a statement in a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Chamatz, director of the National Association of the Deaf's
Law Center which assisted in the Houston cases, said Pyle's
$230,000 verdict should ``signal that there's been a serious
problem'' in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, with the two settlements in Houston and this large
jury verdict, the signal will be sent to police departments across
the state that they need to come into compliance with the ADA,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Pyle's legal attack of his arrest two years ago is far
from over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to appeal and we're convinced the 5th Circuit will
reverse the case,'' said Cullen, referring to the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Pyle, who refused to eat during the three days he spent in jail,
said he began to fear he might never be able to contact someone who
could help him get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst feeling you can ever have,'' he said.

   EDLIFE-CATHOLIC-SCHOOLS (Undated) _ Nearly 10 years after many
educators had written them off for dead, Roman Catholic schools in
America are in the midst of an extraordinary revival. Enrollment is
up across the nation. Hundreds of new schools have opened. And more
than 40 percent of all Catholic elementary and secondary schools
have waiting lists for admission. By Timothy Egan.

   EDLIFE-RURAL-SCHOOLS (Bloomfield, Mont.) _ Even as the number of
tiny rural schools has plunged in recent years, the fundamental
aspects of teaching and learning inside them _ from multi-age
classrooms and peer tutoring, to interdisciplinary projects and
keeping students with the same teacher for more than one year _ are
being copied in large school systems across the country. Small
classes and, especially, small schools, are increasingly seen as
crucial to students' success in the early grades, leading many
urban educators to create islands within large school buildings
that attempt to foster the intimacy and individual attention of
places like Bloomfield. And, with the Internet, long-held concerns
about the narrow curriculum available in an isolated one-teacher
school are fading. By Jodi Wilgoren.

<P>
   EDLIFE-MOZART-THEORY (Undated) _ Never mind that Mozart's
concertos strike peaceful chords in music lovers. In academia, the
battle lines are drawn, and the next salvo in the Mozart wars is
about to be fired. Researchers are mustering data to counter those
who are intent on debunking the ``Mozart effect'' _ the theory that
classical music makes the brain work better _ and they have some
high-profile allies. By Roberta Hershenson.

<P>
   EDLIFE-NEWZEALAND (Wellington) _ For the last 10 years New
Zealand has provided a laboratory for many of the educational
theories that have become increasingly popular among would-be
reformers in the United States in recent years, most notably
charter schools and vouchers. Yet when Trevor Mallard became New
Zealand's minister of education several months ago, one of his
first steps was to bolster direct government assistance to troubled
urban schools. Although the programs he announced were hardly
unusual _ more money for early-childhood education, clustering of
schools with common problems, a bigger national investment in
teacher training _ they were notable far beyond this island nation.
The reason: They signaled the end of a decade-long flirtation with
the notion that parental choice and competition among schools
would, in and of themselves, improve the educational offerings of
troubled urban schools. By Edward B. Fiske and Helen F. Ladd.
</P>
<P>
   EDLIFE-CYBERSPACE-COLLEGES (Undated) _ Universe Online is one of
the many so-called distance-learning programs hovering in
cyberspace. According to reports from the U.S. Department of
Education, at least one-third of the 3,500 colleges and
universities in the United States offer distance-learning courses;
within the next two years, four out of every five are expected to
do so. By Abby Ellin.
</P>
<P>
   EDLIFE-ADAPTIVE-TESTING (Undated) _ With virtually everything
becoming electronic and digital, it may be no surprise to discover
that the hum of hard drives has replaced the scent of freshly
sharpened pencils for students taking many of today's standardized
admissions tests. But here is the catch: Most computerized tests
are not merely onscreen versions of what appears in paper
workbooks. Rather than simply scanning in copies of multiple choice
examinations, some test makers have prepared adaptive tests,
meaning that they are designed to adapt, on the fly, to the ability
of the person taking the test. By Lisa Guernsey.
</P>
<P>
   EDLIFE-FRESHMEN-STRESS (Undated) _ While some first-year college
students experience little or no anxiety, most have a stress story,
be it academic or personal, about family or financial
responsibilities, inadequate high school preparation or pressure to
do well in today's increasingly competitive environment. In a 1999
survey of 683 colleges and universities conducted in the first days
of school by UCLA, 30.2 percent of freshmen acknowledged that they
frequently felt overwhelmed, almost double the rate in 1985. By
Glenn C. Altschuler.

FOR INDUSTRY, BUYING ENERGY HAS BECOME A COMPLEX COST-CUTTING

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last summer, an accident at a local utility curtailed power to
Owens Corning's Kansas City, Kan., plant, sending it scrambling to
find alternative energy. It was a costly, nerve-racking experience.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the company has signed a 10-year contract with Enron
Energy Services to buy electricity for its 20 largest U.S. plants,
and has hired a sales manager from a Belgian utility to handle its
electricity purchases in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Enron unit will negotiate the contracts and pay all the
bills. But Owens Corning, a fiberglass maker whose annual
electricity tab tops $200 million, has also hired three energy
specialists to help manage risk, reduce consumption and keep
abreast of technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enron may be driving the car, but we're still in the front
seat,'' said Charles E. Dana, vice president for global sourcing
operations.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, not so long ago, when buying electricity was a
simple matter. The local utility was the only game in town, the
state set the rates, there was little to do but sign on the dotted
line.
</P>
<P>
   These days, not only are there myriad utilities and upstart
energy companies to choose from, but countless permutations of ways
to contract for electricity, including buying it on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Different suppliers produce the electricity, transmit it and
deliver it. Futures contracts, derivatives and negotiated rate caps
all offer ways to hedge against wild swings in usage, fuel costs _
a particularly germane consideration nowadays _ or other reasons
for rates that soar and dip and soar again.
</P>
<P>
   Today's energy buyers must know how to predict weather and
economic fluctuations as well as how to drive hard bargains. They
must know how to find suppliers who will give them a cheaper rate
if they switch some of their usage from peak to night or other
off-peak times _ and then, how to skew energy usage so that it can
make more use of that cheaper energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer the buying of the commodity that's important,''
said Carol H. Guthrie, group manager for Chevron U.S.A.'s
electricity supply group. ``It's gathering all the information that
allows you to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, from metal smelters to property managers, from
manufacturers to telecommunications companies, all kinds of
companies are rethinking not only how they buy that critical
electricity, but who is doing that buying, how much they are paid,
even whom they report to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying energy knowledge is a requirement for all jobs
these days,'' said Robert H. Welsh, a senior partner at the
executive recruiting firm Heidrick &AMP; Struggles International, ``but
if a candidate for chief technology officer also has energy
experience, the client nods happily.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many companies are pulling chief financial officers and
chief technology officers into energy buying. Others are retraining
and promoting engineers, accountants or particularly talented
buyers. Still others are scouring the regulatory community, the
utilities, even Wall Street for energy-savvy people. And many are
letting consultants seek out suppliers, negotiate contracts, even
survey the company for ways to cut usage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying and selling energy has become a real financial play,
and it needs someone with sophisticated knowledge of finance and
energy both,'' said Bruce W. Peterson, a managing director at the
executive recruiting firm Korn/Ferry International, who is
searching for just such a person for a client.
</P>
<P>
   Such people do not come cheap. Doron Cohen, an energy specialist
at the research firm Gartner, knows a vice president at a metals
company who quit in a rage when he discovered that younger, newly
hired energy buyers made more than he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who'll work for $60,000 doesn't have the knowledge
you need, and you can't attract commodities traders unless bonuses
and such give them a shot at making $1 million a year,'' Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   The competition, and the inflated pay rates, promises to worsen.
Utilities, now that they increasingly are allowed to sell
electricity in areas with wildly fluctuating climates and usages,
are hiring traders to help lock in margins between the price of
natural gas they buy and the possible prices of power they might
sell.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Enron Energy Services, which handle purchases for
many clients and thus can more easily justify paying top dollar,
have bid the price for the most experienced traders and energy
specialists through the roof, offering packages of salary, bonus
and equity that can hit $1.5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying energy these days is all about managing risk and income
statements,'' said Harold G. Buchanan, a managing director at
Enron. ``We're more like an investment bank than a utility.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, for corporations, is sticker shock. ``The biggest
challenge was to create that cultural shift in the client's mind,
away from a $60,000 procurement guy to a $200,000 Wall Street
professional who can hedge and contain costs and minimize risk,''
said Richard J. Preng, managing director of the recruiting firm
Spencer Stuart's global energy practice, who recently placed an
energy supply chief at a metals company, for a pay package ``north
of $300,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the answer for many companies is to pay
consultants, not staff members. Corning, the optical cable
supplier, used to have four energy buyers; it now has one, whose
main job is to be a liaison with a subsidiary of Amerada Hess,
which has taken over the company's energy programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outsourcing lets us focus on the high-level management of
energy,'' said Ernest J. Williams, Corning's director of
procurement operations.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller Group International, which owns several office
buildings and industrial parks, saved $500,000 on electricity bills
for two New York City skyscrapers when it hired John Flood, an
energy consultant, to evaluate energy bids. Similarly, Rockefeller
Group's Cushman &AMP; Wakefield subsidiary now lets M.C. Energy
negotiate its electricity contracts at the dozens of buildings it
manages. Frank A. Freda, a Cushman senior managing director,
estimates that M.C. Energy has shaved $2.6 million off Cushman's
energy tab in New York City; he is now using the firm in other
states.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous Web has given rise to yet another form of
third-party energy buyer: the auctioneer. The Public Service
Enterprise Group's Energy Technologies unit, an energy consultant
in Edison, N.J., just teamed up with Enermetrix.com, a Web
start-up, to run Internet auctions in which Public Service clients
post total energy requirements, and energy suppliers bid to fill
them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, corporate clients keep a close watch on the results.
``The energy buyers are looking at the bids, and I imagine that
higher-level people are giving the final OK on the offers,'' said
Frederick W. Lark, a vice president of Public Service.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, energy is increasingly becoming an executive suite
topic. KeySpan Energy's KeySpan Business Solutions unit, which
designs and builds energy systems, counts among its clients a large
shopping mall developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to let local construction managers write contracts
with local utilities,'' said Anthony Sartor, Keyspan's president.
``Now they have an energy engineer who works with their CFO to
evaluate bids and finance the energy systems.''
</P>
<P>
   For commercial companies, reducing energy costs is a nicety. For
manufacturers, whose energy tabs go into the multimillions, it is a
necessity. Increasingly, such companies are recognizing that
scrimping on energy expertise is penny-wise and pound-foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman-LaRoche, a unit of Roche Holding, the drug giant based
in Nutley, N.J., recently piggybacked onto an energy contract the
New Jersey Chemical Industry Council had negotiated with Allegheny
Energy, an independent supplier, for its members. But Hoffman,
unlike many companies on the contract, generates some of its own
power. So John Parodi, a former utility executive who became
Hoffman's senior energy manager three years ago, negotiated extra
clauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed the provider to supply energy beyond what we
generated ourselves, but also to cover us if our generators go
down,'' Parodi said. He is now scouting out energy suppliers for
Hoffman-LaRoche plants in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Even companies that have had energy experts for years are taking
a fresh look at them.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining Chevron U.S.A. in 1994, Guthrie has reported first
to the vice president in charge of refining operations, then to the
vice president of a natural gas unit _ ``there was a perceived
synergy in deregulatory processes,'' she explained _ and then again
to a refining executive.
</P>
<P>
   In January, her group's name was changed from energy services to
electricity supply, and Guthrie and her four subordinates report to
the head of procurement. One goal is to whittle the number of
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chevron has more than 130 electricity suppliers, and we want
to look at procurement strategies that can span regions and
products,'' Guthrie explained. Last week, Chevron announced that it
had started Chevron Energy Services, a unit aimed at helping
clients control their total energy costs as well.
</P>
<P>
   At Honeywell International, which spends upwards of $300 million
a year on electricity, buyers are broadening their definition of
energy. Honeywell's five specialists _ four of them added to staff
in the last four years _ have worked out contracts with suppliers
of industrial gases in which the suppliers set up shop at a
Honeywell plant and use some of its waste heat, steam and other
sources of energy that might have been vented to the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hydrogen and oxygen are really water and a lot of
electricity,'' said William L. Ramsey, Honeywell's vice president
for the supply chain. ``So it makes sense to work with industrial
gas suppliers as though they were power generators.''
</P>
<P>
   As deregulation continues its slow creep from state to state,
corporate energy czars are rising to prominence at companies that
do not have energy-intensive manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago Bell Atlantic _ which merged with GTE in June,
and is now Verizon Communications _ hired Jeremy Metz, a lawyer
specializing in energy and environment, to head its energy
procurement.
</P>
<P>
   Metz, using his regulatory know-how, has already saved the
company millions by getting it included in every pilot program for
deregulating energy in New Jersey, New York, New Hampshire and
Pennsylvania. And last year he hired another full-time buyer,
someone with 20 years experience buying generation equipment.
``I've got the legal and regulatory experience,'' Metz said. ``He
understands the nuts and bolts of the energy world.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has pulled in operating people, too. Last year it
formed Team Energy _ 12 people pulled from various operating groups
and charged with looking for ways to economize on energy use. It
has hired outside auditors to look for even more efficiencies. And
it has put a link on its Web site that facilities managers can use
to monitor their electric bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of my job was convincing the people who run our
data centers or network operations that some newfangled power
supplier is going to be reliable,'' Metz said. ``Now they're
convinced, and they're ready to look for other opportunities to
improve the way we use energy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Particle discoveries, like home runs in baseball, get all the
attention from casual fans of physics. The arrival of a new
particle is exciting, important and easy to understand. But while
physicists appreciate the Ruthian impact of discovering a new
elementary particle like the top quark or the recent finding of the
tau neutrino, they know that there is a less heralded realm of
discovery that can do every bit as much to change the course of
science. That realm involves laws of symmetry _ how nature obeys
them, and especially how it breaks them.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists' most hallowed theories of the structure of matter
are based on the interplay of symmetries as revealed by the ways
particles move, interact and decay. For example, the orbits of an
electron in a hydrogen atom depend profoundly on the symmetry, or
invariance, of the force on the electron no matter how the atomic
nucleus is rotated. As in planetary systems, the force depends only
on the distance between the electron and the nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   Measurements of those subtleties can severely test the accuracy
of the theories and reveal their shortcomings. In baseball
language, symmetries are the pitching and defense of particle
physics.
</P>
<P>
   The mysteries of symmetry and asymmetry extend to the cosmos,
too. Scientists have not quite figured out why nearly all the
universe they have observed is made of ordinary matter. If the laws
of particle physics were exactly the same for every particle and
its antimatter partner _ one kind of symmetry _ then the Big Bang
explosion in which the universe is believed to have been born would
have created equal amounts of matter and antimatter, which would
then have annihilated each other, and the universe would be empty.
</P>
<P>
   Announcements Monday by two large, multinational experimental
teams at the 30th International Conference on High Energy Physics
in Osaka, Japan, herald a new round of research to determine the
exact degree of nature's lopsidedness, and what consequences it may
have for the observable universe.
</P>
<P>
   One of the teams is based at the High Energy Accelerator
Research Organization in Tsukuba, Japan, known as the KEK
laboratory for its Japanese acronym. ``It's not just the discovery
of a new particle which is important for particle physics and
cosmology,'' said Hirotaka Sugawara, director general of KEK.
``Symmetry is something we have to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of this concern are extremely difficult experiments
that observe particles and their antimatter counterparts directly,
in search of slight differences in things like their decay rates
and the particles they decay into. Physicists have known since 1964
that small differences exist, but they have not found a way to
measure just how large the differences are.
</P>
<P>
   Without that quantitative knowledge, physicists have been unable
to determine whether asymmetry is correctly predicted by their
Standard Model of particle physics, the theory that describes all
existing data on the structure and behavior of matter. Any gap
between the predictions and observations would mean that the theory
is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   And if the measured asymmetry turns out to be too small, said
Zoltan Ligeti, a physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory near Chicago, the impact on scientists' understanding of
the cosmos could be serious. ``We would be at a complete loss, and
we would have to say we don't know a conceivable way to produce
more matter than antimatter,'' Ligeti said.
</P>
<P>
   But help in answering those questions is on the way, according
to the simultaneous announcements Monday in Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   The teams, one based at KEK and one at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center in California, announced that they had each
succeeded in producing millions of well-known, if somewhat obscure,
particles called B mesons along with their antimatter counterparts.
Scientists at these ``B factories'' plan to compare the decay rates
of B's and anti-B's with a precision that has never before been
possible. The comparison should provide a new measuring stick of
one of nature's most basic symmetries _ or asymmetries.
</P>
<P>
   The results are still so sketchy, and the experiments so
demanding, that neither team is ready to claim definitively that it
has seen the asymmetry, which goes by the name of charge-parity
violation, or CP violation. But as more data streams in, the early
results do show hints of the expected signature of CP violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results are very preliminary, and they don't turn the
world of science on their ear,'' said David Hitlin, a physicist at
the California Institute of Technology and a spokesman for
Stanford's BaBar experiment, a play on ``B-bar,'' as anti-B mesons
are often called, and the children's book elephant.
</P>
<P>
   While the results do show hints of CP violation, its observed
strength falls slightly below the predictions of the Standard
Model. Cosmologists already find it difficult to reconcile the
observed asymmetry of matter and antimatter with the amount of CP
violation predicted by the Standard Model, so the conflict would
throw a big curve at theorists _ just what experimentalists love to
do.
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   If the finding holds up as more data comes in, Hitlin said,
``that would be something that would be very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, the experimentalists will have to agree with each
other. Sugawara said the KEK experiment, nicknamed Belle, had found
a larger value that was in agreement with the Standard Model. With
somewhat less data so far than BaBar, Belle's error bars were also
large, so that the two results could not be said to be in conflict.
An earlier experiment at Fermilab found a still larger value, near
the upper end of the predictions, though once again the
uncertainties were substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Prebys, a physicist at Princeton University who is a
collaborator on Belle, said, ``Everything at the moment is
consistent with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The measurements are demanding enough that physicists are not
likely to accept any startling conclusions until the numbers are
much more refined and the experiments agree, Prebys said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the scientific industry of sorts that has grown
around CP violation did begin with a completely unexpected
discovery in 1964. Before that experiment, which won a Nobel Prize
for James Cronin and Val Fitch in 1980, scientists were sure that
the laws of physics exactly obeyed what is called CP invariance.
</P>
<P>
   Checking for CP invariance involves the following imaginary
process: First, take all particles and reverse their charge (the
``C'' part) from positive to negative or vice versa. Then change
particles with left-handed ``spins'' to being right-handed (the
``P'' part) and vice versa. If the particles behave the same in
this new world as they did in the old, then the laws of physics are
CP invariant.
</P>
<P>
   Since the CP operation changes any particle into its
antiparticle, CP invariance would mean that physical laws are
exactly the same for matter and antimatter.
</P>
<P>
   Cronin, of the University of Chicago, and Fitch, of Princeton,
threw a monkey wrench into that symmetric worldview when they found
that particles called kaons sometimes decayed in a way that
violated this rule. Two Japanese theorists, Makoto Kobayashi and
Toshihide Maskawa, later showed how the Standard Model could be
modified to accommodate this result. But even though the change
should cause CP violation in other particles, experimentalists have
still not unambiguously detected it in anything but kaons.
</P>
<P>
   To make things worse, said Ligeti of Fermilab, theorists find it
problematical, for technical reasons, to compare the kaon results
in a very precise or direct way to the asymmetry that the theorists
put at the heart of the Standard Model. The violation is thought to
be related to something called the weak nuclear force, but effects
of another interaction called the strong force confuse matters in
kaons.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are after is trying to test whether the Standard Model
is right or wrong,'' Ligeti said. But in order to make a precise
test with kaons, he said, ``we have to compute quantities which we
don't quite know how to compute.''
</P>
<P>
   The predicted effect is both simpler to interpret and larger in
magnitude in B mesons, said Fumihiko Takasaki, a KEK physicist who
is a spokesman for the Belle collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   So both collaborations aimed to create pairs of B mesons and
anti-B mesons by smashing together electrons and their own
antimatter counterparts, positrons, in particle accelerators. The
electrons and positrons are accelerated to high energy in a linear
accelerator and then injected into a ring, where they circulate in
opposite directions and smash together, said Riccardo Faccini, a
BaBar collaborator at the Stanford accelerator center.
</P>
<P>
   In an experimental twist, the electrons and positrons are
injected at slightly different energies so that the B mesons, when
they are created, drift steadily in one direction at about half the
speed of light rather than remaining stationary. The drift amounts
to a clever way to measure time as a meson, and then its
antiparticle, decay in a spray of particles. By allowing
researchers to trace this spray of particle tracks back to their
source, the high-resolution detectors _ called, unsurprisingly,
Belle and BaBar _ pinpoint the spot at which the decays take place.
</P>
<P>
   Since the B mesons are drifting, the distance they have traveled
gives a measure of the time at which the decays took place. By
comparing the detailed time dependence of B meson decays and anti-B
meson decays, physicists can search for evidence of an asymmetry
that indicates CP violation has taken place.
</P>
<P>
   So far, of 10 million B mesons produced in BaBar, 120 have been
of the specific type that allows the team to look for CP violation,
leading to their preliminary results. Belle still has fewer events,
but both teams are collecting large amounts of data in preparation
for an all-out assault on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science of CP violation in the B physics system is born,''
said Christopher Hill, a physicist at Fermilab.

BARAK BARELY SURVIVES NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE; HIS CHOICE FOR PRESIDENT
IS REJECTED

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak survived a
parliamentary no-confidence vote Monday mounted by opponents of his
peace efforts, but his heavily-favored candidate for Israel's
president, Shimon Peres, suffered a stunning defeat in the twilight
of a long career.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Parliament chose Moshe Katsav, a little-known
Iranian-born lawmaker of the opposition Likud Party who began his
political career as mayor of a small working-class desert town.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, the hawkish, hard-line Likud leader was, as
expected, unable to muster the 61-seat absolute majority in the 120
seat Knesset, or Parliament, that was needed to topple the
government. With Parliament scheduled to adjourn on Wednesday for
its three-month vacation, the hard-pressed Barak now has a period
to try to rebuild his tattered coalition and push for some form of
resumption of the peace talks that stalled at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   The vote seemed almost anticlimactic. It came after three hours
of heated debate _ relatively short by Knesset standards _ with
speakers interrupted by rowdy, hand-waving shouts and insults from
the floor. The votes cast were exactly 50 to 50, with 8 abstentions
and 12 members withdrawing, casting no votes.
</P>
<P>
   But it was far from a victory for Barak, who now must piece
together a coalition in the fragmented Parliament from small
parties _ religious, secular, nationalist, liberal and others _
whose interests are often at sharp odds. Indeed, the vote suggested
that many members simply wanted to avoid calling new elections for
fear they would lose their seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that is sustaining the prime minister is that
the Knesset members do not want, at this time, to go to elections
within 90 days,'' said Israel radio's chief political analyst,
Yaron Dekel. He added that Peres' defeat was ``a severe blow that
can start a snowball effect that can lead to the downfall of his
government _ this is a prime minister without a government.''
</P>
<P>
   In an analysis a few hours later on Israeli television, after
the no-confidence vote, Dekel said, ``This is the worst day for
Barak since he was elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the political drama Monday centered on the vote for the
largely honorary office of president. Peres, dressed in an elegant
dark suit and blue polka-dot tie, wandered around the Parliament
chamber, ashen-faced, when it became clear that he would lose.
</P>
<P>
   Peres, twice prime minister and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize,
lost to an earnest, but colorless politician who had once been
known as the ``tolerant and polite'' member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The blow was all the more shocking because every pundit in this
intensely political country had called Peres a shoo-in. ``Peres
Poised to Win Presidency,'' was the main headline in the Jerusalem
Post, while in Haaretz it was ``Peres confident of capturing
Presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But when the envelopes in the secret ballot were opened in the
first round of voting at midday, Katsov had 60 votes _ one short of
victory _ while Peres had 53. Three ballots were blank.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and his One Israel floor leaders huddled, worried and
baffled. Sharon's Likud supporters and the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic
members of Shas grinned hugely and, as the final vote showed Katsov
with 63 votes, hugged and cried.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big win for Sharon, the first time the candidate
sponsored by Likud was elected president. The election of Katsav
was also seen as a product of the increasing challenge by Sephardic
Jews _ largely of Middle eastern origin _ to the traditional
Ashkenazi European elite.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a long political career, the silver-haired Peres had
also made enemies. It appeared that about five members of his own
party voted against him in the secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had to attend Monday's session and listen to the scorn
heaped on him _ prime ministers do not normally respond in person
to a no-confidence motion _ because Likud's Limor Livnat had taken
the unusual step of getting 40 members' signatures requiring
Barak's presence.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate, Livnat, one of Likud's most forceful orators,
shouted accusations at the prime minister, accusing him of making
major concessions, then, ``you write a letter to Clinton stating
that suddenly it has become clear to you that the Palestinians are
not partners to the talks and they are not negotiating in good
faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this we should say `good morning, Elijah.' Finally you
have discovered what we have known for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Barak sat through the lecture, making a few notes, with his
usual half-smile.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon led off the Likud attack, accusing Barak of broken
promises.
</P>
<P>
   Barak responded by mounting the podium and saying: ``I appeal to
each and every one of you and ask you to rise above petty
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited President Clinton's appearance on Israeli television
Friday, with its hints of moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem
_ a sought-after dream here and a reversal of 50 years of American
policy. ``We strengthened Israel's international standing,'' he
said. ``We removed it from international isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Barak's political problem is a 1996 change in
electoral procedures providing for separate voting for prime
minister and members of Parliament. Although Barak won a strong
mandate in May 1999, defeating Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud with 56
percent of the vote, Barak has had to deal with a fragmented,
unwieldy Parliament with many small parties.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh, an old comrade of Barak's
from the country's most elite secret commando unit and also a
former general, called in frustration Monday for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, in the current political makeup of the Knesset, we could
not bring about the election of Peres, it is a sign that we will be
unable to pass other things,'' Sneh said on Israel radio.
``Therefore we must go directly to the nation, to present our path,
so that the nation can decide what it wants.''

<P>
   It was a spectacle that fused the historic with the mundane.
There was Ehud Barak, the military commander renowned for his
fastidious planning of operations, absorbing the stunning defeat of
his candidate for president of Israel, Nobel Peace Prize laureate
Shimon Peres, and then barely surviving two parliamentary
no-confidence votes just days after he had failed to strike a
historic accord with the Palestinians at Camp David. Barak the
meticulous strategist was compelled to practice the imprecise art
of muddling through.
</P>
<P>
   Since the onset of the democratic era, such spectacles have been
common. Israel's political maelstrom is merely more colorful than
other democracies, more akin to what literary critics call magic
realism. On the eve of the vote for Israel's president, the
spiritual leader of the Shas party, a rabbi in his 90s, said he had
a dream that Peres's opponent was favored by the heavens.
Consequently, all 17 members of the Knesset from Shas voted for the
candidate from the Likud party, Moshe Katsav.
</P>
<P>
   So common to democracies is the problem confronted by Barak that
the Germans have a formulaic phrase for it. They call it the
primacy of domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the undemocratic Yasser Arafat would be wise to do
what he can to assist Barak in muddling through his domestic
difficulties. The same holds true for those monarchs and
presidents- for-life who rule surrounding Arab states and share an
interest in seizing the present opportunity to foster a durable
peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   It is now up to Barak to form a governing coalition that can
pursue peace during the coming three months, when the Knesset is
not in session. He has said he is confident a majority of Israelis
will support any deal he negotiates with Arafat, reasoning that
Israelis know he does not require instruction on the nation's
security needs.
</P>
<P>
   If Barak does create a coalition conducive to the compromises
needed for peace, Arafat will have to do his part _ while Israel
still has a government willing to seek a realistic solution to the
problem of peaceful coexistence for Israelis and Palestinians.

SHORTCHANGING YOUNG MDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the biggest health problems in the United States is the
lack of access to care faced by residents of rural areas and inner
cities. To get more doctors to work in such underserved parts of
the country, the federal government for over a decade has been
offering bonuses to help cover the tuition loans of graduating
medical students willing to put up with the relatively low pay of
work at a rural or urban community health center.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the law authorizing the grants expires Sept. 30,
with no reauthorization in sight. Even worse, The New York Times
reported Sunday, the $30 million program has been so underfunded
recently that many doctors have not been getting what was promised
them. This is a dismaying situation that both Congress and the
Clinton administration should address immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics on the availability of doctors in varying parts of
the country or even a city make clear the need for such recruiting
inducements for graduating medical students who, on average, are
leaving school with more than $90,000 in tuition debt. While
managed care programs recommend a ratio of 218 doctors for 100,000
patients, many of the country's health centers are in isolated
areas where there are fewer than 35 doctors for that population.
</P>
<P>
   Funds are especially short this year for the medical education
grants because the Department of Health and Human Services cut back
sharply on them to meet other spending requirements. The health
centers themselves are in no position to make up the difference
because they are being squeezed by inadequate reimbursements for
their Medicaid and Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   Two steps are needed. Congress should act quickly to reauthorize
the 1989 law setting up the grants program, and the Clinton
administration and Congress should make sure that a modest $4
million increase in program funding in the House version of the
budget makes it into the spending document's final version. After
years of calling on college graduates to make good on their college
loans, it is unconscionable now for Washington to walk away from
its own commitments.

A-BOMBS, SPACE CHICKENS AND GOD: A CONVERSATION WITH FREEMAN J.
DYSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (Science Times) 
 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the small world of literary science writing, there are few
authors as prolific and original as Dr. Freeman J. Dyson, 76, the
British-born theoretical physicist, astrophysicist and author of
books on scientific matters.
</P>
<P>
   Like Stephen Jay Gould and the late Carl Sagan, Dyson is a
highly credentialed scientist: He has been a professor of physics
at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., for 47
years. He enjoys a huge readership, with seven books, including his
meditation on new technologies, ``The Sun, the Genome and the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his marks as a writer has been his willingness to engage
in speculative writing that, at times, seems to border on science
fiction. It was Dyson who suggested sending microbes and spores
into space in a kind of colonization effort to make the universe a
``more interesting place.'' And it was he who imagined ``space
chickens,'' high-tech poultry with the genetically engineered
capacity to wing their way through the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson has long used his expertise to investigate how science
affects issues of war and peace. His 1984 best-seller, ``Weapons
and Hope,'' discussed the rationale of nuclear weaponry. It was
partly his work in this area that won him this year's $948,000
Templeton Prize ``for outstanding originality in advancing the
world's understanding of God or spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyson answered questions in his cluttered office several weeks
after receiving the award.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The play ``Copenhagen'' focuses on a real visit Dr. Werner
Heisenberg, the head of the Nazi atomic bomb program, made to the
home of his former mentor, Niels Bohr, in occupied Denmark in
September 1941.
</P>
<P>
   In the play, as in reality, the two men took a walk in the park
and had a conversation that ended in anger. What actually took
place during that stroll is the Rashomon-like puzzle at the heart
of the play. Did Heisenberg try to pick Bohr's brain on scientific
problems? Was he trying to manipulate his former professor into
encouraging the Allies not to build an atomic bomb? Or was he
trying to pass on information, or even disinformation, to the
Allies through Bohr? Freeman Dyson, you knew these men _ what do
you think really happened in Copenhagen?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: I have my own theory, which may, of course, be totally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   I think Heisenberg was trying to get Bohr to agree that the
development of an A-bomb was something that the physicists of the
world should agree to not participate in. Heisenberg was in a
position where he could quietly decide ``this doesn't make sense.''
And Bohr had once been in a strong position, too. But by 1941, it
was much too late. By that time, they were enemies.
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment earlier when something like that might have
had a chance. In January of 1939, there was an international
meeting when fission was first proclaimed and when the idea of
building atomic bombs was in the air. Scientists could have gotten
together then and decided, ``This is something that should not be
done.'' Before the war started, nobody really wanted to create an
A-bomb. What pushed them, of course, was fear, once the war
started.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: After Germany's defeat, Werner Heisenberg hinted he had
deliberately failed to build a nuclear weapon. Do you think that's
true?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: To a great extent, it is. Heisenberg never claimed to have
obstructed anything. But he didn't give the project the kind of
push it needed.
</P>
<P>
   In countries where bombs were made, there always was at least
one scientist who really made a push. Heisenberg was the one who
might have done that in Germany. Of course, his not pushing was
convenient because Hitler wasn't all that interested anyway. If
Hitler had been interested, Heisenberg's position might have been
different.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your latest foray into science policy involves opposition to
the newest version of the Strategic Defense Initiative. What is the
core of your critique?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: I oppose it because the system doesn't work, mostly because
it can be easily outwitted. A very primitive spoofing will take
care of it: just not letting you know where you have to shoot. If
you know where a target is, you can kill it. It's not easy, but in
principle, you can do that. But if you don't know where it is, it's
hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   So all the attacker has to do is to make sure that you don't
know where the target is, and that's rather easy. All he has to do
is hide the missile among a bunch of balloons. That solves the
problem from the point of view of the attacker. It is easy to use
other kinds of decoys as well as balloons.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've long advocated travel to Mars. Have you been
discouraged by the many mishaps NASA's Mars program has suffered?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: No, not at all. I'm a great fan of Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
I think it's wonderful they've begun taking risks. They launched
six space missions in six months, which is absolutely wonderful.
And of course, if you launch at that speed, you take risks and you
risk failure. I thought they ought to be losing one out of three.
If they were running the thing the way I'd like them to, they ought
to lose two or three missions every year probably. To me, that's a
sign that they are doing things right.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are you highly critical of the space shuttle program?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: I see it as a real tragedy. It was supposed to be a
compromise between the requirements of getting stuff into space
cheap and human adventure. But doing that is like trying to design
a railroad where you have passenger and freight traveling on the
same train.
</P>
<P>
   We should have something much more flexible for the humans,
something more like a sports car than a Greyhound bus. It should be
a high performance spacecraft so that the people could actually go
somewhere. You could go to the moon, learn how to live on the moon.
I think it would be good television, as well. It would be popular.
The shuttle is a bore. The shuttle is not going anywhere. It's
stuck in one low orbit and that's all it can do.  &QL;

   ``AMERICAN RHAPSODY''
</P>
<P>
   ByJoe Eszterhas
</P>
<P>
   (Knopf, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   We'll say right upfront that we felt as if we earned our salary
for the next five years as we struggled through this book, a
quagmire of gonzo posturing and other strange liberties to which
Eszterhas believes he's entitled. The former (beginitalic)Rolling
Stone(enditalic) writer, having made his money with screenplays to
such scintillating films as (beginitalic)Showgirls(enditalic) and
(beginitalic)Basic Instinct(enditalic)(beginitalic), (enditalic)
now shows us the real Bill Clinton or, as Eszterhas' friend, Jann
Wenner, called him, ``the first rock and roll president in American
history.'' Eszterhas was mesmerized by the Monica Lewinsky sex
scandal. He devoured the Starr report, watched it on television,
read about it in magazines. Maybe they are his sources for the
garish ``non-fiction'' sections here, but he never really makes
that clear (there are fictional parts too, including a chapter
narrated by ``Willard,'' the most famous part of Clinton's
anatomy). Read this at your own risk. And remember: No one's paying
you to do it.

   ``LOCO FOR LIZARDS''
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Cherry
</P>
<P>
   (Northland, $7.95)
</P>
<P>
   Lizards, Cherry notes, predate dinosaurs, continents, even -
gasp! - (beginitalic)S(enditalic)(beginitalic)trom
Thurmond(enditalic). If that doesn't leave you hungry for more, you
are a hard sell. This brief, well-illustrated book tells you
everything you always wanted to know about lizards and a lot you
could have done without but aren't troubled to hear, such as the
fact that a monitor lizard can run 10 mph to catch the wild pigs it
likes for supper or that its mouth is so full of bacteria that its
bite will kill its victim within a day or two even if it gets away.
Cherry also includes general information on lizards in myth, art
and advertising and in film (we were delighted to see not just
(beginitalic)Godzilla(enditalic) and (beginitalic)Journey to the
Center of the Earth(enditalic) but also (beginitalic)The
Freshman(enditalic), Andrew Bergman's comedy in which a Komodo
dragon gets loose in a shopping mall). This is a good book to hand
over to visitors from the East as they watch geckos skitter across
your block wall.

   ``POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK''
</P>
<P>
   By Benjamin Franklin
</P>
<P>
   (Modern Library, $10.95)
</P>
<P>
   Early to bed and early to rise makes a man miss pretty much
everything good on TV. That's Ben Franklin updated by Dave Barry in
his introduction to this new edition. Barry is hilarious, in fact,
as he questions the wisdom of a few of Franklin's statements -
particularly ``if your head is wax, don't walk in the sun'' - and
heartily endorses others. ``Poor Richard advocates diligence,
self-reliance, frugality and honesty,'' writes Barry. ``He disdains
laziness, extravagance, pretense and immodesty. It goes without
saying that he hates lawyers.'' This is one of the first four books
in the Modern Library Humor and Wit series. Others are
(beginitalic)Mark Twain's Library of Humor(enditalic), with an
introduction by Roy Blount, Jr.; (beginitalic)Most of the Most of
S.J. Perelman(enditalic); and (beginitalic)Crazy Salad: Some Things
About (enditalic)(beginitalic)Women(enditalic) by Nora Ephron. The
series is edited by Steve Martin, who insists that Perelman stole
his material.

   ``BE THE ONE''
</P>
<P>
   By April Smith
</P>
<P>
   (Knopf, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy Sanderson is a formidable woman - tall, blond, athletic
and savvy enough to be a baseball scout for the Dodgers, the only
female scout in the major leagues. The competition to find new
players is stiff, and when she gets a call from an old friend in
the Dominican Republic, she quickly flies down to see the ``pure
hitter'' he has discovered. Alberto Cruz does have talent so
Cassidy signs him and brings him back to Los Angeles, but soon
Alberto begins receiving mysterious blackmail notes. Flashbacks
throughout this novel reveal that the notes are tied to a
mysterious night in the Dominican Republic when Cassidy, Alberto
and a wealthy American businessman drove drunkenly through a
hurricane just before their return to the United States. The novel
is suspenseful and well characterized although longer than it needs
to be. Smith will appear at the Poisoned Pen bookstore. See Book
Signings for details.

<P>
   ``AN INVISIBLE SIGN OF MY OWN''
</P>
<P>
   By Aimee Bender
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   Bender's odd but very effective first novel is narrated by
20-year-old Mona Gray, a troubled young woman who struggles with
psychological scars and obsessions even as she forms attachments to
some very strange second-graders at her hometown elementary school,
where she has been hired to teach mathematics. Emotionally affected
by her father's poor health since she was 10, Mona is the ultimate
unreliable narrator, her sanity seemingly so fragile that for a
long time we don't know what to make of her. She finds comfort in
numbers - they are the constant force in her mind, her only
reliable port in life's storm. In a voice that is both witty and
spooky, Mona tells us about her students, her family and her inner
life, hinting at potential violence even as she embarks on a sweet
romance with a fellow teacher. It's a mark of Bender's subtle
virtuosity that such a surreal story is ultimately so appealing.
She's a writer to watch.

   ``THE DAY JOHN DIED''
</P>
<P>
   By Christopher Andersen
</P>
<P>
   (Morrow, $26)
</P>
<P>
   Andersen opens this book by trying to justify it, alluding to
the ``ocean of grief'' into which we all allegedly plunged upon
hearing of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s death and pointing out Kennedy's
similarities to Princess Diana (which amount to little more than
that both were ``lit from within,'' and we were obsessed with
them). You'll forgive us if we tell you that books like this make
us feel squirrelly as if we're watching a bank heist in progress
and doing nothing to stop it. But Andersen has cased this joint
before (he wrote not only (beginitalic)The Day
(enditalic)(beginitalic)John Died (enditalic)but also
(beginitalic)Jack and Jackie (enditalic)and Jackie After Jack), and
he knows where the money is. Happily, Kennedy comes off well. His
marriage was doing better; his rebellious youth was spent; and he
was, to all appearances, a good man. And we defy you to remain
unmoved at the description of the funeral service, marked by a
stunned and battered family's grief over another gone too soon.

<P>
   ``FROM OUR HOUSE: A MEMOIR''
</P>
<P>
   By Lee Martin
</P>
<P>
   (Dutton, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   This memoir begins with a ghoulish tragedy but becomes the oddly
uplifting story of the author's determination to understand the
dynamics of his own family. In 1956, when Martin was a baby, his
father, Roy, lost both hands in an accident with a harvesting
machine on their 80-acre farm in Illinois. Roy Martin was already a
coarse, difficult man, but his misfortune instilled in him a new
level of anger. Over the years, he beat and berated his son while
Lee's mother looked on. ``I was too young to know then,'' Martin
writes, ``that she was as helpless in my father's house as I.'' But
to dismiss Roy as a villain is to deny the complexities that exist
in unhappy families. Martin explores his own responses to his
father, and so takes his story beyond self-pity and makes it an act
of salvation. His book is an unflinching look at the bonds between
a wounded man and his son and at the stoic perseverance of the
woman who loved them both.

   ``WHY WE HURT''
</P>
<P>
   By Frank T. Vertosick
</P>
<P>
   (Harcourt, $24)
</P>
<P>
   It's unsettling, reading about pain. We suspect that any amount
of discourse on specific pain would be easier to take - you have a
migraine, you have a bad back, you're looking for solutions. But
this book, subtitled (beginitalic)The Natural History of
Pain(enditalic), covers the whole gamut of discomfort, and it made
us squirm. Cancer pain, spinal pain, migraine pain, the pain of
childbirth, of carpal tunnel syndrome, of kidney stones or worse.
Vertosick, who is a neurosurgeon, eases the way with his friendly,
nonchalant tone, and he reminds us often that in the grand scheme
of things, pain has a purpose. It is, he says, ``a teacher, the
headmaster of nature's survival school.'' He discusses some of his
own patients and how he alleviated their pain and gives lots of
time, bless him, to the miracle of anesthesia, which he ranks as
one of the great achievements of our age. So do we, but right now
we're going to take some aspirin. We're not sure why.

 UNDATED: can do.   Q: A few years back, you published a proposal in The Atlantic
Monthly suggesting that future human missions to Mars might carry
``warm-blooded plants'' which would be genetically engineered to
grow their own greenhouses. ``Warm-blooded'' plants?''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A: If you want to have a settlement on Mars, you'd better have
plants and animals that can live there.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the key to any sort of practical colony: plants
that grow their own greenhouses. It's like a turtle growing its own
shell. You sow the seeds on Mars. You have to pick a place where
there is water underground. They put their roots down. Then, they
build a greenhouse and they maintain a greenhouse independently. Of
course, we are many years away from that. The science isn't in
place yet.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was your take earlier this summer, when you saw the
announcement of the human genome mapping?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: The genome statement was mostly hype but that is not
important. The important thing is that we now have the tools to
sequence all kinds of animals and plants and microbes _ as well as
humans. It is not important that we didn't actually finish the
human sequence yet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The two big revolutions of the past 20 years have occurred in
genetics and computer technology. You are as much a futurist as a
scientist. Did you see either of them coming?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the genetic revolution, that was obvious as soon as one
saw the double helix. But the Internet, I certainly never heard of
it before it happened. It still surprises me that it has taken over
the world much more than we expected. It used to be just this
little Arpanet that my friends were on and that connected various
military bases with each other. We never thought of it as something
that would take over.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: One senses you feel a real affinity for the practical people
of science, engineers and the like. Is that true?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: I like people who are working on practical things and who are
working in teams. It's not so important to get the glory. It's much
more important to get something that works. It's a better way to
live. If you are trying to solve the big problems by pure thought,
it's very solitary and it's very competitive and the people who
don't succeed are mostly unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've lived a life in science and you have been quite happy?
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Because I've jumped around many times, and I've never
become obsessed with any particular thing.
</P>
<P>
   The other point goes back to what we were discussing about the
generation that grew up in the shadow of World War I: my generation
took such a tragic view of life. We started out with this deep
conviction that life was tragic and that one better make the best
of it. One didn't expect anything to come out right. If you start
out with a tragic view of life, then anything since is just a
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   We did, after all, survive, and we created a world that is
moderately peaceful. I take it as a bonus that we only have about
eight countries with nuclear weapons at the end of the 20th
century, instead of the 50 that we expected. Another bonus is that
nobody has used a nuclear bomb in anger since Nagasaki.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in Ohio Monday, George W. Bush pledged to
``rally the armies of compassion'' if elected president.
Shoe-horning ``armies'' and ``compassion'' into the same sentence
may require mental acrobatics for some, but not for the throngs of
believers at the GOP convention, which Monday night focused on
images of compassion and Tuesday night will, quite literally,
showcase the armies.
</P>
<P>
   The theme Monday was ``Opportunity with a purpose _ leave no
child behind.'' First lady-hopeful Laura Bush, a former
schoolteacher and librarian, was scheduled to speak about literacy
_ also, perhaps not coincidentally, the pet cause of first
lady-emeritus Barbara Bush. Videos and speeches featured
after-school programs, immigrant success stories, community
service, and foster-care families. Children's faces were
everywhere, and all of it to a background score of swelling
strings.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday tonight, expect a parade of patriotism and military
firepower, including tributes to war heroes from Norman Schwarzkopf
to John McCain. Speakers will reinforce Bush's message of restoring
military morale and preparedness. Tuesday night's theme: ``Strength
and security with a purpose.'' Even US Representative Jim Kolbe of
Arizona, a gay Republican, who might seem an odd choice for a
speaker when gays in the military are not always welcomed, will
likely stick to his script: international trade.
</P>
<P>
   This is the ambition of the Republican message for 2000: to hold
seemingly contradictory values in a single, coherent ideology.
Compassionate conservativism is only the half of it; Bush aims to
turn traditional Democratic themes on their head by arguing that
the welfare state hurts more poor people than it helps; that, in
Bush's phrase, ``the soft bigotry of low expectations''
shortchanges schoolchildren through special education and bilingual
education; that guns in the home make children safer; and that
``tough love'' will work not just for at-risk teenagers but for a
grateful nation hungry for limits.
</P>
<P>
   As George W. Bush seeks to remake the Republican Party in his
own image, voters would do best to consider his deeds, not just his
words.

Wenner, called him, ``the first rock and roll president in American

MCCAIN UBIQUITOUS AS BUNTING AT GOP CONVENTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Tuesday will be Day Two of the Sen. John McCain
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   With nobody here yet to shush him _ though Laura Bush might try
_ McCain has been talking on every street corner and shaking hands
at every Philly cheese steak stand, leaving no microphone silent as
he campaigns for Most Popular Ex-Candidate at the Republicans'
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, he's giving the keynote speech in prime time
after ``Judging Amy.'' Last night, he opined on ``Larry King
Live.'' All last weekend and all week, he has been tailed by
gaggles of reporters hanging on his every word, except when the
words are ``George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush doesn't get here soon, McCain may start moving in with
Laura. He's already making big-time moves on the Republican
nomination in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, everybody here is desperate to see a presidential
candidate. On Sunday night, 600 wavering Republican delegates and
even 10 members of Congress turned out to toast the arrival of a
widely promoted third-party candidate, Captain Morgan of The
Seagram Co.'s Rum Loyalists' Party.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he's the only politician who outdrew McCain. However,
the Republicans may have been attracted by the unfulfilled promise
of an appearance by ``Playboy'' ``playmate'' and vice presidential
candidate Kalin Olson (Miss August 1997) of Hot Springs, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Without benefit of playmates, McCain still attracted 70
reporters to ride along as he made his grand entrance to
Philadelphia aboard his ``Straight Talk Express'' campaign bus from
Arlington, Va., with three more buses in the caravan.
</P>
<P>
   He was starring on ``Face the Nation'' Sunday. He was
autographing his book, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' at the Bourse
building. He was welcoming his former delegates in a teary-eyed
televised farewell at the Hotel Sofitel.
</P>
<P>
   He even spoke to a warm welcome Sunday at a ``shadow''
counter-convention for college students at the University of
Pennsylvania. The audience of several hundred students, described
as laden with nose rings and tattoos, clapped and chanted his name
_ turning hostile only when McCain said Bush ``is the candidate who
offers change.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he starred in an MTV special from the Hard Rock Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   I'm amazed that he wasn't at City Hall for the assembly of the
World's Largest Hoagie.
</P>
<P>
   They could have used the bologna.
</P>
<P>
   Once, McCain called Bush a ``Pat Robertson Republican'' and said
the governor's knowledge of foreign affairs consisted of trips to
the International House of Pancakes. Now, he compliments Bush's
``inclusive'' campaign, and he had better brag on Bush for at least
several sentences tonight.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has professed no pretensions. ``The last time I looked, I
was a United States senator,'' he said aboard his
once-and-possibly-future campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
   But he also joked to the ``New York Post'' that he was watching
out for a ``grenade from Texas.'' He added: ``Seriously, I believe
Governor Bush sees this in a positive light.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush saw McCain in a positive light, the senator would be
here on the ticket instead of Dick Cheney. That brings to mind last
week's McCain attempt to upstage the future nominee, when his
friends floated the rumor that he ``might'' accept the second spot
on the ticket when no such deal was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, the omnipresent McCain popped up hosting a
blue-ribbon panel discussion on foreign affairs. For a discussion
featuring six former secretaries of state, reporters walked into
the Philadelphia Convention Center press room asking anxiously,
``Where's the McCain speech?'' ``Did I miss McCain?'' ``What time
is McCain?''
</P>
<P>
   Not a single nose ring was in sight as he joked, ``Since I've
withdrawn from the campaign, my reception is getting warmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this keeps up, I'm going to demand a recount.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure whether to take McCain seriously. Or Captain
Morgan.

US TRIALS WILL BE HOTLY CONTESTED, KAROLYI SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Sixty floors above the Hub, in the Summit Room of John
Hancock's looking-glass tower, only the keenest eye in the land
Monday could have fixed a direction on Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kormann and Bela Karolyi were in town to talk about
Olympus _ specifically the US Olympic gymnastic trials to be held
at the FleetCenter Aug. 17-20 _ and in the misty gray of the day,
both men talked of bright, promising horizons in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are as good as the other teams in the world right now,''
said Kormann, the former Olympic bronze medalist who again is head
coach of the men's team. ``Point for point, we are matched with
them. There are no more mountains to climb. And in the distance, we
see a little bit of glimmering, and it's Olympic medals.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from the national championships that concluded Saturday in
St. Louis, Kormann and Karolyi were here with their newly crowned
champions, Blaine Wilson and Elise Ray, touting the return of the
tumblers to Causeway Street. The Olympic trials were also held at
the Fleet in '96.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who will turn 26 Wednesday, has already been guaranteed
one of the six spots for the Games in September. Ray, 18, is the
freshest face among a bold, impressive pack of young women who will
try to fend off some formidable older challengers, including the
Magnificent Seven likes of Olympic gold medalists Amy Chow,
Dominique Dawes, Dominique Moceanu, and Shannon Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking forward,'' said Karolyi, the '96 women's head
coach and now the team's coordinator, ``to having one of the most
incredible, most fiery, most disputed Olympic trials we ever had _
particularly on the women's side.''
</P>
<P>
   By Kormann's count, the indefatigable Wilson, a returnee from
the '96 team, has rattled off 110 consecutive victories in national
competition. He refers to his sculpted charge as the Tiger Woods of
gymnastics. The triumph in St. Louis brought Wilson an
unprecedented fifth consecutive national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you're the best guy,'' said Kormann, Wilson's former
coach at Ohio State, ``to go out 110 times and win five consecutive
USA championships, and prove it on the floor . . . that's extremely
rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray and four other relative newcomers took the top five spots in
St. Louis, making life difficult for Chow (sixth), Moceanu
(eighth), and Dawes (ninth). Miller, who has more medals in
international competition than any other gymnast in US history,
came to the nationals only to show that she was serious about being
in shape for the trials. Her petition to compete here is only a
formality, but it remains to be seen whether she can regain her
championship form in time to make the bus to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, sure, Miller can come like she's alays done,'' said
Karolyi, ``in very critical moments, and come up with a surprising
high-caliber performance, which immediately changes the whole
ranking.''
</P>
<P>
   Chow didn't place as well in St. Louis as Karolyi expected. He
also thought Dawes would be stronger. But given his read of some of
the younger challengers, that their inconsistency and lack of
experience makes them vulnerable, the colorful coach bellowed, ``It
is not over yet!''
</P>
<P>
   Miller could be especially valuable, perhaps more as a mature,
respected leader than what she might bring to the point total.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a benefit,'' said Karolyi. ``And it's a benefit for
many, many different reasons. First of all, prestige. We put
Shannon on the team, and the prestige of the team immediately _ and
I mean the visibility of the team _ comes up higher. Not inside,
because we all know her. But on the outside, the ones that don't
know _ but they know a Shannon Miller. So Shannon is in there,
boom, and suddenly it's, `Oh my, oh my,'' and Shannon is maybe not
even the best coming into the (tournament), but people are
thinking, `Oh, that's how good they can be.' ''

BOOKSTORE BULLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, which calls itself the nation's largest
bookseller, appears to be acting more like the book world's biggest
bully. In April, a New York City law firm claiming to represent
Barnes &AMP; Noble _ Robinson, Silverman, Pearce, Aronsohn &AMP; Berman _
sent a letter to the New England Booksellers Association,
concocting a dispute over the names of two promotional programs.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, Barnes &AMP; Noble has run the ``Discover Great New
Writers'' program. The chain holds a trademark on the name. The
program promotes groups of books by new and emerging writers on
specially marked shelves and each year gives a $10,000 award to a
first-time American novelist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the New England Booksellers Association set up a much
smaller program called ``Discovery of the Month,'' selecting one
fiction or nonfiction book to promote every other month.
</P>
<P>
   The B&AMP;N letter insists the names are too similar. To avoid
``unnecessary and costly litigation,'' it asks the association to
``cease and desist'' from using the phrase ``Discovery of the
Month'' and to destroy labels, product packaging, catalogs, Web
pages, Web sites, advertising, and promotional materials ``used on
or in connection with the name Discovery of the Month.'' Lawyer
Todd Braverman, who signed the letter, declined to comment, and
Barnes &AMP; Noble officials didn't return calls.
</P>
<P>
   The request is over-the-top. It's hard to confuse B&AMP;N's highly
visible shelves of ``Discover'' books with the association's
bimonthly effort. Barnes &AMP; Noble's timing is also odd. The two
programs have co-existed for six years. Several B&AMP;N stores have
been members of the booksellers association and have been sent the
smaller program's materials.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, stores in a given industry typically use common sales
language. Protecting trademarks is essential, but not to the point
of leaving other retailers mute. What's next, a patent on
``bestseller list''?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes heartfelt word-of-mouth can bring a great but
little-known book to the public's attention. This is a gift to
readers and a money-maker for the book industry. But it can only
happen if all bookstores are allowed to speak freely in plain
English.

<P>
   The bullies on the bus in Dallas did not know who they were
picking on, they only laughed at the small boy's stutter, his pale
skin and his clothes, playing the cruel game of childhood.
</P>
<P>
   His older sister, Tamara, would rush to fight his tormenters, or
restrain him from doing so. Kenyon Martin's anger, meanwhile, rose
up within him like a sermon. Do not doubt me.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has learned to control his stutter along with his
temper. He made himself into the best college basketball player in
the country, defying predictions. Today he speaks most eloquently
through his actions, powerful, yet gentle.
</P>
<P>
   Where are those bullies now? ``My mom said she saw a few of them
the other day, just doing nothing,'' Martin said with a distant
smile and a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they saw him on television on June 28, the night of the
National Basketball Association draft, when the 6-foot-9-inch,
235-pound forward out of the University of Cincinnati dissolved in
sobs of relief and vindication after the Nets made him the first
overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   He never thought of leaving college early for the draft,
returning to Cincinnati for his senior year specifically to win a
national championship. That dream was shattered along with his
right fibula on March 9, when he landed awkwardly after colliding
with a player on a routine pick in the Conference USA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, people questioned Martin's leg and ability to heal,
prodded and X-rayed him until his insides glowed, but the Nets
hushed all doubters within minutes at the draft. Now Martin feels
he must validate their choice when the season begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had confidence in me,'' he said. ``I never had a doubt
that I would come back and play. A lot of people wondered, but I
never had a doubt. I'm going to go out there and work as hard as I
can. I don't back down from anybody. No matter who it is.''
</P>
<P>
   On the basketball court, Martin cuts a menacing figure with his
four tattoos, fierce glares, slam dunks, rejected shots and swift
sprints. ``People look at him as a mean, tough guy,'' said his best
friend, Don Willis, who met him playing Bitty Basketball when they
were 7. ``But he's a real tender, sweet person.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin is also an animal lover, and after his fiancee's boxer
flunked out of obedience school, only he could tame and mesmerize
the hyperactive dog. He will sit for hours watching ``Big Cat
Diaries'' on the Animal Planet cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   An astute listener with a generous spirit, Martin, 22, is the
product of growing up around strong, caring women. ``He is a better
person than a basketball player,'' Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins
said of his consensus national player of the year. ``Kenyon's
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he is private, his body can be used as a map to his soul,
the pictures and letters in different languages all clues to his
contrasting personality. On his left arm are thick, black Japanese
characters shouting his credo: Never Satisfied. On his right
shoulder is his mother's name in thin letters: Lydia.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia Moore, Tamara Ridley and Martin formed an unbreakable
family triangle early on. Ridley, 26, three and a half years older
than Martin, mothered him almost immediately, from changing his
diaper to fighting his bullies, driving him to basketball games and
cooking for him while their mother often worked two jobs. They were
inseparable as latchkey children in Dallas and still speak daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a bond that's unbreakable,'' Moore said. ``She's
married with two children, but she and her brother, they are joined
at the hip.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's father, Paul Roby, played basketball at the University
of New Mexico, but Martin remembers meeting him only once, when he
was in grade school, long after his mother moved the family from
Michigan to Texas. When Martin was filling out information forms in
college, he told his sister, ``I put you as my dad on my
paperwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridley understood. ``I was more like his dad,'' she said. ``I
was always fussing after him. I wanted him to succeed.'' Go to
Class, Directly  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Martin skipped an early morning class at Cincinnati, Huggins
used to threaten to call Ridley. Martin went to class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tamara taught me how to be a strong person, how to overcome
things,'' Martin said. ``Both she and my mom did. Just growing up,
not letting the bad stuff get between us, making nothing out of
something. My mother worked so she could find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Ridley. She, too, was a single mother, working and going
to school to earn her accounting degree. Ridley is now married with
a daughter, Tatum, 8, and a son, Darius, 4. Her children are almost
exactly the same age difference as she and Martin; they, too, never
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Darius idolizes his uncle, begging for Martin's same tattoos,
wearing his jersey, dressing in basketball gear whenever Martin
returns to Dallas. The adoration is mutual.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the draft, Martin arranged to have a three-bedroom
house built for his mother and to move his sister and her family
into a house on the same block. Ridley currently lives and works
out of her mother's home as a wedding consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' said Martin, who will most likely make the rookie
maximum of $11.4 million over three years, ``it's their time to
relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before he was the provider for the family, Martin offered
his sister and mother a sense of calm. ``My sister worries enough
for both of us,'' he said. ``I tell her, `Why worry about things
you can't control?' I never do.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a perspective that took time to develop, an inner battle
he finally mastered on the court. ``I've come 360 degrees with my
temper and my attitude,'' Martin said. ``When I was young, I would
just snap. But I had a coach who told me my attitude wouldn't get
me anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   That was when Martin was 12 and the shortest player on the team.
As he grew, he excelled defensively but was still reluctant to
emerge on offense. He went to three high schools in Dallas,
including a private school and two public schools. After leaving
the private school, the bus ride to the first public school was so
far from home that he moved in with his sister and niece to go to
Bryan Adams High School.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was not a top high school prospect when he signed with
Cincinnati. ``He was very talented when he came in,'' Huggins said,
``he just didn't have any skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin had not qualified academically to play the first semester
at Cincinnati, but kept taking the SAT until he became eligible to
join the team in January. By the 14th game of his freshman year, he
was starting. Still, he played with upper-class stars, like Danny
Fortson and Damon Flint, and averaged only 2.8 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not productive at all,'' he said. Nor was he
particularly aggressive. ``I didn't want to get fouled because I
struggled at the free-throw line.'' As a freshman, he went to the
foul line only 32 times in 22 games, and made 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mechanics were really bad,'' Huggins said. ``As his
mechanics got better and better, he gained more confidence.''
Martin's sophomore year, he shot 47.6 percent from the line, 50 of
105. His junior year, he made 50 of 89, for 56.2 percent. Last
season, he went to the line 206 times and made 141 for 68.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really got a great aptitude for basketball, and he's a
great listener,'' Huggins said. ``His last two years he coached the
other guys. So much of why Kenyon is so good is that he gets great
pleasure in helping other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Against DePaul his sophomore year, Martin pulled off a
triple-double, with 24 points, 23 rebounds and 10 blocks.
Afterward, he approached Huggins. ``Did I shoot too much?'' Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins was amazed. ``The guy really wants to win and he's never
been caught up in statistics,'' he said. ``When he started getting
all the accolades, you wondered if his work ethic would change.''
</P>
<P>
   It only intensified. The summer before his senior year, Martin
decided he would change his game, that this Cincinnati team would
bear his offensive imprint. ``If I could do it in practice,''
Martin said, ``I don't know why I couldn't do it in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin got in the gym and shot ``until his arm fell off,'' the
assistant coach Rod Baker said. He practiced his free throws, his
post-up moves, working out with Corey Blount, the former Cincinnati
player and six-year N.B.A. forward.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's single-minded determination to achieve a national
championship was why Huggins, too, was devastated when his star
went down 3 minutes 4 seconds into Cincinnati's opening-round game
against St. Louis in Memphis in the conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get my sister,'' Martin said, on his way into the ambulance.
Tamara was right behind him. Moore, who would cry any time her son
got poked in the eye, was there, too.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The fracture, like a fault line, led to other disappointing
events. The Bearcats did not get a No. 1 seeding in the NCAA
tournament, and they lost in the second round. Martin's wedding was
to be in Cincinnati in April. Instead, his fiancee of two years,
Fatimah Conley, withdrew from her classes at Xavier to tend to him.
</P>
<P>
   They met during his freshman year at a night club, each
convinced by their separate friends to attend. ``He's a man of few
words and he just sort of introduced himself,'' Conley recalled.
``He didn't have a shady line, he was real calm, though not quite
as confident as he is now. He was a gentle giant.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of their classes and his basketball schedule, they
rarely spent many days in a row together, but then the injury
brought them closer. ``I've known him for three years and he never
complains,'' Conley said. ``If he didn't have any money, he didn't
complain. He never once complained about his leg. Me, coming from
suburbia, we complain a lot. I'm a worry-holic, always wondering
how it's going to be tomorrow, a year from now. He tells me,
`Things are going to be how they're going to be.''' Wedding Plans  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two plan to get married before the season.
</P>
<P>
   Once she and Martin find a house in New Jersey, Conley plans to
finish work toward her undergraduate chemistry degree, perhaps at
Columbia or New York University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the season is going to be very hectic and he'll be away
a lot,'' she said. ``So it's important for me to have my own
life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, they have been living in Santa Monica, Calif.,
since late April. Martin's agent, Dan Fegan, arranged for him to
rehabilitate at the Kerlan-Jobe Institute and Martin has been
working out every morning for three hours, shooting, improving his
strength and quickness, and following Nets team doctors' advice not
to scrimmage until next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``My confidence is at an all-time high, even though I'm not
playing,'' Martin said. ``When I get in games, I know I can play
with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Martin attended Shaw's Summer League in Boston with
the Nets, learning some plays and sitting on the bench watching
free agents and rookies who will most likely never be his
teammates. It was torture.
</P>
<P>
   The leg, he said, will be healed by Oct. 2, when the Nets begin
training camp. He does not see pressure in being anointed a savior
for a Nets team historically tagged by injuries and underachieving.
Rather he is looking forward to running the floor in the up-tempo
offense of the Nets' new coach, Byron Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing, I don't look at anything as pressure,'' Martin
said. ``When I'm on the court, I'm so relaxed, I'm more nervous
when I talk to somebody than when I am on the court, in front of
thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least with one group, his words flow easily.
</P>
<P>
   After he left Boston, last week, Martin stopped in Cincinnati
because he had promised an elementary school class he would return.

ANXIOUS PUBLIC DELIVERS BIRDS BY THE BAGFUL TO VIRUS HUNTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One dead sparrow arrived at the state lab in a Nike
shoebox. Another was unceremoniously dumped in a Shaw's shopping
bag. A crow corpse was even delivered ice cold _ packed in a bag
with fruity popsicles.
</P>
<P>
   Since the West Nile virus was discovered in two crows in the
Boston area last week, state public health authorities have been
overwhelmed with reports _ and bodies _ of suspicious dead birds,
turned in by the concerned public. Just since Friday, they have
logged 200 calls. And Monday, with more calls coming in, state
epidemiologists had to hire a courier service to zigzag across the
state, helping collect everything from dead seagulls to cat-mauled
finches.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Department of Public Health is asking the public to
only report dead crows. Crows, they said, are particularly
susceptible to the disease, and provide hints of how far the virus
_ which killed seven people in the New York area last summer _ has
spread.
</P>
<P>
   The deluge of bird reports, said public health workers, is a
sign of the tough position they now find themselves in: While they
want the public's help in stopping the disease, they don't want
people to panic when the chances their chances of contracting the
virus are vanishingly small.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking a lot of measures to protect a very small number
of people from a bad disease,'' said Dr. Alfred DeMaria, Jr.,
director of the state Bureau of Communicable Disease Control.
``Most people who get it won't even know they have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Quelling the panic is all the more difficult because the West
Nile story has all the elements of a Michael Crichton summer
thriller: A mysterious virus working its way up the Northeast
coast, transmitted to people by the mosquito, one of our most
common nuisances.

   ``The mosquito is ubiquitous and that is what is so
frightening,'' said Dr. Robert Youngberg, a psychologist at McLean
Hospital in Belmont. ``There is some element of reality to it all.
And there is a type of progression of how it is getting here.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there are the birds. Crows -- mythological
harbingers of death -- are providing the most visible sign the
disease is among us.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state has been agressively testing birds and
mosquitoes, no other sign of the disease has surfaced, state
officials said Monday. No one has gotten sick. After two infected
crows were found, one in Boston's Jamaica Plain section and one in
suburban Hopkinton, health workers expanded their mosquito
eradication efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus -- which has infected people in Africa, Asia
and Europe -- mysteriously appeared for the first time in the
Western Hemisphere in New York City last year. The city then
embarked on a highly controversial aerial spraying program that had
tens of thousands running for cover. And while initial estimates
predicted that thousands could have been infected, seven elderly
people died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The estimates are that somewhere around 1 in 200 or 300 of
people infected with the virus actually become sick and most of it
is a flu-like virus,'' said Dr. Martin Hirsch, professor of
medicine at Harvard and part of the infectious disease unit at
Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that we have the virus in our area shouldn't
illicit a great deal of fear, but that's not to say we shouldn't be
cautious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for many, any outbreak they cannot personally control, is a
reason to panic. In New York, concerts and picnics were canceled
because of West Nile fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's anxiety tends to increase when there is less
control,'' said Dr. Donna Pincus, assistant professor at Boston
University and director of the Child and Adolescent Fear and
Anxiety Treatment program. ``You see all this stuff in the media
and it causes intensified fears.''
</P>
<P>
   Pincus predicts that tobacco kills more people every day than
the West Nile virus ever will, but people feel more comfortable
with tobacco because they are controlling its use. They can't
control the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   The search for dead crows, Pincus and others said, is just a way
for people to assure themselves they have a reason to be fearful.
``People seek out information that confirms their thoughts. And
it's natural to want to protect ourselves from danger,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>
AT CONVENTION HALL: FAREWELL, SPONTANEITY; HELLO, CHOREOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
   By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Ronald Reagan used to preach what he called the
11th Commandment: Speak no evil of other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But now his party, and the other one, too, have gone him one
better, appropriating the physician's Hippocratic Oath as the
unspoken guiding principle for their quadrennial gatherings: First,
do no harm.
</P>
<P>
   It is that thought, more than anything, that has drained all of
the drama and much of the meaning from modern political
conventions. No surprises are wanted these days. No sore losers. No
floor fights. So long, eccentricity. Farewell, spontaneity; hello,
choreography. No more smoke-filled rooms _ unless you count the
convention hall, which is to be filled with artificial, politically
correct smoke as part of the entertainment here.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, who began their 37th national nominating
convention this morning, and the Democrats, who meet in Los Angeles
in two weeks, have been reading the polls and reflecting on the
recent past. Partisans all, they are confronted with the
uncomfortable finding that Americans, a few of whom may actually be
watching on television, hate partisanship and discord.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is the times. Perhaps it is because most people are
happy with their lot, with the economy and with the course of the
ship of state. If that is the reason for voters' aversion to
conflict, feel-good conventions could be a passing phase. Hard
times pose hard questions, and those questions get thrashed out not
only in campaigns but also in the conventions preceding them.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, it's pablum for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The original raison d'etre of conventions _ nominating
candidates _ vanished a quarter-century ago. Not since the
Republican gathering in Kansas City in 1976, when Gerald Ford
barely held off Ronald Reagan, has there been a genuine contest for
the presidential nomination at a major-party convention. It was
well past midnight when West Virginia finally gave Ford the votes
he needed to go over the top.
</P>
<P>
   And not since 1940 has a rank outsider captured the nomination.
At the Republican convention that year, Wendell L. Willkie finished
third on the first ballot; it took his handlers many hours to put
together the deals that gave him the nomination on the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   There will probably never again be a spectacle even remotely
resembling the epic struggle between rural and urban interests at
the 1924 Democratic convention in the first Madison Square Garden.
John W. Davis of West Virginia was chosen by the exhausted
delegates on the 103rd ballot, but the party had next to nothing
left for the fall campaign, and Davis was trounced.
</P>
<P>
   The new reality is the consequence of the 1968 Democratic
convention in Chicago, which was so rowdy, with spiteful verbal
combat inside the hall and a police riot outside, that the parties
tore up their old rule books.
</P>
<P>
   Today almost all the delegates are chosen by the voters in
primaries and caucuses, not, as of old, by the political bosses.
The delegates know months before they come to town whom they will
vote for. They are bit players now, with badges around their necks
and beers in their fists but no power.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the man they have come to nominate, told the
National Journal the other day that conventions have become an
anachronism. But that, he insisted, does not _ should not _ mean
they are on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convention provides a system of rewards for hard-working,
grass-roots people who end up being delegates,'' Bush said. ``I
view it as an opportunity for these people to go back home,
energized to help me get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. It also provides an excuse for a lot of parties,
mostly paid for by big corporations, and yet another setting place
to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that the convention had become ``a place to
showcase ideas more than in the past.'' Not exactly. To be precise,
it has become a place to talk in muted terms about ideas that the
nominee wishes to be heard. If there are abortion-rights supporters
at the podium this week, for example, they will talk about
something else, thanks to what Mr. Bush calls his ``iron-fist''
control of the proceedings. But there will be no oratorical fire on
the other side of the issue, either, and few attacks on the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   That was the lesson that politicians drew from the contrasting
conventions of 1992. The Republicans, nominating George Bush the
elder, permitted the clergyman who delivered the opening-night
invocation to compare abortion to the Holocaust and allowed Patrick
J. Buchanan to issue a shrill call to arms for the ``religious war
going on in our country for the soul of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania said this week, ``I felt
absolutely terrible that night.'' Just like a lot of other people
in the hall and out across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, on the other hand, staged a pageant of unity
behind Bill Clinton in New York, denying Robert J. Casey, then the
governor of Pennsylvania, a chance to state his anti-abortion
position from the podium. Clinton won, of course, and a new bit of
conventional political wisdom was born: Trouble in August means
trouble in November.
</P>
<P>
   So there will be no echoes here of Barry Goldwater's
belligerence in accepting the 1964 Republican presidential
nomination in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting Cicero, the Arizonan told the delegates that ``extremism
in defense of liberty is no vice, moderation in pursuit of justice
no virtue.'' He lost, as did William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska in
1896 after perhaps the most spellbinding of all convention
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Siding with the Western populists against Eastern bankers, Bryan
cried out, ``You shall not crucify mankind on a cross of gold!''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will there be a surprise vice presidential nominee. In 1956,
Adlai E. Stevenson left the choice to the delegates at the
Democratic convention, and a youngster named John F. Kennedy,
though narrowly defeated by Estes Kefauver, set himself up for
1960. Kennedy, in turn, stunned the country by choosing Lyndon B.
Johnson as a running mate. And George Bush chose Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now a new tradition is emerging: choose the running mate before
the convention, so as to eliminate that, too, as a potential
disruption.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the drama of past conventions has lain in credentials
disputes. At Chicago in 1952, Dwight D. Eisenhower's managers
mounted a campaign of dubious legitimacy under the slogan ``Fair
Play'' and succeeded in stripping Robert A. Taft of enough
delegates to assure the general's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the drama has lain in the rules. At Miami Beach in
1972, the brain trust of Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota,
headed by Anne Wexler, now one of Washington's most successful
lobbyists, deftly manipulated the rules to guarantee his victory.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes _ often, in fact _ the drama has lain in the
platform debate, where conflicting ideas on major issues were
thrashed out.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Philadelphia 52 years ago this summer, Hubert H.
Humphrey, the ``Boy Mayor of Minneapolis,'' led a passionate
campaign for civil rights. He told the delegates, assembled to
nominate Harry S. Truman: ``There are those who say we are rushing
this issue of civil rights. I say we are 172 years too late.'' The
Dixiecrats walked out, nominated Strom Thurmond for President and
carried five states. But Truman won _ a reminder that it has by no
means always been politically suicidal to stage a contentious and
divisive convention.
</P>
<P>
   This year, neither convention is likely to tackle such important
issues as drugs, campaign finance and the gulf between the rich and
the poor. The Republicans, deeply divided on the issue of abortion,
will display no prime-time dissent; the minority, abortion-rights
forces, who had enough votes in the platform committee to take a
minority plank to the floor, decided to pass up that chance in the
name of unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all propaganda,'' said Haley Barbour, the chairman of the
Republican National Committee during the 1996 conventions. ``It's
all a TV show. It's not news, but it's hugely important information
for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the question remains whether these carefully packaged
four-day Republican and Democratic infomercials will influence the
unaligned, uncommitted voters whom both parties say they want to
reach. With dissent muffled, with debate defunct, will they be
stirred? The low turnouts in recent presidential elections suggest
that all the staging in the world won't do the trick.

<HEADLINE>
MARIJUANA INGREDIENT HELPS MICE OVERCOME ARTHRITIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An extract of marijuana that does not make users ``high''
blunted the attack of rheumatoid arthritis in mice, scientists are
reporting, suggesting a possible new weapon against the crippling
disease that affects more than 2 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The substance is called cannabidiol, one of about 80 ingredients
of marijuana. But it doesn't have any mind-altering properties,
making it potentially easier to develop as a drug in today's legal
environment, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The compound apparently works much like Enbel and Remicade, new
drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, but unlike them can be taken
orally, said Dr. Marc Feldmann, a prominent arthritis researcher in
London and senior author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse experiments are described in the current issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists gave laboratory mice injections of collagen, a
connective-tissue protein that sparked an abnormal immune system
attack on the mice's tissues and joints.
</P>
<P>
   Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by such mistaken attacks
by the body's own defense system, which leads to swelling, pain,
inflammation, and destruction of joints. Osteoarthritis, the other
major type, is caused by wear and tear and is not usually as
disabling.
</P>
<P>
   The cannabidiol, purified from hashish, was injected into some
rats and given orally to others, while control animals received a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers evaluated the drug's effect by measuring swelling,
inflammation, and joint stiffness in the animals. Some of the
rodents' hind feet were removed so they could be studied for
physical damage by the renegade immune system attack.
</P>
<P>
   Animals who got the drug had significantly fewer symptoms, and
more of them escaped damage to their feet. Only a certain dose was
effective, though, the scientists reported: a little higher or
lower dose didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the way forward now is to do a clinical trial'' in
human patients, said Feldmann, who is a division chief at the
Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology in London, which he said is the
largest institution in the world studying rheumatic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Feldmann and a colleague recently received a $500,000 prize from
the Swedish Academy of Scientists for their work over a decade in
showing that a particular immune system signaler, tumor necrosis
factor, or TNF, is a major culprit in rheumatoid arthritis.
Blocking TNF, they found, also squelched the activity of other
molecules involved in the immune system's mistaken attack on the
body's own tissues.
</P>
<P>
   This paved the way for drugs like Enbrel and Remicade, which are
TNF-blockers that entered wide use in the past year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Feldmann said he was interested in testing the marijuana
compound because of findings over many years by Dr. Raffi Mechoulem
in Israel, who he called the ``guru of cannabinoid chemistry.'' He
said Mechoulem has made it his life's work to understand the
medicinal properties of the many ingredients in the marijuana
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Klippel, the medical director of the Arthritis
Foundation in Atlanta, called the work ``interesting'' and said
that because Feldmann is such an influential arthritis researcher
it gives the marijuana findings credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Klippel said that Enbrel and Remicade have brought dramatic
relief to many rheumatoid arthritis sufferers. ``There's now
unequivocal evidence that they slow down or even halt joint
damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The drawbacks are that the drugs have to be injected by the
patient or someone else twice a week, and that they are expensive.
A year's treatment costs about $10,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary accompaying the report, Dr. Stephen E. Straus of
the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine
noted that previous research has indicated that marijuana and its
ingredients can block inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, he said, that the compounds in marijuana ``could
alleviate arthritis as implied in the present report, yet remain
well tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Straus highlighted the puzzling finding that the cannabidiol
compound was only effective at a narrow range of doses, and said
for that reason ``it might be difficult to develop (the substance)
into a useful anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drug.''

   Tuesday's front page stories:
</P>
<P>
   GOP-RDP-NYT (Philadelphia) _ A convention roundup: Republicans
open their convention, beginning what party leaders hope will be a
highly scripted four- day celebration of George W. Bush; the first
real business came when the delegates approved a platform that
reaffirms the party's staunch position opposing abortion while
adopting Bush's compassionate conservative positions; according to
a New York Times/CBS News poll of delegates, the Republicans here
are far more conservative than average Republican voters, but Karl
Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush Campaign, played down the
dichotomy between the delegates and the message in an interview
Monday.

   AMHERST, Mass. &UR;  &LR; _ The West Nile virus has now taken over the No.
1 spot in the unofficial list of infectious threats from far-off
places. The Hong Kong flu held the position three years ago and the
Ebola virus three years before that. As before, the driving force
is fear, and observers are enmeshed in controversy over what action
to take.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of chickens were destroyed to curb transmission of Hong
Kong flu to humans. The West Nile target is the mosquito, with
widespread insecticide spraying under way.
</P>
<P>
   How dangerous is the virus? We have data from 1999 indicating
that it will kill 5 or 10 people along the mid-Atlantic seaboard if
it is not controlled. This corresponds with deaths from similar
viruses transmitted from birds or mammals to people by mosquitoes
but essentially nontransmissible from person to person.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that control efforts are effective at breaking the
transmission from bird to human, several lives will be saved and
many people will not have to suffer the infection. If this is the
basis for supporting the spraying and for the attention given to
the problem, fine.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, however, worry that the virus will spread out of
control, and the news that it has been found in Massachusetts will
fuel those fears. But the epidemiological study of infectious
diseases like West Nile suggests that this fear is overblown. Every
year countless mosquito-borne diseases immigrate into the United
States, often into regions in America where they once thrived.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria comes into Kennedy Airport, and dengue fever slips
across the Mexican border into Brownsville, Texas. The mosquitoes
that transmit these diseases are still here, often in abundance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the diseases do not really spread, probably because our
window screens, air-conditioned cars and buildings tend to keep us
on the safe side of a boundary. If mosquito-borne malaria and
dengue fever, which are so superbly adapted to causing mischief in
humans, cannot make a go of it in America, then what chance does
little old West Nile virus have?

HOW TAXES TRICKLE DOWN

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's common for leaders of the Democratic Party to claim that
Republican tax cut proposals ``favor the rich,'' but this shows a
lack of understanding of the true consequences of today's high tax
rates. When Republican leaders fail to challenge this claim, they
implicitly endorse the assumption that high-income individuals
currently bear the entire burden of high tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense and experience tell us just the reverse. Much of
the burden of today's high tax rates falls on individuals with
middle and low incomes, and, arguably, these rates have contributed
to the increased disparity between rich and poor that has occurred
under the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the luxury tax, passed by Congress in 1990 and aimed at
the rich who could afford expensive jewelry, furs, automobiles and
boats? It was repealed three years later because those hurt worst
by the tax were thousands of low- and middle-income workers who
lost their jobs as the luxury goods and recreational boating
industries suffered a severe recession.
</P>
<P>
   The same phenomenon is occurring now with the tobacco industry,
which agreed to pay the states $246 billion over the next two
decades to settle lawsuits by the states' attorneys general seeking
to recover health care costs. The tobacco industry is not paying
for this settlement. The cost has been shifted to smokers, who are
paying higher prices for their cigarettes so that the industry can
protect its profits while paying the states and lawyers. Not
everyone may care that smokers are paying more, but the point is
that the tobacco companies simply shifted the burden of the
settlement to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Another shift occurred in 1993, when the Clinton administration
increased the top personal income tax rate by 20 percent. The
administration promised that the new 39.6 percent rate would affect
only those with the highest incomes.
</P>
<P>
   But is that really true? After taxes went up, I noticed that the
fees my dentist charged also went up about 20 percent. He wrote the
check to the IRS, but his customers got the bill.
</P>
<P>
   My dentist was not alone. That year, the income of the top 5
percent of households jumped an average of 20 percent, according to
data from the Statistical Abstract of the United States. By
contrast, the income of the middle 20 percent fell 1 percent that
year.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Americans understand that high taxes jeopardize
their financial security. For example, polls show that some 60
percent of people support repeal of the inheritance tax, even
though it supposedly only affects the richest 2 percent of all
Americans. They may not be able to articulate why the death tax is
bad, but they instinctively grasp its true cost. With effective tax
rates rising above 80 percent, the death tax discourages savings
and investment, encourages the squandering of assets and allows the
government to take most of whatever is left. It silently steals
from our communities the investment necessary to build wealth and
create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-class Americans also intuitively understand that high tax
rates on personal income are a barrier to prosperity. For example,
an average two-income couple in the 31 percent tax bracket must
also pay 12.4 percent in Social Security taxes and 2.9 percent in
Medicare taxes on each of the two incomes. Add in state and local
income taxes, and the marginal tax rate could easily exceed 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   That means a $30,000 college tuition really costs $60,000. And
to put away an extra $250,000 toward retirement, a couple would
have to earn $500,000. What's fair about that?
</P>
<P>
   Today's high tax rates also hurt those lower on the economic
totem pole. Let's say that someone in the highest tax bracket wants
to renovate his house, and pay a contractor $20,000. Assuming the
contractor is in the 31 percent bracket, he would take home only
about $10,000 after income and other taxes are taken out.
</P>
<P>
   But the high-income family has to pay much more than $20,000.
The wage earner must earn $40,000 to afford the $20,000, because he
must first pay federal income taxes, Medicare taxes and state and
local taxes. So high rates suppress economic activity by depressing
both what the family can spend and what the contractor can earn.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about tax cuts in terms of their impact on the ``rich''
vs. the ``middle class'' only supports the misperception that the
wealthy pay the brunt of high tax rates. The reality is that the
middle class also pays. The political establishment would be
well-advised to listen to the wisdom of the people and lead them
where they want to go, to a land of zero death taxes and lower
overall rates.

THE GOP'S ILLUSION OF INCLUSION

<TEXT>
<P>
   This week in Philadelphia, the Republican Party faithful will
play their parts as master illusionists try to convince independent
voters that this is a different kind of convention for ``a
different kind of Republican,'' Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, I made a noisy exit from the Republican Party
in an effort to send a message to party leaders that, Bush's
endless photo ops with black and brown children notwithstanding, it
was past time for the party to move beyond the oratory of
inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Though the proximate causes of my resignation from the GOP's
minority outreach committee were Bush's appearance at Bob Jones
University and his unwillingness to condemn the flying of the
Confederate flag atop the South Carolina statehouse, my resignation
was two years in the making. It was set in motion by a pattern of
blunders.
</P>
<P>
   These included the Republican National Committee's gala at the
ancestral home of Jefferson Davis, the president of the
Confederacy; the House Republicans' refusal to support a resolution
condemning the Council of Conservative Citizens, a white
supremacist group that had been given open access to GOP leaders
like Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott; and Louisiana Gov. Mike
Foster's reported payment of $150,000 for David Duke's mailing list
of supporters.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years, I accepted the Sisyphean challenge of broadening
the GOP's appeal to the 30 percent of African-Americans who,
according to poll after poll, share mainstream conservative beliefs
on issues like school vouchers and welfare reform. The party's
self-inflicted wounds undermined my efforts, so rather than
continue a fruitless climb, I called it quits.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a former party activist and convention veteran, let me
offer this sneak preview: This year's gathering will offer a
distinction without a difference. By any objective measure, the
convention will be no different from, say, the 1996 or the 1992
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,066 delegates and 2,066 alternates, there will probably
be 85 black delegates (4.3 percent) and 76 black alternates (3.6
percent), according to David Bositis of the Joint Center for
Political and Economic Studies. It's true that at the 1996
convention, there were only 52 black delegates and 50 black
alternates (2.6 percent of delegates and alternates). But in 1992,
there were 107 black delegates and 102 black alternates (5 percent
of the delegates and alternates).
</P>
<P>
   OK, some people might say: ``Lighten up. Didn't Governor Bush go
to the NAACP's convention? You have to start somewhere.'' But a
Republican presidential candidate must do more than simply show up
to bridge the racial gap.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance before the NAACP, which is, after all, the
nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization, encapsulated
his party's problem. His failure to address the issues of concern
to the group's members _ Supreme Court nominees, affirmative
action, racial profiling, gun control, the death penalty and, yes,
the Confederate flag _ reinforced Colin Powell's observation on Fox
News on June 25 that ``too often the Republican Party has said, `We
know what's best for you,' as opposed to listening to the
African-American community.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's noblesse-oblige turn before the NAACP may help him
with some white voters, it did little to answer Powell's point last
month that the GOP ``is certainly not seen as the black guy's
party.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, Powell and a parade of African-American and
Hispanic speakers will take center stage at the convention, a
made-for-television illusion of inclusion. Fans of reality TV,
however, may want to check their local listings.

REPUBLICAN'S AT GOP CONVENTION LEAVING CLINTON'S IMPEACHMENT IN THE
PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BENNET   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Bill Clinton was impeached, right? No one here at
the Republican National Convention seems to recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's forgotten,'' said Robert Livingston, the former
congressman from Louisiana, who abandoned his dream of being
speaker and resigned his seat in the tumult surrounding the
impeachment of Bill Clinton. ``Whether the president was impeached
or wasn't impeached really is a non-issue.''
</P>
<P>
   It sure seemed like a big deal at the time, what with all that
talk about history and the Constitution and the rule of law. But a
convention is no time to boast about a landmark legislative feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what the key to this convention is and what the
key to this election is, is that voters want to focus on issues,''
said Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida. That sounded remarkably similar
to what the president used to say back when he was being impeached
so many years ago. Well, two years ago, anyway. OK, a little less
than that, even.
</P>
<P>
   Back in those days, McCollum used to say things like, ``His
conduct constitutes a great insult to our constitutional system and
subverts our system of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, McCollum, who was one of the House members who
prosecuted Clinton in the well of the senate, is running to return
to that chamber as a senator himself. But no one brings up
impeachment on the campaign trail, he said. ``I don't see it coming
up unless a media person asks me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, the man who suffered the incredible lightness of
being impeached, was off in Florida Monday raising hundreds of
thousands of dollars for McCollum's Democratic opponent, Bill
Nelson. But McCollum demurred when offered the chance to say that
the president was out for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he has or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is forgotten but not gone.
</P>
<P>
   When George W. Bush refers to restoring ``honor and dignity'' to
the White House, everyone knows that he is talking about the
internship program. Republican congressmen have used the issue in
fund-raising appeals to gingerly targeted conservative donors. And
when pressed about it, Republicans involved declare their pride in
having done what they believed was right, at great political cost.
</P>
<P>
   So there is something poignant in all this silence: Impeachment
has become the Republican pride that dare not speak its name _ like
the Contract with America at the last Republican convention, when
Speaker Newt Gingrich (remember him?) chose in his speech to
emphasize beach volleyball instead.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the platform comes to using the I-word is this:
``And, at a time when the nation felt betrayed by misconduct in
high office, the Republican Congress responded with gravity and
high purpose. We applaud those members who did their duty to
conscience and the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the genial Livingston said he has moved on. He is
attending the convention as a delegate from Louisiana, and he
helped draw up the platform. He is working as a lobbyist in
Washington and spending time with his family. He cannot vote, he
said, but otherwise representing his clients is ``not so far apart
from what I did as a congressman, in representing constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no regrets about losing his job in a fight he
believes the public no longer cares about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system worked,'' he said. ``I think he had to be
impeached. I think the Senate wasn't ever going to convict him. And
that's life. We all played our roles, and I played mine and moved
on.''

BLOOD SUPPLIES RUNNING LOW IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts blood supplies are running dangerously
low and hospitals may soon be forced to postpone some elective
surgeries, health care groups warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The cause, they said, is a jump in the number of blood-consuming
surgeries done at area hospitals and a bulge in the eldery
population that is producing an ever-increasing stream of patients.
Donations have not dropped off but are being outpaced by the
increasing demand for blood, the groups said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross and organizations representing doctors and
hospitals issued a call for even more blood donations _ a rare
instance of unity among groups that typically compete for blood
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of (Monday) morning we are at critical levels in
O-positive, O-negative, A-negative and B-negative,'' said Melissa
Croteau, a spokesperson for the state chapter of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, refering to the different types of
blood.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross supplies 65 percent of the state's transfused
blood. They reported Monday that only a one-day supply is on hand,
meaning that if new donations to the blood supply were to abruptly
dry up, transfusions could continue for a single day. The Red
Cross' comfort level is a three- to four-day supply.
</P>
<P>
   Blood transfusions are necessary componants of most surgeries
since when people are cut open, they bleed. Among the procedures
that use the most blood are coronary bypass surgery and various
orthopedic surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allan Kliman, a hemotologist at the Spaulding Rehabilitation
Hospital, said emergency surgeries are not threatened by the
shortage, but elective ones may soon be effected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Procedures may have to be delayed. Doctors might have to let
people go without transfusions for a longer period of time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts shortage is not an isolated malady. The Red
Cross reported that 32 states have similar problems. This summer,
blood supply drops in the Baltimore and Philadelphia areas prompted
elective surgery postponements at hospitals there. In the New York
City area, some hospitals are allowing patients to drop to
lower-than-normal blood levels before giving them transfusions,
according to the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Shortages in other states impact Massachusetts because the
much-respected hospitals here draw thousands of out-of-state
patients. Unfortunately, out-of-state blood supplies do not follow,
said local health care officials.
</P>
<P>
   The current blood drought is not the product of some new
hematological thriftiness in the public. Donation levels are pretty
consistent with past years, though summer is traditionally slow.
Rather, hospitals are using 5 percent more blood on average this
year, according to a Red Cross study. In July, one Boston-area
hospital called the Red Cross urgently seeking blood for two
pending organ transfusions. The organization had to go to another
state to find the necessary blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer's shortage is almost unprecedented,'' said Croteau
of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Some area doctors have made the unusual request that excess
blood from hemochromatosis patients _ those who produce too much
blood _ be used for transfusions, said health care groups. Other
doctors have suggested revisiting the discarded practice of asking
the families of patients to provide blood for their loved-ones'
surgeries. These options, however, are not being actively
considered by any area hospitals, said health care groups.
</P>
<P>
   The only permanent solution, the groups said, is to somehow
stimulate public blood donations. To that end, the Massachusetts
Medical Society this week sent thousands of doctors letters urging
them to ask their patients to donate blood.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in donating blood can call the Red Cross at
1-800-448-3543 or the Massachusetts Medical Society at
781-434-7311.

</P>
<P>
   GUEST: Freak show stuff, mostly. You know, some guy sleeping
with his wife's sister and his wife's best friend, whose husbands _
lo and behold _ are sleeping with each other in the same cheap
sleazy motel where the wife is sleeping with the husband's brother
and husband's best friend, on alternating Thursdays. Stuff like
that.
</P>
<P>
   AUDIENCE: (laughter, boos, applause) Jer-ree! Jer-ree!
</P>
<P>
   SPRINGER: (shaking head pensively) And what do these poor people
get out of talking to you?
</P>
<P>
   GUEST: I dunno. Their jollies, I guess. I pay them a little. Put
'em up in a hotel if they're from out of town. I guess they're
starved for attention.
</P>
<P>
   SPRINGER: (voice rising pensively) Do you assist them with these
problems? Do you bring in any professionals like, say, a shrink or
a clergyman to help them work through their troubles?
</P>
<P>
   GUEST: Uh, no. That wouldn't be very entertaining. I'm not into
charity work, bub.
</P>
<P>
   SPRINGER: (lowering voice pensively) You said you pay these
people a little money. Your sponsors, do they pay you well?
</P>
<P>
   GUEST: Yeah, quite a lot of money, in fact. I'm a wealthy man.
If I ever ambushed ``People Who Got Stinking Rich Doing Little or
Nothing,'' I'd be interviewing myself.
</P>
<P>
   SPRINGER: (expressing disgust, pensively) And you're proud of
this?
</P>
<P>
   AUDIENCE: (laughter) Jer-ree! Jer-ree! Jer-ree!
</P>
<P>
   GUEST: Hey, this doesn't define me. It's just something I do. I
bring people together. If I didn't do it, somebody else would.
</P>
<P>
   SPRINGER: (pensively silent) Do people ever get hurt as part of
your fun and games? I mean, really, really hurt, beyond the pain
they brought with them when they met you?
</P>
<P>
   GUEST: Uh, well, sort of. Had one lady get killed recently. But
what do I know about it? I don't meet these people before I ambush
them. It's better that way. It's more extemporaneous.
</P>
<P>
   SPRINGER: (growling pensively) It's not my business, you
understand, but do you feel at all responsible for this violence?
Do you ever consider that you're preying on these pathetic
creatures? That you're exploiting them for profit?
</P>
<P>
   AUDIENCE: (laughter) Jer-ree! Jer-ree!
</P>
<P>
   GUEST: Well, uh, no, not really. They probably would have ended
up where they did without me. They've got problems, like I said.
</P>
<P>
   SPRINGER: (charging stage, pensively) Wait a second! Let's start
to peel away these levels of reality. They're messed up, but don't
your little sideshows just make them worse? Aren't you trafficking
in human misery?
</P>
<P>
   GUEST: Uh, I'm sorry. Are you trying to make some sort of point?
</P>
<P>
   SPRINGER: (shaking head, pensively) What a waste. What a waste
of energy.
</P>
<P>
   AUDIENCE: (laughter, applause) Jer-ree! Jer-ree! Jer-ree!

<TEXT>
<P>
   What I remember most about entering Ronald Reagan's suite early
on the third evening of the 1980 Republican convention, the night
of his nomination, was the silence. It's not that there weren't
plenty of people around. William J. Casey, Reagan's campaign
manager, Richard Wirthlin, his pollster, and his advisers Peter
Hannaford, Michael Deaver and Edwin Meese were all there in the
candidate's elegantly appointed rooms on the 69th floor of the
Detroit Plaza Hotel. So, too, was Reagan, dressed in a casual shirt
and tan slacks. The entire group was seated on a large U-shaped
couch, hushed, as if they were watching some spellbinding movie on
TV.
</P>
<P>
   The silence in the room was in marked contrast to the steadily
rising noise at the Joe Louis Arena. There, word was spreading that
Reagan was going to choose Gerald Ford, the former president and
his bitter adversary in the 1976 primaries, to be his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   As Reagan's foreign policy adviser, I didn't have much business
getting involved in the selection of a vice president. But as
someone who signed on with Reagan because I admired his principled
criticism of the foreign policy of the Nixon, Ford and Carter
administrations, I couldn't help venturing to the suite to see what
was going on. And so, at 5:30 in the evening, before I was to head
over to the convention, I walked up the single flight of stairs
that separated Reagan's floor from mine. It didn't take long for my
suspicions to be confirmed. As I stepped into the hallway, there,
coming out of Reagan's rooms and flanked by his Secret Service
detail, was a tanned and fit Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Once the former president and I had exchanged pleasantries, I
made my way past security to Reagan's suite. Alone among those
gathered on the couch, the nominee looked up and greeted me. I
asked if he needed anything before I left for the arena. ``Oh,
no,'' he replied, ``but thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   As I turned to leave, he asked, ``What do you think of the Ford
deal?'' ``What deal?'' I responded, genuinely surprised that the
two parties were already working out details. In addition to the
vice-presidential slot, Reagan said, ``Ford wants Kissinger as
secretary of state and Greenspan at Treasury.'' My instant response
was, ``That is the craziest deal I have ever heard of.'' And it
was.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, both major presidential candidates have conducted
highly structured searches for their running mates. Richard Cheney,
the former secretary of defense, spent months vetting candidates
for George W. Bush before getting the nod himself. Former Secretary
of State Warren Christopher has been doing the same for Al Gore,
who has yet to name his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was only 20 years ago, the process in 1980 could not
have been more different from the one today. It is hard to imagine
an unexpected vice-presidential pick at the last minute, like John
Kennedy's selection of Lyndon Johnson in 1960, Richard Nixon's
choice of Spiro Agnew in 1968 or even George Bush Sr.'s elevation
of Dan Quayle in 1988 _ all of which caught the candidates'
advisers by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Ronald Reagan's nomination of Governor Bush's father
that bears special telling. Reagan's selection of Bush in Detroit
represented a turnabout within six hours; it came only when the
negotiations with Ford, having taken on a life of their own,
appeared to have reached an impasse. Had the talks succeeded and
had Ford been selected, the Reagan campaign, crippled by
infighting, might well have lost to the Carter-Mondale ticket in
the fall. Had Reagan and Ford managed to win the election, it's
very likely that their administration would have been hobbled by an
unworkable power-sharing arrangement. It's also possible that the
Republicans might have a different candidate today.
</P>
<P>
   There are many plausible versions of how and why Reagan chose
George Bush as his running mate, but most are wide of the mark. One
conventional view is that Reagan, about to be nominated, recognized
that he ``needed a moderate'' like Bush to balance the ticket;
another version has it that Reagan, supposedly unschooled in
foreign affairs, saw the wisdom of naming someone with extensive
experience in the field to offset his own shortcomings. Yet another
explanation holds that Reagan, a Californian, needed ``geographic
balance'' and got that in Bush, with his Connecticut and Texas
lineage.
</P>
<P>
   These explanations are wrong. George Bush was picked at the very
last moment and largely by a combination of chance and some
behind-the-scenes maneuvering. Many Reagan advisers have claimed a
deal was never close. The post-convention media commentary has
largely reflected this view. In fact, Meese and Deaver have gone so
far as to declare that Bush was their first choice all along. I
take exception to their account. I saw a very different story
unfold, and saw it from a privileged vantage point. From the moment
I walked into that suite until the moment Bush was finally
selected, I was the only person to remain in Reagan's presence
throughout the adventure. With detailed notes to back up my memory,
this is what I saw at the dawn of the Reagan Revolution on that
long night in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan's search for a vice president started as soon as
he clinched the nomination with a string of primary victories in
the spring of 1980. Before long, a short list of prospective
running mates had been put together, including Howard Baker,
William Simon, Jack Kemp, Richard Lugar, Paul Laxalt and George
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   None of these prospective running mates were actually ``vetted''
in the way the process works today. Reagan knew all these men in
varying degrees, but as was his style, he expected his advisers to
do what was necessary to prune the list. The job fell largely to Ed
Meese, who knew Reagan's mind better than anyone except Nancy
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until several weeks before the convention that Gerald
Ford's name entered into the mix. While it has never been
established how it happened, most attribute it to Bryce Harlow, a
respected adviser to Eisenhower, Nixon and Ford. Harlow probably
initiated the idea in a discussion with his friend, William Casey,
who then took it to Reagan and Meese.
</P>
<P>
   As the convention approached, the Ford rumors became stronger.
Although Reagan was running even with or behind President Carter in
most polls, the idea struck several of us on the senior staff as a
highly impractical, if not silly, idea. After all, Reagan and Ford
had fought intensely for the nomination in 1976. In 1980, the GOP
platform carried Reagan's conservative message down the line. Its
foreign policy planks in particular were, under cover of assailing
Carter, a de facto indictment of the Nixon-Ford-Kissinger policy of
detente with the Soviet Union. Unlike many of his predecessors,
Reagan actually believed in the platform and was determined to see
it put in place. The platform alone, we thought, would make a
Reagan-Ford ticket unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   In Reagan's suite, however, the unthinkable had become the
possible. In less than 24 hours, Reagan was going to have to go
before the convention to announce his vice-presidential nominee.
And yet for reasons that to this day remain baffling, not only had
Reagan given his political advisers free rein to negotiate with
Ford, he had also refrained from initiating conversations with
other potential running mates. With no alternate plan in sight, it
seemed that Reagan was prepared to embrace the wing of the
Republican Party that had ridiculed him, probably disliked him and
would surely do its best to undermine his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:50 p.m., Casey and Meese, who had left the suite shortly
after my arrival, returned. They seemed pensive. Lyn Nofziger, a
longtime aide, joined us a few minutes later, asking, ``What did
Ford want?'' Reagan again described the deal being negotiated,
complete with Ford's demands for Kissinger and Alan Greenspan,
adding, ``I thought that was more than a little sacrifice.'' Then
Reagan went to his bedroom to take a short nap. He knew it would be
a long night.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 6:30, Kissinger entered the suite to talk to
Meese, evidence that a serious negotiation was indeed in progress.
Half an hour later, he emerged; we chatted briefly, but Kissinger
revealed nothing of the talks. Meese, who was similarly guarded,
said that Kissinger wanted to proceed with discussions. This was
serious.
</P>
<P>
   And so I did something rash: I decided to try to contact George
Bush. Until that moment, the campaign inner circle had treated
important issues in a collegial manner; there had been no secrets
among us. But on this issue, Casey, Meese, Wirthlin and Deaver were
keeping the lid on. If my colleagues could play it close to the
vest on such a crucial issue, it was a game that could be played by
others as well.
</P>
<P>
   Although nominally still on a list of frequently mentioned
running mates, George Bush was not really on Reagan's radar screen.
Apart from serious policy differences, Bush had refused to admit
defeat in the primary battles despite being vanquished by Reagan in
29 of 33 primaries and did not withdraw from the race until just
before the California primary in June. Reagan considered the
belated departure willful and unnecessary and was offended by it.
Still, I thought Bush a viable alternative to Ford. Despite the
unsettled relations between the two, Bush could bring more to the
ticket to help Reagan than anyone on the list of choices.
</P>
<P>
   There was no question that a Bush candidacy would be a hard
sell. Among Reagan's advisers, Nofziger and Casey viewed Bush as a
liberal, and others were almost unanimously against him, some even
contemptuous. I considered Bush a capable man whose positions were
actually much closer to Reagan's than were Ford's, especially on
foreign policy and defense matters. In 1978, Bush had requested my
assistance on his campaign, but my commitment to Reagan was firm.
Of the Reagan inner circle, I had the clearest channel to Bush and
knew him the best.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 7:30, I reached Stefan Halper, a Bush aide.
Talking to him from the nearly empty suite, I asked him, in as
circumspect a manner as possible, to seek Bush's assurance that he
could support the platform ``with no exceptions.'' Halper knew what
I meant: Was Bush interested in the job? Would he implicitly
abandon his support for abortion and his opposition to supply-side
economics by embracing the platform? I then called an old friend,
Richard Fairbanks, to ask him to approach Bush with the same
question. I wanted two sources of independent confirmation and knew
Fairbanks was close to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Reagan emerged from his bedroom refreshed by the
catnap and sat down in front of three muted television sets in the
suite. Within moments, Gerald Ford appeared on CBS with Walter
Cronkite, and Reagan asked that the volume be turned up. Cronkite
wasted no time asking Ford if he and Reagan were discussing a
``co-presidency,'' which Ford affirmed by not disagreeing. Reagan
looked appalled.
</P>
<P>
   After the broadcast, the room cleared out. Reagan and I were
alone. Reluctant to question him, but knowing that another track
could never be started unless he agreed to it, I asked Reagan why
he would not simply issue a statement denying that he had agreed to
a co-presidency. There was a sense of resignation in his voice when
he said, ``I can't.'' After a few seconds, he said aloud, almost
rhetorically, ``Who else is there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Bush,'' I suggested, half expecting him to close off
the discussion. Instead, he paused and then said, ``I can't take
him; that 'voodoo economic policy' charge and his stand on abortion
are wrong.'' Sensing an opportunity, I reached for a copy of the
platform lying on the coffee table, passed it to him and said,
``Governor, this is your platform, every word of it.'' I added that
Martin Anderson, Reagan's chief domestic policy adviser, Peter
Hannaford and I had scrutinized it carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could be assured that George Bush would support this
platform in every detail,'' I asked, ``would you reconsider Bush?''
Reagan mulled this for a moment and then said, deliberately,
``Well, if you put it that way, I would agree to reconsider.'' The
opening emerged.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:50 Fairbanks called to say that Bush could indeed embrace
the platform; soon thereafter, Halper phoned with the same message.
Meanwhile, negotiations with Ford continued upstairs on the 70th
floor, with Casey, Meese, Deaver and Wirthlin representing Reagan,
and Greenspan, Kissinger and the Ford advisers John O. Marsh,
Robert Barrett representing the former president. Reagan continued
to sit before the televisions, snacking on his favorite jelly
beans. Sen. Bob Dole appeared with the television commentator Max
Robinson and declared that ``Ford and Reagan can work it out.''
Reagan commented, softly: ``No, Bob. I cannot give him what he
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing another opening, I then informed Reagan that Bush had
given unequivocal assurances that he could embrace and defend the
entire platform, emphasizing ``with no exceptions.'' He listened
carefully, but did not respond. I simply could not read his
reaction, and the thought crossed my mind that he was angry that I
had opened a channel to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:05, Reagan announced to no one in particular, doesn't Ford
``realize there is no way in the world I can accept? What kind of
presidential candidate would I be in the eyes of the world if I
were to give in to such demands?'' It seemed odd that despite his
instincts, Reagan did not call a halt to the talks. It seemed odd,
too, that so many of those who felt uncomfortable about the deal
remained quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 8:30, Meese reported progress: Ford had modified his
demands and now wanted to be ``chairman'' of the National Security
Council. The notion should have been rejected outright, as the
president is the head of the NSC. A few minutes later, Anderson and
Deaver rejoined the group in the suite, and Deaver told Reagan that
Ford would like to speak to him on the phone. At 8:55, Reagan went
into his bedroom to call Ford. He returned five minutes later,
reporting that Ford had told him that Kissinger ``now takes himself
out'' of the running for secretary of state. It was clear that Ford
and Greenspan had not taken themselves out of anything.
</P>
<P>
   By 9:30, Sam Donaldson was reporting that Reagan would go to the
arena with Ford in a matter of hours, reinforcing speculation about
the ``dream ticket,'' and at 9:45, Cronkite announced that Ford and
Kissinger were meeting with Reagan operatives. At 9:50, Meese came
into the room: ``We're wanted upstairs'' in Ford's suite.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:05, former Treasury Secretary William Simon entered, and
Reagan and I sat with him in a corner. Simon, who had been
mentioned as a vice-presidential candidate, was determined to stop
the deal in its tracks, which was surprising since he had served in
Ford's cabinet. ``Ron, take me out of this,'' he told Reagan. ``But
under no circumstances take Ford.'' Simon, never a man to mince
words, left; he had made a deep impression on Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   By 10:45, Casey and Meese returned to the suite to present the
latest version of the deal. ``It's kind of hard to describe how it
would work in practice,'' Meese began. ``The president will
nominate the secretaries of state and treasury, with the veto of
the vice president. The vice president will name the director of
the Office of Management and Budget and the national security
adviser with the veto of the president. It boils down to a mutual
veto power.'' In this version, Kissinger, ``taken out'' as
secretary of state, would run foreign policy from the vice
president's office.
</P>
<P>
   At that late hour, despite its obvious and fundamental flaws and
without any sort of backup plan, our side seemed determined to try
to make this constantly changing arrangement work. It was almost
surreal: how could a president limit his constitutional powers and
prerogatives by allowing a vice president to veto his choices?
</P>
<P>
   Just before 11, Nancy Reagan and the Reagan children came in to
watch the convention roll call. At 11:13, Montana put Reagan over
the top, and there was jubilation. At the moment of triumph,
though, the negotiators were not present; they remained upstairs,
locked in discussions. Meanwhile, the convention was drawing to a
close _ if the Ford talks went on much longer, and failed, there
would be no way to heal the disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the preceding hour, I had told Hannaford,
Anderson and Nofziger that a channel had been opened to Bush and
that Bush was on board with the platform. Hannaford then began to
argue that the logjam had to be broken. He collected Deaver and
Nofziger at the entrance to the suite and mounted the stairs to
tell the negotiators that a decision was needed.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:25, the negotiators returned; Casey reported that ``the
answer is probably no.'' Five minutes later, Ford, accompanied by
Barrett, entered the suite to talk with Reagan, and we left the
room. The two men spent a few minutes alone, and at 11:35, Ford
departed. We rushed back into the room, and Reagan said: ``I have
to say the answer is no. All this time, my gut instinct has been
that this is not the right thing. I have affection and respect for
Ford. He said he would go all out to help.'' There was complete
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan glanced around and asked those assembled _ a group that
included Casey, Meese, Wirthlin, Hannaford, Deaver and me _ ``Well,
what do we do now?'' There was no immediate response. No one
offered an alternate plan. No one tossed out a name.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting instant opposition, I ventured, ``We call Bush.'' Once
more, silence. Reagan again looked at each of us; hearing no
objection, he said, ``Well, let's get Bush on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   At precisely 11:38, the phone was in Reagan's hand; though they
barely knew each other, Reagan dove right in. ``George,'' he said
warmly, ``I would like to go over there and tell them that I am
recommending you for vice president. Could I ask you one thing _ do
I have your permission to make an announcement that you support the
platform across the board?'' We could hear Bush agreeing at the
other end. Reagan then left for the convention center where,
shortly after midnight, he took the podium to praise Ford and then
to announce his running mate, George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And so it came to pass that Ronald Reagan averted what would
have been a disaster for his candidacy and the Republican Party.
The following morning, Ed Meese called us together and declared the
official line should be that the process of selecting a running
mate had been orderly and measured and that there ``never was a
deal with Ford'' for the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, he's right, since no deal was ever consummated.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, while on the campaign plane, I asked Deaver what
was in his mind as he sat in those discussions. He thought for a
moment and said, ``Look, I'm a guy from Sacramento, Calif., and
there I was sitting at a negotiating table with Henry Kissinger,
and Kissinger had negotiated with Mao.'' Astonished, I waited for
something more, then asked, ``And so, that's it?'' He looked at me
as if I didn't understand and said, sharply: ``Of course that's it.
I was sitting right there!''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Kissinger, no stranger to balky negotiations,
later told The Washington Post that ``if it had been possible for
both the principals to go to bed, sleep on it, meet again in the
morning, we could have wrapped up this thing in two hours in the
morning,'' adding, ``That's how close it was.'' And I believe him.

JUDGE FINDS EPA PROSECUTED MILL OWNER IN BAD FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a harsh rebuke to the Environmental Protection
Agency's pursuit of criminal polluters, a federal judge has ruled
the government unnecessarily harassed a Northbridge mill owner and
pursued a case against him even though it didn't have any credible
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The case marks the first time in the region that a judge has
ruled in favor of a Hyde Amendment application, a 3-year-old
federal law that allows an exonerated defendant to seek legal fees
from the government if the criminal prosecution was ``frivolous, in
bad faith or vexatious''.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, only seven defendants had successfully pursued Hyde
Amendment complaints as of October 1999, according to the
Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very high standard,'' said Pace University Professor of
Law Bennett Gerhsman, an expert on prosecutorial misconduct.
``There have only been a handful of successful applications. It's
very infrequent and very rare.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Nathaniel Gorton also
follows complaints detailed by The Boston Globe in a series last
fall that criminal investigators working for the EPA have bullied
people they were investigating and unfairly targeted small
businesses for enforcement action.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Gorton's decision, the government must pay
$68,726 to Riverdale Mills, a manufacturer of wire mesh used for
lobster traps, to reimburse the company for expenses and legal
fees. The company is owned by James Knott.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American system worked today,'' said attorney Jamy
Buchanan, who assisted Boston lawyer Warren Miller with Knott's
Hyde Amendment complaint. ``The courts pointed the finger back at
the real criminals -- the people hiding behind a government agency
misusing their considerable power.''
</P>
<P>
   An EPA spokesman said the agency remains convinced it acted
appropriately in the Knott case and is considering an appeal of the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision dated Friday, Gorton ruled not only that the
government lacked evidence to prosecute Knott and his company, but
that it failed to reveal evidence clearing Knott.
</P>
<P>
   The judge condemned the behavior of investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is also troubled by the government's unnecessary
harassment of defendants and their employees during'' a 1997 search
warrant, Gorton wrote. ``At that time, a virtual `SWAT team'
consisting of twenty-one EPA law enforcement officers and agents,
many of whom were armed, stormed the (mill) facility to conduct pH
samplings. They vigorously interrogated and videotaped employees
causing them great distress.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Knott and his company were indicted on two counts of
violating the Clean Water Act. In a press release announcing the
indictment, U.S. Attorney Donald Stern and former EPA Regional
Administrator John DeVillars warned Knott faced a jail term of six
years and fines of up to $1.5 million if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The case was dropped in 1999, however, when a federal prosecutor
revealed that information was withheld from a search warrant
application. It was information that Gorton determined was critical
to Knott: It showed his company was not in violation of the Clean
Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Knott began with an anonymous tip to the EPA by
a former employee, alleging highly acidic wastewater was being
illegally discharged into the town sewerage system.
</P>
<P>
   When EPA inspectors tested the wastewater in a manhole outside
the plant in 1997, they confirmed the employee's allegation. Knott,
however, urged the inspectors to test the wastewater at a second
manhole that was closer to the point where the mill water entered
the town system.
</P>
<P>
   The results at the second manhole revealed the wastewater was
within legal limits. It was those results that were withheld.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an expert hired by Knott determined that other test
results were altered, so that passing scores were changed to
results indicating a criminal violation.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said the government's conduct was ``clearly vexatious,''
meaning it was without probable cause and calculated to harass or
annoy.
</P>
<P>
   EPA spokesman Peyton Fleming said agency officials ``vigorously
disagree with the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that on both the facts and the law, the
government had very legitimate reasons for initiating this case,''
Peyton said ``To this day, the government has substantial basis to
believe that the defendants committed the environmental crimes they
were indicted for in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice department officials in Boston and Washington declined
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Knott said he believes he was targeted because he owns a small
manufacturing business that is easy prey for regulators. He said
most businessmen in his situation accept a settlement offer instead
of going through the expense of fighting the government -- even if
they are innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people settle and I think they bank on that,'' Knott
said.

   MOTHER-REUNION _ ATLANTA _ Kimberly Howard last saw her son on a
winter day in 1989. He was a curly-headed 6-year-old, full of the
wonder and excitement of a child about to board a plane with his
father. Weeks later, her ex-husband called to say he would never
bring their son back from a trip to his native Saudi Arabia. ``That
was the day my descent into hell began,'' says Howard, 42. For the
next 11 years, the former Atlantan hoped, despaired, fumed and
fought to get her son back. Now, in what Howard's family calls a
miracle, Laith Khayyat _ who will be 18 in October _ is due to
arrive Tuesday night in the United States. ``I'm numb,'' Howard
said. ``I thought I'd never see him again.'' (Hansen, Atlanta

 &HT;    New vote on union ordered at Delta
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The Transport Workers Union is getting a second chance
in its bid to represent ramp workers at Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   The National Mediation Board has ordered a rerun of an election
last winter in which 17 percent of the Delta's 10,777 eligible ramp
workers voted for the TWU, far short of the majority required.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency, ruling on a TWU appeal claiming misconduct
by Delta, cited three reasons for ordering a new election:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The board said it inadvertently disclosed to Delta the number
of election authorization cards that had been submitted in support
of an election, information that is supposed to remain
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Because of a mailing glitch the board mistakenly sent United
Airlines ballots to 241 Delta workers, which it said ``undermined
the integrity'' of the process.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The board found ``substantial evidence'' that Delta
supervisors wrongly used ``daily mandatory briefings to discuss
Delta's point of view on the election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Based upon the totality of the circumstances,'' the board
concluded, ``conditions required for a fair election were
tainted.''
</P>
<P>
   The board rejected, however, a TWU accusation that Delta
unfairly influenced ramp workers by announcing a pay increase and
discount computer purchase plan in the weeks before the election
began, noting that those moves were long-planned and applied to
most employees.
</P>
<P>
   The mediation board will conduct a new mail-in election,
although dates aren't set.
</P>
<P>
   The TWU has scaled back its Atlanta office since last winter's
defeat. John Kerrigan, secretary-treasurer at the union's national
headquarters, said Monday the board's ruling was ``greatly
gratifying and confirms our contention that the actions of Delta
management directly interfered'' with a fair election.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said it is ``profoundly disappointed.'' The company denies
any wrongdoing in conducting meetings or disseminating anti-union
materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta people spoke loud and clear in the first election when
more than 83 percent of eligible voters chose to remain union-free.
We trust our people will again make their opinion known in the
rerun election,'' a company statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, the least-unionized major airline, has seen a jump in
organizing activity in recent years. So far, the only union victory
came last year when 107 pilot instructors narrowly voted to join
the TWU.

<TEXT>
<P>
   D-Day, Pearl Harbor, FDR, penicillin and Orson Welles' ``War Of
The Worlds'' radio broadcast. All of these were part of growing up
for the War generation, often referred to as the ``Greatest
Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   They were raised during the desperation of the Depression and
grew up in the shadow of World War I, one of the most horrific wars
the world had ever seen. They went on to win World War II, and many
would fight again, and die, in the Korean War. To support the war
effort, they became the first recycling generation, turning tires
into gas masks, radiators into rifles and shovels into hand
grenades.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1940s, with imminent threat of invasion by Hitler's
forces, this was a generation on edge, and not yet aware of the
power and deceptive verisimilitude of the media. So imagine the
terror one Sunday night when they switched on the radio and heard
these words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most terrifying thing I have
ever witnessed ... There, I can see the thing's body ... The mouth
is V-shaped with saliva dripping from its rimless lips...''
</P>
<P>
   Orson Welles had struck! It was the 20th century's first virtual
alien experience: Orson Welles' 1938 Mercury Theater radio
broadcast of H.G. Wells' ``The War Of The Worlds.'' Members of the
War generation remember it well, either firsthand or from the
newspaper accounts of the panic it instigated in New Jersey and New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   That they believed Welles' news show drama was a reflection of
the national fear of invasion. It also signaled the power of radio,
a relatively new, live medium which, like its audience, was coming
into its own. And this generation had to learn fast and learn well,
often by making _ and then learning from _ mistakes. Their survival
depended on it.
</P>
<P>
   All of these issues, and more, are on display in the new exhibit
at Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich., called ``Your Place In
Time: 20th Century America.'' The exhibit covers the six
generations of Americans who came of age in the 20th century and
the people and events that shaped them. The second generation _ the
War generation _ and its accomplishments have received a lot of
long overdue attention recently. The exhibit brings that time in
history to life with photos, displays and interactive vignettes.
</P>
<P>
   A STAR IS BORN
</P>
<P>
   You may be a member of this generation if you recall that bad
times weren't so bad when you were at the movies _ one of the few
fantasy escapes available. Movies had been around for a while, but
were now improved with sound and, starting in 1935, color.
Hollywood stars were bigger than life _ even the child stars like
Shirley Temple and Judy Garland.
</P>
<P>
   Fan magazines became the cornerstone of the neighborhood
newsstand. In their pages, readers could gaze longingly at their
new pals Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Humphrey Bogart, or covet the
long lashes of leading ladies like Carole Lombard and Joan
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibition, visitors can flip through Silver Screen
magazine. Some ads will look familiar _ Maybelline cosmetics,
LifeBuoy soap and Camel cigarettes, for example. Others may look
strange in light of today's trends _ for instance, one ad touts
``Dr. Walter's reducing brassiere that gives you that trim youthful
figure that the new styles demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio, like motion pictures, was a recently improved technology.
Youngsters of the War generation took to radio like today's kids
take to computers. Young people (they weren't called ``teens'' yet)
bought and built sets, broadcast their own messages and listened in
every night to regular shows like ``The Lone Ranger,''
``Amos'n'Andy'' and the ``Grand Ole Opry.'' Soap operas first
appeared as short radio vignettes, sponsored by, well, soap
companies, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of this generation who came of age in the late '30s
and '40s fought in World War II, while the younger ones assisted
their elders in holding down the home front. At home, Uncle Sam
asked for donations of old scrap of all types to make new items for
the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the exhibit shows that silk and nylon stockings
went into gunpowder bags. One old radiator made 17 .30-caliber
rifles, one old lawnmower reel equaled six 3-inch shells, and the
rubber for 12 gas masks came out of one old tire. One shovel could
make four hand grenades. And lard, the most common shortening of
the day, was collected to make explosives.
</P>
<P>
   They saw new materials, such as plastics and plywood, aluminum
and magnesium, make possible entirely new items like squeeze
bottles, aluminum foil, lightweight auto parts and architectural
elements, and new forms of furniture. After the war, aluminum was
applied to a couple of developments that would become essential to
modern life: beer kegs and aluminum siding.
</P>
<P>
   This generation saw the introduction of streamlined industrial
design, which began as a way to increase the aerodynamic efficiency
of cars and trains, but soon beautified telephones, radios and even
toasters, which in most homes don't travel very fast at all.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the exhibit's interactive vignettes, a decade-by-decade
showcase running the length of the exhibit features photos and
artifacts that speak to each generation (especially the ``tweens''
who, like some of us, fall between generations).
</P>
<P>
   Here we are reminded that the War generation saw the
not-so-long-ago miracle of penicillin, first made available as an
antibiotic during World War II. Along with artifacts, the
exhibition also showcases famous photos of troops embarking on
their fateful D-Day mission, and the mushroom cloud from the big
bomb that helped end the war.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a ride for these young people. They saw a lot, did
a lot, and no doubt later annoyed their boomer offspring with tales
of youthful hardships. Now mostly retired, they're finally getting
to enjoy some of the things they fought for. Youngsters, you should
listen to their stories. They were there. They saw some of the
greatest changes this world has ever known. In fact, we could all
learn a thing or two.

 (ART ADV: Photos of a recliner seat with TV screens, in-flight
entertainment screens and personal DVD players are available on
Newscom or by calling William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.) 
 By REBECCA DAY 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a long day. You kick off your shoes, lean back in your
recliner, punch a few buttons on the remote control and are soon
immersed in the movie of your choice. Sound like a Friday night at
home? Try again. It's air travel on a growing number of
international flights where the jouney can be almost as enjoyable
as the destination.
</P>
<P>
   Noise cancellation headphones, audio and video on demand, DVD,
satellite TV and intranet access are among the in-flight services
that are making the skies _ if not friendlier _ a lot more
comfortable. As carriers compete for passengers' business,
in-flight entertainment is getting better both in quality and
variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always looking at the latest technology to keep
passengers occupied and entertained,'' says James Boyd, a
spokesperson for Singapore Airlines. The airline has pumped $1.3
million _ at a cost of $18,500 per seat _ into 15 of its 747-400
jets for the Matsushita AVOD 1.5 audio/video-on-demand system.
</P>
<P>
   Installed in first- and business-class cabins, the on-demand
system shifts the entertainment program from a channel approach to
a library concept, according to Boyd. It's part of the airline's
strategy to give passengers more control over in-flight
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Niche airlines with long-haul routes like Singapore Airlines,
Malaysia Airlines and South African Airways are taking an
aggressive approach to in-flight entertainment, offering the latest
audio and video-on-demand systems.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways and Air Canada are scheduled to add on-demand systems
on widebody aircraft this year, while startup JetBlue Airways hopes
to make its mark on hour-long flights within New York state with
live in-flight TV programming from satellite provider DIRECTV.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller airlines are leading the charge in in-flight
entertainment, but a few major airlines are stepping up service as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research indicates that passengers don't make air-travel
choices based on entertainment options,'' says Mark Smith, director
of in-flight entertainment for American Airlines, ``but we know we
have to be competitive.'' The company has recently begun offering
Panasonic L10 portable DVD systems to first- and business-class
international travelers along with Bose noise-cancellation
headphones.
</P>
<P>
   The Panasonic L10 portable, with a built-in 5.8-inch display,
had to be modified for airline use. That included disabling the
internal speakers so that the audio can be heard only through
headphones, and boosting the audio level for use in a noisy
environment. DVD players for airplanes conform to the Region 8
coding system for DVD players, Hollywood's geographical tracking
system that prevents DVDs coded for the United States (Region 1)
from playing on machines in other countries where movies are still
in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Since airline DVD players are Region 8 machines, you can't bring
your own library of Region 1 discs on board, but American loads 20
DVD titles for each passenger.
</P>
<P>
   For years, military and commercial pilots have used noise-
cancellation headphones to block the deafening roar of jet engines.
More recently, headphone manufacturers have begun to make
noise-cancellation headphones available for retail sale, and now
Bose, one of the pioneers of noise-cancellation technology, is
offering them for use on commercial airlines. Expect to see the
Bose phones at retail stores soon, which means you won't have to
pony up for a premium-class ticket to enjoy it quieter ride.
</P>
<P>
   Active noise-cancellation headphones like the 6-ounce Bose model
work by using microphones in the earcups to monitor both the
desired sound (music or movie soundtrack from a CD or DVD player or
just silence if you don't choose to connect a source) and the
overall sound coming into your ear. The difference between the two
is noise.
</P>
<P>
   Processing circuitry creates an out-of-phase correction signal
that's the opposite of the noise signal, and then the speakers in
the earcups reproduce the correction signal, which cancels the
noise. The result is a 95 percent reduction in noise, according to
Bob Maresca, general manager of Bose's Noise Reduction Technology
group.
</P>
<P>
   The next wave of in-flight entertainment is audio, video and
intranet service on demand. Past video-on-demand systems have
enabled passengers to select movies from a catalog of titles. The
next wave gives you more control.
</P>
<P>
   Video-on-demand systems such as those from Matsushita Avionics
and Sony Trans Com are built around an A/V video server _ as
opposed to the racks of VCRs that feed most current in-flight video
systems. The digital medium offers the same benefits you reap at
home: better audio and video quality, the ability to pack more
information in a smaller space and added durability.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest plus is that you become the projectionist for your
own personal screen. You can start, stop and pause a movie at will
or repeat your favorite Metallica track as many times as you want.
You can even build your own playlist and select only the tracks you
want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The new digital storage systems are also easier on the airlines
for loading movies and music onto the planes. With videotape-based
systems, thousands of videotapes have to be shuffled on and off
planes each month, says Russ Johnson, director of strategic
marketing and inflight entertainment for Matsushita Avionics.
Matsushita's AVOD 1.5 system, currently in use on Singapore and
Malaysia airlines, uses portable media loaders instead.
</P>
<P>
   With new tape-based portable loaders, up to 110 hours of
programming (about 22 movies, 50 CDs and 40 short features) can be
uploaded to the server's 72GB hard drive in less than an hour,
Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's new Passport audio/video-on-demand system relies on a
fiberoptic network throughout the plane to provide the bandwidth
required for high-speed video distribution, according to
spokesperson Lori Krans. Typically, in-flight entertainment systems
use coaxial cable to transfer signals, but fiber can pass through
100 times more information than co-ax, Krans says.
</P>
<P>
   VGA monitors allow the display of text-based information such as
the Web pages that will be downloaded to the Sony and Matsushita
servers in the future. The pages will be modified for display on
smaller screens and chosen based on what the airlines want you to
see. Initially, Web access will be of the canned variety rather
than live.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't go live Internet right now because it's not
economically feasible,'' says Krans. Air-to-ground communication
speed is the primary obstacle, with the fastest ground-to-air data
speed available on aircraft currently being about 4,800 bits per
second.
</P>
<P>
   Cathay Pacific recently announced plans to start testing e-mail
and Internet service in January on 56 passenger jets. Customers
will use their own laptop PCs, which can be powered independently
at each seat. The plane's data system will enable more than 200
passengers to access data simultaneously using the Internet
satellite communications network.
</P>
<P>
   The hardware and service for Cathay's Internet service will be
provided by Seattle-based Tenzing Communications, a global Internet
service provider that will charge users $150 to $200 a year for
e-mail and Internet access. Passengers will register with Tenzing
prior to the flight to enable Web access.
</P>
<P>
   Each plane will be equipped with a proxy server that offers
different levels of Internet access: pages with one-month and
two-week shelf lives, for example, and then real-time information
such as stock quotes, e-mail and news headlines that will be
downloaded to the airplane's server every 15 minutes. Server
capacity will be 150,000 cached Web pages. Tenzing is currently
setting up partner relationships with information and e-commerce
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   As data speeds improve, so will passengers' options. Johnson of
Matsushita Avionics believes entertainment will move more in the
direction of interactivity. Matsushita's digital System 3000, which
will be introduced this year, will have the digital infrastructure
required to handle Web access, Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   The other hot area of in-flight entertainment is live TV beamed
down by satellite. Equipment from LiveTV, a joint venture between
Harris Corp. and Sextant In-Flight systems, receives signals from
three DIRECTV satellites via an antenna located in the top center
of an aircraft's fuselage and distributes them to individual
monitors throughout the plane.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue Airways was scheduled to be the first commercial carrier
to offer the LiveTV service when it opened for passenger business
in February, and Alaska Airlines and startup Legend lines plan to
offer the service as well.
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue also was on course to deliver 24 channels of DIRECTV
Airborne to each of its Airbus A3-300 aircraft. The short segments
of TV lend themselves well to domestic travel such as JetBlue's
short flights within New York state and from JFK International
Airport to Florida. Among the channels slated for service are four
ESPN channels, Travel Channel, Discovery Channel, Animal Planet,
The Weather Channel, CNNfn, The Learning Channel and Bloomberg
Television.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines is currently evaluating next-generation
systems from Sony and Matsushita, accord according to Tengawong
Yeoh, manager of in-flight entertainment. Whichever system the
airline selects for its next fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft, due to
be delivered in 2001, needs to be useful for seven years, he says.
</P>
<P>
   He envisions a future of high-speed Internet access and e-mail
capability, but air-to-ground satellite communication needs to be
available and affordable for that to be successful. Sending a
simple e-mail now can take an hour because of the slow data rate.
</P>
<P>
   Matsushita's Johnson foresees a shift in in-flight content from
90 percent audio and video to an even split with interactive
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on the quality of the entertainment,'' he says.
``As we find compelling Web sites and CD-ROM infotainment-type
material, you'll see that become more and more popular.''

 (ART ADV: An illustration of a car hood mechanism is available on
Newscom or by calling William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.) 
 By MIKE ALLEN 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BACK IN THE HOOD
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm OK for now, but I'm eventually going to need to get into
the engine compartment of my Buick Skylark. The problem is that the
hood release has broken, and there doesn't seem to be any way to
open the hood. My mechanic tried for almost an hour, and he can't
get at the mechanism through the radiator or from underneath. He
suggested cutting a hole in the hood with a blowtorch, but that
seems drastic.
</P>
<P>
   _ Terry Palms, Truth or Consequences, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: The cutting torch idea sounds more than drastic, it sounds
downright dangerous. Here's how to proceed: Find a car with the
identical hood release system. There are a couple of GM cars built
on the same platform as yours, so it doesn't necessarily have to be
a Skylark. Open the hood and get the lay of the land, so to speak.
I've done this to open hoods and locked gas cap doors.
</P>
<P>
   Find or make a tool that you can snake into the gap between the
hood and grille. You may need to be inventive. Practice on the open
hood of your example car until you can open it easily. Now you
should be able to pop the latch mechanism on your own car just as
easily. I opened a stuck hood some years ago with a piece of
16-gauge sheetmetal cut into a large hook shape. Other lock
mechanisms may respond better to a coat hanger bent into a small
hook or piece of thick welding rod, depending on whether it's
easier to push or pull.
</P>
<P>
   Last resort is to use a large hole saw on a drill directly above
the latch. It probably will cost only a hundred bucks or so to have
it welded back and painted.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your hood latch lubricated and properly adjusted to prevent
the new cable from breaking.
</P>
<P>
   INCREASE IN OIL USAGE
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a '94 Buick Century with a 2.2 engine. It's serviced
every 3,000 miles. About a year and a half ago it started to use
oil at the rate of about 1 quart every 3,000 miles. No mechanic is
concerned about this. But this isn't normal, and I believe
something is wrong. Could someone have done something wrong while
servicing it? I hate to think of an engine job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marlin Feaser, Lebanon, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, Marlin, it is normal for an internal combustion engine
to use some oil. One quart per 3,000 miles is well within the range
of normal. GM says consumption rates in the neighborhood of 1 quart
per 1,000 miles are normal. Oil needs to make its way down the
valve guides or past the rings to lubricate things. If you think an
engine uses no oil at all, you're mistaken. Oil analysis shows that
engine oil becomes diluted as it's in use _ sometimes to the tune
of 10 percent to 15 percent with water and unburned fuel residue.
This extra volume can compensate for oil usage and fool you on the
dipstick.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if you're not using the latest grade of oil, it may simply
be vaporized in your crankcase and carried out through the PCV
system. One of the things oil manufacturers try to do when they
blend oil is reduce its volatility so this doesn't happen. Engines
run a lot hotter than in the past, and the hotter the oil, the
faster it boils away. If you're going to a quick lube or mechanic
who's using a brand of oil that's more volatile than what you've
been using in the past, this could easily explain your oil
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   LIMITED
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently had a limited-slip differential installed by the
local Ford dealer in my 1996 F-350. It doesn't seem to make much
difference. The guys at the garage put it up on the lift, and spun
one rear wheel. The other wheel spins in the same direction, so
they say it's fine. But snowy roads still leave me stuck.
</P>
<P>
   _ Andrew G. Perry, Hendersonville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: And how often does it snow in Hendersonville, N.C.?
Seriously, however, most limited-slip differentials will work
better if there's a little load. When one rear wheel starts to
slip, pull the handbrake up a notch or two to give the differential
clutches something to bite against. If you have an automatic (not
likely on your F-350, I realize), just ride the brake pedal
lightly. Sounds weird, but it works.
</P>
<P>
   RUST NEVER SLEEPS
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently, while changing the oil on my 1992 Mercury Grand
Marquis, I noticed that the front part of the oil pan (near the
drain plug) had large rust spots. I went to wire-brush the spots
off and discovered that large areas of rust had formed between the
metallic coating and the metal of the pan. The entire coating
flaked off, exposing the metal. I primed the exposed metal, but I'm
concerned that the paint I applied doesn't provide enough
protection.
</P>
<P>
   _ Paul Herman, via Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: That plating was zinc galvanizing, and I'm surprised that it
all peeled off, but not surprised that the front of the pan was a
little rusty. It's exposed to a constant stream of gravel and
pebbles, and is usually sandblasted pretty thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Clear away any loose rust and paint, clean with solvent, and
paint with a rust-resistant paint. In my many years of working on
cars I've never seen a car that's driven regularly rust through its
oil pan. Cars in storage or a salvage lot, yes. But not one in
service. Relax.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave Hill, vehicle line executive and Corvette chief engineer,
calls his new Z06 model ``a car for the extreme driving
enthusiast.'' Indeed, with a power-to-weight ratio of 8.13
pounds/horsepower the Corvette Z06 is the quickest, fastest
Corvette ever built. Yes, bar none. According to Chevrolet, the Z06
goes from 0 to 60 mph in a lightning 4.0 seconds and rips through
the quarter-mile in 12.60 seconds at 115 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the former hardtop model, Chevrolet claims, it's not
only the quickest, but also the best-handling production Corvette
of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Providing the grunt for all this performance is a new version of
the venerable small-block engine, the LS6, which delivers 385
horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 385 foot-pounds of torque at 4,800 rpm.
The LS6 is the only engine available for the Z06, and is not
offered on other Corvette models.
</P>
<P>
   The LS6 designation is another expression of appreciation for
the accomplishments of earlier Corvette engineers. In 1971, a
special 425-horsepower (gross) bigblock V8 was created for the
Corvette, again with racing in mind. It was second only to the
legendary L88 racing engine that was available from 1967 to 1969.
Despite the fact that only 188 Corvettes were sold with the LS6
engine, it occupies a special niche in Corvette legend.
</P>
<P>
   The new LS6 is based on the 5.7-liter LS1, the standard Corvette
engine. Its aluminum block has been modified for better management
of crankcase pressures and speedier return of oil from the upper
part of the engine. The engine also has a more aggressive camshaft
profile to take full advantage of the additional air that
Corvette's new intake manifold provides.
</P>
<P>
   New high-compression cylinder heads (10.5:1 vs. 10.1:1 on the
LS1) have improved porting to get this larger volume of air
smoothly into the combustion chambers. The new heads are equipped
with stronger valve springs and larger fuel injectors. Exhaust gas
backpressure is relieved by the Z06's less restrictive titanium
exhaust system, which is 50 percent lighter than the stainless
steel system it replaces.
</P>
<P>
   Unique to the Z06 is a new six-speed transmission (M12) with
more aggressive gearing to increase torque multiplication in almost
every gear and for more rapid acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   The Z06 also features a suspension calibration that's all its
own, designated FE4. It features a larger front stabilizer bar,
stiffer rear leaf spring and revised camber settings, all
calibrated with a bias toward control during high-speed operation.
</P>
<P>
   Special Z06 specific forged-aluminum wheels are an inch wider
front and rear than those used on the coupe and convertible.
</P>
<P>
   New wider and stickier Goodyear Eagle SC Supercar tires were
created for the Z06. They feature reduced mass, an asymmetric tread
design for better grip, a more compliant sidewall and better wear.
</P>
<P>
   The Z06's FE4 suspension and its new wheels and tires allow the
car to take full advantage of the additional power available.
During development testing, Corvette engineers were able to
generate racetrack speeds that improved Z06 performance by an
average of 3 to 4 seconds per lap over last year's hardtop model on
typical 2-mile closed-circuit road courses.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers were aggressive in reducing mass. The Z06 has a
thinner windshield and rear backlite compared to a standard Vette.
The Z06 option list is very short to maintain weight-reduction
gains. All told, the Z06 is the lightest Corvette at just 3,133
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the performance the additional panache of its own front
end, functional side scoops, special emblems and upholstery, and
the Z06 comes up as a very special version of a very special car.

VENEZUELANS LEAVING FOR BETTER BUSINESS CLIMATE IN US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS _ The economy is shrinking and unemployment is
disturbingly high. But perhaps the most telling sign of Venezuela's
economic troubles may be in a word that residents have created:
``Mianeros,'' a name for those who've packed their bags and left to
seek better fortunes in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists estimate that as many as 150,000 Venezuelans
have left the country over the last two years for other, more
promising places like Florida to escape the country's protracted
crisis, which has seen a severe loss of jobs and an increase in
crime.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this problem that many experts say the country's
leftist president, Hugo Chavez, must now address after his
resounding reelection on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should talk more about opening markets and making Venezuela
more attractive for businesses if things are going to get better,''
said Roberto Bottome, director of VenEconomia, a think tank which
publishes an economic newsletter. ``If not, we'll continue to lose
businesses and we'll keep losing our most educated and talented
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite an economy which contracted by 7 percent last year and a
15 percent unemployment rate, Chavez, the 46-year-old,
beret-wearing former paratrooper, was given a strong endorsement
from voters on Sunday to proceed with his so-called ``peaceful
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He won 59 percent of the vote in an election that pitted his
fiery, populist platform against the more moderate and pro-business
agenda of Francisco Arias, a former military comrade. With more
than 80 percent of ballots counted, Arias had won 38 percent of the
vote. A third candidate, former Caracas Mayor Claudio Fermin, had
the remaining three percent.
</P>
<P>
   The election was part of a new constitution and political
overhaul that has been Chavez's main concern since he was first
elected in December 1998. But now that the president has solidified
his political power for at least the next six years, business and
industry leaders are urging him to put more emphasis on re-igniting
the country's stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in crisis for more than a year and more than three
with a depressed industrial sector,'' Juan Calvo, president of the
Industrial Federation of Venezuela, told the Caracas daily El
Universal. ``This has to be solved with energy and decisiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to thousands of supporters early Monday morning from a
balcony at the Miraflores presidential palace, Chavez vowed to make
economic growth a priority. But exactly how he would do that
remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who speaks frequently about ``a humane economy,'' seems
more drawn to a government-controlled economy like Cuba than a more
liberal free-market like Mexico's. Among other Latin American
leaders, Chavez stays closest to Cuban President Fidel Castro, who
used a Saturday press conference in Cuba to publicly send warm
wishes to his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be looking more at countries like the United States
as a model for fixing this economy,'' said Andres Alvarez, a
41-year-old restaurant owner in downtown Caracas who voted for
Chavez. ``Yes, I believe in helping the poor, but even the poor
will turn on him if things don't improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said Chavez will need a comprehensive strategy to
attract businesses and investors and to get the economy moving
again:
</P>
<P>
   --The country's legal code and labor laws must be revised to be
more business friendly.
</P>
<P>
   --Venezuela's growing crime problem must be tackled quickly.
</P>
<P>
   --The country's current image must be changed to one that
welcomes trade, not rejects it.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the country has lost more than 500,000
jobs and $3 billion in capital. Multinational companies such as
Unilever, Honda, Fiat and Warner-Lambert have either left Venezuela
or cut back their presence, taking white- and blue-collar jobs with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an investor or business decides to come here, there is a
long list of pros and cons that are considered,'' Bottome added.
``Right now, Venezuela has more cons.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez will have less than a veto-proof majority in the new
legislature to push whatever economic program his administration
puts together. His Patriotic Pole coalition won 60 percent of the
body's 165 seats, making it likely that he'll have to do some
negotiating with opposition parties to get his proposals approved.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Arias, 49, who stood by Chavez during a failed
1992 coup attempt only to break away and challenge him for the
presidency, pledged to continue leading a broad, business-oriented
opposition against the president's coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our responsibility to this country to keep fighting for
a stronger, better Venezuela,'' Arias, who has not yet conceded
defeat, said in a speech Monday. ``We will make sure that an
opposition exists to protect all citizens of this country, rich and
poor.''

PRIME-TIME SPEECH SCHEDULED AFTER BUSH'S BEDTIME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's nationally
televised, prime-time speech Thursday night accepting the
Republican presidential nomination will be the most important of
his career _ and it will be delivered after his bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   If there ever was a time during his presidential campaign that
Bush was most likely to mangle his speech, slaughter his syntax,
slur his words or drop nouns from his sentences, it almost always
was at night after a long, busy day.
</P>
<P>
   Bush typically hits the hay at about 9:30 p.m. and rises
sometime between 5:30 and 6:30 a.m. Bush's acceptance speech is set
to be delivered to the Republican National Convention at 10 p.m. in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope he'll have time for a nap Thursday afternoon,'' Bush
spokesman Karen Hughes said Monday. ``It's a late night, but he's
been looking forward to this moment and he'll make the most of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the campaign is counting on Bush not switching his
internal clock from Texas' Central Time to Philadelphia's Eastern
Time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's Central Time, it's close (to his bedtime). We're
assuming his body is still on Central Time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During the long days of campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire
last January, Bush often complained about missing his own bed. He
admitted even carrying his own pillow on the road to help ease his
slumber.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his more notable evening speech stumbles, Bush told a
crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, how in the post-Cold War world (which
he often describes as the ``post-Cold World``) the United States
can no longer focus on the Soviet Union as its enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also running because I want to keep the peace, keep the
peace,'' Bush said. ``When I was coming up, it was a dangerous
world and you knew exactly who the `they' were. It was us vs. them,
and it was clear who `them' was. Today we're not so sure who the
`they' are, but we know they're there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's days leading into the convention already appear to be on
the longish side _ running from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Texas first lady Laura Bush told Hughes about hearing a clock
chime at 3 a.m., then again at 4 and 5, as she lay awake nervously
thinking of the speech she was to deliver to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Bush) was teasing her for waking him up at 5 in the
morning,'' Hughes said, adding that Laura Bush responded that he
should thank her for delivering a convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech _ which takes 38 minutes to deliver without
interruptions _ is expected to run about 50 minutes at the
convention due to applause. Hughes said the speech has undergone a
small amount of rewriting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one section where he has consistently had trouble
saying it, and I thought as long as he's having trouble saying it
we ought to change the words and make it more comfortable for
him,'' Hughes said.

TUESDAY'S SPEAKERS AT THE GOP CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Corrects overline and intro to Tuesday, sted Monday) 
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the speakers on Tuesday evening's program:
</P>
<P>
   Condoleezza Rice
</P>
<P>
   Bush foreign policy adviser
</P>
<P>
   Condoleezza Rice is quarterback of Gov. George W. Bush's foreign
policy team, whose members have named themselves the ``Vulcans.'' A
statue of Vulcan, the god of metalworking in Roman mythology,
overlooks Rice's hometown of Birmingham, Ala. Of the foreign policy
team, Rice is the closest to Bush. He has said that he feels
comfortable asking her the most basic questions. An only child
raised in segregated Birmingham, Rice, 45, joined the faculty of
Stanford University in 1981, before becoming its youngest, first
female and first nonwhite provost.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole
</P>
<P>
   Former president of the American Red Cross
</P>
<P>
   A thirst for politics and a knack for leadership have made
Elizabeth Dole probably the most recognizable woman in the
Republican Party. Her appearance at the 1996 convention when she
introduced her husband, Bob Dole, was widely praised. She placed
second to Gov. George W. Bush in many national polls before
dropping out of the presidential race last year, and there had been
speculation that Bush had considered her as a vice presidential
contender. A native of Salisbury, N.C., she graduated from Duke
University with a degree in political science in 1958 and received
a law degree from Harvard in 1965. After marrying Sen. Bob Dole, a
Republican from Kansas in 1975, she worked for two Republican
presidents. In 1995, she left her job as president of the American
Red Cross to be at her husband's side during his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain
</P>
<P>
   Republican senator from Arizona
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is one of the Senate's most respected members.
Starting as a marginal candidate for president in 1999, McCain
emerged as a threat to Gov. George W. Bush in the primaries,
attracting independents and Democrats. Before dropping out in
March, he won primaries in New Hampshire and Michigan. McCain, 63,
was born in the Panama Canal Zone, the son of a naval officer. He
graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1958 and was a pilot
during the Vietnam War. In 1967, his plane was shot down over North
Vietnam and he spent five and a half years as a prisoner of war.
After retiring from the Navy, McCain moved to Arizona, and was
elected to Congress in 1982. He won the first of his three terms in
the Senate in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Funderburk Ware
</P>
<P>
   Family Advocate
</P>
<P>
   Having raised a daughter on her own, Patricia Funderburk Ware
knows the difficulties and hardships of being a single parent.
Living in Raleigh, N.C., she saw lifestyles that led to teen-age
pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases _ issues,
she has said, that are particularly epidemic in black communities.
These concerns are the focus of her work as president of the
Preserving Family Well-Being Foundation, an organization that
addresses the problems facing black families.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Roosevelt 4th
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Activist
</P>
<P>
   The great-grandson of the 26th president, is an investment
banker and an environmental activist. Roosevelt, a managing
director at Lehman Bros. and resident of Brooklyn, was appointed by
Gov. George Pataki of New York to be a board member of the Hudson
River Trust in March 1999. The trust is responsible for designing,
building and operating the Hudson River Park to stretch along the
waterfront of the West Side of Manhattan from Battery Park City to
59th Street.

   ATLANTA - Let the redevelopment of the Macy's building downtown
begin.
</P>
<P>
   Taconic Investment Partners of New York closed on its
acquisition of the historic property at Peachtree and Ellis streets
late last week. It bought the building with partner Benenson
Capital Co. The seller was Federated Department Stores of
Cincinnati, which leased back part of the building for a condensed
Macy's store.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Taconic principal Paul Pariser said a majority of the
building _ floors two through six _ will be renovated and leased to
Internet, e-commerce and telecommunications companies. ``We will
commence our redevelopment activity shortly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mathews, a Colliers Cauble &AMP; Co. executive vice president
who represented Federated, declined to comment on the sale price.
However, based on similar recent sales, the building likely fetched
about $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction culminates five years of planning for Federated,
which had been seeking an agreement that would allow it to sell the
Macy's building and keep the store open. Downtown boosters hoped
the upper levels would be converted to residential use, and Post
Properties made a run at the building.
</P>
<P>
   The new office and telecom space will bring 500 to 800 workers
to the building, Pariser said. In January, he said the new space
would house 700 to 1,000 workers, but he lowered the estimate after
Taconic decided against adding space to the building's top three
floors. For now, 360,000 square feet will be marketed as high-tech
and telecom switching space.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the telecom space has been ``tremendous,''
especially from telecommunications and collocation companies, said
Casey Neel, an Insignia/ESG broker who is marketing the space.
``Anybody who comes through for telecommunications space looks at
the Macy's building,'' he said. ``It's hard not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Collocation companies lease space that houses telecom and
computer equipment of several companies. The buildings also are
known as telecom hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Neel said the building's location in the heart of downtown and
its proximity to fiber-optic trunk lines make it a natural for
telecom companies.
</P>
<P>
   The redeveloped Macy's building will be similar to, although
much smaller than, buildings such as 111 Eighth Ave. in New York
that Taconic converted to telecom use.
</P>
<P>
   It houses companies such as WorldCom, Fibernet Telecom Group and
Broadwing Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Pariser said Taconic will seek similar tenants for the renovated
space at the Macy's building, which it has renamed AtlantaXchange.
</P>
<P>
   Federated will condense the downtown Macy's store from 4 1/2 to
three floors, including the Cellar and mezzanine areas. The store
will contain about 200,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Federated has committed to a 20-year lease with options to
extend the lease for an additional 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   A separate entrance for the office space will be constructed at
the corner of Peachtree and Ellis.

CHRISTIAN RIGHT TONES IT DOWN FOR GOP CONVENTION

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ While the religious right is still a key presence
at the Republican National Convention, its tone and role are more
low key and less, shall we say, evangelical than in the last
several years.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the change, Republicans say, is that the
large bloc of religious conservatives who remain in the GOP fold
has, by mutual consent, agreed that any public feuds or harsh
rhetoric would only serve to undermine the party's overriding
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, it isn't so much their tremendous enthusiasm for
Bush as a desire to beat Gore,'' said Jeff Bell, a GOP consultant
who worked for the primary campaign of moral conservative Gary
Bauer until the former Family Research Council chief packed it in
after the March primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is not militant on the issues important to social
conservatives, but getting him is a lot better than 12 years of
Clinton-Gore,'' Bell said. ``That's more the glue that unites.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that widely known figures like televangelist and
Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson will not have speaking
roles at the convention, and moral traditionalists like Bauer, Alan
Keyes and Steve Forbes, whose campaign crusades all sputtered this
year, also will be out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   But besides the desire to defeat Al Gore in November, there are
other reasons for the change in strategy, a result of both design
and necessity.
</P>
<P>
   The necessity comes from the series of reversals that Christian
conservatives have faced in recent years. Chief among them is the
simple fact that none of their champions has lasted very long in
the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   This means that come convention time, religious right
organizations don't have much leverage. Candidates have not had to
pay court to Christian conservatives (even though many believe that
indifference to evangelicals came back to haunt Bob Dole at the
voting booths in 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the granddaddy of the religious right lobbies, the
Christian Coalition, has gone through a series of well-publicized
travails. In 1997, after the Dole debacle and the advent of
Clinton-Gore II, Robertson's savvy young lieutenant, Ralph Reed,
left the Christian Coalition to go into private consulting, and the
organization's leadership has been a revolving door ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year, the IRS won a long-running case that strips the
Christian Coalition of its tax-exempt status as a nonpartisan
group, a decision that contributed to the financial woes dogging
the group in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Robertson has righted the ship a bit, using some of
his own money to bail the group out and returning to take an active
role in guiding the organization he started after his own GOP
presidential run in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But the Christian Coalition is not as feared as it once was, and
Robertson seems to have adjusted to that reality by taking a new
tack of going mainstream. He embraced a Bush candidacy early and
enthusiastically, pledging to work from within for Bush rather than
agitating from without. Party leaders made it clear that would also
mean accepting a diminished role in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robertson's a lightning rod at this point,'' said Steve Benen
with Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, a
religious right watchdog group. ``He's well known but not
necessarily well liked, especially at the national level.''
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways the metamorphosis of the so-called ``religious
right'' is also a consequence of its own successes.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority in the late 1970s,
the religious right has always been essentially a grassroots
movement, and that is now paying off. For example, Christian
Coalition allies and operatives are estimated to have taken control
of Republican organizations in at least 17 states.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, however, Christian conservatives without
formal affiliation to outside lobbies have steadily integrated
themselves into the fabric of the party to the point that more than
a third of the GOP delegates in Philadelphia identify themselves as
evangelicals, and more than two-thirds say they are sympathetic to
the religious right's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a transformation of the Republican Party as
more of them (evangelical Christians) have become party
activists,'' said James Guth, a political scientist of the
religious right at Furman University in South Carolina. ``Most of
the evangelical Christian leaders are themselves delegates and
elected political officials. They don't need an external
organization to speak for them.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   The transformation also means that Christian conservatives tend
to be more temperate than they were in the days of Patrick
Buchanan, who defected to the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is about the need to compromise, and it has induced a
little more pragmatism among Christian conservatives,'' Guth said.
As political insiders, he said, ``they have more of a stake in the
outcome (of the election), and so they make judgments about when to
push and when not to push.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Combs, the Christian Coalition spokeswoman and a
longtime activist in the organization, agreed, saying the low
profile of the religious right at the Philadelphia convention is in
fact a sign of their acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a place at the table. We are part of what is going
on. Our role now is to go into the convention united and to come
out of the convention united. We are there to get support for our
issues, and Gov. Bush has shown he is willing to do that. We may
not be out there tooting our horn on television,'' Combs said,
``but we are definitely a presence.''

 &HT;    TIGHT REIN ON RHETORIC SOFTENS REPUBLICAN IMAGE
 &HT;    By TOM BAXTER
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Unsympathetic Democrats dismiss it as a
camouflage that the Republicans will soon discard if they get Gov.
George W. Bush elected. Republicans defend it as a pragmatic
restatement of what they've always believed.
</P>
<P>
   But does either explanation fully explain the softened edges of
this year's Republican National Convention?
</P>
<P>
   In part, the generally less strident, more ``inclusive'' (this
week's buzzword) tone of this gathering amounts to a tighter job of
stage managing.
</P>
<P>
   What is remembered as the disastrous Houston convention of 1992
would have seemed much less hard-edged if it had not included Pat
Buchanan's ``culture war'' speech, and those involved in that
convention insist they didn't know what the conservative firebrand
was going to say.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is not even in the party this time, and this Bush
campaign is riding much closer herd on those who will speak.
</P>
<P>
   It really is nothing new for Republicans to present a less
conservative image and for Democrats to act less liberal at their
conventions in an effort to win over the broad middle of the
American electorate.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the party's platform and the list of those who will
speak clearly does indicate that at least in the face it presents
to America, the GOP has turned the page from the era when the party
openly pursued so-called ``wedge issues'' to divide traditionally
Democratic conservative voters from their party.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Schlafly, a conservative stalwart whose edge has never
been in question and who was attending a fund-raiser for House
Republicans Bob Barr of Georgia and Dan Burton of Indiana, did not
appear entirely thrilled by the new tone of the party Monday. But
she, too, was on board with a campaign Republicans of all stripes
hope will deliver them back to the Promised Land of Pennsylvania
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The platform, she observed, was ``muted,'' and she wished more
``interesting'' speakers, such as Barr or Burton, could have been
included in the convention program. But she demurred from open
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're happy enough to support the ticket,'' Schlafly
said of conservative Republicans like herself. ``Bush has pretty
well corralled all sections of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   The most striking instance of this softened tone is the almost
total absence of any mention of Bill Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to hear very little mention of Bill Clinton at
this convention, but that's because the message has penetrated,''
said Floyd Brown, a longtime Clinton critic from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just an absence of broadsides at the Democratic
president that is noticeable. When Rep. Bill McCollum, who is
running for the U.S. Senate in Florida this year, spoke during the
day Monday, his role as one of Clinton's House prosecutors got
barely a mention.
</P>
<P>
   It confuses things to say this amounts to the Republicans
becoming more liberal, which they are not. ``Civic'' _ as opposed
to ``political'' _ is another word that has been tossed around, and
while that may not be a perfect description, it's closer to the
mark.
</P>
<P>
   One might be ``civic'' and still be conservative, but like the
candidate himself, the word implies a softer rhetoric than has been
applied in the past.

 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ George Bush is ahead today but Karl Rove, the
campaign's chief strategist, said the lead can vanish because
``large swaths of the country are up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   The commanding double-digit advantage Bush now holds in most
public polls will fade, Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election is far from over,'' he said. By Labor Day, Rove
predicts, the gap between Bush and Democratic Vice President Al
Gore will shrink to single-digits ``one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be points after the Democratic convention
(Aug. 14-18) where, in all likelihood, we're going to be behind,''
Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio are some of the states in
play, Rove said, with Bush and Gore ``close to parity'' in all
three.
</P>
<P>
   Republican governors in all three of those states have been
``very helpful to the campaign,'' Rove said in a wide-ranging
discussion of electoral map strategy, key issues and swing voters
over breakfast with reporters at the Republican National
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything until now has been the preliminaries,'' Rove said.
``We get to the serious part now.'' Some of the concerns on the
Bush campaign manager's mind:
</P>
<P>
   THE ``BOUNCE''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates traditionally enjoy a surge, or bounce, in support
levels in the wake of a successful national convention, but Rove
said Bush may have already had his _ a spike in his polls after his
choice last week of Richard Cheney for the vice presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have seen the convention bounce, prompted by the vice
presidential choice, before the convention,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   FINDING 270 ELECTORAL VOTES
</P>
<P>
   That's the number needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the claims of many pundits, Rove said it is too
early to characterize the election simply as a struggle for a
handful of industrial states, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Michigan and Illinois, with the outcome virtually predictable
everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are as many electoral votes in Oregon and Washington as
there are in Michigan,'' Rove said, ``and we're up in Washington
and Oregon.''
</P>
<P>
   Both are states the Democrats expect to carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Missouri, Georgia and Iowa in play'' and Bush is
slightly ahead in Connecticut, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
   California is winnable for Bush, Rove insisted, although polls
show Gore slightly ahead. ``We should be getting our brains beat in
California,'' Rove said. ``The fact that we are not shows a
weakness in Gore and an opportunity for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida has been trending Republican and with Bush's brother,
Jeb, the governor there, Rove said he expects Bush to win the
state. But Florida decides late, Rove said, and the non-Cuban
Latino voters outside Miami do not want to be taken for granted, so
Bush will have to campaign in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is an uphill climb,'' Rove acknowledged, the biggest
state where Gore has a solid lead in the polls. ``But New York is
fickle,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   Rove claims Alaska and all the states between the Sierra Nevada
and the Missouri River, for Bush _ Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, New
Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska and Kansas _
with 100 electoral college votes among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are in very good shape for us today,'' Rove said, with
public polls showing Bush leading by 10 or more points in each of
those states except New Mexico, where he is up by 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   Rove adds another 112 Southern electoral college votes, not
counting Tennessee, Gore's home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Add in Indiana and we're at about 226 electoral votes, and
we've got to find 44 more,'' Rove said. Bush faces ``an
embarrassment of opportunities'' to do that, Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bush is ahead in Missouri with 11 electoral votes,
Washington with ll, Ohio with 21, Michigan with 18, Pennsylvania
with 23, Iowa 7, Wisconsin with 11, Delaware with 3, Vermont with
3, and New Hampshire and Maine with 4 each, according to Rove, who
said he expects to see ``some diminution'' of Bush's strength in
the West and the South, but not much. Bush will be able to make up
elsewhere ``whatever ground we may lose in those two regions.''
Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   SWING VOTERS
</P>
<P>
   Rove said the Bush campaign will focus particularly hard on
three groups:
</P>
<P>
   _ Men and women who live in the nation's older suburbs, whom he
described as ``weak Republicans'' or ``unaffiliated independents.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Catholics, who vote in large numbers in several Midwestern
industrial battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   _ Latinos, present in signficant numbers in a small number of
battleground states. They are ``weakly linked'' to the Democratic
Party and ``quite variable in their degree of turnout,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATING GORE
</P>
<P>
   Rove's strategy is to gleefully inflate expectations that Gore
will dominate the debates and minimize chances that Bush will do
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our debate strategy can be summed up in one word: survive,''
Rove said. ``We hope to survive Bush's necessary appearance in
debates against the world's most preeminent debater, the man who is
more proficient at hand-to-hand debate combat than anybody. He's
the world's best.''
</P>
<P>
   ISSUES VS. PERSONALITY
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are spreading a myth that Bush wants to keep the
election focused on personality, not issues, Rove asserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to run on personality and issues,'' Rove said. Bush's
five main issues: Reform education, reform Social Security and
Medicare, cut taxes, rebuild the military, take the next step in
welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   The convention itself, Rove said, will give Bush the opportunity
to ``share Bush's issue agenda and to allow people to see what's on
his heart, what motivates him and what his principles and
convictions are.''

 &HT;    Overweight folks must stand up to their doctors
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judi Dandy remembers her worst trip to the doctor. She went to
see an internist because, in the course of a few hours, she lost
all feeling in her left thigh.
</P>
<P>
   After poking pins into her legs through her pantyhose, he told
her his professional opinion: She was fat. His prescription: She
should lose weight. Then he charged her $75 for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   She left, still numb _ now mentally, as well as physically.
There is a fairly common condition, ``meralgia paresthetic,'' in
which the thigh can lose feeling because of excess weight. But
Dandy was angry that the doctor didn't explain the diagnosis,
examine her or order any other test to see whether the cause might
be linked to a more serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   Her left side did return to normal within a few weeks, but the
incident left her wary of the health care system. Now, she screens
doctors to try to make sure she's going to get the care she needs,
not just a lecture about something she's already painfully aware
of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, (obese) people cannot go to a doctor without having
them tell us that everything, everything, is related to our
weight,'' said Dandy, a 57-year-old Roswell, Ga., resident who is
about 100 pounds overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Such experiences, medical professionals say, are keeping many
overweight patients from doctors' offices and making them forgo
preventive services in order to avoid ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though every doctor's office now has obese and overweight
patients, we still find there is a problem of some people really
being treated with disrespect,'' said Susan Yanovski, director of
the Obesity and Eating Disorders Program at the National Institutes
of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Few studies have examined how many obese people may avoid
medical treatment, out of embarrassment or because of doctors'
insensitivity. But with half of Americans now considered overweight
and one in five classified as obese, according to a recent study by
the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it's
an issue that's getting a second look by public health agencies.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a minor concern: Obese men and women have significantly
higher rates of heart disease, diabetes and some cancers, numerous
studies have shown. Consequently, it's in the best interest of both
doctors and patients with weight problems to see one another in a
consistent, scheduled manner.
</P>
<P>
   And yet doctors must, in some ways, be like neighborhood cops.
They should be friendly enough to foster trust and communication
with those at risk. But at some point, they also have a
responsibility to point out _ and try to stop _ dangerous behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, it's difficult to find that balance. And
sometimes, doctors bring prejudices about weight to the office,
which can make a patient's visit a gantlet of humiliation and
shame.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn McAfee, director of the Council on Size &AMP; Weight
Discrimination, a New York-based advocacy group for the overweight,
has collected several such incidents of disrespect, such as:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A woman sprained her ankle but was initially unable to
convince her doctor that she needed treatment. Finally he agreed to
prescribe anti-inflammatory medicine, telling her, ``Take this with
food, which shouldn't be a problem for you.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Another woman, who wanted to get pregnant, was told by her
doctor that if she succeeded, he would recommend abortion.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A grandmother, berated by her doctor about her weight,
confessed that she started fasting and drinking a bottle of
laxatives before stepping on the scale at the doctor's office. A
heart patient, she did this every other week.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two percent of obese patients say that a health care
worker has suggested that they lose weight, with the most likely
candidates for such advice being middle-aged women with higher
education, according to a study published in October in The Journal
of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   But too often, the advice is to diet, even though studies
indicate that less than 5 percent of dieters keep off the weight
they've lost for more than five years. Miriam Berg, the weight
discrimination council's president, for example, has lost more than
300 pounds through the years on diets, and she's gained every pound
back. Dandy has been on more than two dozen diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I told patients I had a cancer cure, but it had
less than a 10 percent success rate and it was going to cost a
bundle of money, I'd be laughed right out of the office,'' said Dr.
Allen King, a California endocrinologist who has been working with
diabetic patients, many of them obese, for almost three decades.
``And yet, we keep trying to sell this to overweight patients, and
they're supposed to take it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, experts say, doctors and patients should discuss more
lasting lifestyle changes _ to move more, eat less _ that go beyond
fad diets and short-term solutions. Such discussions remove the
stigma of obesity and instead center on advice everyone should
follow, regardless of what the scale says.
</P>
<P>
   For example, federal guidelines say that people should eat five
servings of fruits and vegetables a day, along with two servings of
animal protein and two to three servings of low-fat dairy products.
And everyone should exercise for a minimum of 30 minutes three
times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, according to a new poll conducted by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, three out of every 10 Southerners say they
never exercise, and another two of every 10 exercise only one or
two days a week. One-third of the Southerners polled said they eat
no fruit or vegetables on an average day or consume one serving at
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health is not always necessarily a size issue,'' said Dee
Hakala, who weighs 220 pounds and is a winner of the Nike Fitness
Innovation Award and runs aerobics classes for the overweight.
``It's a movement issue. ... it's a healthy-lifestyle issue.''
</P>
<P>
   And doctors can create a more hospitable environment for obese
people just by making a few changes in their offices, experts say.
Instead of tiny chairs with armrests, they could include love seats
or larger chairs without armrests. They could offer gowns and blood
pressure cuffs that actually fit. And an article titled
``Size-Friendly Waiting Rooms,'' in ``Radiance: The Magazine for
Large Women,'' suggests that doctors display artwork that depicts
``diversity of body size.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to keep saying, `I may be bigger, but I deserve equal
treatment,''' said Hakala. ``You cannot let them bully you
around.''
</P>
<P>
   GETTING RESPECT
</P>
<P>
   Overweight people can get better medical treatment if they're
willing to become more assertive about their needs. Experts
recommend:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Call a new doctor before a scheduled appointment and simply
ask whether he or she is comfortable with heavier people. The
doctor may not tell the truth, but a patient might be able to sense
any significant discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Acknowledge that weight might be playing a role in an illness
or injury, but remind the doctor to check other factors as well. It
is not acceptable to get a diet speech when you need treatment for
the flu.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't be combative. Instead, patients should work with their
doctors to try to find a way to improve their health that feels
comfortable to both.

LAURA BUSH STEPS INTO THE LIMELIGHT &HT;    (EDS: Story will update after speech is delivered at 10 p.m.)
 &HT;    By DAN FREEDMAN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Defying her reputation as a prim,
noncontroversial former librarian, Texas first lady Laura Bush took
a swipe at the Clinton-Gore administration Monday night, telling
delegates to the Republican National Convention that if her husband
becomes president he ``will not change with the winds of polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a giant step into the limelight in a prime-time speech on
the convention's opening night, Bush addressed presidential
character _ an issue that regularly registers as a high priority
among voters in polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known (George W. Bush) through big legislative successes
and a few defeats,'' Laura Bush said, according to a transcript of
her speech released before her address. In a reference to her
husband's former ownership of the Texas Rangers baseball team, she
said: ''I sat by his side during some winning and many losing
baseball seasons. But George never loses sight of home plate.``
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush's remarks were a veiled slap at Texas Gov. George W.
Bush's Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, who has been
characterized by Republicans as waffling on issues and saying
anything to get elected. It also is a jab at President Clinton,
whose presidency has been marked by similar accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's ``core principles will not change with the winds
of polls or politics or fame or fortune or misfortune,'' she said
in an address that focused largely on education.
</P>
<P>
   On education, she and her husband had tried to impart to their
twin daughters the lessons their parents had taught them, that
``reading is entertaining and interesting and important. ''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is running for president ``to make sure every child
in America has that same opportunity to grow up reading,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The convention represented a big stage for Laura Bush. She
agreed to marry Bush in 1977 on condition that she would never have
to deliver a political speech on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only political promise I ever broke,'' the governor
has told innumerable campaign crowds over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   For Laura Welch Bush, it has been something of a long, strange
trip between the tumbleweed plains of Midland, Texas, where she
cruised Agnes' drive-in for hamburgers, to potential first lady
whose family life is publicly picked over in sometimes excruciating
detail.
</P>
<P>
   In between, there were stops in Houston and Austin as a teacher
and librarian. And there was the mutual friends' barbecue in 1977
where she met Bush. It was an encounter she had actually resisted
because she did not think she would have anything in common with
someone from a political family. (Bush's father was a U.S. House
member from Texas before becoming president and his grandfather was
a U.S. senator from Connecticut.)
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes were married in November 1977. Laura Bush was 31, the
last of her longtime friends to walk to the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Ambition, power and fame _ with all the trimmings _ are not life
qualities to which Laura Bush aspired. ``Traditional,''
``reluctant,'' and ``sheltered'' are words she has used to describe
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, on the campaign trail, she has grown into the role of
high-profile political spouse. She has stumped on her own, talking
about the topic of her convention speech: education. On the
campaign plane when she is traveling with the candidate himself,
Laura Bush is relaxed and informal up to a point, reminding some
reporters of helpful librarians they might have known in grade
school.
</P>
<P>
   Don Evans, a longtime family friend who serves as Bush's
campaign manager, described Laura Bush as ``a lady who's full of
grace'' and ``somebody America will love.''
</P>
<P>
   Has there been a campaign-trail learning curve for her? ``Well,
there is for everybody,'' Evans responded. ``But I guarantee you,
she's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, 53, was the only child of a Harold Welch, a home
builder, and Jenna Welch, who did bookkeeping for him and read
books to Laura aloud.
</P>
<P>
   She knew her future husband just barely in junior high school
before the Bushes moved from Midland to Houston and Bush was sent
to boarding school in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   About the only blip on the screen of her life is when at the age
of 17, she ran a stop sign in Midland. Her car collided with a
vehicle driven by another teen-ager, a boy she knew. He was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was painful, of course,'' she told one interviewer. It
was ``a very tragic time in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush graduated from Southern Methodist University in
Dallas in 1968. Like her future husband at Yale, the social turmoil
and experimentation of the 1960s passed her by.
</P>
<P>
   She spent the first part of the 1970s as an elementary school
teacher and librarian in Houston and Austin, earning a master's
degree in library science at the Austin campus of the University of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching in a predominantly minority school in Houston and not
marrying until after age 30 shows she was ``in many ways very
contemporary,'' as she told one interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after their marriage, Laura Bush gave birth to twin
girls, Barbara and Jenna _ named after the couple's mothers.
Barbara will attend Yale University this fall and Jenna will go to
the University of Texas in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the Bushes are a classic odd couple. He is at times
a garrulous jokester who bounces off the walls; she is mostly quiet
and demure. But by all accounts, Laura Bush has been the yin to her
husband's yang.
</P>
<P>
   She has a calming effect on him and years ago helped him quit
drinking before it became a problem. But she acknowledges that he,
in turn, adds a few thrills to her life that she might not
otherwise have expected.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush was not wild about the idea of her husband running
for governor of Texas in 1994. And earlier this year she told the
Associated Press, ``I was the last person on board'' when Gov. Bush
was weighing a White House bid.
</P>
<P>
   But if her service as first lady of Texas is any indication,
Laura Bush may well warm to the role of national first lady should
her husband vanquish Gore. From the governor's mansion, Laura Bush
has raised money and lobbied fiercely for Texas libraries and
programs to teach reading to pre-school children.
</P>
<P>
   The education theme of Monday night's speech drew polite sniffs
from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaigns are asking the spouses to do different things,''
said Joseph Andrew, chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
who as at the Republican National Convention at the behest of
various media organizations. Gore's wife ``Tipper speaks out on
substantive issues'' such as mental health, Andrew said. ``With
Laura Bush, the (Republican) campaign has asked her to talk
non-specific generalities because they can't talk about the issues
or the record ... Texas is one of the worst places to raise
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Andew was referring to studies showing Texas ranking at the
bottom of various social indicators. In one such study earlier this
year by the nonpartisan, Baltimore-based Annie E. Casey Foundation,
Texas ranked 44th among 50 states in rates of child poverty.

 &HT;    Period of separation will soon end for mother, son
 &HT;    By Jane O. Hansen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Kimberly Howard last saw her son in January 1989,
he was a curly-haired 6-year-old full of wonder and excitement.
</P>
<P>
   The child was about to board a plane with his father to visit
grandparents in Saudi Arabia. She didn't know at the time that her
ex-husband had no intention of bringing their son back.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later she received the call at her Atlanta home. Laith _
the boy whose wide brown eyes and smile she treasured _ would not
be coming home. Not ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the day my descent into hell began,'' said Howard,
now 42.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 11 years, the mother hoped, despaired, fumed and
fought _ pursuing every person and State Department official she
could who might help get her son back. She even contacted a
vigilante group to see if it could rekidnap her son. ``Then you
realize nobody cares,'' she said. ``It was a civil issue. It had
nothing to do with our relations with Saudi Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   The day came when she packed away the little boy's pictures in a
box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got too painful,'' she said. ``I realized Laith wasn't
coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   But six weeks ago, another call came. On June 23, Howard checked
the messages on her answering machine in San Diego, where she had
moved to be closer to her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Mum?'' an adult-sounding male voice said. ``This is
Laith.'' He told her he loved her and wanted to see her. It was the
first time she'd heard his voice in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started crying,'' Howard said last week, crying again
as she spoke. ``I was in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard's family calls it a miracle. Laith Khayyat _ who will be
18 in October _ is due to arrive late tonight in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm numb,'' Howard said. ``I thought I'd never see him again.
``
</P>
<P>
   Howard met Abdulaziz Khayyat in the early 1980s while the two
were students at San Diego University. She was tall,
strawberry-blonde, studying business. He was slender, dark-haired,
a student of engineering. They fell in love, married and had a son.
</P>
<P>
   When Laith was a baby, Khayyat convinced his young wife to
return with him to Saudi Arabia, where he was the prized son of the
king's tailor. Howard soon realized that even an American woman
could not travel, speak, dress or act as she pleased there. She
eventually escaped with her son in a dramatic ruse orchestrated
with the help of her parents and an American couple in Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband was transferred back to the United States about
a year later, Howard served him with divorce papers, and a
California court awarded her custody of their son.
</P>
<P>
   But the bitterness wore off in time. Howard decided the boy
needed his father, and the two worked out amicable visitations. It
seemed to be working until Howard moved to Atlanta to take over a
day care center. While she was getting settled in their new home,
she let Laith visit his paternal grandparents. It was a
life-changing decision, one she calls shamefully stupid.
</P>
<P>
   After he was gone, she kept pictures of Laith on the bulletin
board at her day care center. She tried to live normally, and says
she grew to love a nearby lake, where she rented pontoon boats and
swam with friends. But she calls her time in Atlanta a dark period
in her life.
</P>
<P>
   In those first years after her son was taken, Howard frequently
called the State Department, which opened a case but offered little
hope. ``Can we go in there with a vigilante squad and guns and
remove the child from the home?'' a spokeswoman said in 1992. ``No,
we cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently there are 950 similar cases of children abducted by a
parent and taken to a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   As years passed, Howard became increasingly depressed.
Thanksgiving and Christmas were lonely holidays. ``I had nothing to
celebrate,'' she said. She realizes now why she lost so many
friends. She could not get over the loss of her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's lives go on,'' she said. ``Mine stopped. It's very
difficult for people to understand. Even your family. Nobody wants
to hear about stuff like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she says, the State Department closed Howard's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, a miracle,'' said Jane Howard, Kim's sister in
Charlotte, N.C. On June 19, Laith walked into a U.S. consulate and
said he wanted to find his mother. The State Department quickly
retrieved Howard's file and tracked her down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew that Laith would try to find us,'' Jane Howard
said.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving that first message from Laith, Howard bought a
tape recorder to record his next call, and she and her family began
to prepare for his homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   They've rented an ultra-stretch limousine, big enough to carry
her parents, two sisters and their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be better to have a group meet him,''
Howard said. ``I'm kind of scared. And I'm sure he is too. I want
him to know that he has a family here who loves him and has missed
him very much.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, Laith called again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was in shock, having finally gotten hold of me,''
Howard said. ``He wanted to hear my voice.''
</P>
<P>
   He told her they needed to sit down and talk. ``I let him carry
the conversation,'' Howard recalled. ``I was scared. He said he
loved me and his father, and it's very hard for him.''
</P>
<P>
   He told her he'd applied for a scholarship through an oil
company that would pay for his education in the United States. He
said he wanted to be an engineer or a doctor, but he didn't know
whether he would remain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was killing me, but I didn't say anything,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   They talked for more than an hour. ``He's matured,'' she said.
``He does have a Saudi accent, but he speaks excellent English.''
</P>
<P>
   When he asked why she had never visited him in Saudi Arabia, she
hesitated. ``I said, 'Well, the country doesn't allow women to
travel.' He doesn't understand how harsh it is.''
</P>
<P>
   She says at some point she will explain what happened _ how his
father wouldn't even let her talk to him on the phone. But for now,
she doesn't want to scare him away with criticisms of his father.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard for Howard to imagine what her son looks like. He told
her he was 196 centimeters, slightly over 6 feet 5 inches tall. His
hair is still curly, ``and he made a point of telling me that he
does not look like his dad,'' she said, laughing. ``I don't think
his dad has allowed him to have any pictures of me, trying to wipe
me out of Laith's memory. I always wondered, did he remember me?''
</P>
<P>
   She says they were both nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the scary part,'' she said. ``In my mind, he's still 6
years old. ``
</P>
<P>
   Now he's a mature young man. ``He's a smart kid. He's really
thought about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that call, she's been in a fog _ excited but tortured by
the wait. Although she taped the July 4 conversation, she
accidentally erased it. Last weekend, she left the house with her
shirt on backward. ``It's just overwhelming,'' she said. ``I'm a
bundle of nerves.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard wants her story to be an inspiration to others. ``There
are a lot of men and women out there whose children were
abducted,'' she said. ``I know not all of them turn out like this.
I mean, I still don't know what's going to happen. But there is
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   She admits she's still angry. ``The thing is, he's a young man.
I lost his growing up,'' she said. ``But I'm not going to focus on
the past. You have to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Laith called again. This time she got it on tape
for good.
</P>
<P>
   He told her he would be coming home Tuesday, that his father had
bought him the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you coming to visit or go to school?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm staying with you, Mum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday, I can't wait. Oh, I'm so happy,'' the mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me too, Mum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't wait to see you,'' she said. ``It's been so long.
I love you so much, I can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you too, Mum.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the State Department said Laith was still scheduled to
arrive today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been over 11 years,'' Howard said. ``Another day won't
matter.''

 &HT;    Disciplines converge at Center for Brain Research
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRBORN, Ohio _ The new Center for Brain Research at Wright
State University's School of Medicine will encourage collaboration
among scientists who study different aspects of the brain's
functions in health and disease.
</P>
<P>
   The center was established in July with a donation from the
Kettering Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Departments ranging from anatomy, physiology, biophysics,
neurology and psychiatry will share the laboratories, imaging
technology and research staff of the new center in the school's
Biological Sciences Building.
</P>
<P>
   ``No single laboratory or experimental approach can solve the
technical problems presented by the diversity of structures and
functions in the brain and central nervous system,'' said Robert
Fyffe, the researcher who is the center's first director.
``Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for the future of
brain research.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Fyffe cited the collaborative process in
determining the function of a protein called TASK-1, which helps
move potassium in and out of brain cells. Researchers from Wright
State and Imperial College in London recently reported their
results in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
journal.
</P>
<P>
   They determined that TASK-1 helps regulate the communication of
nerve impulses from brain cell to brain cell. Learning that raised
the possibility of someday regulating that potassium flow to help
treat epilepsy, ataxia and other neurological disorders that result
from hyperactive or uncoordinated communication among brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``What starts off as a fundamental research question in basic
science can suddenly appear to have direct clinical relevance,''
Fyffe said. ``None of us know where the questions will take us.''

   Wanted: Your genes.
</P>
<P>
   A California startup called DNA Sciences is introducing a Web
site this week that will recruit people to donate their DNA to help
find genes that cause disease. The company, which has James D.
Watson, a discoverer of the DNA double helix, as a director and
James H. Clark, Netscape's founder, as an investor, hopes to get
50,000 to 100,000 people to contribute to its ``Gene Trust'' by
appealing to their altruism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knowledge we gain from the Gene Trust has the potential to
change medicine forever,'' the site, DNA.com, intones. ``But we
can't do it without your help.''
</P>
<P>
   The new effort reflects a big change taking place in genetics.
Studies to link genes to disease are starting to be done on an
unprecedented scale, involving far more people than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent unraveling of the human genome, scientists are
cataloging hundreds of thousands of differences in the genetic
makeup of different individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out which genes contribute to disease could help in
developing drugs. In the future people might have their genes
tested to know if they are susceptible to certain diseases. And
instead of the current practice of one-drug-fits-all, patients
might have their genes tested to see which drug would work best for
them, a field known as pharmacogenetics.
</P>
<P>
   But to get to that point, scientists must first determine which
of hundreds of thousands of genetic variations contribute to which
disease or to the effectiveness of a particular drug. And that will
require ``disease association studies'' _ surveying many people to
find statistical correlations.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, scientists usually found disease-causing genes by
studying a few families or some isolated village with a high
prevalence of a disease. Such genes have often been for rare
inherited diseases, in which a defect in a single gene is at fault.
</P>
<P>
   But that technique is becoming less effective, said Neil J.
Risch, professor of genetics at Stanford University. The diseases
of most interest to drug companies and the public health, he said,
are common ones like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's
and schizophrenia. It is believed many genes contribute to such
diseases, with each one having a small effect. To find these genes,
hundreds or thousands of patients might be needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to happen in some esoteric studies with a
couple of families here and there,'' said Dr. Mihael
Polymeropoulos, a vice president of Novartis, the Swiss drug
company. ``We're going to need lots of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how many will be needed is a matter of debate. Some
skeptics say the statistical links might be too weak to ever
detect. ``It's a blind leap of faith that this approach is going to
work at all,'' said Joseph D. Terwilliger, an assistant professor
at Columbia University's genome center.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Glaxo Wellcome says it has already found genes associated
with migraines, psoriasis, diabetes and Parkinson's disease.
Genset, a French company specializing in studies on diverse
populations, claims to have found genes linked to prostate cancer
and schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   DNA Sciences, based in Mountain View, Calif., is just one of the
companies springing up to try to gather patients and do studies.
Two companies had initial public stock offerings in the last two
weeks: DeCode Genetics, which is making a database using medical
records and DNA samples from most of Iceland's 275,000 people, and
Gemini Genomics, a British company that has DNA samples and
extensive medical records from thousands of pairs of twins.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Framingham Genomic Medicine, was formed in June
by Boston University and venture capitalists to analyze data from a
project that has collected information and DNA samples from
thousands of people in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltic nation Estonia is also looking to set up a genetic
database of nearly all its 1.4 million citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Genomics Collaborative, a private company in Cambridge, Mass.,
has a network of 250 doctors with the goal of getting as many as a
million patients. It just signed an agreement with Ameripath, which
performs pathology services for 170 hospitals, to analyze nearly 3
million biopsies a year. Under the agreement, hundreds of thousands
of those tissue samples will go into a tissue bank for genetic
studies.
</P>
<P>
   These databases are raising ethical and privacy concerns,
particularly that genetic data could be misused to deny people _ or
relatives _ insurance or employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essentially being developed and hitting the spotlight
without a sense of rules, ethics and social norms,'' said Janlori
Goldman, director of the Health Privacy Project at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   The companies all say they obtain the informed consent of
patients to have their DNA used and operate under the purview of
institutional review boards or ethics committees. They also say
they ``anonymize'' the data, so they cannot be linked to particular
people.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say hackers could gain access to the identity of
patients stored in computers. They say assurances that data will
not be sold to others, like insurance companies, are not ironclad.
Questions have already arisen about the ethics of privatizing the
Framingham data, which was collected in a federally financed
project. And DeCode's activities in Iceland have also provoked a
controversy about privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Kari Stefansson, chief executive of DeCode, argues that privacy
advocates are retarding progress. ``It is considered by some a
right to deny science the ability to use information about us to
help future generations,'' he said at a public forum on medical
privacy in Washington recently.
</P>
<P>
   He and others involved in such companies say many people are
happy to help search for cures for diseases, which they or their
descendants may suffer from.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first opportunity for Six-Pack Joe in the
heartland who has diabetes to participate in a study,'' said Dr.
Hugh Rienhoff, a physician and former venture capitalist who heads
DNA Sciences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Under DNA Sciences' program, volunteers answer online
questionnaires about their medical history, and their family's. The
company will then send someone to their homes or offices to collect
blood samples. Healtheon/WebMD, the medical Web sites, owns a stake
in DNA Sciences and will be used to help recruit patients.
</P>
<P>
   Donors will not be paid. The companies say that since the DNA is
being used in statistical studies, any one patient's contribution
is insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   Experts see two potential problems. One is that volunteers'
description of their medical histories might not be accurate.
``There's garbage in and garbage out,'' said Jonathan M. Rothberg,
chairman and chief executive of Curagen, a company looking for
disease genes. He said the company used data from Gemini Genomics
because the twins in the Gemini database had undergone hours of
standardized medical tests.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is that the people recruited by DNA Sciences
might be too heterogeneous. Although large numbers are needed,
there is still some advantage to relatively homogeneous populations
like Iceland's.
</P>
<P>
   DNA Sciences and most other companies want to find some disease
genes themselves. Merely providing patients for others may not be a
great business because some academic scientists studying particular
diseases already have large collections of patients and samples.
And some drug companies will do it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome enlists about 10 academic scientists per disease
to recruit several hundred families for each study, said Allen D.
Roses, worldwide director of genetics. The company is spending $22
million a year on this, because it pays the scientists'
institutions, which will also be entitled to royalties from any
drugs that result.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis intends to get patients from its clinical trials, since
those patients have the disease and well-documented medical
records, Polymeropoulos said. Novartis intends to get controls _
the DNA of people who do not have the disease _ from blood banks,
which have thousands of anonymous samples.
</P>
<P>
   Besides recruiting patients, the biggest obstacle to the studies
is cost. It costs about $1 to test one patient for one variation of
a single letter in the genetic code. Scientists have already found
hundreds of thousands of variations, known as single nucleotide
polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced ``snips''). Testing 100,000 SNPs
in 1,000 patients would cost a prohibitive $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   But companies like Orchid Biosciences of Princeton, N.J.;
Sequenom of San Diego; and Third Wave Technologies of Madison,
Wis., are developing techniques for high-speed SNP testing that
experts hope will bring the cost down sharply in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first big disease association studies will take place
in Japan. Third Wave and PE Biosystems, a genomics equipment
company, just won an $80 million contract to jointly develop tests
for 150,000 SNPs for a Japanese government project. About 800
people will be tested for all 150,000 SNPs, said Dr. Yusuke
Nakamura, director of the Human Genome Center at the University of
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   How many SNPs must be tested on how many people depends on how
homogeneous the population being studied is, how many genes
contribute to a particular disease, how frequent a particular
genetic variation is, and how strong the effect of a particular
gene is. Scientists do not have all the answers yet.
</P>
<P>
   If a particular variation is found in 10 percent to 50 percent
of people and doubles the chance of getting a disease, then several
thousand patients would have to be tested to find this variation,
said Dr. Leonid Kruglyak, a geneticist at the Fred Hutchison Cancer
Research Center in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   If a variation increases the risk of disease fivefold or
tenfold, far fewer patients would be needed, but Kruglyak said he
doubted there are many such variations. ``If there are tenfold or
fivefold effects out there we probably would have found them by
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Glaxo and others say they can effectively narrow the search.
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, for instance, uses biological knowledge
and other techniques first to estimate what genes are likely to be
involved in a disease. It then studies only the 1,000 or so SNPs in
those genes, allowing it to get by with fewer than 100 patients,
said Dr. Michael G. Kauffman, vice president for medicine of
Millennium Predictive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Curagen is also limiting its search to particular SNPs, said
Rothberg. ``The bottom line is you just do it, and that gets rid of
the cynics,'' he said.

CHAVEZ FAILS TO WIN MANDATE FOR ABSOLUTE POWER
</HEADLINE>
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ With final results in Sunday's
``mega-election'' here tabulated Monday, President Hugo Chavez has
won an overwhelming personal victory, but his coattails were
apparently not quite long enough to pull into Congress the
followers needed to guarantee him absolute powers.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez won 59 percent of the vote. But in the races for the
National Assembly, pro-Chavez parties won 99 of 165 seats, which
fell just short of the two-thirds majority that would have turned
the new single-chamber legislature into a rubber stamp.
</P>
<P>
   The two-thirds watershed was crucial to Chavez's plans to carry
out the ``peaceful social revolution'' he has promised supporters.
With it he would have avoided any opposition resistance to
decisions to discharge Supreme Court judges and members of
Congress, decree certain laws, and appoint prosecutors, members of
the Central Bank board and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need from here on in is to find the path to national
unity,'' said Henrique Salas Feo, the opposition governor of the
state of Carabobo, in what was seen as a veiled message to Chavez
to be more conciliatory. ``The divisions must end, and we must all
have the conviction that we are members of the same community.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez's majority in the National Assembly is still large
enough to assure passage of an ``enabling law'' that would allow
him to decree at least some of the sweeping measures unpopular with
the opposition. It was the granting of those special powers last
year that allowed Chavez to dissolve the opposition-dominated
Congress and take over the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Also working in his favor is the fact that his adversaries
remain fragmented and demoralized. His main rival, Francisco Arias
Cardenas, showed few gifts as a campaigner or orator, and the
right-of-center political party that divided power for 40 years,
called Copei, has all but vanished as an electoral force, winning
only five seats in the new legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional left-of-center party here, known as Democratic
Action, did much better, and will be the second-largest political
grouping in this nation of 23 million people, which in recent years
has been the main source of oil imported by the United States. The
party holds 32 seats in the National Assembly and won four or five
governorships, depending on the outcome of one especially tight
race.
</P>
<P>
   At the state level, Chavez did better than expected. His
Patriotic Pole coalition won at least 12 of 23 governorships,
including the re-election of his father in his home state of
Barinas, and also appears to have won a majority of the country's
336 mayoral races. Many analysts had predicted exactly the opposite
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The election Sunday to ``re-legitimize'' Chavez's rule was
required by a new constitution whose formulation and approval by
voters has been the main focus of his first 18 months in office.
The constitution significantly expands the powers of the federal
government, especially the executive branch, while eliminating a
ban on presidents immediately seeking re-election, and extending
their term of office to six years from five.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez quickly made it clear that he intends to take full
advantage of all the new features and powers of the charter. In his
victory speech early Monday, for instance, he indicated that he
already plans to run for a second term, in hopes of being the
nation's chief executive when Venezuela marks the bicentennial of
its independence in 2011.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, delivered from the balcony of the presidential
palace, Chavez mocked Arias Cardenas and other political rivals,
but took an unusually conciliatory tone toward business leaders who
have frequently been objects of his wrath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all sailing in the same boat,'' he said, adding that he
needed them to ``help save the Venezuelan economy,'' which
contracted by 7.2 percent last year despite record high oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders responded optimistically to that olive branch.
``If he is holding out a hand, now is the time to shake it,'' said
Antonio Herrera, vice president of the Venezuelan-American Chamber
of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, differences persist over how to make the economy
grow. In the victory speech, Chavez made a point of saluting his
minister of planning and development, Jorge Giordani, and of
finance, Jose Rojas, who have taken most of the criticism for his
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   To Robert Bottome, publisher of Veneconomia, the country's
leading business newsletter, this declaration of support did not
bode well. ``Nothing makes me think this president is willing to
change his policies,'' he said. ``If you don't change Giordani and
Rojas, you don't change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever course he takes, Chavez will be under pressure to
deliver results soon. When Edelmira de Gil, a Chavez supporter, was
asked Sunday at a polling place here how long she would be willing
to wait before seeing an improvement, she quickly replied, ``three
or four months.'' If Chavez ``doesn't keep his word,'' she warned,
``he won't get re-elected.''

VENEZUELANS LEAVING FOR BETTER BUSINESS CLIMATE IN US 
</HEADLINE>

 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS _ The economy is shrinking and unemployment is
disturbingly high. But perhaps the most telling sign ofVenezuela's
economic troubles may be in a word that residents have created:
``Mianeros,'' a name for those who've packed their bags and left to
seek better fortunes in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists estimate that as many as 150,000 Venezuelans
have left the country over the last two years for other, more
promising places like Florida to escape the country's protracted
crisis, which has seen a severe loss of jobs and an increase in
crime.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this problem that many experts say the country's
leftist president, Hugo Chavez, must now address after his
resounding reelection on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should talk more about opening markets and making Venezuela
more attractive for businesses if things are going to get better,''
said Roberto Bottome, director of VenEconomia, a think tank which
publishes an economic newsletter. ``If not, we'll continue to lose
businesses and we'll keep losing our most educated and talented
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite an economy which contracted by 7 percent last year and a
15 percent unemployment rate, Chavez, the 46-year-old,
beret-wearing former paratrooper, was given a strong endorsement
from voters on Sunday to proceed with his so-called ``peaceful
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He won 59 percent of the vote in an election that pitted his
fiery, populist platform against the more moderate and pro-business
agenda of Francisco Arias, a former military comrade. With more
than 80 percent of ballots counted, Arias had won 38 percent of the
vote. A third candidate, former Caracas Mayor Claudio Fermin, had
the remaining three percent.
</P>
<P>
   The election was part of a new constitution and political
overhaul that has been Chavez's main concern since he was first
elected in December 1998. But now that the president has solidified
his political power for at least the next six years, business and
industry leaders are urging him to put more emphasis on re-igniting
the country's stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in crisis for more than a year and more than three
with a depressed industrial sector,'' Juan Calvo, president of the
Industrial Federation of Venezuela, told the Caracas daily El
Universal. ``This has to be solved with energy and decisiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to thousands of supporters early Monday morning from a
balcony at the Miraflores presidential palace, Chavez vowed to make
economic growth a priority. But exactly how he would do that
remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who speaks frequently about ``a humane economy,'' seems
more drawn to a government-controlled economy like Cuba than a more
liberal free-market like Mexico's. Among other Latin American
leaders, Chavez stays closest to Cuban President Fidel Castro, who
used a Saturday press conference in Cuba to publicly send warm
wishes to his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be looking more at countries like the United States
as a model for fixing this economy,'' said Andres Alvarez, a
41-year-old restaurant owner in downtown Caracas who voted for
Chavez. ``Yes, I believe in helping the poor, but even the poor
will turn on him if things don't improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said Chavez will need a comprehensive strategy to
attract businesses and investors and to get the economy moving
again:
</P>
<P>
   --The country's legal code and labor laws must be revised to be
more business friendly.
</P>
<P>
   --Venezuela's growing crime problem must be tackled quickly.
</P>
<P>
   --The country's current image must be changed to one that
welcomes trade, not rejects it.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the country has lost more than 500,000
jobs and $3 billion in capital. Multinational companies such as
Unilever, Honda, Fiat and Warner-Lambert have either left Venezuela
or cut back their presence, taking white- and blue-collar jobs with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an investor or business decides to come here, there is a
long list of pros and cons that are considered,'' Bottome added.
``Right now, Venezuela has more cons.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez will have less than a veto-proof majority in the new
legislature to push whatever economic program his administration
puts together. His Patriotic Pole coalition won 60 percent of the
body's 165 seats, making it likely that he'll have to do some
negotiating with opposition parties to get his proposals approved.
</P>

   For his part, Arias, 49, who stood by Chavez during a failed
1992 coup attempt only to break away and challenge him for the
presidency, pledged to continue leading a broad, business-oriented
opposition against the president's coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our responsibility to this country to keep fighting for
a stronger, better Venezuela,'' Arias, who has not yet conceded
defeat, said in a speech Monday. ``We will make sure that an
opposition exists to protect all citizens of this country, rich and
poor.''

A TASTY RX: GREAT FLAVORS HELP KIDS' MEDICINE GO DOWN &HT;    w/Photos
 &HT;    By DANIEL J. VARGAS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   That one word can send your taste buds shuddering and your inner
child searching for a bed to hide under.
</P>
<P>
   You can taste it now: a bitter, thick syrup that's supposed to
taste like cherry, except it's more like a menthol-reeking shot of
cheap booze that invokes a vengeful gag reflex.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, memories.
</P>
<P>
   However, things are getting sweeter for children who take
medicine by the spoonful.
</P>
<P>
   Four Houston-area pharmacies are using the FLAVORx program _ the
Baskin-Robbins of children's medicine. It uses more than 50
concentrated flavors from apple to mocha cappuccino to mask the
bitterness of children's medicine, making it more palatable for
young tykes.
</P>
<P>
   No more trickery or use of mild force-feeding measures to get
the medicine down the hatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children have a better sense for bitterness,'' says Kenny
Kramm, president of FLAVORx, based in Washington, D.C. ``As we get
older, our tastes change. Things we didn't like when we were
children don't bother us now. That's why when parents taste the
medicine, they don't see what the big deal is.''
</P>
<P>
   He still has fond recollections of when Mom used a towel to tie
him to her so he couldn't get away come medicine time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone can understand this problem. It's a universal one,''
Kramm says.
</P>
<P>
   He knew something needed to be done to spice up the taste of
children's medicine when he came home one day to find that his wife
had cooked their daughter's anti-seizure medicine with eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents resort to doing whatever they can think of _ putting
it in chocolate syrup or in foods,'' Kramm says. ``But with some
drugs, those things can interact with the medication. For instance,
citrus can reduce the efficacy of some medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   So he paired up with his father in the early 1990s to experiment
with flavorings in the family's Washington, D.C., pharmacy. After
three years of trial and error taste-tests, they came up with a
300-page formulary, or recipe book, that tells the pharmacist how
to re-flavor medications _ both prescription and over-the-counter.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, FLAVORx has spread to 2,500 pharmacies
in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and at 50
hospitals, including the Baptist Health System in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon W. Martin asks the Medicine Shoppe Pharmacy in Spring,
Texas, to use it in all of her 15-month-old daughter's medications,
which are usually antibiotics. About 10 percent of the pharmacy's
customers ask for flavoring.
</P>
<P>
   When Martin smelled her daughter's first antibiotics, she
likened it to the stench of ``dirty socks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't even consider giving it to her without the
flavoring,'' she says. ``You don't do that to a child. You don't do
that to a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the flavoring, Martin says, it would be difficult for
her daughter to swallow it without any fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``As good a baby as she is, I imagine we might have had to hold
her down and give it to her,'' she says. ``This is just one more
comfort that makes our job as parents easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are more than 50 sweet-tasting flavors, not all
blend well with each medication.
</P>
<P>
   Kramm says 15 flavors work with penicillin _ the least
compatible of all drugs. Amoxicillin is an easygoing kind of
medicine, mixing well with every flavor, he says.
</P>
<P>
   It may take more than one to suppress a nasty taste. For
example, Biaxin, a children's antibiotic with a gritty texture,
needs a triple punch of grape, watermelon and vanilla to mask its
bitter taste, Kramm says.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacists and Kramm say the added flavor concentration neither
changes the medicinal properties of the drug nor dilutes it.
Because most children's medicine is stored in powder form and water
is added to make the syrup or liquid form, pharmacists simply
subtract a specified amount of water and replace it with droplets
of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is patient compliance,'' says Joe Staller,
owner and pharmacist at north Houston's Red Oak Pharmacy, which
also offers the flavorings. ``That's the name of the game. It's not
doing any good if it's not going down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's important when children are taking antibiotics for ear,
sinus and bronchial infections. Doctors usually prescribe a 10-day
supply that must be finished completely. If not, the infection can
resurface.
</P>
<P>
   Kramm says kids can sample flavors at the pharmacy to find out
which one they like best. And if they change their mind about the
flavor they've chosen, it can be re-flavored without throwing out
the original medication.
</P>
<P>
   He says parents shouldn't worry about kids trying to drink or
take more of the medicine than they should because of its improved
taste. Nevertheless, it should be kept out of reach and sealed with
a child-resistant top.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flavors make them more palatable, but a child won't drink
an entire bottle, believe me,'' Kramm says.
</P>
<P>
   At Horizon Pharmacy in Houston, several parents a day come in
requesting flavoring.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Roosth, a pharmacist for 38 years, says the pharmacy, which
has used the FLAVORx program for several years, charges $2.50 for a
flavoring. The most popular are cherry, bubble gum, lime and grape.
</P>
<P>
   He says pharmacists have flavored medicines for hundreds of
years, especially when they frequently compounded medications.
Sometimes pharmacists would add vanilla or mint. Now the idea is
just more sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   ``A teaspoon of sugar makes the medicine go down,'' Roosth says.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja Jezierski, a pharmacy manager at Kroger in The Woodlands,
Texas, says her store does about 10 flavorings a day since it
adopted the FLAVORx program about three weeks ago. The Kroger
pharmacy, which also charges $2.50 for flavorings, is a test market
for the grocery chain in the Houston area, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a popular thing,'' Jezierski says.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't want to pay the extra fee or aren't near a
pharmacy that offers the service, Staller suggests that the child
suck on an ice cube or lollipop before being given the medication.
This should mask any aftertaste, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Roosth admits that though the vast majority of
flavoring-medication combinations are right on target, ``sometimes
medicine just tastes like medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the record, not one sickly child has asked him for mocha
cappuccino. These kids are too young to hang out and sip a grande
coffee drink at Starbucks.

INTEL SAYS NEW PENTIUM III IS FASTEST CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the ongoing game of one-upsmanship between chip makers Intel
Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Corp., Intel has once more hopped
into the lead. The company announced a new Pentium III processor
Monday that, at least in theory, is faster than any of rival AMD's
Athlon chips.
</P>
<P>
   The new Pentium III will offer a clock speed of 1.13 gigahertz,
about 13 percent higher than the 1 gigahertz speed of the fastest
Athlon chip. Clock speed is just one of many factors that determine
the speed of a computer chip. But chip makers believe it's this
measurement that catches the attention of power-hungry customers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, AMD became the first of the two chip makers
to create a 1 gigahertz chip. The achievement suggested that AMD,
long a maker of lower-quality Pentium-compatible chips, had at last
achieved technological parity with Intel, the world's biggest chip
maker. But within days, Intel responded with its own 1 gigahertz
Pentium III chip, and now the company has moved into the lead once
again.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lead that probably won't mean much to the typical user of
Windows-based PCs. Most common software programs won't run any
better on the new Intel chip as they would on a slower processor.
But Intel spokesman George Alfs noted that there are always users
who need exceptional performance _ for example, people who use
computers to edit videos or create complex graphic images, or
serious players of the most advanced computer games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for everybody,'' said Alfs, ``but it's for people who
really use that kind of performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The new chip will first be made available to PC manufacturers
that want to design ultrafast systems for these serious users. At a
time when many complete computer systems cost well under $1,000,
the new chip will sell for $990 in lots of 1,000 chips.
</P>
<P>
   But people looking to upgrade their present Pentium III systems
will have to wait awhile. Alfs said it will be some time before the
new chip is available as an aftermarket part at electronics stores.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AMD is hot on Intel's heels. A company spokeswoman
said it will release a 1.1 gigahertz Athlon on Aug. 28, and have a
1.5 gigahertz version on sale early next year.

 &HT;    Some blacks are finding their political roots with the GOP
 &HT;    Eds. All names are correct
 &HT;    By Miriam A. Garcia
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Colorado delegate Syl Morgan-Smith is the only
Republican in her family. In fact, she is the first one in four
generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows the great return of African-Americans to our
party,'' said Morgan-Smith, one of a handful of black Colorado
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Her family left Lincoln's party for the Democratic party after
the Great Depression, as did many others. People needed assistance
from the government to survive, but today's economic boom should
drive people back to the Grand Old Party, Morgan-Smith said.
Morgan-Smith is attending the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and delegates at the convention said that the party is
gradually becoming more diverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think more and more minority groups are getting involved
with the party,'' said Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo. ``They are
playing a greater role.''
</P>
<P>
   Allard cited the state's diversity among elected officials
including the only Native American in Congress, Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, Colorado State Rep. Joe Nunez, who is Hispanic, and Lt.
Gov. Joe Rogers, who is an African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers had a prime spot on the convention floor Monday
afternoon, speaking from the main stage. Speaking to a full
convention hall, Rogers talked about the vision of Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to stirring the waters of opportunity in our
land,'' said Rogers, chairman of the Republican Lieutenant
Governors Association and the group's youngest member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is a rising star renewing America,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was one of several African-Americans slated to speak on
the convention floor this week.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been said about the inclusion of minorities to the
line-up, which did not include other prominent Republicans
including Colo. Gov. Bill Owens.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the snub, Owens' spokesman Dick Wadhams said in
press reports last week that Owens ``never anticipated he would be
asked'' and that ``it's not a surprise that Joe Rogers would be
asked. He's one of the highest ranking African-American Republican
elected officials in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Owens and Rogers has become contentious
during their year and a half of working together.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Owens refused Rogers' request to let him veto
a bill that will allow future governors to pick their own running
mates. The bill, which Owens let become law without his signature,
will replace the current system of having running mates picked by
the state party assembly or at a primary election.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Rogers on the podium Monday is part of a GOP
effort to change it's image, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But the audience in the First Union was mostly white. According
to the Associated Press, about 83 percent of the delegates are
white, 4 percent black, 3 percent Hispanic, 1 percent Asian and 0.4
percent Native American. And about a dozen of the state delegations
are entirely white.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must diversify. The picture of this country is changing,''
said Morgan-Smith, who marched in several civil rights
demonstrations with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Birmingham,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The party's image has changed dramatically since Glen Neidert,
an alternate delegate to Colorado, joined the party about 50 years
ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party has been trying to (become more diverse) for years
but people have not recognized it for what it is,'' Neidert said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Morgan-Smith is back to her family's political roots,
she is trying to encourage her family to vore GOP, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see opportunities for my grandchildren that I could not
envisioned 30 years ago,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom would go to a store and if she saw a dress she liked,
they wouldn't let her try it on because it wouldn't be
merchantable. Yet here I am, a delegate in the year 2000 in the
city where our democracy was framed.''

BUMFUZZLED?: A DICTIONARY THAT CAN HELP YOU OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis.)   (For release Sunday, Aug. 6)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. Double parentheses
should be set as brackets. The numbers 1 and 2 in parentheses refer
to the footnotes at the end of the story.) 
Frederic G. Cassidy was the chief editor of the Dictionary of
American Regional English until his death in June, at age 92,
shortly after he wrote this column. His collaborator, Joan Houston
Hall, is DARE's associate editor. William Safire is on vacation.

<P>
   President Clinton's staunch refusal to give up his own regional
vernacular has frequently left members of the Fourth Estate
confused _ or  &UR; flummoxed &LR; ,  &UR; bumfuzzled &LR;  or  &UR; ferhoodled &LR;  (as they
say in some regions of the United States). Reporters were baffled
when Clinton proclaimed that his staff members were there to work
for the American people and ``not to  &UR; throw off on each other &LR; .''
And when he said of a dissenting major general that ``he doesn't
know me from  &UR; Adam's off-ox &LR; ,'' many were admittedly  &UR; in a swivet &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Where do bewildered reporters (or others) turn for
clarification? To the heartland, to flyover country, to the land of
 &UR; bakery, bubblers and brats &LR; .(1) To the makers of the Dictionary of
American Regional English (familiarly known as DARE).
</P>
<P>
   In Madison, Wis., we and a staff of 12 work with a massive
collection of the words, phrases, pronunciations and grammatical
constructions likely to be brought to Washington by the regionally
speaking folks who represent the 50 states. Our files make it easy
to explain Orrin Hatch's  &UR; hissy fits &LR; , Ronald Reagan's  &UR; squoze &LR;  or
Al Gore's  &UR; rip-tootin' &LR;  presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   In offices located on the campus of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, we sift through the words and phrases collected
between 1965 and 1970 when fieldworkers fanned out across the
country to ask native-born Americans what words they used for the
simple realities of their daily lives: ``What do you call the rolls
of dust that collect on the floor under the bed? What joking
expressions do you have around here about snoring? Of someone who
seems quite stupid you might say, `He hasn't sense enough to _
_!'''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 2.5 million responses gathered in this way,
we have the collections of the American Dialect Society
(established in 1889 specifically to make such a dictionary as
ours) and a huge file of quotations excerpted from American
newspapers, diaries, novels, plays, histories, government documents
and ephemeral publications. All of these are used to illustrate the
words that go into the dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   But who (other than folks like the usual writer of this column)
would ever have a use for a book like DARE? Word lovers, of course.
But are there any practical uses for a work like ours? We've
discovered that there are.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you grew up in Madison, went to the excellent university
in this city, stayed on for medical school and then found yourself
somewhere in the southern Appalachians for your first job. Your
patients might complain of having the  &UR; ground itch &LR; , or  &UR; dew
poison &LR; , or  &UR; sore leaders &LR; , or  &UR; kernels &LR; , or  &UR; pones &LR; . How would you
react? These aren't ailments you learned about in medical school.
If you had a dictionary of regionalisms on your shelf, you could
slip out, look up the word and come back knowing what questions to
ask next.
</P>
<P>
   Or suppose you were a forensic linguist, as is Roger Shuy
(formerly of Georgetown University, now cozily ensconced in the
mountains of western Montana). Further, suppose you were asked to
read the manifesto of the Unabomber or another at-large miscreant
and to provide a profile of him based on his language.
</P>
<P>
   You might conclude, as Shuy did, that law enforcement
investigation is aided by reference tools like DARE: ``I keep my
three volumes of DARE very handy to my desk along with my
unabridged dictionaries, dictionaries of slang, usage texts,
regional dialect atlases, encyclopedias and other important
reference works. I find it invaluable. Needless to say, it would be
even more valuable if it went beyond the letter O.''
</P>
<P>
   If you were a psychiatrist or psychologist, you might give some
of your patients a standardized test to diagnose aphasia. They
would be asked to give names to a series of illustrations of
everyday objects.
</P>
<P>
   You would find it extremely useful to know, for example, that
the musical instrument played by blowing across a series of holes
isn't only a  &UR; harmonica &LR; ; it's a  &UR; mouth organ &LR;  in much of the
country (especially the inland North, central Atlantic, south
Atlantic and Southwest), a  &UR; mouth harp &LR;  (particularly in the south
Atlantic, north central and Western areas) and a  &UR; French harp &LR;  as
well (especially in the west midland, Texas and the central part of
the country).
</P>
<P>
   Why should you care? Because the answer key to the test is
highly unlikely to recognize any regional or social variation in
the naming of common objects. And if your patient from Mississippi
calls a pair of stilts  &UR; Tom Walkers &LR; , you need to know that that is
a normal, expectable term for them in that part of America. If you
don't, your patient will be marked ``wrong'' and could end up with
a misdiagnosis simply because he used his legitimate, regional
English.
</P>
<P>
   And what about all you librarians? We always assumed that a
reference like DARE would be invaluable in answering the weird and
wonderful questions that come your way. And Kathleen Glaser, from
the reference room at the Putnam County Library in Cookeville,
Tenn., proved us right: ``A library patron wanted information on
 &UR; dry-land fish &LR; . We looked in every `fish' book we could think of,
to no avail. As the patron kept repeating that this fish `grew in
the woods,' ... I finally got to wondering if this was a regional
expression. And of course it was: A  &UR; dry-land fish &LR;  is an edible
mushroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, oral historians also find uses for books that
can bring life to the words of our grandparents: What did it mean a
century ago to  &UR; put a flea in someone's ear &LR; ? To  &UR; be on your
beanwater &LR; ? To  &UR; honeyfuggle &LR;  with your  &UR; jimpsecute &LR;  in the  &UR; keeping
room &LR; ?(2)
</P>
<P>
   Writing from the Institute for Oral History at Baylor
University, M. Rebecca Sharpless tells of listening to tape
recordings of Texas regional dialects and finding similarly
unfamiliar words: ``We exhaust the standard unabridged dictionary,
then we turn to the DARE .... Nineteen times out of 20, what we're
looking for is ((there.))''
</P>
<P>
   On that 20th time, when DARE doesn't have the answer, we turn
the tables and ask others for help. Our Web site
(http://polyglot.lss.wisc.edu/dare/dare/html) has lists of words
and phrases that have us stumped. While we might not know something
 &UR; from Adam's housecat &LR; , for you it might be  &UR; small skimption &LR;  to
figure it out. Give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   (1) In Wisconsin,  &UR; bakery &LR;  isn't just the place where you buy
the pastries, it's also the sweet delights themselves; the
 &UR; bubbler &LR;  is where you get a drink of water to wash down the
 &UR; bakery &LR; ; and  &UR; brats &LR;  (properly rhyming with rots, not rats) are
the staple of summer grilling _ succulent, greasy bratwurst links,
traditionally smothered in sauerkraut.
</P>
<P>
   (2) These are all old-fashioned phrases meaning, respectively,
``to give someone a hint or a warning'' (chiefly Northeast), ``to
be in high spirits'' (New England) and to ``make a show of
affection'' (Georgia) with your ``sweetheart'' (Texas) in the
``sitting room'' (New England).

PHILADELPHIA POLICE YIELD TO MARCHING PROTESTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Slowly and strategically, a thick blue line of
city police retreated from downtown toward the Republican National
Convention on Monday, yielding before an illegal protest parade
rather than facing a potentially violent street confrontation with
the world watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to stop them,'' Deputy Police Chief Sylvester
Johnson decided on Broad Street as a parade of welfare protesters,
denied a permit to march, stepped off from City Hall nevertheless
and headed south toward the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were no less strategic than the police as they
made sure that their parade began with a phalanx of toddlers and
infants backed up by paraplegics in wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be marching with them,'' Johnson added, emphasizing that
flexibility was the city's watchword for this tense convention
week.
</P>
<P>
   And the chief did march for the full 3 miles through the hot
sun. He converted his large stationary force of officers, who stood
at first as a line in the sand that attracted a mass of news media,
into a mobile escort. They cleared traffic out before the parading
demonstrators, who happily won their point and chanted: ``Whose
streets? Our streets!''
</P>
<P>
   The marchers, in turn, cooperated by finally veering off into a
park near the convention site rather than confronting the large
backup force of police officers firmly ringing the arena behind
barricades, equipped with hundreds of sets of plastic handcuffs
tucked in their gunbelts.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, eight arrests were made at a much smaller
demonstration outside City Hall as protesters denounced the Army's
School of the Americas and blocked traffic by lying down in the
street. The school, at Fort Benning, Ga., has long been a cause for
complaints that it trains Latin American soldiers in combat methods
often used in human rights abuses to protect dictatorships. The
demonstrators, opting for nonviolent civil disobedience, were
accommodated by police who made fast arrests and carried them off.
</P>
<P>
   The larger welfare protest, which eventually attracted several
thousand marchers, drew initial warnings of arrest but apparently
proved too sizable and peaceful for police confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this is a big victory in giving a voice to the words
and power of poor people,'' said Jonathan M. Blazer, a lawyer for
the Kensington Welfare Rights Union, a North Philadelphia civic
group that sponsored the march and prevailed in taking over Broad
Street despite being denied a permit.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests were made during the march and no injuries were
reported. But traffic was disrupted on one of the main routes to
the convention arena as the opening gavel was summoning the
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about the traffic,'' said Femi Johnson, a cab
driver trapped by the protesters. ``This march is letting the
people express themselves. I'm from Nigeria and one day I wish to
go back and deliver a lesson in democracy like this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For all the uniformed police and gold stars in evidence along
the march, the key police figures were plainclothes officers from
the civil affairs unit who negotiated with demonstration leaders
and even supplied them with cold drinks from police buckets as the
day unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. William V. Fisher, the unit commander, stayed at the head
of the march, a sweat-soaked study in navigating around
confrontation. He conferred repeatedly with protest negotiators,
then with Police Chief John Timoney, who would suddenly pedal to
the scene at strategic turnings with members of the police bike
squad.
</P>
<P>
   With the convention site sealed off and the Republican agenda a
rosy model of nondissent, the marchers, bolstered by other
protesters, sought to instigate the only untoward event of the day
for the 15,000 visiting news workers. Once the chance of
confrontation passed, the event turned into an unsensational
three-hour trudge but for a flurry of alarm at a passing
coincidence: Newt Gingrich was sighted down a side street.
</P>
<P>
   A thicket of television camera crews instantly sprang off in
pursuit, as if the former House speaker were one of the promised
``anarchists'' who have been threatening to haunt the convention
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt came out of that Dunkin' Donuts, I think,'' one foreign
journalist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it was a White Castle!'' another journalist corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, on his way to a photo opportunity in the neighborhood,
turned and looked bewildered at receiving the largest amount of
media scrutiny since Republicans purged him from leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Before yielding to the marchers, Johnson received contrary
advice from an aide who could be heard telling him, ``If we don't
move, they don't move.''
</P>
<P>
   But the police moved first, backwards. As the march proceeded, a
large, ever-changing electronic message sign at a construction site
at Spruce and Broad came forth almost eerily with what seemed apt
advice for the passing scene: ``Using force to stop force is
absurd.'' And: ``To disagree presupposes moral integrity.''

BUSH WOULD BRIDGE THE NATION'S RACIAL DIVIDES, SAYS COLIN POWELL &HT;    By ERIC ROSENBERG
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Colin Powell, one of the nation's most prominent
African Americans, told delegates to the Republican National
Convention Monday night that Texas Gov. George W. Bush would reach
out to minorities and seek to heal racial rifts if he were elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared prime-time address to the 2,066 delegates _ more
than 90 percent of whom are white _ Powell said the governor ``can
help bridge our racial divides'' and ``has been successful in
bringing more and more minorities inside the tent by responding to
their deepest needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The retired Army general added, ``Some call it compassionate
conservatism. It's just about caring for people. He can do the same
thing as president. He will bring to the White House that same
passion for inclusion''' that he has shown as governor in reaching
out ``to all Texans _ white, black, Latino, Asian, Native
American.,''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, 63, the former chairman of the joint Chiefs of Staff
under President George H. W. Bush, the Texas governor's father,
also said that improving the lives of American youth should by the
country's top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the problems we worry about go back to how we raise
our children. We either build our children or we build more
jails,.'' Powell said, adding that it is ``time to stop building
jails.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell noted that giving children ``what they need to be
successful in life ... has become the passion of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the general became chairman of America's Promise, a
national organization that mentors young people, using faith-based
and community organizations to help solve social ills.
</P>
<P>
   Powell did not mention hot-button issues on which his views run
counter to those of Bush and many of the delegates here. For
example, Powell supports abortion rights and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Monday's GOP convention activities was
``Opportunity With a Purpose: Leave No Child Behind.'' It was an
effort flesh out Bush's campaign mantra of ``compassionate
conservatism'' by showcasing speakers focused on improving
education and conditions for young people generally.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Powell, Monday's speakers included Laura Bush,
wife of the Texas governor, who spoke about literacy, and Michael
Feinberg, a teacher at an innovative Houston charter school, who
described his work..
</P>
<P>
   Powell considered running for the Republican presidential
nomination in 1996 but ultimately declined. In the current
campaign, he aggressively publicly dissuaded Bush from considering
him as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Powell is considered a likely contender for secretary of
state should the governor win the election. The selection would
reunite Powell with Richard Cheney, the presumptive vice
presidential nominee and secretary of defense under President Bush.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Powell is perhaps best remembered for his role as Joint Chiefs
chairman in helping plan Operation Desert Storm, the massive 1991
war effort to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   He initially opposed use of military force to turn back Iraq's
1990 invasion of the oil kingdom. But once President Bush and the
allies decided to fight, Powell helped devise a strategy of using
overwhelming force. No U.S. troops should be put into harm's way
unless they are supported by sufficient numbers to rapidly defeat
the Iraqi military, Powell reasoned, drawing a key lesson from his
Vietnam war experience.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's history with Republican presidents dates to the Richard
Nixon era. While in the Army, Powell served in 1972 as a White
House fellow, a program that exposed him to the inner workings of
the president's Cabinet. While there, he impressed Caspar
Weinberger and Frank Carlucci, both of whom later served as
secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   During the Reagan administration, Powell was the top military
aide to Weinberger and later became the president's national
security adviser. In 1989, under President Bush, Powell, at 52,
became the youngest chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the nation's
highest military post. He is the only African American to have
served in the position.

BUSH BLUEPRINT SMOOTHLY PASSES MUSTER AMONG GOP FAITHFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Bob Dole, the GOP presidential candidate in 1996,
showed his respect for the Republican platform when he said he
didn't even plan to read it. Most candidates skim the party
statement of principles and then ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   It's different with Texas Governor George W. Bush. He decided
and then made sure the platform would be a vision statement and a
roadmap for his ``compassionate conservative'' presidential
campaign and a rallying point for a party that Bush insists will be
unified and winning in November.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, without debate, audible dissent, or a prime-time
audience, &UR;  &LR; delegates to the Republican National Convention approved
the Bush blueprint that commits the party to ``bold education
reforms'' and ``a vision of a welcoming society in which all have a
place.'' The only grumbling came from supporters of abortion
rights, who accused the Bush campaign of blocking their last-ditch
efforts to put that issue before the full convention.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Stone, chairman of Republicans for Choice, said, ``We ran
into a brick wall called the Bush campaign'' when the group tried
overnight Sunday to get the platform committee to add language
acknowledging different views within the GOP on abortion. Other
hard-line party positions taken in 1996 _ eliminating the
Department of Education, denying citizenship to the children of
illegal immigrants _ had been changed in the 2000 platform at
Bush's urging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the platform is moderate on everything
but this issue,'' Stone said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign denied it played any role in thwarting Stone's
group, which raises money for GOP candidates who support abortion
rights. ``Governor Bush's position (in favor of) the pro-life
language was clear, but the decision to keep the pro-life language
in the platform was made by the delegates,'' said Ray Sullivan, a
Bush spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Little of Pelham, Ala., a member of the Republican
Coalition for Life, said the platform, which calls for a
constitutional amendment to ban abortion, an end to federal
family-planning services, and the appointment of judges who oppose
abortion, reflects the will of the GOP. Republicans who support
abortion rights need to ``get with the program,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought theirs was the effort of sore losers,'' said Little,
who is a member of the platform committee. ``Bush's advisers stood
right by us, saying the governor did not want a jot or tittle in
the abortion plank changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone said she would urge like-minded Republicans to stay in the
party, continue their fight, and support Bush because she doesn't
believe as president he would push to end a woman's right to an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, whose pro-abortion positions
probably ruined his chances to be Bush's running mate, said Bush's
campaign will be about education, the economy, and the environment,
not abortion. In fact, the platform's preamble, which sounds like a
Bush speech, does not mention the word.
</P>
<P>
   ``The platform tries to set a tone that is different, better,
and more positive than in the past,'' Ridge said. ``At the end of
the day, this election is going to be about the kind of leader we
want. I dare say there will be very few votes cast on the academic
basis of the language of the platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Tom Campbell, a California Republican who is
running against incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein for the US
Senate, supports abortion rights and wanted the platform to reflect
a diversity of opinion. A recent Associated Press poll found only
15 percent of the California GOP delegation embraced the platform
language on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a candidate win or lose on a platform,''
said Campbell, adding that he questioned the need for such a
document at all at a time when a voters can get all the information
they need on individual candidates from the internet or cable TV.
``Platforms are a holdover from another era,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Eddie Mahe, a longtime GOP consultant, said that as a
consequence of Bush's involvement in writing the platform, making
it the foundation of his campaign, and insisting that the party in
2000 stand for something, Republican candidates around the country
will use it as a benchmark for their own campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a uniting document, the tone is positive, and it isn't
just a litany of idealistic principles,'' Mahe said. ``You will see
a lot of our candidates referring to the platform as a way to tell
voters, ``this is what we are about.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mahe says GOP candidates can ``walk away'' from the parts of the
platform where they disagree. But Darlee Crockett, a Republican
activist in San Diego who supports abortion rights, says party
conservatives will use the document to intimidate moderate
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to get rid of us,'' Crockett said, noting how some
delegates to the recent GOP state convention in California wore
buttons aimed at people like her: The buttons had a red slash
through the acronym ``RINC'' _ Republicans in Name Only.

a more compassionate image. By Robin Toner.

   GOP-RDP-NYT (Philadelphia) _ A convention roundup: Republicans
open their convention, beginning what party leaders hope will be a
highly scripted four- day celebration of George W. Bush; the first
real business came when the delegates approved a platform that
reaffirms the party's staunch position opposing abortion while
adopting Bush's compassionate conservative positions; according to
a New York Times/CBS News poll of delegates, the Republicans here
are far more conservative than average Republican voters, but Karl
Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush campaign, played down the
dichotomy between the delegates and the message in an interview
Monday on ``Political Points,'' a joint production of ABCNEWS.com

   DNA-VOLUNTEERS (Undated) _ A California startup company called
DNA Sciences is starting a Web site on Tuesday to recruit people to
donate their DNA to help find genes that cause disease. The
company, which has DNA double helix discoverer James D. Watson as a
director and Netscape founder James H. Clark as an investor, hopes
to get 50,000 to 100,000 people to contribute by appealing to their
altruism. The new effort reflects a major change taking place in
genetics: With the unraveling of the human genome, studies to link
genes to disease are starting to be done on an unprecedented scale,
involving far more people than ever before. In the past, scientists
usually found disease-causing genes by studying a few families or
some isolated village with a high prevalence of the particular
disease. Now, they need to survey many more patients and controls
to find statistical correlations between genes and disease or
between genes and drug effectiveness. By Andrew Pollack.

   ISRAEL-PERES (Jerusalem) _ At the moment Monday when the
announcement of the first of the two Knesset votes for Israel's
next president made it all but certain that he had lost the last
major battle of his 60-year political career, Shimon Peres, Noble
laureate, three-time prime minister and one of the most enduring
standard-bearers for Middle East peace, remained proudly, though
unobtrusively, in character. The result, with 60 votes for Moshe
Katsav, 57 votes for Peres, and three blank ballots, brought
groans, slumped shoulders and moist eyes among parliamentarians
backing Peres' bid to become Israel's eighth president. To those
who know him well, the 76-year-old statesman appeared ashen, but in
the simplicity of his manner and words he did nothing, despite the
moment's pain, to bely his reputation for courtliness and courage.

persist, and the music business continues to consolidate as well as
fight battles on the Internet front, those free-speech claims have
decreased and an array of song-lyric review and editing procedures
have become routine. Artists are routinely asked to re-sing lyrics,

IT WASN'T THE WAY ARNOLD DREW IT UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dreaming really big dreams is a lot like drawing
very delicate lines, Dominique Arnold discovered last week. If you
make a gl mistake, one that can't be covered up or erased, you
don't scrap the whole sketchbook; you simply flip to a fresh page
and start anew.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials, Arnold was so
close to putting his signature on arguably his finest work of art,
he had his i's dotted. Nearing the midway point of the 110-meter
hurdles final, the trained artist from Washington State was right
where he needed to be to finish in the top three and earn a berth
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   His signature, alas, would end in a line that abruptly skittered
off the page, four years of painstaking work ruined by an
accidental brush with the fourth hurdle. Arnold tripped, failed to
finish the race and was left off the U.S. Olympic team after
leading all qualifiers in the heats and the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   While Allen Johnson, Mark Crear and Terrence Trammell celebrated
their 1-2-3 finish, Arnold was left to turn the page on his track
career and start fresh. It was no simple task.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold's drawings had turned dark in the days leading up to the
Trials. He took it as a sure sign that he was ready to run the race
of his life in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   His sketches included a abstract rendering ``of a guy getting
impaled,'' Arnold told us at the time, and you didn't have to be
renowned art critic Robert Hughes to appreciate the imagery;
Arnold's aim was to lance one of the deepest sprint hurdles fields
in history.
</P>
<P>
   For two rounds he did just that, winning his qualifying heat and
a stacked semifinal that included Johnson, the 1996 Olympic gold
medalist.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it took three sterling races, lined up one after the other
like hurdles on a track, to join the five-ring circus in Sydney.
The process, which puts the trials in the Olympic qualifying meet,
invariably ends up breaking more hearts than Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, 26, was crushed when he woke up each of the two mornings
after the hurdles final and realized it was no nightmare, that his
Olympic dream had been deferred at least four more years. Over and
over he replayed that last race in his head.
</P>
<P>
   He saw himself overtake Valencia's Crear (the Olympic silver
medalist in Atlanta) and draw even with Johnson and fly over the
fourth hurdle with so much speed he felt the same rush he had in
his previous two races, a sensation, he said, that was ``like
breaking free from a mist of confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened next unwinds in Arnold's mind in super slow
motion. The toe of his trail leg hit the fourth hurdle and as fast
as you can exhale, Arnold lost his footing and fell.
</P>
<P>
   One of the indelible images we took from the Trials was of
Arnold slumped on the track, rubbing his smooth head in his hands,
a dazed victim who had been robbed of his dream in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   In a heartbeat, years of hard work and sacrifice were snatched
from Arnold, never to be recovered. We wondered how hard it was to
pick oneself up and move on. So we caught up to Arnold on Sunday,
shortly before he left for a four-meet tour of the lucrative
European track circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics is a big deal because it's the one meet every four
years that the world watches. But between now and Sydney the race
is on for another kind of gold, one no less valuable to someone
like Arnold, with rent to pay and a car and a body to fuel and no
wealth of sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   To dwell on the disappointment of the Trials would be to risk
docking his own pay with lackluster races in places such as
Stockholm, where Arnold will compete today. Athletes at Arnold's
level can't afford to be just dreamers, they have to be pragmatic,
too.
</P>
<P>
   So on the third day after his Olympic dream took a tumble,
Arnold returned to the Cal State Northridge track where he trains.
His first workout since returning from Sacramento was, in his
words, ``a little more intense'' than usual. It was almost as if by
sweating Arnold hoped to cleanse himself of the memories of his
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about the screwup,'' Arnold said. ``I was
thinking, 'I don't want this to happen again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He ran fast enough to ``break free from a mist of confusion,''
only this time Arnold didn't falter. He cleared all the hurdles his
coach, Jeff McAuley, put in his path. It was the first day of the
rest of Arnold's athletic career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't eagerness or anxiety that got me in the finals,''
Arnold said. ``That's just the hurdles. You risk falling every time
you race. The one thing I can take from (the final) is that I was
right there (with Johnson and Crear) until I fell. Maybe if the
opportunity presents itself down the road, I'll be able to feel
like I did in that race, only I'll just be able to finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of an Olympic medal, Arnold has his sights set on
breaking the 13-second barrier (he clocked a personal best of 13.14
in the semis at the Trials). Then there's the American record of
12.92, held jointly by Johnson and Roger Kingdom. Arnold agreed
that it would be a nice consolation prize.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold sounded upbeat. The previous day he had resumed
sketching, as sure a sign as any that he has put that sad Sunday in
Sacramento behind him. Over the weekend, he worked on a drawing he
had started at the Trials. It is a portrait.
</P>
<P>
   For now Arnold has forsaken the abstract; he is focusing on what
is real.

 &HT;    GOP EXPANDING OUTREACH TO BLACKS
 &HT;    By MELANIE EVERSLEY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ There was a time when such a scene would have
seemed surreal.
</P>
<P>
   The emcee for the luncheon laid manicured hands atop the podium
and prodded the audience to applaud for the man they all knew from
the big screen's ``Shaft,'' the black-oriented action movie from
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   As the mostly white, well-heeled crowd put their hands together
in the Grand Ballroom of the Philadelphia Marriott _ as if they
really had seen ``Shaft'' _ Richard Roundtree jogged onstage.
</P>
<P>
   The black actor praised the principles of self-help touted by
the Republican Party, to which he belongs. The audience of GOP
conventioneers cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel comfortable being a Republican,'' Roundtree later
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Roundtree might not have felt so comfortable being a Republican
in the days when ``Shaft'' was popular. He may not have felt
comfortable even just five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But convention organizers say they are kicking off a new
campaign of inclusion for America's minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a very diverse party that invites people of all
different backgrounds to this convention,'' said Andy Card,
convention co-chairman. ``Gov. Bush has reached out in Texas in
particular to bring people into the party who have not been active
heretofore.''
</P>
<P>
   Words like ``inclusion'' and ``community'' are being tossed
around, and the party is putting money behind several black
Congressional candidates, including three who addressed the
convention on Monday. One of them, Dylan Glenn, is challenging
Sanford Bishop for the seat representing the district in and around
Albany and Valdosta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The three black Republican Congressional candidates networking,
handshaking and fund-raising here on Monday are spending a good
deal of their time getting out the message that the GOP is ready to
work with minority Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And there are people out there who clearly believe in this
message. For instance, most recent government records show Glenn
has raised more than half a million dollars and nearly as much as
Bishop. Jennifer Carroll, challenging Rep. Corrine Brown in
Florida's 3rd congressional district, has raised nearly half a
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the convention floor, Glenn, Carroll and third
candidate _ Joan Johnson, a black Republican woman from Long Island
seeking the seat of Republican Rep. Rick Lazio, who is running for
Senate _ all offered similar messages of how record-breaking their
posts would be if they won their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn told delegates he would be the first black Republican man
in Congress since Reconstruction representing the deep South if he
won his race. Johnson said she would be the first Republican woman
from Long Island to ever be elected to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of Glenn's platform is growth and employment.
The 31-year-old president of a non-profit economic development
organization that he founded says what the rural, second
Congressional district desperately needs is jobs. He believes he
can and will develop that job growth by mixing and talking
frequently with constituents and promoting economic development.
But he also said he sees the reality of the GOP'S new willingness
to welcome people like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news flash here is that it's not easy and it takes time,''
said Glenn, who is from Cusseta. ``It seems to be OK to be a black
Republican these days. You don't see a lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is quick to believe this new GOP message. What the
party is attempting to do is take into account U.S. Census
predictions that minority Americans will shortly represent the
majority of Americans, said Dr. Ron Walters, director of the
African American Leadership Institute at the University of
Maryland. The party wants to reverse the unfriendly tone some say
was set by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., Walters said.
Mostly, the party wants votes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that people of color are being used by the Republican
party for a political obligation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still others claim that many African-Americans have always been
conservative in their philosophy. People making this argument point
to church-going traditions and entrepreneurship often seen in
mostly black communities around the country. They say this concept
should not be so difficult for people to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Chappell, a black Republican delegate from Atlanta, said
his turnaround came during his growing-up years in the Los Angeles
area. He had a great aunt who cleaned houses for a living, but
saved her pennies, listened to classical music, enjoyed the piano
and opera, and vacationed in Palm Springs, all things that Chappell
and the public in general did not associate with black people back
in that era. In fact, Chappell said, his family made fun of this
great aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I got older and went to college, I found out she was the
one who was right,'' Chappell said.
</P>
<P>
   Chappell insists that the Republican Party has not been cruel to
minorities in its insistence at abolishing affirmative action, as
many Democrats have argued, but rather, wants people to take pride
in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've been raised as a Democrat, all you know are the
Democratic virtues,'' Chappell said. ``Now it's about high-tech.
It's about having our own businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Nora Reese, a black Republican alternate delegate from Warner
Robins, said the self-help message continually drummed by the GOP
is something she would like to see in her county, where poverty has
beaten down many in the African American community. She said she
would like to see her fellow African-Americans in middle Georgia
break away from their dependence on government-subsidized housing
and public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Reagan Democrat,'' said Reese, 40. ``I switched in '86.
I felt that my community had been too dependent on big government
for social needs.''
</P>
<P>
   George Bush speaks to this, Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His thing is he does not want to leave anyone behind. His
youth excites me. His message is coming from the heart,'' she said.

CANADIAN TV NETWORK BUYS MUCH OF BLACK'S NEWSPAPER EMPIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Making a bold bet on the future braiding of
television, newspapers and the Internet, Canada's second-largest
private television network announced plans Monday to buy about half
of the country's larger daily newspapers from Conrad Black, the
international press lord.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest media deal in Canadian history, CanWest Global
Communications Corp., a company that started 20 years ago with a
North Dakota television station, is to pay $2.36 billion for
dominant dailies in eight of Canada's 10 provinces. Black is to
gain a seat on the CanWest Board and to become the second-largest
shareholder, after the family of the company founder, Israel H.
Asper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The borders are gone, we have to grow,'' Asper, Global's
chairman, told a news conference Monday, comparing his acquisition
to Tribune Media's recent purchase of The Los Angeles Times. ``We
don't intend to be one of the corpses lying beside the information
highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said in a statement that his company, Hollinger Inc.,
``believes this intimate association with a highly successful
telecaster built by an entrepreneurial spirit compatible with
Hollinger is the best possible assurance of the strength of the
newspaper franchises.''
</P>
<P>
   In the political realm, the newspaper ownership change could
affect Canada's growing conservative movement. Black, an outspoken
press baron, placed his free-market stamp on some of the nation's
most influential editorial pages. During the recent leadership race
of the new conservative party, the Canadian Alliance, his National
Post newspaper seemed, to some readers, to be the movement's
official newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Asper, who runs his national television network
from his hometown of Winnipeg, Manitoba, has long been seen as a
low profile social democrat, running the provincial branch of the
Liberal Party for five years in the 1970s. Canada does not have
laws barring the ownership of newspapers and television stations in
the same media market, and the Liberal Government of Jean Chretien
is not expected to place regulatory barriers in the way of the this
merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as if the unapologetic conservative, Conrad Black,
has surrendered the reins,'' Chris Dornan, director of Carleton
University's journalism school, said Monday from Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Black's sale seemed to be primarily motivated by his crushing
debt load, $1.6 billion. Under the deal, CanWest will assume
responsibility for about $460 million in Hollinger debt.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of this year, Canada's print media suffered a
psychological body blow as most of the nation's newspapers were put
up for sale, either by Black or by Kenneth R. Thomson. Thomson,
chairman of the Thomson Corp., clearly said that he wanted to
invest deeper in electronic information services. Two weeks ago,
Thomson completed the sale of his 49 American newspapers, for $2.44
billion. Thomson is trying to sell five of his Canadian newspapers
and has said he will retain ownership of the Globe and Mail of
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Black has sent mixed signals about newspapers. In April, he said
he wanted to sell his Canadian weeklies and smaller dailies. But
with Monday's announcement, he is selling newspapers that dominate
some of Canada's most important markets, including The Ottawa
Citizen, The Montreal Gazette, The Calgary Herald, The Edmonton Sun
and The Vancouver Province.
</P>
<P>
   If the sale goes through as expected in late September, Black,
55, will have tailored his press fiefdom to ownership of newspapers
in prestige cities that he cares about: The London Telegraph, the
Jerusalem Post and the Chicago Sun-Times.
</P>
<P>
   As for his pet Canadian project, The National Post, a
Toronto-based newspaper that in less than two years of existence
has added a muscular conservative voice to Canada's intellectual
debate, Black is to become the newspaper's chairman and Hollinger
is to retain management control. CanWest will own 50 percent of
this national newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Black was on vacation in Europe and did not return
telephone calls left at his Toronto and New York offices. But in
his press statement, he seemed to expect criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There continues to be an audible body of opinion that holds
that the newspaper industry has entered a period of stagnation or
even decline,'' said Black, who is Hollinger's chairman. ``We
strenuously disagree with this and look forward to demonstrating
both the fallacy of this view and the enduring vitality of quality
newspaper assets intelligently managed and imaginatively linked
with other media.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Don Babick, The Post's publisher, declined in an interview to
predict how the marriage of electronic and print media would take
place, saying only: ``We are blending ourselves with a first-class
national telecaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal would greatly strengthen the news-gathering capacity of
CanWest, making it ``far and away the leading Canadian media
operation,'' said Dornan, a former television journalist. ``These
guys are going to have the robust newsrooms in every single market
in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   CanWest estimated that the combined strengths of the merged
operations could save the company up to $100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Little known in the United States, CanWest Global emerged in
recent years as Canada's third-largest television network, after
CBC, the government-owned network, and CTV, a privately owned
network. Bell Canada Enterprises, a major telephone company, wants
to buy CTV, largely with the idea of piping television and Internet
programs over Bell lines.
</P>
<P>
   From the small station imported 20 years ago from North Dakota,
CanWest grew by calling its collection of separately licensed
stations a ``system''rather than a ``network.'' Under Canadian
broadcasting laws, networks have to air a higher percentage of
Canadian-made programs than systems. American programs can be
bought for one-tenth the cost it takes to produce Canadian
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Global has been as studiously nonpolitical as possible,
producing as little Canadian content as possible and making as much
money as possible,'' said Vincent A. Carlin, chairman of the
journalism school of Ryerson Polytechnic University in Toronto.
``They were always failing the government guidelines, and always
getting a break.''
</P>
<P>
   After succeeding in Canada, Asper methodically expanded in the
industrialized English-speaking world, buying television stations
in Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has taken some of the economics of a big box retailer and
applied them to small market media, where you buy American
programming in bulk and pass the savings along,'' said Paul W.
Taylor, who worked for Asper's first television station before
studying the company for a doctorate in communications. He said
Global was one of the largest buyers of American television
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor predicted that with the merger, the newspapers would
strengthen television news programs, the newspapers would promote
the television entertainment shows, and that advertisers would get
larger audiences. He said: ``If you are a national advertiser, with
a single buy, you will be able to reach the eyeballs you want to
move your goods.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Global became a full network, complete with a
familiar red flash logo. Now, Asper and his son, Leonard, the
president of CanWest, may have decided that Canadian news is the
Canadian content that Canadians most want to see. By this
reasoning, Californians want to see California news, but not
necessarily California movies. Dornan said: ``News about ourselves,
journalism, current affairs programming, documentaries _ that's
what Canadians want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal Monday suggested that Black might eventually play a
bigger role in Global. He has repeatedly entered companies by
holding a minority position, then has ended up wresting control. He
is to end up with 15 percent of the equity of CanWest, making him
the second-largest shareholder after the Asper family.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Black may have to content himself with what the
deal offers: a seat on the CanWest board for himself and for
another Hollinger representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asper family's control of the corporation is beyond his
reach,'' said Richard Siklos, author of ``Shades of Black: Conrad
Black and the World's Fastest Growing Press Empire'' (McClelland &AMP;
Stewart, 1995 ). ``It's an exit strategy for Black and these
newspapers. I wouldn't expect it to be a lasting partnership.''

 &HT;    GOP EXPANDING OUTREACH TO BLACKS
 &HT;    By MELANIE EVERSLEY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ There was a time when such a scene would have
seemed surreal.
</P>
<P>
   The emcee for the luncheon laid manicured hands atop the podium
and prodded the audience to applaud for the man they all knew from
the big screen's ``Shaft,'' the black-oriented action movie from
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   As the mostly white, well-heeled crowd put their hands together
in the Grand Ballroom of the Philadelphia Marriott _ as if they
really had seen ``Shaft'' _ Richard Roundtree jogged onstage.
</P>
<P>
   The black actor praised the principles of self-help touted by
the Republican Party, to which he belongs. The audience of GOP
conventioneers cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel comfortable being a Republican,'' Roundtree later
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Roundtree might not have felt so comfortable being a Republican
in the days when ``Shaft'' was popular. He may not have felt
comfortable even just five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But convention organizers say they are kicking off a new
campaign of inclusion for America's minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a very diverse party that invites people of all
different backgrounds to this convention,'' said Andy Card,
convention co-chairman. ``Gov. Bush has reached out in Texas in
particular to bring people into the party who have not been active
heretofore.''
</P>
<P>
   Words like ``inclusion'' and ``community'' are being tossed
around, and the party is putting money behind several black
Congressional candidates, including three who addressed the
convention on Monday. One of them, Dylan Glenn, is challenging
Sanford Bishop for the seat representing the district in and around
Albany and Valdosta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The three black Republican Congressional candidates networking,
handshaking and fund-raising here on Monday are spending a good
deal of their time getting out the message that the GOP is ready to
work with minority Americans.
</P>
<P>
   And there are people out there who clearly believe in this
message. For instance, most recent government records show Glenn
has raised more than half a million dollars and nearly as much as
Bishop. Jennifer Carroll, challenging Rep. Corrine Brown in
Florida's 3rd congressioand seeking the seat of Republican Rep.
Rick Lazio, who is running for Senate _ all offered similar
messages of how record-breaking their posts would be if they won
their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn told delegates he would be the first black Republican man
in Congress since Reconstruction representing the deep South if he
won his race. Johnson said she would be the first Republican woman
from Long Island to ever be elected to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of Glenn's platform is growth and employment.
The 31-year-old president of a non-profit economic development
organization that he founded says what the rural, second
Congressional district desperately needs is jobs. He believes he
can and will develop that job growth by mixing and talking
frequently with constituents and promoting economic development.
But he also said he sees the reality of the GOP'S new willingness
to welcome people like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news flash here is that it's not easy and it takes time,''
said Glenn, who is from Cusseta. ``It seems to be OK to be a black
Republican these days. You don't see a lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is quick to believe this new GOP message. What the
party is attempting to do is take into account U.S. Census
predictions that minority Americans will shortly represent the
majority of Americans, said Dr. Ron Walters, director of the
African American Leadership Institute at the University of
Maryland. The party wants to reverse the unfriendly tone some say
was set by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., Walters said.
Mostly, the party wants votes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that people of color are being used by the Republican
party for a political obligation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still others claim that many African-Americans have always been
conservative in their philosophy. People making this argument point
to church-going traditions and entrepreneurship often seen in
mostly black communities around the country. They say this concept
should not be so difficult for people to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Chappell, a black Republican delegate from Atlanta, said
his turnaround came during his growing-up years in the Los Angeles
area. He had a great aunt who cleaned houses for a living, but
saved her pennies, listened to classical music, enjoyed the piano
and opera, and vacationed in Palm Springs, all things that Chappell
and the public in general did not associate with black people back
in that era. In fact, Chappell said, his family made fun of this
great aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I got older and went to college, I found out she was the
one who was right,'' Chappell said.
</P>
<P>
   Chappell insists that the Republican Party has not been cruel to
minorities in its insistence at abolishing affirmative action, as
many Democrats have argued, but rather, wants people to take pride
in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've been raised as a Democrat, all you know are the
Democratic virtues,'' Chappell said. ``Now it's about high-tech.
It's about having our own businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Nora Reese, a black Republican alternate delegate from Warner
Robins, said the self-help message continually drummed by the GOP
is something she would like to see in her county, where poverty has
beaten down many in the African American community. She said she
would like to see her fellow African-Americans in middle Georgia
break away from their dependence on government-subsidized housing
and public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Reagan Democrat,'' said Reese, 40. ``I switched in '86.
I felt that my community had been too dependent on big government
for social needs.''
</P>
<P>
   George Bush speaks to this, Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His thing is he does not want to leave anyone behind. His
youth excites me. His message is coming from the heart,'' she said.

ADS BY DEMOCRATS TIMED FOR GOP CONVENTION TARGET BUSH'S RECORD IN
TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Democratic Party released two new 15-second television
commercials Monday timed to the opening of the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia that attack the Texas record of Gov.
George W. Bush, the Republican's presidential nominee, on health
care and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Victory 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN
</P>
<P>
   Both spots open with a shot of confetti and red, white and blue
balloons floating above a convention hall. In the commercial on
health care, a map of Texas with a bandage slung around the
Panhandle appears. In the commercial on the environment, the same
map is shown, only with fumes billowing from the Panhandle as if
from an industrial smokestack. Both close with the words, ``For the
facts, visit www.texasunderbush.com.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT
</P>
<P>
   In the spot titled ``Texas Children,'' the narrator reads:
``Tonight in Philadelphia, you'll hear a lot about `leaving no
child behind.' Meanwhile, back in Texas, George W. Bush opposed
health coverage for 200,000 more children. The state ranked second
to last in children with health insurance. Get the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spot titled ``Environment,'' the narrator reads:
``Tonight in Philadelphia, you won't hear a lot about `the
environment.' Maybe that's because back in Texas, George W. Bush
appointed a chemical company lobbyist to enforce the environmental
laws. Houston is now the smog capital of the U.S. Get the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY
</P>
<P>
   On health care, it is true that Bush fought for a plan in 1999
that would have excluded 200,000 of the more than 400,000 children
eligible for the federal Children's Health Insurance Program. But
the Legislature insisted on the more expansive plan, and Bush
signed the bill. It is also widely accepted that Texas has more
uninsured children than any state other than Arizona. The Bush
campaign contends that the number of uninsured children is
increasing four times faster nationwide than in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On the environment, Bush's first appointee to the Texas Natural
Resources Conservation Commission was a former Monsanto executive,
Ralph Marquez, who was also vice chairman of a chemical trade group
that did lobbying. And according to preliminary statistics from the
Environmental Protection Agency, Houston surpassed Los Angeles last
year for having the most days that exceeded the agency's smog
standards. The Bush campaign says it has significantly reduced
industrial air pollution and toxic releases since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD
</P>
<P>
   Polls suggest that Bush has been adept at reaching out to
centrist swing voters on education and health care, traditionally
strong issues for the Democrats. The two new advertisements are
part of a broader effort by the Democrats to stop Bush's march
toward the center by portraying Texas as suffering an array of
social maladies and the governor as beholden to the rich and
powerful. But Vice President Al Gore has been making those attacks
for several weeks, and Bush continues to receive relatively high
marks for his leadership skills and policy positions in the polls.

GOP DISCARDS VENERATED TRADITION: TUESDAY NIGHT TRASH TALK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ There's something missing from the Republican
National Convention this year, a certain venerated tradition
discarded like political dross by a kinder and gentler GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night trash talk is gone, or so convention planners
hope.
</P>
<P>
   Long a staple on the second night of the convention, highly
partisan zingers historically have provided some of the most
memorable, occasionally disastrous, moments of otherwise
forgettable political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, in a larger effort to put a new and friendlier
face on the Republican Party and its presidential ticket,
convention officials are jettisoning the smack for a more upbeat
message of unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delegates do enjoy the trash talk because these are your
longtime, hard-core Republican Party stalwarts,'' said Cathy
McConn, a Texas delegate and national committeewoman. ``At the same
time, I think we're getting a fresh look for the party, and one
that's more appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, verbally vivisecting the other side will be
replaced as the evening's entertainment by a message on ``Strength
and security with a purpose: Safe in our homes and in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   On attack night in 1996, Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison of Texas famously noted that President Clinton had
``high-taxing, free-spending, promise-breaking, Social
Security-taxing, health care-socializing, drug-coddling,
power-grabbing, business-busting, lawsuit-loving, U.N.-following,
FBI-abusing, IRS-increasing, $200 hair-cutting, gas-taxing,
over-regulating, bureaucracy-trusting, class-baiting,
privacy-violating, values-crushing, truth-dodging,
Medicare-forsaking, property-rights-taking, job-destroying
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, partisan screeds are hardly the exclusive purview of
Republicans. Former Texas Gov. Ann Richards' best-remembered mortar
shot was delivered on savage-the-Republicans night at the 1988
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor George,'' Richards said of former President Bush. ``He
can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Both those speeches were delivered on key nights before huge
national audiences. At this convention, however, what scant traces
of Democrat-bashing can be found are so far not happening on prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, on Monday some of the lesser constellations in the
Republican galaxy delivered a few pointed barbs at Democrats during
a sparsely attended afternoon convention session.
</P>
<P>
   ``After eight years of scandal, of tax increases, of
disappearing nuclear secrets, of military decline, of partial birth
abortions and of liberal federal judges, the American people want
new leadership in Washington,'' said Don Stenberg, Republican U.S.
Senate candidate from Nebraska, offering some of the day's most
heated invective.
</P>
<P>
   The party platform this year also is lightening up on the
partisan rhetoric. In 1996, the GOP platform mentioned President
Clinton 153 times.
</P>
<P>
   This year, writers were admonished to keep the focus on Bush and
his plan for America's future. As a result, the new draft includes
two mentions of Vice President Al Gore, apparently by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Texas delegates, among the most recorded and scrutinized on the
convention floor, said they like the new magnanimity. Several said
that reaching out without slashing reflects the style of Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kinder and gentler, but I think it's also designed to
show that we have the confidence to do it without resorting to the
same old parlor tricks,'' said Paul Bettencourt, the Harris County,
Texas, tax assessor-collector attending the convention as an
alternate.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth delegate James Borchert, absorbing the mild swats
featured in the afternoon speeches, said the party's lack of rancor
is a welcome respite from the politics of nastiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good idea to keep it positive,'' Borchert said. ``It
will improve people's perception of politics.''

CONJURING WEE BIT OF SCOTLAND IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR TRIAL NO SMALL
FEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Map is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Nonsubscribers

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands _ The Netherlands is about as flat as
countries get, so here in this corner of a foreign field that is
for the moment Scotland, there are no Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a Hadrian's Wall. It is electric, and it is on
wheels.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, turning a bit of the Dutch country into Scottish
soil for the trial of the two Libyans accused in the Lockerbie
bombing has not been a great diplomatic headache. Thus far, it has
gone so smoothly that Gordon Beaton, the Scottish Court Service
administrator who oversaw the conversion, was awarded an Order of
the British Empire.
</P>
<P>
   But some compromises did have to be made. The rolling wall _
really a chain-link gate _ was the way around a potential
international incident.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is taking place on a former NATO air base that now
houses the Dutch Air Force museum, a bit of bosky glade with
various fighter-bombers on show.
</P>
<P>
   Everything beyond Gate 1, south of the museum, is legally
Scotland now, created for about $20 million in construction costs:
the courthouse, which is a converted school; the prison, which is a
converted bomb shelter; the media center, which is a converted
gymnasium; and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But the main road cuts across the strip of asphalt that connects
the museum to its repair shop. Any mechanic who darted across for a
wrench would technically be invading a foreign country containing a
high-security prison.
</P>
<P>
   So the pleasant, chatty Scottish police officers patrolling in
their checkerboard hats and carrying Heckler &AMP; Koch submachine guns
would probably have to shoot him. And the Dutch high school
students who sometimes skip the old-airplane tour and sneak into
the woods for a smoke might get the same treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than gun down their Dutch hosts or spend even more money
to build a new repair shop, the Scottish court erected a clever
two-way fence. When the two gates letting the workers cross are
open, all Scottish traffic is blocked and the ground is legally the
Netherlands. When the others open, it is Scottish soil again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got caught inside, between the gates once,'' said Richard
Bailey, a spokesman for the Scottish courts. ``And I did think,
`Where am I?''' But mostly I thought, `When the hell's the gate
going to open?'''
</P>
<P>
   In the Dutch countryside near the base, all has been quiet. The
director of the museum, Lt. Col. Dick Piest, and the press
spokesman for the nearby town of Zeist, Louis Smit, said they
hardly noticed the camp's presence. Some Zeist residents had
fretted about terrorist attacks, Smit said, but ``when they saw
that security was very good when the two Libyans arrived last year,
that disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeist's hotel rooms were booked solid when the trial opened on
May 3, but the news media have all but disappeared, as have most of
the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   Zeist and nearby Soest pick up Scotland's garbage and stand
ready to send their fire brigades if necessary. Otherwise, the
trial has little impact.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish officers ``don't wear their uniforms when they come
here, so we don't know which they are,'' said Smit. ``Maybe a few
people who sell flowers or food to the base are making some more
income, but it's hard to calculate.''
</P>
<P>
   An exception, of course, was the night that officers from the
first contingent had their farewell dinner at an Italian
restaurant. They marched down in full Highland dress, accompanied
by two bagpipers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dutch thought we were totally and absolutely mad,'' Beaton
said. Now the camp tries to make sure that each police team
includes a piper; they go along to good-neighbor events like
wreath-layings at Dutch monuments or bicycle races to raise money
for Dutch charities.
</P>
<P>
   Certain other Scottish traditions have taken the low road. For
officers designated to carry weapons (like British bobbies, they
normally do not), ``no alcohol may pass their lips from the moment
they leave Edinburgh to the moment they get back,'' Beaton said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the officers, all volunteers, serve 12-week stints, this
can be a wee strain. It is claimed _ although some hae thir doots _
that they held last year's Robbie Burns supper pouring nothing but
Iron Brew, a Scottish soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   The point of this expensive exercise is to put on trial just two
men, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah,
who are accused of being Libyan intelligence agents and of blowing
up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years of sanctions and the intervention of Prince Bandar
ibn Sultan of Saudi Arabia and Nelson Mandela finally persuaded
Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Gadhafi, to let the two
``voluntarily'' surrender to the Dutch, so that they could be tried
in the Netherlands, but under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the fence, they might as well be in Scotland. The judges,
the prison officers and the local police are Scots, and the
defendants have the same rights to the presumption of innocence as
Scottish citizens have, as well as to family visits, an exercise
bicycle and a television with Arabic channels.
</P>
<P>
   An irritating aspect for journalists inside the fence is that
everything is presumed secret until proven otherwise. Partly this
is just Scottish legal habit; neither defense lawyers nor
prosecutors speak to the press. Court spokesmen have been known to
roll their eyes and say, ``This isn't the O.J. trial'' when asked
simple questions like why scheduled witnesses are overdue.
</P>
<P>
   But partly it stems from fear that Libya will try to rescue the
suspects or kill an important witness, who is said to be a turncoat
Libyan intelligence agent now in an American witness protection
program. The weaponry and the number of officers on hand are
secret.
</P>
<P>
   At least two Americans are on the base each day: a Justice
Department lawyer assisting the prosecution and an FBI liaison
officer, but they also keep to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The ingrained secrecy habit can become comical. On a recent
stroll to the front gate to buy souvenir police T-shirts from an
officer, two journalists decided that they could not tell a curious
court spokesman their mission.
</P>
<P>
   Their fear was that the shirts would be seized because jumpy
court officials might worry that the U.S. marshals escorting the
secret witness could mistake a long-haired Irish photographer in a
thistle T-shirt for a genuine Scottish police officer and let the
secret witness be photographed.
</P>
<P>
   On their return, a court spokesman offered to trade two cups of
coffee for an accounting of where they had been. When told it was a
secret, he looked hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you secrets,'' he pleaded, unconvincingly.
</P>
<P>
   Even this article was kept secret. An interview with Beaton was
granted on the condition that it be printed only after the court
recessed for summer on July 28.
</P>
<P>
   And it contains one: Only as he reads these words is the court
spokesman learning what the mysterious ``package'' that summoned
the journalists to Gate 1 was.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Gate 1 officer cracked or the closed-circuit
televisions in the Dutch woods gave away the game.

TAIWAN'S PRESIDENT AGAIN INVITES CHINA DIALOGUE, AS HIS
ADMINISTRATION FOUNDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, issued another
appeal Monday to the Chinese government to reopen negotiations with
his government.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen's overture _ the latest of several since he was elected
in March _ was all but lost in the face of his deepening political
troubles at home and evidence of mounting impatience in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is dialogue, there can be exchanges,'' Chen said at a
news conference in Taipei. ``If there are exchanges, there can be a
consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the conciliatory words, Chen brushed aside Beijing's
demand that Taiwan acknowledge a single China, of which it is a
part. Instead, he asked China to embrace ``the spirit of 1992'' _ a
reference to negotiations in which the two sides agreed to disagree
about the meaning of ``one China.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Chen's flexibility on relations with China was
constrained last month when his party reaffirmed its support of an
independent Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   But his party ties are the least of the president's problems
these days. Chen's government has been battered by accusations of
incompetence and thwarted by Taiwan's Legislature, which is
dominated by the opposition. The 49-year-old leader's approval
rating has plummeted in polls.
</P>
<P>
   Most damaging was the government's bungled response to a recent
flash flood in central Taiwan that killed four construction
workers. The workers clung desperately to each other while the
military and police bickered over which agency should respond to
the rescue call. Tens of thousands of Taiwanese watched on
television as the four men were swept away by the raging waters.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's deputy prime minister, Yu Shyi-kun, resigned to take
responsibility for the deaths. The prime minister, Tang Fei, stayed
on only after Chen refused to accept his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chen Shui-bian's government is in deep trouble,'' said Andrew
Yang, the secretary-general of the Chinese Council of Advanced
Policy Studies, a research group in Taipei. ``His opponents,
particularly in the Legislature, are taking advantage of his
weakness on the mainland China issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen has described the tragedy as a ``turning point,'' which
will force his administration to confront thorny issues. On Monday,
he said the government would reopen an investigation into a
seven-year-old arms scandal, in which senior officials allegedly
took bribes to approve the purchase of French-made frigates, German
minesweepers and other military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are eager to see a clean government,'' Chen said.
``They are disappointed in the new government because they have yet
to see any action.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government is also showing new impatience with
Taiwan's leader. Although Beijing did not respond to Chen Monday,
the official state news media have sharpened their criticism of his
advisers. Last week, the New China News Agency condemned the head
of Taiwan's mainland affairs council, Tsai Ying-wen, for being a
separatist and denying her Chinese heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said Tsai's ``words and deeds mirror the true face of
the new leader of Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   China is also holding firm on the ``one China'' principle in its
pending agreement to join the World Trade Organization. Taiwan was
expected to gain entry as a stand-alone member, shortly after
China's admission. But Chinese negotiators are now insisting that
Taiwan be classified as a ``customs territory'' of the mainland.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Internet has given a platform to death-row inmates
and other American prisoners to plead their cases and seek pen
pals, sparking outrage among many families of victims and creating
a new debate about the rights of the growing number of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   While no American prison allows inmates to have access to the
Internet, prisoners use third-party services, usually for a fee, to
reach out to a potentially huge audience.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, dozens of inmates like Michael Blue, who is on death
row, appear on Web sites saying they were wrongly convicted of
murder. On one Web site, Blue is described as ``a little shy,
honest, caring, loving.''
</P>
<P>
   A California inmate, Askia Ashanti, appears on a Web site
looking for ``a pro bono attorney or $5,000 to $10,000 in funds to
hire an attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   And Beau Greene, who is imprisoned in Arizona, appears on a Web
site in a picture, cradling a fluffy cat and asking for pen pals.
Greene is described as ``bored and lonely with a surplus of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, 32, does not mention that he was convicted in 1996 of
killing a slender, 58-year-old musician, Roy Johnson, by bashing
the man's head against rocks.
</P>
<P>
   When the victim's daughter, Jennifer Johnson Lopez, discovered
the Web site, she said she was horrified that the killer was able
to use the Internet to escape his feeling of confinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disgusted,'' Johnson Lopez said. ``He said he missed
companionship. I thought, `Serves you right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Victims' rights groups complain that it is humiliating for
victims and their families to see prisoners popping up on Web
sites. The groups also complain that people browsing the Internet
might begin correspondence with violent criminals or believe their
stories without knowing the real details of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such criticism, officials in New York and Arizona
have enacted policies or laws that forbid prisoners from using
third-party Internet service providers. Washington and other states
have debated similar measures.
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of many civil libertarians, these measures
infringe on the First Amendment rights of inmates. Eleanor
Eisenberg, the executive director of the Arizona chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union, said her group was considering
filing a lawsuit against the Arizona measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly impinges on an inmate's First Amendment right to
communicate,'' Eisenberg said. ``It also chills the rights of third
parties who have committed no crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials, however, say they are frustrated by the Web
sites, and they say the Internet has allowed prisoners to have
soapboxes and to to prey on the innocent and softhearted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has given these criminals worldwide access and
the ability to raise huge amounts of money,'' said Gary Phelps, the
chief of staff for the Arizona Department of Corrections. ``Besides
that, we've got women coming from Australia, Belgium, England _ all
wanting to see these men they've met on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has also become a tool in championing the causes of
individual inmates, such as Mumia Abu-Jamal, who defenders contend
was wrongly convicted of killing a police officer in Philadelphia
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen Web sites carry details about the case and
history of Abu-Jamal. One of the largest sites, operated by a
private anti-death-penalty group in New York called Refuse and
Resist, describes the inmate as ``a prominent radio journalist''
being punished because he ``allowed the angry and anguished voices
of the oppressed onto the airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   It features a photograph of Abu-Jamal, smiling and raising a
clenched fist.
</P>
<P>
   A page on the Web site, under a headline reading ``The
Frame-Up,'' calls the police account absurd and says that witnesses
in Abu-Jamal's defense were harassed by law enforcement
authorities. The site invites people to join marches around the
country on Abu-Jamal's behalf. It also encourages Web site visitors
to print and distribute the posting to other potential supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal's lawyer, Leonard Weinglass, said the Internet had
allowed people around the world to closely follow Jamal's case.
``If something happens in court, it's important that our friends in
France, Germany and Denmark be informed,'' Weinglass said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, American prison authorities have long read inmates'
mail, except for legal correspondence and letters to elected
officials. But in recent years, prisons have made it more difficult
for inmates to have contact with people on the outside, said Steve
Bright, the director of the Southern Center For Human Rights, an
advocacy group for inmates' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be viewed as a positive to stay in touch with the
outside world, since the idea was that people would be
rehabilitated and then returned to society,'' Bright said. ``Now
the attitude is to make the prisons as punitive as possible and
make the prisoners as miserable as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, he said, the courts have almost always sided with
prison authorities in clamping down on the ability of inmates to
communicate with outsiders, especially reporters.  &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In New York, while inmates are forbidden to receive mail from
third-party services, they can send mail to these services, as long
as they disclose that they are prison inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in truth in inmate advertising,'' said James
Flateau, a spokesman for the New York Department of Correctional
Services. ``We want people to know who they're writing to.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other state prison systems, the New York correctional
department posts an ``inmate look-up'' on the Internet so the
potential pen pals can learn about a prisoner's record, Flateau
said, ``and decide for themselves if that's someone they want to
write to.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest third-party Internet services for inmates is
run by the Rev. Rene Mulkey, who operates in rural Missouri and has
a client list of about 1,500 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   For $10, a fee that Mulkey says is used to defray mailing costs,
inmates can have a biographical sketch posted on her Web site,
usually with a photograph, a first name and an identification
number. When people send messages to individual prisoners, she
forwards them through the United States Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the guys are asking for romance, or friends, or just
plain encouragement,'' Mulkey said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her empathy for inmates stemmed, in part, from what she
described as a ``false arrest record'' that had haunted her late
husband. ``Things are not always what they seem to be,'' she said.
``The press makes these guys out to be animals, but they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jane McGrath, a Republican state legislator who sponsored
the bill prohibiting inmates from using third-party Internet
services, said it galled the families of victims to see the smiling
faces of criminals who describe themselves as decent people.
</P>
<P>
   ````The Internet allows these people to distort history. It's a
way of further victimizing the victim,'' McGrath said.

SENIOR CHINESE OFFICIAL SENTENCED TO DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China sentenced a former central government
official to death Monday for taking almost $5 million in bribes,
the highest-profile case yet in the country's marathon
anti-corruption drive.
</P>
<P>
   The former official, Cheng Kejie, who until April was one of 19
vice chairmen of the National People's Congress under its chief, Li
Peng, would be the most senior Chinese official executed for
corruption since 1949, when the Communists took control.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng was found guilty of taking bribes while he ran the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, a poor, mountainous province bordering
Vietnam and populated largely by ethnic minorities, including the
Zhuang people. Cheng is a Zhuang, China's largest ethnic group
after Han Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng, 67, has 10 days to appeal his sentence, but such appeals
are rarely successful. On March 8, the former vice governor of
Jiangxi Province was executed for corruption almost immediately
after losing his appeal. Executions in China are carried out by
pistol shot to the back of the head.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-corruption drive, which has been in operation for two
years, is the Communist Party's latest effort to shore up its
credibility as its ideological foundations crumble, and the
country's best and brightest abandon Marxism to make money.
</P>
<P>
   The hybrid economy, in which the state owns most assets but is
relaxing control over how those assets are used, has given
officials huge opportunities for graft. Many economists believe
that corruption is unbeatable as long as the system gives officials
the use of state assets without making them responsible for those
assets' economic viability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem can't be solved by just punishing some people,''
said He Qinglian, an independent economist and outspoken social
critic, ``because this system itself breeds corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cheng's case, he and his mistress amassed $4.7 million,
primarily from kickbacks on land deals and in return for granting
development contracts between 1992 and 1998. There is no open
bidding process for such transactions and officials like Cheng have
the power to dole out land rights or development contracts as they
see fit.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese are cynical about the party's drive against
corruption, which is seen as selective because graft is so endemic.
China's news media are forbidden to investigate anything more than
petty consumer-related corruption cases. Newspapers are regularly
told not to write about even well-known corruption cases, or told
to limit coverage to dispatches from the central government's New
China News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. He advocates giving the media freer rein in investigating
corruption and allowing nongovernmental organizations to act as
watchdogs. Otherwise, the government will never successfully root
out corruption from within its own ranks, she argues. Instead, the
Communist Party has tightened control of the media and punished
people like He, who was recently demoted.
</P>
<P>
   There has been almost no state media coverage, for example, of
the country's biggest ongoing corruption case, which centers on the
smuggling of hundreds of millions of dollars in firearms, cars and
crude oil through the southeastern port of Xiamen. The case has
reportedly implicated 200 people, including Xiamen police officers,
bankers and customs agents, and the former wife of a Communist
Party Politburo member. She has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   According to widespread rumors, the case also implicates Gen. Ji
Shengde, the former head of the army's intelligence department and
the son of one of China's most vaunted revolutionary leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Ji was identified by a Chinese-American businessman, Johnny
Chung, as the source of funds used for donations to the Democratic
National Committee in 1996. But, as with much unofficial news about
China, the reports that Ji has been arrested and is awaiting trial
come from Hong Kong news organizations, which often rely on
unsubstantiated rumor from the mainland.

   Virgin Atlantic Allows Incoming Cellular Calls
</P>
<P>
   Virgin Atlantic Airways says passengers can now receive calls
made to their cellular telephone number during flights.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers get a card with a magnetic strip and an
identification number from their cell phone service. Swiping the
card at the phone at the passenger's seat and entering the
identification number activates the service, which is provided by
the BT Aeronautical division of British Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Callers who dial the individual's cell phone number will have
their calls routed to the telephone at the Virgin passenger's seat.
There is no extra charge to the callers, but the passenger will pay
a per-minute fee of $8 for incoming calls and $9 for outgoing
calls.
</P>
<P>
   This Skyphone Mobile Connect is available only for cell phones
using GSM, the dominant cell phone technology outside the United
States. Virgin Atlantic said that it eventually expected to expand
the service to American-style cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Another airline, Air Canada, said that in October it will make
it possible for passengers on its Boeing 767's to use their laptops
to gain access to the Internet and get and send e-mail messages.
After six months, it will decide whether to expand the service,
which is provided by Tenzing Communications of Seattle.

   Grand Lakeside Lodge Expanded in Ontario
</P>
<P>
   Deerhurst Resort, a luxurious lakeside 425-room hotel in the
Muskoka region of Ontario, a two-and-a-half-hour drive north of
Toronto, has opened for this season after a $12.3 million
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners, Massachusetts Mutual Insurance Co., acquired the
late 19th-century resort in 1998 and spent 18 months adding a
102-room wing, a grand ballroom and a solarium-enclosed swimming
pool near Peninsula Lake. A floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace
dominates the new lobby.  &QC; In the adjoining bar, slate floors and
intricately milled, lodge-style woodwork echo the building's new
stone and timber facade. Eclipse, the newest of Deerhurst's three
restaurants, offers views of Sunset Bay from a wraparound porch.
</P>
<P>
   Summer diversions at the resort include kayaking, canoeing,
sailing and tennis; winter guests can cross-country ski on the
800-acre property. There are two 18-hole golf courses, including
Deerhurst Highlands, with dramatic shifts in terrain that include a
30-foot rock wall on one hole.
</P>
<P>
   Once the preserve of wealthy American industrialists _ one
stretch along Lake Muskoka is called Millionaire's Row _ the
Muskoka region is known as much for its cottages and lavish summer
estates as for its 1,600 lakes, sheer granite cliffs and maple
forests.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms at Deerhurst range from $88 to $225, at $1.47 Canadian to
the U.S. dollar; multiroom suites cost as much as $463. For
information and reservations, (800) 461-4393.

<P>
   Discord in Fiji Islands Alters Cruise Schedules
</P>
<P>
   As Fiji struggles to establish a new government, cruise lines
remain concerned about the safety of some of the country's ports.
Fiji has been in turmoil since mid-May, when indigenous rebels,
objecting to leadership by people of Indian descent, seized
government officials and held them hostage until July 13.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Cruises has decided to scratch a scheduled Sept. 6 stop
at Suva, the capital of Fiji, during a 20-night voyage aboard the
Crystal Harmony that leaves San Francisco for Sydney on Aug. 22.
The ship will be at sea on the 6th and substitute a call at the
Isle of Pines in New Caledonia on Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Seabourn Sun of Seabourn Cruise Line, originally scheduled
to call at Suva on Oct. 13 during a 14-night cruise out of Sydney
that begins Oct. 3, will also bypass Fiji for now. The line will
call at Port Vila in Vanuatu instead. The Seabourn Sun, however, is
still scheduled to call at Lautoka, Fiji, on the west coast of the
main island, during a 13-night cruise from Sydney beginning Oct.
17.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Deilmann Cruises still intends to have its ship the
Deutschland call at Suva for 24 hours on Sept. 4 during an 18-night
voyage from Papeete, Tahiti, to Sydney that begins Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Star Gazing
</P>
<P>
   Amateur astronomers and other sky watchers will have a new West
Coast spot to stargaze from when the Chabot Space and Science
Center, an 86,000-square-foot facility in the hills of Oakland,
Calif., opens Aug. 19. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the center covers a broad range of sciences, the focus is
on astronomy and space exploration. An observatory complex houses
8- and 20-inch refractor telescopes (the bigger the telescope, the
clearer the view) that were relocated from the center's former
facility. A new 36-inch reflector, one of the largest public
telescopes in the country, will be installed sometime next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Live and recorded star shows will be presented in a 240-seat
planetarium equipped with one of the world's most advanced star
projectors, capable of creating more than 9,000 points of light
using fiber optics. The inaugural show is ``The Soul of the
Night,'' a 35-minute presentation featuring constellations, the
Milky Way, laser graphics and a musical soundtrack. A separate
210-seat, dome-screened theater will be used for a changing
selection of 70-millimeter films.
</P>
<P>
   In the galleries, visitors can walk through full-size mockups of
International Space Station modules and learn about planetary
landscapes and meteorites. One exhibit recreates the Earth's
changing atmosphere, oceans and continents through a 3-D device
called a Hologlobe, on permanent loan from the Smithsonian
Institution.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The center is at 10000 Skyline Boulevard. Admission $8, $5.50
ages 65 and over and 4 to 12; separate planetarium or theater
tickets are $8.75, $6.50 seniors and children. Combination tickets
including either the planetarium or theater are $14.75, $11 seniors
and children; tickets including both are $19.75, $15.50 children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no charge for the telescopes, which are positioned by
staff members and are open to the public on Friday and Saturday
evenings. Information: (510) 530-3480; www.chabotspace.org.

 &HT;    'New economy' workers gain attention of political campaigns
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Democrats and Republicans are reshaping their
doctrines in this year's presidential campaign to appeal to ''new
economy'' workers, says Business Week (Aug. 7). Many of these
workers are ``economically conservative, socially tolerant swing
voters who live in suburbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Affluent ``new prosperity'' workers now account for one-third of
all registered voters _ a rapidly growing slice of the electorate.
What's more, the confluence of Information Age productivity and the
record nine-year economic expansion has transformed Campaign 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax cuts and culture wars have receded as issues,'' Business
Week says. ``Education, health care and concerns about keeping the
high-tech boom chugging along have zoomed to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   End of `dot-com' magic
</P>
<P>
   This may be the first ''new economy'' presidential campaign, but
90-year-old management guru Peter Drucker says the ``dot-com''
phenomenon that came with it probably ``is over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these Internet start-ups were not start-ups of
business, at all. They were just stock exchange gambles,'' Drucker
tells ''new economy'' magazine Business 2-0 (Aug. 22). ``If there
was a business plan, it was just to launch an IPO (initial public
offering) or be bought _ not to build a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Shocking investments
</P>
<P>
   Electric-utility stocks are surging, according to Barron's (July
31). Utilities should post strong earnings because the still-sound
economy is generating such robust demand that there are power
shortages in many areas. The outlook is particularly bright for
companies such as Atlanta-based Southern Co., the investment weekly
says.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of renewal
</P>
<P>
   Harlem, the epicenter of African-American culture, is getting
more like Mickey Mouse and Starbucks than Billie Holiday and Duke
Ellington, says Inc. Magazine (August). That's because of an
economic development boom that is bringing large, outside
corporations into the famed Manhattan neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   After years of poverty and neglect, Inc. says Harlem may now be
facing the kind of uncontrolled growth that will crowd out many
small, homegrown businesses unable to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning...
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The problem with making automobiles more fuel efficient is
``the green car paradox.'' As Forbes (Aug. 7) columnist Peter Huber
explains it, the goal of fuel efficiency advocates is reduced
energy consumption. But he says ``more supply-side efficiency means
lower-cost energy, which means more consumption, not less.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gross sales of the 100 biggest black-owned businesses in
America have risen from $473.4 million in 1972 to $16.03 billion in
1999, an increase of more than 3,000 percent, Black Enterprise
(August) says in its 30th anniversary edition.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What'll it be if you're a small-business owner: voice mail,
e-mail, fax, phone or all of the above? Atlanta bimonthly
Competitive Edge (August) offers advice on how small firms can cope
with the options available.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ALSO INSIDE: The August issue of Esquire magazine features
female Olympic hopefuls and a profile of the owner of Southern
Voice, a regional gay newspaper.

`HONOR AND INTEGRITY' IS BUSH'S APPLAUSE LINE
</HEADLINE>
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ He rarely mentions President Clinton in his
stump speeches these days, and his aides are constantly pointing
out that the Republican convention will not be devoted to bashing
the Democrats. But as Gov. George W. Bush marches toward his
coronation in Philadelphia, it is clear that the president is not
far from his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he hits the high notes about family and faith, Bush's
pointed subtext in his five-day, six-state ``Renewing America's
Purpose'' tour is President Clinton and the saga of Monica
Lewinsky. On Monday, as he does at the end of almost every speech,
he raised his hand high and made his ritual pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to conclude by telling you,'' he said, ``that when I
put my hand on on the Bible that day in January of 2001, I will
swear not only to uphold the laws of the land, I will swear to
uphold the honor and integrity of the office to which I have been
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the statement proved his biggest applause getter at a
rally Monday morning at the University of Dayton and again at the
statehouse here in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been running against Clinton's character for
years, often to see their efforts boomerang. But Bush does it more
subtly than some Republicans. And polls show that while Americans
are content with the economy, they are concerned about values and
the moral state of the nation and the Bush campaign hopes to
capitalize on that discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks about restoring the honor and integrity to the White
House,'' said Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman. ``I think that's
something that the American people talk with him about at almost
every stop and he does talk about the need for that and I think
that's something people are looking for in this election.''
</P>
<P>
   She took umbrage at the idea that his words amounted to shots at
Clinton. And she disavowed the warm-up speakers at Bush's rally in
Cincinnati on Sunday who struck the same anti-Clinton themes less
subtly than Bush. A radio talk show host spoke about the ``filth
and degradation of Clinton-Gore'' while the mayor of Blue Ash,
Ohio, Jim Sumner, asked, ``Are you ready to have your daughter
serve as an intern?''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said, ``Governor Bush hopes that the Republicans across
the country will join with him in helping to raise our political
discourse to a higher level.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that in his speech to the convention on Thursday night,
Bush ``will needle his opponents a little but he will treat them
with respect. He will not engage in the kind of trash and burn
attack style politics that we have become so sick of out of
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Her words illustrated a basic point and counterpoint of the
campaign. While Democrats have gone on the attack against Cheney
and his record of votes in Congress, the Bush campaign responds
with attacks against attacks, clearly hoping to reinforce the
perception of Vice President Al Gore as running a negative
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign says the Republicans are counterattacking
because they are ``wrong on the issues.'' Douglas Hattaway, a
spokesman for Gore said, ``An informed voter is their worst
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes countered: ``Let's point out a vote where Dick Cheney
voted to increase funding for Head Start by 16 percent. Al Gore
voted no. Now, should we run an ad claiming Al Gore's against Head
Start?''

 &HT;    16 Georgia players disciplined in phone scandal
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. - The Georgia Bulldogs on Monday suspended seven
football players one game each and nine others were disciplined for
their unauthorized use of a university long-distance access code.
</P>
<P>
   The suspended players include starting defensive tackle Richard
Seymour, defensive end Charles Grant and middle linebacker Kendrell
Bell. Reserve running back Kenny Bailey, tight end Robert Brannon,
cornerback Decory Bryant and linebacker Tony Gilbert also were
suspended one game for charging more than $50 worth of phone calls
using UGA Athletic Association code.
</P>
<P>
   Under penalties recommended by the NCAA, the players must repay
the charges and sit out one of the first two games. Georgia may
withhold four players from the Sept. 2 opener against Georgia
Southern, and then have three sit out the Sept. 9 game at South
Carolina, or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conduct of these players was inappropriate and is a
violation of NCAA rules,'' Georgia coach Jim Donnan said in a
statement. ``We did discover the violation, promptly notified the
Southeastern Conference and the NCAA, and conducted a very thorough
investigation. The players understand their mistake and are willing
to take responsibility for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan declined additional comment.
</P>
<P>
   Nine additional players also made unauthorized calls, but the
totals were less than $50. Players who made calls totaling $25 to
$50 will have to pay restitution and serve 30 hours of community
service; players with totals of less than $25 will serve one hour
of community service for every dollar charged and repay the school
for the calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake, but part of being a man is admitting your
mistakes, paying for the mistakes, and learning from them,'' said
Seymour, an All-America candidate this season. ``I'm prepared to do
that and, at the same time, apologize for the problems I've
caused.''
</P>
<P>
   The players could still face punishment from the university's
Student Judiciary. ``We will work with the athletic department on
this but . . . these are students first and athletes second,'' said
Owen Barber, UGA's director of Student Judicial Services.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents obtained by the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, an athletic department employee became aware
of the charges in March while completing a routine audit. The calls
were made between July 1999 and December 1999, and were charged to
a long-distance access code that was once issued to a receptionist
at Georgia's Butts-Mehre Heritage Hall.
</P>
<P>
   When the employee was promoted to an assistant in athletics
director Vince Dooley's office, the access code was never
deactivated so part-time employees could still use it. More than
$1,700 in calls were made during that period, and Georgia's
investigation found that football players accounted for more than
$900 in calls. Most of the calls were placed from a telephone in
the team locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``In discussing it with some of the student-athletes, we
couldn't determine where it started,'' said Hoke Wilder, Georgia's
assistant athletics director for compliance. ``But it was passed on
from athlete to athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilder said that some of the athletes told him they were unaware
they were using a Athletic Association calling card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were some cases where the players really didn't
know what they were using,'' he said. ``They thought they were
using a calling plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia reported the violations to the SEC in March. Initially,
athletics director Vince Dooley recommended the suspension of
Bailey and Brannon for the first half of the Georgia Southern game
and that the rest of players serve community service. Bailey and
Brannon were the only active players who had totals of more than
$100.
</P>
<P>
   SEC commissioner Roy Kramer agreed with those self-imposed
penalties, but the NCAA's Subcommittee on Student-Athlete
Reinstatement ruled that they weren't adequate. The committee
recommended that players with totals of more than $50 be suspended
for one game.
</P>
<P>
   On April 24, Dooley sent a letter to Julie Roe Sumner, director
of reinstatement for the NCAA. Dooley wrote that Georgia ``strongly
believes the penalty of a one-game suspension for a first-time
violation to be excessive'' for players with less than $100 in
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley also asked that the suspensions be served over the first
three games, instead of two, because it ``would create a severe
hardship on the defensive unit and, of course, penalize the team.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wilder said Monday that the NCAA will no longer allow
schools to stagger the suspensions over more than one game. In the
future, suspensions will be served on the first scheduled game
after penalties are levied.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ At the moment on Monday when the announcement of the
first of the two Parliament votes for Israel's next president made
it all but certain that he had lost the last big battle of his
60-year political career, Shimon Peres, Nobel Prize laureate,
three-time prime minister and one of the most enduring
standard-bearers for Middle East peace, remained in character.
</P>
<P>
   The result, with 60 votes for Moshe Katsav, the Iranian-born
immigrant who was the eventual winner; 57 votes for Peres, and
three blank ballots, brought loud groans, slumped shoulders and
moist eyes among members of Parliament backing Peres to become
Israel's eighth president.
</P>
<P>
   But Peres himself, aware that Katsav's second-ballot victory was
a virtual certainty, merely thrust his hands in the trouser pockets
of his dark suit, leaned back against the parliamentary chamber's
rear wall, and talked studiedly with friends.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came as Prime Minister Ehud Barak survived a
no-confidence vote mounted by opponents of his peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   To those who know Peres, the 76-year-old statesman appeared on
Monday to be nursing a deep private hurt, but in his manner and
words he did nothing overt to bely his reputation for courtliness.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome cannot have been made easier by the fact that the
54-year-old Katsav was a relatively obscure figure who had never
held an office more weighty than tourism minister in the last Likud
government and whose name would almost certainly draw blanks in the
chancelleries and palaces around the world where Peres' visits have
become a fixture.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment, the only thing I have to say is to
congratulate Moshe Katsav on his election as president,'' Peres
told reporters who engulfed him as he left the Parliament chamber
after the second ballot had confirmed Katsav as the victor by 63
votes to 57. ``I wish him success and all the best.''
</P>
<P>
   With no further word for the clamoring throng, Peres turned and
walked away, this time almost certainly into retirement from a
political career whose glittering pinnacle was the 1993 Nobel Peace
Prize that Peres won for his role in the Oslo peace accords, along
with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Yitzhak Rabin, the
prime minister who was assassinated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   For all his honors, Monday's defeat, denying Peres a five-year
term in an office with mainly ceremonial powers in a magnificent
presidential mansion in the heart of Jerusalem, will almost
certainly mark him as one of Israel's great losers.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the vote, the talk in the Parliament hallways was of
whether Peres could shake off the image he has acquired over the
last two decades by losing four of five elections for prime
minister, as well as leadership battles within the Labor Party that
relegated him to runner-up status first behind Rabin and then Ehud
Barak, the current prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   While many factors appeared to have combined to secure Katsav
his victory, including the last-minute defection of at least a half
dozen members of Parliament who had assured Peres of their support,
there was no doubt that the perennial loser tag followed him into
the vote, and may even have been what sunk him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His reputation as a loser may have been something that
influenced some Knesset members,'' said a chagrined Yosef Lapid, a
68-year-old Parliament veteran whose six-member centrist Shinui
Party supported Peres.
</P>
<P>
   The vacancy in the presidency came with the resignation three
weeks ago of Ezer Weizman, a 75-year-old stalwart of the old
political elite, who quit mid-way through a second term after state
prosecutors issued a report harshly criticizing him for financial
improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   When the day began, accounts in many of Israel's newspapers
depicted the presidential vote as a virtual formality. The papers
said Peres' election was more or less assured by his towering
reputation as a peacemaker and as a major figure in Israeli
governments since the 1960s and by his association, almost from
boyhood, with most of the major political icons of Israel's
history.
</P>
<P>
   An eve-of-vote Gallup poll in the newspaper Maariv had Peres as
the popular choice for the post, 63 percent to 20 percent for
Katsav, with 17 percent undecided. But political power in Israel
has been shifting for years from the old Ashkenazi elite with roots
in eastern Europe that the Polish-born Peres personifies, and the
newspaper forecasts appeared to have underestimated how far the
process has gone among the elected members of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In Katsav, whose first home in Israel was a tent, the Parliament
chose a man who is not widely known even inside Israel. His home is
in Qiryat Malakhi, about 30 miles south of Tel Aviv, one of the
working-class ``''development towns'' that many prosperous Israelis
consider deeply unfashionable.
</P>
<P>
   But precisely because of this modest background, Katsav has a
strong chance, as president, of turning himself into an icon for
many of Israel's six million people. When he is sworn in on
Tuesday, he will be the first Israeli president from the underclass
of Sephardic immigrants who flooded into the country from the
Middle East and north Africa in the 1950s. He will also be the
first successful presidential nominee from Likud, the right-wing
party with broad working-class and Sephardic support.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the days before the vote, Katsav campaigned aggressively
among the right-wing and ultra-Orthodox splinter parties with
strong Sephardic support that control crucial blocs of votes in the
120-seat Parliament, tapping the alienation among the have-nots of
Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   But in victory, he struck a conciliatory note, saying he
intended to ``lock up'' his political views during his five-year
term and work as ``the loyal representative of all Israeli
citizens, of all strata, of all sections, of all classes.''
</P>
<P>
   His speech brought loud cheers from his supporters, and smiling
handshakes from several Labor Party members, including Dalia Rabin,
daughter of the assassinated prime minister and a herself a member
of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The big question facing Israelis after the presidential vote was
what impact it would have on the peace efforts. After the huge
gains made in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations that have been
virtually synonymous with Peres, the march to a final peace pact
faltered last week after 15 days of negotiations at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   One theory about Peres' loss on Monday was that right-wing
lawmakers could not stomach the prospect of Peres as president,
notwithstanding the office's limited powers. Unquestionably, one
thing that drew backing for Katsav from a block of 22 right-wing
members belonging to Shas, a religious party that broke with
Barak's coalition before Camp David, and to United Torah Judaism,
another right-wing Orthodox group, was Katsav's widely-advertised
opposition to some of the concessions that Barak offered Arafat at
Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   In Knesset hallways, some wondered if the erosion of support for
Peres might have been engineered by Barak, who has had uneasy
relationship with his predecessor as Labor Party leader. But
Barak's aides said the Labor bloc had voted solidly for Peres, and
Barak himself appeared upset.
</P>
<P>
   But an even stronger factor than calculations about the peace
process appeared to have been played by the growing political power
of Sephardic parties, and of political groups that draw their
support from among the one-million Russian immigrants who have
arrived in the past two decades. Many of these groups, including
Shas, want changes that would chip away at the secular nature of
Israeli politics, and tighten religious laws and practices.
</P>
<P>
   Haim Shibi, parliamentary correspondent for Yedioth Ahronoth,
the country's most widely-circulated newspaper, said that the
country was witnessing one of its most significant political
watersheds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are calling the shots now, whether you like it or not,''
he said, referring to Sephardic Jews.

ONLY HAPPY FACES IN THIS MAGIC KINGDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Earlier skedded as GOP-INTERNET)  By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican Party elders Monday declared on every channel that
would listen that they intended to put a new, more moderate face on
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours will be a different kind of convention for a different
kind of Republican,'' Andrew Card, co-chairman of the convention,
told Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new GOP, it's a new time in America,'' the party
chairman, Jim Nicholson, told MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, they seemed to pull it off. As far as the
television cameras could find, none but happy faces inhabited the
Magic Kingdom, otherwise known as Philadelphia's First Union
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled to be here and my husband and I are excited
about the future of the party,'' Cindy McCain, wife of Gov. George
W. Bush's chief primary opponent, told MSNBC. ABC had outfitted
McCain with a videocamera and was planning to regularly show
portions of her ``video diary'' during the five-day gathering. Not
surprisingly, much of the early footage featured her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who had been on the short-list to be Bush's
running mate told interviewers Monday that they were delighted _
delighted _ that the former Wyoming congressman Dick Cheney had
been chosen in their stead. As Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee and
others noted, Cheney was ``popular on both sides of the aisle,''
despite what he called efforts by Democrats to paint him as a
right-winger in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing is not much fun when there are not any waves.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, several Republican candidates for the House and
Senate were given a few minutes in front of the nearly empty
chamber during the morning session (at times, it looked like the
crowd for a baseball game between two last-place teams on a drizzly
day), and a few of them seemed to have trouble sticking to
don't-bash-the-Democrats rule.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rod Grams, running for re-election from Minnesota, told the
Republican delegates that they were part of ``the party of
opportunity, not the party of oppression.'' The party of
oppression? Lighten up, dude. Didn't he get the memo?
</P>
<P>
   The result was that reporters and commentators _ there are
15,000 journalists representing 1,700 news organizations _ were
forced to look elsewhere for drama, or to supply it in the
traditional way, by arguing among themselves. Others just tried a
different tack.
</P>
<P>
   CBS gave us a tour of the Main Line, the ritzy suburban stretch
west of the city, and said it had ``discovered'' that the district
was named for the rail line that runs through it. CNN talked about
the party scene. Apparently, the hot ticket on Sunday night was a
bash put on by the Bloomberg News Service, although another
headlined by Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., in which the Oklahoman sang with
the Temptations, was a close second. Monday night, the place to be
was the party for John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN hopped on a yellow school bus rented by demonstrators to
take a ``reality tour'' of Philadelphia, a visit to the tent city,
where out-of-town protesters were encamped, and through the city's
poverty-stricken neighborhoods. ``We are not experiencing a booming
economy and our poverty is getting worse every day,'' said Tazmin
Cheshire of the Kensington Welfare Rights Union, who acted as tour
guide.
</P>
<P>
   Fox News' World Wide Web site decided that the best way to cover
the demonstrators was to offer a daily ``slightly opinionated
column'' that poked fun at them, describing one group of marchers
as ``a writhing mass of several thousand malcontents.'' Not to
worry, though, America. ``It was all good fun,'' the column
decided. ``More like a carnival parade in Trinidad than a political
march.''
</P>
<P>
   On the British Broadcasting Corp.'s Web site, the Republican
gathering was not even one of the five top stories, relegated
instead to a digest at the bottom of the opening page (under
``Americas''). But it did offer a helpful guide on ``how to elect a
U.S. president.'' Done in the form of a baseball diamond, the
cheeky devils showed how a candidate must move from first base
(primaries), to second (the convention), third (campaign) and
finally home (Election Day).
</P>
<P>
   The BBC also offered a Republican convention quiz, asking when
the last time was a GOP ticket didn't include a Bush or a Dole
(1972) and when a woman first addressed a Republican convention
(1920). A score of 9 out of 10 meant ``you should get a job running
a political campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Great. What's second prize?

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Jeff Zucker, the executive producer of NBC News'
convention coverage, wanted a live interview Monday night from the
First Union Center with one of the event's most highly sought-after
guests: George P. Bush, the telegenic, 24-year-old nephew of the
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   But to NBC officials' dismay, the Republicans turned down the
request, and not because young Bush is camera-shy. No, Zucker
contended, NBC was spurned because it was only covering the
proceedings in prime time Monday night on its cable channel, MSNBC,
which garners substantially lower ratings than the broadcast
network.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that ABC News was to provide a full hour and CBS News
at least 30 minutes of prime time coverage starting at 10 o'clock
Monday night knocked NBC down a few notches in the interview
pecking order, Zucker said. ``It's a game,'' he observed. ``They
have divvied out guests accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, after a reporter inquired about Zucker's
complaint, the Republicans informed NBC that they could have the
young man on the air, and spokesmen for both NBC and the convention
sought to play down the episode. But the incident was instructive
about a reality of the media hierarchy here: Cable television may
provide more coverage, but the broadcast networks are still the
kings.
</P>
<P>
   That enduring truism is reflected in the way the convention
program is structured: virtually all the major speeches this week,
from those of Laura Bush and Gen. Colin L. Powell on Monday night
and continuing with Sen. John McCain and Elizabeth Dole on Tuesday,
the vice presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, on Wednesday and Gov.
George W. Bush on Thursday, are to take place between 10 p.m. and
11 p.m. That just happens to be the hour on every night that one or
more of the over-the-air networks will be covering the Philadelphia
proceedings live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is geared for the 10 to 11 o'clock hour,'' said Tom
Hannon, the political director of CNN. ``They're obsessed about
getting their message across in the 10 to 11 hour, and that is
their driving concern. People say that the conventions are for
cable, but as far as the parties are concerned, the conventions are
for the most eyeballs they can get.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting aims of the parties and the networks have led to
an odd standoff: as the conventions become ever more scripted and
ever less newsworthy in the strictest journalistic sense, the
networks become ever less interested in covering them. Yet the
conventions vie for the network cameras as vigorously as ever, and
the networks still show up in vast numbers, but with scaled back
prime-time coverage plans.
</P>
<P>
   According to Thomas E. Patterson, a Harvard professor of
government and the press, convention coverage on ABC, NBC and CBS
has declined from 50 total hours in 1976 to 12 hours in 1996, and
this year, he reported, that total may dwindle to 10 hours. He told
a conference here on Saturday, sponsored by the Harvard's Joan
Shorenstein Center on the Press, that if the networks were to
abandon the conventions altogether, the audience for the gatherings
would be cut in half. In 1976, the conventions had an average
prime-time rating of 28; by 1996 it had dropped to about 17.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Patterson did not place all the blame for the erosion of
network attention on the broadcasters. ``The parties need to loosen
up a bit, and allow for a little more conflict and spontaneity,''
he said, adding that recent polls show that ``those who might be
expected to watch said it's the lack of suspense that's keeping
them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even keeping awake could be a problem. Zucker, who has been
detached from his normal producing duties at the ``Today'' program
to oversee the party gatherings, seemed a bit underwhelmed Monday
at the prospect of supplying four nights of coverage, principally
on MSNBC, the network's cable channel. NBC will also cover the
proceedings on its flagship channel on Wednesday and Thursday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting Monday afternoon in an air conditioned trailer,
Zucker and Elizabeth O'Connell, the news executive producer of
special events, gave out assignments to the correspondents for the
night of cable coverage _ David Bloom was to answer viewers' e-mail
from the floor, for example _ and presented an overall theme for
the three-hour program, the ``soft side of the Republican party.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were to fan out and report on the conservative bent of
the delegates and try to score interviews with more coveted
Republican luminaries. (George P. is widely considered a
significant ``get,'' as are the presumptive nominee's parents, who
were to appear on MSNBC Monday night.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the event does not exactly enthrall Zucker. ``I'm not
sure it's not a colossal waste of time and money,'' he said after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker is not a lone voice. Many in the news business, both in
print and broadcast, mutter to one another about the gargantuan
size of the press corps here _ 15,000 plus, or more than 7 for
every delegate _ and the puniness of the story. ``Great drama and
great TV and great journalism are built on conflict,'' Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans seem unfazed about the lack of drama. Their big
worry is to keep up the pace and make sure they exploit the
television moment. On the convention floor Monday, Ed Gillespie, a
Bush adviser who had been working on the convention for six weeks,
was preoccupied with the endless logistics. Between cell phone
calls placed to find one of the evening program's participants, he
explained that the schedule was merely the most rational use of
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the featured speakers are in the 10 o'clock hour,'' he
said, ``and that's the point at which the most people will see the
Republican convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannon said that from his vantage point, Republican operatives
are not about to start worrying about filling that hour with
breaking news. ``These guys are in the business of knowing who
their audience is,'' he said, even if their focus on packaging may
be overblown. ``Bob Dole lost in '96,'' he added, ``but they still
think they had a great convention.''

 &HT;    GOP COLLEAGUES PAY TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH DOLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The most famous North Carolinian in the GOP was
overcome with emotion and humility Monday after an hour-long
tribute that exalted her many accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am simply overwhelmed,'' said Elizabeth Dole, who addresses
the convention Tuesday night. ``In no way do I feel I deserve such
a magnificent tribute. ... You had me in tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who brought much excitement to the presidential race last
year as a GOP candidate, was honored at an upbeat and moving
ceremony in a hotel ballroom during the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues spoke of her courage, compassion and
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., praised Dole's service as president
of the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``She willingly journeyed into the face of hurricanes and
floods. And in places around the world, like Bosnia and Somalia,
she braved mine fields, civil war, and cholera epidemics to stand
with Red Cross staff and volunteers to reach out to those in the
most dire human need,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., who has known Dole for more than 30
years, said her personal side is even more impressive than her
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through all her years in Washington, no matter what the
pressures or how busy her schedule, she has always found the time
to be a friend, who never forgets a birthday or a special occasion
and who is always there when you need her,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The tribute also included video clips _ some emotional and
others humorous. The lighter side included a salute from her
husband, former Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, and a TV clip of Jay Leno
driving her onto the ``Tonight Show'' stage on a Harley Davidson
motorcycle during her husband's failed 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people thought that was the highlight of the campaign,''
Bob Dole said. ``I can't remember that there was any highlight to
the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   During her long career in public service, Elizabeth Dole held
many high-ranking positions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to heading the Red Cross, she was transportation
secretary under President Reagan and secretary of labor under
President Bush. In her role as transportation secretary, she was
responsible for the U.S. Coast Guard, becoming the first woman to
head a branch of the military.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's tribute, Dole thanked her parents, John Van Hanford
and Mary Ella Hanford, for teaching her the value of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Under their guidance, she showed leadership from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   She was the first female to run for class president at Boyden
High School in Salisbury, N.C., a post that had been off-limits for
girls. Although she did not win, it marked her determination to
take on roles not previously assumed by women.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to be student body president at Duke University,
where she graduated with a political science degree. She also
obtained a master's degree in education and took the first step in
her political career that same year working for Sen. Everett Jordan
of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   To her Republican father's dismay, she toured the South with
Democratic vice-presidential nominee Lyndon Johnson. She later went
to Harvard Law School and was one of 24 women out of a class of 550
who graduated in 1965. She later worked for President Johnson in
the Committee for Consumer Interests and took the same executive
director position when Richard Nixon became president in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she made a run at the GOP nomination, which she
called ``one of the greatest experiences'' of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that somewhere between the streets of San
Francisco, the cornfields of Iowa and the mountain roads of New
Hampshire, I may very well have met and talked to a woman who will
be the first female president of the United States,'' she said. ``I
believe that we have helped to pave the way.''

29 CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR LUCKY MINUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Even though many Republicans worry more about
losing the House than capturing the presidency, Gov. George W.
Bush's team has given the House campaign effort no prime time for
the week and indeed just half an hour of throw-away time at midday
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the feel-good atmosphere of this convention, nobody from
the congressional wing of the Republican Party could be found to
complain that Bush was putting his election ahead of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, chairman of the National
Republican Campaign Committee, said the un-prime time was just
fine, even though the House Republicans hold the majority by a
margin of just 13 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is going to be our spokesman,'' Davis said,
adding that for Republicans, ``Bush is a great brand name.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, 29 Republican congressional candidates made the
most of their allotted 60 seconds on stage. John Kline, challenging
a Democratic incumbent in the suburbs of St. Paul, Minn., walked
quickly onstage, promised to ``return control of our schools to the
parents of Minnesota and take it away from the bureaucrats of
Washington,'' and dashed off.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Eagan, Minn., Kline's supporters watched carefully
as a television camera recorded their cheers at Joe Sensor's
Restaurant. It made the noon news. Kline said later, ``It was great
for those of us to be showcased, a big help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, where retaining Republican control seems more
likely, despite the death of Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia, which
put the majority's margin at eight, also got a midday half-hour
Monday, under the control of its campaign chairman, Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his home state's Kentucky Derby, McConnell valiantly
tried to persuade the half-empty hall that there was more than a
first-place bet on Bush on the board; there was a trifecta, a wager
in which the bettor picks the first three finishers. ``Winning a
trifecta takes real skill,'' McConnell said. ``The true measure of
victory in addition to George W. Bush winning the White House is
keeping a Republican Senate and a Republican House.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded, ``It isn't going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell put six candidates forward. There were two embattled
incumbents, Spencer Abraham of Michigan and Rod Grams of Minnesota,
and four competitors for open Senate seats, Reps. Bob Franks of New
Jersey and Bill McCollum of Florida, former Rep. John Ensign of
Nevada and Attorney General Don Stenberg of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   And McConnell alluded to one other high-profile race, the one in
New York. He said, ``We're going to elect a Republican to the
United States Senate who is actually from New York.'' But he never
said the words ``Rick Lazio.''
</P>
<P>
   Later McConnell said in an interview that Lazio had been offered
one of the five-minute speaking slots for Senate candidates but had
``turned us down.'' In New York, Lazio's staff said he had better
uses for his time. He had no public campaign schedule Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was mentioned _ but by his would-be successor in the
House, Joan Johnson, the town clerk in Islip. N.Y., who said she
would ``follow in the footsteps of Rick Lazio.'' With an acute
sense of timing, Johnson, who is black, said, ``I will make
history.'' And as the audience expected her to predict that she
would become the first black Republican woman in Congress, she said
instead, ``I will be the first Republican woman ever elected to
Congress from Long Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's opponent was also mentioned _ by Franks, who said his
own Democratic opponent, Jon Corzine, was ``pushing Hillary Rodham
Clinton's failed health care plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the candidates sought to tie themselves to Bush, none
more forcefully than Stenberg. Stenberg complained that his
argument before the U.S. Supreme Court defending his state's ban on
a particular type of abortion need not have been unsuccessful. ``If
I had one more conservative justice,'' he said, ``Nebraska's ban on
partial-birth abortion would have been upheld. President George W.
Bush can make that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some House candidates had highly individualistic messages _
sometimes intended to distinguish them from their district's
general assumptions about Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Dick Zimmer, hoping to unseat Rep. Rush Holt in
central and western New Jersey's 12th District, cited a ``strong
Republican legacy that the environment will be protected for
generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kirk, contesting an open seat in the Chicago suburbs, made
a point of saying, ``I do not agree with every tenet of our
platform.'' Several hours later he explained that he disagreed with
the Republican platform's positions against abortion and
gun-control.
</P>
<P>
   Others seemed to benefit from the speechwriting assistance that
the campaign staff had offered. ``Faith, family and freedom'' was a
central message for both Dunn Lampton of Mississippi and Chuck Yob
of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The lucky 29 seemed thrilled. Mark Nielson, challenging Rep. Jim
Maloney in southwestern Connecticut, said, ``They say everybody has
15 minutes of fame, and so I know it was only one minute, and
therefore I still have 14 left.''
</P>
<P>
   While the senators and would-be senators were given five
minutes, the House hopefuls and Rep. James Rogan of California, the
only struggling incumbent to receive stage time, may not have been
aware of the good training they were receiving with their one
minute. House members most often speak for only a minute, though
they get to revise and extend their remarks and make them look
longer in the Congressional Record.

BRAZILIANS AIM TO TRANSFORM BOOM IN FASHION INTO ECONOMIC
MOMENTUM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ When the gurus of fashion came here from all
over the world a few weeks ago for a peek at MorumbiFashion,
Brazil's biggest and most prestigious fashion show, they were
wondering if this was the industry's next international capital.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's burgeoning textile and garment industries are hoping
the answer is yes. But in a country still known largely as an
exporter of goods made with cheap manual labor, questions remain
about whether the Brazilians can transform this new international
attention into something sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time for us to show to the world that we are
offering products of high quality, competitive price, good design
and beauty, and with all the characteristics of Brazil,'' said
Paulo Skaf, the president of the Brazilian Textile Association, a
trade group.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Brazilian fashion is hot. It started with
the meteoric success of a 19-year-old supermodel, Gisele Buendchen,
who was Vogue's model of the year in 1999. In four years, Buendchen
has landed on the cover of more than 250 magazines and paraded down
1,600 catwalks, bringing international attention to the concept of
``Brazilian-ness.'' Marking the trend in the United States: Bikinis
are shrinking and the caipirinha, the country's potent
lime-and-cachaca cocktail, is the drink of choice in some Manhattan
night spots.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, such Brazilian designers as Alexandre
Herchcovitch and Icarius are gaining cachet on the world fashion
circuit. Both have been asked to participate in the ready-to-wear
fashion week in Paris in October, while Herchcovitch has already
been seen on the catwalks of London. The confluence of the Gisele
phenomenon and the growing success of Brazilian designers abroad
has been called the Brazilian Moment in this country. But the
garment industry is working to make sure that the moment never
ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is all about the sensual, tropical Latino, Carnival,
sports, women, sex,'' said Nelson Alvarenga Filho, the founder and
president of Brazilian label Ellus. ``It's entertaining, and people
always need a little entertainment. That will never go out of
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   One look down the local equivalent of Madison Avenue _ Rua Oscar
Freire in Sao Paulo's posh Jardins neighborhood _ would indicate
that Brazil is on the right track. Boutiques selling both Brazilian
and international fashion are springing up all along the most
exclusive 10-block stretch, and have spilled into adjacent avenues.
</P>
<P>
   But while Sao Paulo may be turning into the fashion capital of
Latin America, Brazil still has a long way to go to break out of
its mold as a source of cheap manual labor to become an
international fashion exporter. Only a handful of the most well
known Brazilian designers have landed in stores in the United
States and Europe so far, and the $18 billion industry still
remains dominated by small businesses that lack the resources to
expand and export.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exports of garments over the past years have been around $200
million, which is about zero point nothing of world trade,'' said
Leda Oliveira, the director of foreign trade at the Brazilian
Apparel Association. ``We plan to get to $1 billion by 2003 though.
Put that in writing, and I'll sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the apparel association's first steps has been to
organize the country's small and medium-sized apparel businesses
into regional consortiums to attract more attention from national
and international buyers. The effort seems to be working. Aided by
a favorable exchange rate, garment exports were up 33 percent in
the first five months of the year, compared with 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian Textile Association has sought to take advantage
of Brazilian fashion's popularity to strengthen the country's
textile industry. It has publicized plans by textile manufacturers
to spend more than $12 billion on updated machinery over the next
several years.
</P>
<P>
   The textile association is a co-sponsor of the MorumbiFashion
show, and in June it held the country's first annual Brazilian
fashion awards, with Buendchen receiving the award for model of the
year. The textile association is also organizing a show of
Brazilian designers in a not-yet-selected European city later in
the year.

AT PLAY WITH SMILING DOLPHINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 6)  
(Editors: 2nd take is a 236-word box containing details about
accommodations) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When we headed up the Australian coast for Port Stephens, a
resort two and a half hours north of Sydney, we had expectations:
miles of lovely and empty beaches, magnificent sand dunes, famously
clean waters inhabited by trophy fish and sociable dolphins. It was
all there as promised. But there was also something not on our
list: rain.
</P>
<P>
   It did not seem to be on anyone else's list, either. The locals
never stopped professing amazement at our bad luck. No one could
remember the last time they'd had five straight days of rain. Why,
there hadn't been a drop of water in the two months before we
arrived last March. ``If only you'd come another week,'' they kept
saying. Their sympathy got more irritating every day.
</P>
<P>
   We still managed to have a good time, and that is no small
tribute to the charms of Port Stephens. Rain is the ultimate test
of a beach resort, not to mention a family's bonds. On wet days you
can't help wondering why you've spent so much time and money to
commune with nature. What exactly is so great about nature? But
there are enough other attractions to keep everyone content on the
shores of Port Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   It's a huge bay (two and a half times the size of Sydney's
harbor) with tranquil waters connected to the ocean by a narrow
opening in the headlands. The northern shore is green and largely
uninhabited. The southern shore is a peninsula that's becoming a
popular spot for resorts and retirement homes, although it is still
undeveloped compared with other coastal resorts near Sydney (or
with some on the United States Eastern Seaboard _ imagine Nags Head
a few decades ago). The attractions include a couple of tiny
amusement parks, a wildlife preserve with koalas, and a zoo where
children can pet koalas and kangaroos.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Dana, and I and our 11-month-old son stayed at one of
the better resorts on the southern shore, the Peppers Anchorage.
The resort is a collection of well-appointed town houses
overlooking a marina, with a small beach on the bay. The placid
waters are popular for water skiing and sightseeing excursions. A
few miles away, on the ocean side of the peninsula, is a national
park with hiking trails and beaches with pounding surf.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular sights are the Stockton Beach Sand Dunes,
which stretch for 20 miles along the seaside coast. They extend a
half mile inland and include dunes 10 stories high. In dry weather
you could easily imagine you were in the Sahara, especially if you
were on one of the camelback tours. We chose other forms of
transportation. Dana went across the dunes on a horse and enjoyed
the challenge of the occasional sinkhole. When the inevitable rain
came, she took consolation in being fashionably wet in the long
oilskin coat provided by her guide. It billowed in classic Outback
style as she emerged from the dunes for a gallop along the deserted
beach.
</P>
<P>
   I climbed the dunes on a quad bike, which has four balloon tires
and looks like a riding mower on steroids. The instructor, Tony
Burrell, lectured on safeguarding the environment and leaving no
traces of our rides. He also demonstrated the perils of the dunes,
like driving off the edge of a sand cornice or allowing your bike
to overturn on a slope. If you didn't follow the rules, he was fond
of repeating, ``your machine will roll over and you will be
squashed.'' It was a little frightening at first _ some of the
slopes appeared just about vertical _ but once you learned to rev
your way up and brake your way down, it was utterly exhilarating to
cruise through the dunes. Lawrence of Arabia never had it so good.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer to let someone else do the driving, there's the
Bushmobile. It carries 24 passengers and is emblazoned with the
motto of Dieter Hartmann, its German operator: ``Ve get U there
when others would not dare!'' Hartmann migrated to Australia as an
engineer and then decided to live in the bush with his wife and
another couple. They built a cabin deep and subsisted for several
years on food they hunted and gathered themselves. ``I was the
guinea pig for the plants we found,'' he says. ``I would eat it,
and if I didn't get sick, then we knew it was safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to civilization, Hartmann applied his engineering
skills to the Bushmobile, a converted military transport vehicle
with a 20-speed transmission, enormous tires and a hydraulic winch
for extricating itself from quicksand that sometimes forms in the
dunes. Hartmann's tour included dramatic descents in the Bushmobile
as well as a chance to do some sandboarding _ the dune equivalent
of sledding. He took us into Tin City, a shantytown in the dunes.
He also conducted what he called a magic carpet ride, which
consisted of bouncing across the sand on a mat dragged behind the
Bushmobile.
</P>
<P>
   High-speed rides are something of a theme in the Port Stephens
area. You can whiz down a half-mile-long winding metal chute at
Toboggan Hill Park (your toboggan, incidentally, has a brake). You
can go out on a jet boat called Foxy that hits speeds of 40 knots
and does 180-degree turns. With a little luck, you can watch
Australian and American military pilots in action by visiting
Fighter World, a museum that's next to a working military airfield.
It was raining so hard the day we visited that no planes were
flying, but we at least got to peer into the cockpits of the
fighters on display and listen to war stories from the Australian
Air Force veterans who run the museum.
</P>
<P>
   The rain didn't deter the fishermen competing in an annual event
called the Billfish Shootout at the Peppers Anchorage marina. They
were busy hauling in sharks and marlins to be weighed on the dock.
The talk of the marina was a world-record blue marlin that had just
been caught. Even amateurs can arrange to catch their dinner (and
have it superbly cooked at the hotel) on one of the charter boats.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can merely observe the marine life in what local boosters
like to call the Dolphin Capital of Australia. About 80 dolphins
have settled in the sheltered waters of the bay, and their
performances are sustaining a small fleet of dolphin-watching
boats. Our first evening in Port Stephens we boarded an elegant
yacht, the Winifred, and sailed off in the hope of watching the sun
set over a sea of leaping dolphins. Then the clouds came. The
captain took us into a sheltered cove and assured us that we could
still see dolphins in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll come out as long as the water's calm,'' he said, ``and
we're sheltered here from the wind in every direction except the
northwest.'' Then the wind began blowing from the northwest. No
dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The next evening we tried a different dolphin-watching
operation, a catamaran called Imagine. It was even rainier than the
previous evening. We clutched wine glasses and stared glumly into
the murky twilight waters. Suddenly, 20 yards off starboard, there
was a fin; then 10 yards away, another one. Then a whole shining
dolphin body crested, just feet away.
</P>
<P>
   We were surrounded by at least 20 dolphins, cresting and
flipping their bottle noses, their sinuous bodies nimbly keeping
pace with the racing pontoons of the catamaran. They were playing
with us! We cheered and waved into the wet wind, and managed to
convince ourselves that they were smiling back at us. And for a
moment we convinced ourselves that the rain didn't matter, either.
</P>

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Josh Workman admits there have been times when he
would really like to go ``off the record.''
</P>
<P>
   The Banner Elk, N.C., college student is a delegate, after all,
at one of the biggest political parties of the year _ four days of
parties, dancing, night-owl concerts and schmoozing otherwise known
as the 2000 Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But Workman, at 19, is believed to be the youngest of the 2,066
delegates gathered here this week, a status that has earned him the
distinction of having an MTV camera crew follow him around day and
night for the entire convention.
</P>
<P>
   As Workman talked recently, he fiddled with a microphone clipped
to his shirt that is recording his every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I went into my room and undid it,'' he said, referring
to the microphone. ``I needed to take a break.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone in his youthful status _ Joy Barganier, two
months older than Workman and a native of Fort Deposit, Ala., is
thought to be the next youngest delegate. The two represent an
emphasis by the GOP to put a youthful face on their party, and this
week's slate of convention festivities represent that. Nightly
parties that last into morning feature hip musical acts, and MTV is
just one of dozens of entertainment-related media outlets covering
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   For Workman, the MTV attention means special access to a host of
private parties and events that would normally cost hundreds of
dollars a ticket. He is scheduled to meet with George W. Bush when
he arrives at the convention later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Workman is now a rising senior at Lees-McRae College in Banner
Elk majoring in criminal justice and psychology. Politics is more
of a passion than a career goal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome and cool. I like to be here to show that young
conservatives exist instead of sending to Philadelphia a bunch of
50-year-old men and a bunch of millionaires who donate to the Bush
campaign,'' Workman said. ``Why not send a young guy?''
</P>
<P>
   Workman said he campaigned door-to-door for his delegate
selection, winning all but six votes of those cast in his
northwestern North Carolina district. His previous political
experience included volunteering on Lauch Faircloth's 1998 Senate
campaign and working for the N.C. College Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Barganier is just as politically enthused as Workman, yet she's
glad that MTV is not chronicling her week. The two are about as
different as two teen-agers might be. Workman has spiked hair, an
earring and a tattoo of a maple leaf on his shoulder; Barganier is
reserved, proper and calls everyone ``Sir'' or ``Ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with people my age is the MTV generation, the
radical, liberal propaganda that's put into their heads. Kids don't
know what's really going on, they just listen to what MTV tells
them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Workman, Barganier, a rising sophomore at Auburn studying
English, is a convention veteran. She has attended three as a guest
of her mother, Susan, who has been a delegate to three conventions.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1980 at the GOP convention in Detroit, Susan was pregnant
with Joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really neat that she can sit on the floor with me,'' said
Mrs. Barganier.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Barganier said the view is different as a participant than a
spectator. Her biggest thrill has been rubbing elbows with the
state's two U.S. senators, Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barganier and Workman said they often have to explain their
Republican affiliations to their college pals, many of whom are
apolitical. If their friends could get a taste of convention life,
they would be similarly hooked, the pair said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young people are not Republicans simply because their
parents are. I bet kids would agree with most of the party stuff if
they took the time to find out about it,'' Barganier said.

COMPANIES AID LAWMAKERS WHO WILL OVERSEE THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN M. BRODER and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Reps. Michael Oxley and Billy Tauzin have brought
their cash-fueled competition for the chairmanship of the House
Commerce Committee to the Republican convention. And corporations
affected by the committee are betting on both men.
</P>
<P>
   At parties on Monday night and Tuesday financed by some of the
companies the committee regulates, Oxley of Ohio and Tauzin of
Louisiana will entertain lawmakers and lobbyists with rock 'n' roll
and zydeco music and stuff them with finger food and po' boys.
</P>
<P>
   Oxley, who leads the Subcommittee on Finance and Hazardous
Materials of the Commerce Committee, and Tauzin, who presides over
the telecommunications subcommittee, are in a race to see who can
raise the most money this year. Since the beginning of last year,
they have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars _ and given much
of it away to win the allegiance of Republican House members. The
Commerce Committee sits astride much of American industry, and its
chairman is one of the most powerful figures on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The confluence of corporate money, political influence and
congressional power is one of the hidden motifs of this and all
modern political conventions. While the congressional leaders in
Washington are not being showcased during television prime time in
Philadelphia, their Beltway battles and intrigues have followed
them here.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxley-Tauzin contest provides the most striking example of
the phenomenon here this week, but other lawmakers are also using
the occasion to solicit special interest money, often from
industries they oversee. Scott Harshbarger, president of Common
Cause, a group that monitors campaign spending, said, ``People are
giving who have clear business before these committees.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Oxley and Tauzin have amassed enormous war chests for their
re-election campaigns this fall, and nearly all of the money comes
from corporate political action committees and individuals with
interests before the Commerce Committee, according to an analysis
provided by the Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin has already raised $541,845 for his re-election bid, and
his leadership political action committee, the Bayou Leadership
PAC, has raised $49,234 since January 1999, Federal Election
Commission data shows. Tauzin has given away more than $43,000 of
his PAC's money to the election campaigns of his fellow House
members. Oxley does not have a leadership PAC.
</P>
<P>
   The receptions here span the spectrum of corporate interests.
Time Warner, Walt Disney, Universal Studios and Viacom are giving a
party for Rep. Mark Foley of Florida, chairman of the House
Entertainment Industry Task Force. It is one of the hottest tickets
this week, to be held on Wednesday at 10 p.m. at the Shampoo Night
Club.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T bought martinis and cigars and Guinness provided the stout
for Rep. David Dreier of California, chairman of the House Rules
Committee at the Continental, a 50s-style diner jammed with so many
cigar-smoking lobbyists that 100 people who wanted to could not get
in. Limousines and town cars were double-parked outside on Market
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxley and Tauzin receptions, expected to cost as much as
$500,000 each, are sponsored by companies with business before the
Commerce Committee. Oxley's party, on the old soundstage of
``American Bandstand'' and featuring entertainment by Frankie
Avalon, Chubby Checker and others, was sponsored on Monday night by
18 investment houses, insurance companies, accounting firms and
chemical industry associations.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin's Mardi Gras event, to be held on Tuesday night, is
underwritten by ``a bunch of telecommunications and energy
companies,'' an aide to Tauzin said on Monday. The aide would not
name them.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, had a
sock hop for himself and 1,500 ``friends.'' Lott and his wife,
Tricia, who wore a letter sweater and a poodle skirt, arrived in a
1959 Chevrolet convertible. Among the underwriters were AT&AMP;T,
International Paper, Union Pacific and Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrylser put on a dual-purpose party, displaying its
latest models and paying tribute to Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma,
chairman of the House Republican Conference. Watts joined The
Temptations on the stage of the downtown Convention Center for a
rendition of ``My Girl.''

2 AFRICAN NATIONS SAID TO BREAK U.N. DIAMOND EMBARGO 
</HEADLINE>
   By BLAINE HARDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ American and British officials accused the
presidents of Liberia and Burkina Faso Monday of taking a personal
role in trading arms for diamonds in violation of a U.N. embargo.
The Americans and British also said the two presidents had helped
Sierra Leone rebels to continue fighting a brutal civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The American ambassador to the United Nations, Richard
Holbrooke, compared President Charles Taylor of Liberia to
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, who has been indicted
for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taylor is Milosevic in Africa with diamonds,'' Holbrooke said
in an interview, contending that outsiders have been ``much too
passive'' in naming African leaders who foment war for personal
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taylor is fueling the conflict in Sierra Leone for his own
benefit,'' Holbrooke said. ``He is threatening to destabilize west
Africa, and there is deep division in the region about how to deal
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   A British diplomat said Monday at a U.N. hearing on the role of
diamonds in the Sierra Leone war that that Taylor had personally
taken command of rebel forces fighting there against U.N.
peacekeepers and that he has in recent weeks sent arms to the
rebels and taken smuggled diamonds in payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, President Taylor has been directing strategy
meetings of the rebels,'' said the diplomat, Stephen Pattison.
</P>
<P>
   Pattison also made unusually specific allegations against
President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso, saying that in return
for diamonds Compaore has sent mercenaries from Burkina Faso to
fight with rebels in Sierra Leone against U.N. peacekeepers.
Compaore has repeatedly allowed airports in Burkina Faso to be used
for supplying the rebels with arms bought in Ukraine, Pattison
added.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats from Liberia and Burkina Faso denied the allegations,
demanding that hard evidence be presented.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Monie Captan of Liberia categorically denied
that Taylor had been trading arms for diamonds this year, although
he acknowledged that ``in the past'' the president had dealt with
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Captan said Taylor was working for peace in Sierra Leone. In an
interview, he accused Holbrooke of making accusations against
Taylor to advance his campaign to become secretary of state if Vice
President Al Gore wins the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a former warlord who terrorized voters into electing him
in 1998, has played a singularly influential role in the making and
the unmaking of a crisis this year in Sierra Leone. Before rebels
there seized 500 U.N. troops in May and held them hostage, Taylor
was their principal ally in letting them smuggle diamonds and buy
arms. After the troops had been detained, Taylor's intervention
secured their release. The Liberian government, Captan said Monday,
had expected to receive international credit for its role in
defusing the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But in mid-July, Thomas R. Pickering, Under Secretary of State
for Political Affairs, had a combative meeting with Taylor in
Monrovia. Pickering warned Taylor that unless his government
quickly halted its support for the Sierra Leone rebels, the United
States will invoke unilateral sanctions, including denying American
visas for Taylor and other Liberian officials and seizing their
assets in the United States, an American official said.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting in Monrovia, Taylor acted defensively, denying
the allegations and demanding to be shown proof, the American
official said.
</P>
<P>
   That proof was not supplied, but an American official said
Monday that evidence includes photographs of trucks carrying arms
and supplies to Sierra Leone and electronic surveillance that shows
Taylor meeting with commanders of the rebels, known as the
Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Monday, Pattison said Taylor recently ordered
an increase of diamond production in rebel-held areas of Sierra
Leone. ``Taylor has assured the RUF of his support and of increased
military aid, this has included supplies of arms, ammunition, fuel,
food and medicine,'' he said. ``These are regularly transported
across the Liberian border in trucks and occasionally in
helicopters.''
</P>
<P>
   After the peacekeepers were taken hostage in May, the Security
Council banned trading in Sierra Leone diamonds until a
certification regime could be set up. The diamond industry _ led by
De Beers, the world's largest trader _ has since moved to tighten
trading and toward branding diamonds to make provenance clear.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have said, however, that there is no way of
knowing if the industry can police itself. In March, a scathing
U.N. report condemned the central diamond clearing house in Antwerp
for ``extremely lax controls'' in handling banned diamonds sold by
rebels in Angola.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said that the Clinton administration now supports the
creation of a global certificate of origin system. It is not yet
clear how such a system would work. The U.N. embargo on diamonds
from Sierra Leone does not yet ban sales of diamonds exported from
Liberia. Industry experts say most of Liberia's diamond exports
originate in Sierra Leone. An American official said that Liberia
itself has the capacity to mine about $10 million of diamonds a
year, but that last year it exported about $300 million worth of
the stones.
</P>
<P>
   Pattison said that Burkina Faso has become a major player in the
export of smuggled stones from Sierra Leone. He said the best
recent estimate is that, in return for arms and other supplies,
about 60 percent of rebel-mined diamonds are moving from Liberia
and about 40 percent from Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said the Clinton administration hopes to persuade
American consumers to demand a certificate of origin that will
prove they are not taking home ``blood diamonds'' from Africa. ``I
hope that people buying a beautiful stone will start asking
questions and be sure not to buy unless they see a certificate of
origin,'' said Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   So far, American diamond consumers have shown little interest in
the provenance of the stones they buy, according to industry
experts and shop owners. Sales of diamond jewelry jumped 11 percent
last year, and De Beers had record worldwide sales of more than $5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Burkina Faso was also singled out in March for
violating a 1998 U.N. embargo to stop Angola rebels from using
diamonds to pay for their war. The U.N. report said Compaore sent
fuel to the rebels and received ``substantial contributions'' for
his political campaigns. A representative of Compaore's government
dismissed the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating that some African countries will respond to his
accusations as ``neo-colonialism,'' Holbrooke emphasized that he
was not making a ``universal condemnation'' of African leadership,
but only of some ``bad leaders.'' ``We should have been saying
these things a year ago,'' he said. ``We need to move past
perceptions based on race. This is not about race. This is very
difficult for the Africans because it means there has to be a
candid admission that some of the African leadership has failed its
people.''

GERMAN FAULTS SILENCE ABOUT ATTACKS ON IMMIGRANTS
</HEADLINE>
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ A renewed wave of anti-immigrant violence in Germany
has prompted Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer to suggest that a
silent majority may be abetting the crimes by not speaking out
against them.
</P>
<P>
   His statement, with its thinly veiled allusion to past German
passivity before the rise of rightist violence, reflected growing
concern in the government over an abrupt increase in such attacks.
Germany has more than 7 million foreigners but remains uneasy with
the idea that it is a ``land of immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   A bombing in Dusseldorf on Thursday that wounded nine
immigrants, six of them Jews, was followed by a number of attacks
over the weekend. The worst occurred in the eastern town of
Eisenach, where two African asylum-seekers were kicked, spat upon
and pursued by a group of neo-Nazi skinheads shouting ``Sieg
Heil!''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities on Saturday raided the home of a policeman in
Potsdam, near Berlin, after hate calls were traced to his number.
Officials found firearms, ammunition and anti-immigrant propaganda
similar to the cache recently discovered in the dismantling of a
rightist youth movement south of Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that hatred of foreigners probably lies behind the
Dusseldorf attack should rouse us all,'' Fischer, a member of the
Green Party, said in a statement on Saturday. ``We have reached a
point where the majority of the population that has been silent up
to now can no longer remain silent.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Germany appears to face a quandary over its identity.
With great fanfare, the government on Monday handed over the first
of a planned 20,000 ``green cards,'' papers allowing skilled
foreigners to come here and work in computer jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time since Turkish ``guest workers'' were
admitted in the 1960s that Germany has formally invited immigrants
in this way, a tacit admission that it requires outside talent to
remain competitive in a global economy.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the door to legal immigration is pried open a
fraction, animosity toward foreigners seems to be rising. Heinz
Fromm, the president of the Office for the Protection of the
Constitution, a domestic intelligence service, expressed outrage
similar to Fischer's in a newspaper interview published on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being injured and killed,'' he was quoted as
saying. ``These groups keep blacklists, including the names of
well-known actors who are identified as Jews. Yet the population
does not seem to take all this too seriously. Society must
intervene or this development will damage the whole country.''
</P>
<P>
   The response Monday from the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine
was furious. It published an editorial saying, ``Placing the entire
German population under suspicion is hardly the way to promote
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Germans with no sympathy for rightist violence are troubled
by the large number of foreigners, particularly Turks, in the
country and by suggestions that Germany must embrace
multiculturalism. As a result, politicians have been generally
hesitant to broach the questions raised by Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of the Berlin Wall a decade ago, rightist
violence has become a fact of German life. It is rooted principally
in the east, where, since the collapse of the Communist state
there, youth unemployment has remained high, alienation widespread
and broad exposure to foreigners a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a virtually unbroken nationalist tradition in
the east of the country for decades,'' said Klaus Klott, a teacher
who worked for several years in the eastern town of Jena.
``Exposure to a multicultural society is something entirely new,
and in many instances it is violently resented.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems clear from the recent attacks is that even a decade
of German unity has not diminished this rightist and xenophobic
sentiment. In the last decade, more than 100 people have been
killed in Germany in xenophobic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Fromm suggested that the spread of Internet sites full of racist
invective and the passivity of most Germans had in fact allowed the
anti-immigrant groups to spread their message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perpetrators obviously think they will not face much
resistance from the community,'' he said. ``They even have the
feeling they are acting on behalf of the majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials close to Fischer suggested that the minister was
troubled by what he views as the post-Nazi German taboo surrounding
nationalist extremism and anti-Semitism. ``What is needed is more
open debate,'' one official said. ``An unhealthy silence has
descended.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent killing of a child by a pit bull prompted a far more
vigorous national debate over dogs than anything that emerged from
the killing on June 11 of an African immigrant, Alberto Adriano, by
a group of neo-Nazi thugs in Dessau.
</P>
<P>
   This point was made on Sunday in an unusually emotional
television debate that touched on the subject, in which Annette
Kahane, the director of a foundation that seeks to combat racist
violence, noted that no government minister appeared in Dessau
after Adriano's death or issued a statement on his behalf.

THE BEST OF THE LATEST GUIDEBOOKS TO SYDNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, August 6)  
 By DEBBIE SEAMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spare me the spread of the bronzed, muscle-bound lifeguard and
show me something I may not know about before visiting Sydney, such
as the saltwater sea pools, built barely out of reach of the
breakers, at many of the city's ocean beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Guides to the host city of the 2000 Olympic Games are plentiful
at the moment, but the best go beyond being just visually
resplendent. Photos and graphics in these provide context, and are
illustrative and informative rather than merely decorative. I can
pardon the occasional close-up shot of a koala nibbling gum leaves,
for example, but it is a delight to see giraffes or elephants
against the backdrop of Sydney's skyline and harbor afforded by the
Taronga Zoo. I'm also more tempted to visit a museum by a visual
preview of a few of the works in its collection rather than a photo
of its facade.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney guides I prefer also tell visitors intriguing things
they might miss, like what stages the Sydney Harbour Bridge was
built in and in what time spans, or tips about the different styles
of Aboriginal art. De rigueur, too, are detailed accounts of
excursions to nearby areas, like the majestic Blue Mountains about
65 miles to the west and the breathtaking juxtaposition of bush and
waterways in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park about 19 miles to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   I'll pass altogether on the Sydney guides whose pages are
enlivened by little more than bold-face type or sporadic clumps of
color pictures.
</P>
<P>
   It's well worth spending the extra $5 to $10 for a thorough and
thoughtfully produced book.
</P>
<P>
   THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC TRAVELER SYDNEY, by Evan McHugh. 271
pages. 1999. (National Geographic Society, $22.95.)
</P>
<P>
   As one would expect from the publisher, this handsome travel
guide is impeccably appointed with bold and relevant color art.
Even a relatively small photo in the Eastern Suburbs section places
picnickers not only in Nielsen Park but also under the canopy of an
outsize Moreton Bay fig tree, with the gables of Greycliffe House,
an 1852 residence that now houses the National Parks and Wildlife
Service office, visible in the background. Now, that's context! It
also has the most comprehensive section on the Olympic site as well
as an Olympic Survival Guide. (Don't forget the bottled water and
the aspirin!)
</P>
<P>
   Yet what really makes this one of the top two Sydney city books
is that Evan McHugh, a native Sydneysider, goes the extra mile to
provide the unexpected: a comprehensive section on Aboriginal art;
a section on where to view noteworthy artists' renditions of Sydney
Harbour; a short history of the area's shipwrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the back there are miniportraits and profiles of Sydney's
principal wildlife _ most of the species charming, as the venomous
funnel web spider is noteworthy in its absence here. ( McHugh deals
with these and such other nasty creatures as sharks right up front
under the heading A Few Precautions.) My only disappointment is
that the hotel and restaurant listings, while succinct and
informative, could use a bit of the dazzling photographs that are
so prominent elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   DORLING KINDERSLEY TRAVEL GUIDES SYDNEY. 264 pages. 2000.
(Dorling Kindersley, $19.95.)
</P>
<P>
   I was happy to see a few interiors pictured among the
restaurants and hotels in this top-tier Sydney guide, then amazed
to see that the book's contributors were considerate enough to show
what your plate is liable to look like if you order, say,
char-grilled kangaroo fillets, Chinese Yum Cha dumplings,
freshwater crayfish or the classic Australian pavlova dessert of
meringue, cream and fruit. Likewise with beverages: It explains
with pictures as well as words the difference between a middy of
beer (10 fluid ounces) and the more daunting 15-fluid-ounce
schooner, among other gustatory guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   It's all in the details here. The segment on beaches _ and
Sydney warrants one of these _ shows the varieties of waves and the
level of swimming skills it takes to negotiate them. The
topographic map of Paddington indicates exactly where to glimpse
the terrace and gingerbread houses the neighborhood is famous for.
Close-up photographs and graphics allow readers to get accustomed
to the different currency before they arrive; sample a float from
the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras; look at size charts and see that an
Australian women's size 14 is equivalent to an American 12; learn
how to operate a pay phone, and how to spot an Australian
policeman. The menacing funnel web spider even makes a relatively
innocent appearance _ among the displays at the Australian Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the Olympic Games, however, is relatively
scant, and I was sorry not to see Sydney's most spectacular harbor
walk, the Manly Scenic Walkway, mapped out the way it is in the
National Geographic guide. (The authors chose to focus on a less
worthy ramble around the seaside resort town of Manly itself.)
Fortunately, my other favorite, the Bondi Beach to Clovelly
cliffside walk, has two pages devoted to it.
</P>
<P>
   SYDNEY IN A WEEK, by Wendy Moore. 176 pages. 1997. (New Holland
Publishers, $24.95.)
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Moore's ``Ultimate Guide to Sydney,'' as the subtitle
proclaims, does not quite have everything you'll need. The author's
written sketches, while useful, tend to be thumbnail, and diners
are encouraged to look elsewhere if they want more than minimal
information about restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   That said, this is one of my favorite books on Sydney, and there
is a practical reason behind its somewhat impractical 8}-by-11-inch
size.
</P>
<P>
   Its seven sections on sightseeing, organized by day, are
illustrated with spectacular, full-blown color photographs. A
visitor might look at the aerial photo of the peninsula that
culminates in South Head at the entrance to Sydney Harbour, for
example _ with breakers on one side and crystalline coves on the
other _ and decide to spend the last day checking out this
landscape in the Eastern Suburbs rather than the more commercial,
less aesthetically pleasing Darling Harbour.
</P>
<P>
   I was particularly excited about the aerial vistas of different
districts of Sydney, most covering two-page spreads, in which
neighborhoods and landmarks are prominently labeled. My husband,
who is Australian, laughs at me, but these orient me much better
than conventional maps. They also show something of the character
of neighborhoods and how they fit into the grand scheme of Sydney.
In addition, there are plenty of traditional maps for people like
my husband, and a variety of special itineraries for the
adventurous, including harborside walks.
</P>
<P>
   LONELY PLANET SYDNEY (CONDENSED). 128 pages. 2000. (Lonely
Planet Publications, $9.95.)
</P>
<P>
   The best of the so-called pocket guides, although its nearly
eight-inch height makes it better suited to a purse, this slim book
should not be confused with the publisher's adequate but
unarresting full-length version, or judged by its homely front and
back covers. The covers, in fact, fold out and harbor a variety of
useful maps.
</P>
<P>
   There's too much impractical, sometimes careless artwork here _
one caption claims that beach views are a draw at a certain
restaurant, but there's nary a shore in sight in the photo, which
focuses on a wine bottle and glass. However, there is a lot to like
about this book, including an eight-page insert about the Olympic
Games. For hungry Game-goers who can't find places at the more
popular restaurants, this section offers a list of suburban streets
where the many and varied restaurants will probably have tables.
The contributors also note the Olympics events, such as the
Marathon, which can be seen free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   There is a page on Quirky Sydney here, which is good for an
entertaining read even if you don't want to visit a wig and
clothing shop for drag queens, and parents will appreciate the
facing page, which covers Sydney for Children, complete with the
name and number of an agency for reliable baby sitters and nannies.
Restaurants are listed by neighborhood. I was initially puzzled not
to be able to locate two of my favorite eating establishments _
Bathers Pavilion and Forty One _ then relieved to see them on a
separate restaurant page entitled Outstanding Views, only with no
sign of their vistas.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the basic facts for travelers are condensed in the back
of the guide, even access numbers for major servers and a list of
Internet cafes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPING SECRETS: SYDNEY EDITION, by Michelle Matthews. 130
pages. 1999. (Shopping Secrets, $14.95.)
</P>
<P>
   Like any international city, Sydney has a wealth of retail
outlets, but it never struck me as an intriguing shopping town
until I saw this engaging guide. Grouping stores by neighborhood,
Matthews steers buyers beyond the Benettons and other international
chains so they can make a beeline for the most unusual wares Sydney
has to offer. Complementing Matthews' snappy writing style are
crisp, almost tactile photos by Rupert Lorhaldar.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the products on offer here are indigenous to Australia.
There is an espresso bar where the handmade furniture you sit on is
for sale, and a store specializing in anything made from Australian
cotton, for example. Yet the book also tells you where to find the
best French imports, Soviet memorabilia and Swedish designs. Among
the 113 rather esoteric businesses to choose from are an upscale
sex shop; a boutique of unusual buttons; a lounge where you can go
with friends and a bottle of wine to make your own pottery; a
bottled-water purveyor with 100 varieties; and a consignment shop
for recycled designer clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Information on each store includes address, telephone and fax
numbers and hours, but does not include prices. The latter are apt
to change; besides, as in a store window, a lack of price tag can
draw you into the store to ask. For richer or, most likely, for
poorer, this fashionably slim book should accompany the acquisitive
to Sydney. It is available in the United States only at
www.amazon.com or at its own Web site, www.shoppingsecrets.com, but
it is sold in bookstores in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY, by Bill Bryson. 307 pages. 2000.
(Broadway Books, $25.)
</P>
<P>
   The flight to Sydney is long _ about 14 hours nonstop just from
Los Angeles _ but the travel writer and humorist Bill Bryson's
vastly entertaining takes on Australia should make it elapse
swiftly. The only risk is that laughing aloud may intrigue
neighboring passengers, possibly engaging them in unwanted
conversation, or simply make them irked that they're not having
fun, too.
</P>
<P>
   If there is one book with which to get oriented before departure
or en route to Australia, this is it. Bryson celebrates the quirks
_ in history, in culture, in flora and fauna _ that together give
Australia its eccentric character. He pokes gentle fun at Lachlan
Macquarie, governor of the colony in the early 19th century, after
whom lakes, streets, you-name-it are named. He mines the humor
inherent in Australia's abundance of extravagantly toxic creatures
such as the 10 most deadly poisonous snakes on the planet, box
jellyfish and the blue-ringed octopus. He takes us into the store
that sells pet supplies and pornography in a small country town.
</P>
<P>
   Bryson's droll point of view even renders past events palatable
for nonhistory buffs: I would never known that the explorer
Jean-Francois de la Perouse just missed claiming Australia for
France, thus, notes Bryson, saving the country from 200 years of
English cooking.

 &HT;    With minutes to spare, Braves add Orioles' Surhofff
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Not to be caught standing still in a tornado of trades
late Monday afternoon, the Braves sealed their second deal of the
month at 3:45 p.m. With 15 minutes to spare before the trading
deadline, Braves general manager John Schuerholz acquired Orioles
left fielder B.J. Surhoff.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff becomes the second recent addition Schuerholz has made
via trade, along with Andy Ashby, to a roster he's building for
October.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves also acquired pitcher Gabe Molina, a 25-year-old
right-handed reliever who's headed to Class AAA Richmond, while
giving up right-hander Luis Rivera, catcher Fernando Lunar and
outfielder Trenidad Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for their toughest road trip of the year that
includes stops in division-leading Arizona and St. Louis, the
Braves got an added boost to go along with the best record in
baseball and the expected return to health of Brian Jordan, Walt
Weiss and Andres Galarraga. Their one glaring weakness, produced by
Reggie Sanders and his .193 batting average in left field, has been
addressed.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Surhoff will join the Braves today in Phoenix,
with his .292 batting average, 13 home runs, 57 RBI and his
major-league leading consecutive games played streak at 427.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a deal we've been talking to the Orioles about for quite
some time,'' Schuerholz said. ``We felt like it improves the
offense of our club, especially in the outfield, which was one of
the important things for us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Rivera and Jason Marquis have been sought after by other
clubs. The Braves might have been quicker to deal Marquis than
Rivera at the start of the season, but that changed with Marquis'
strong showing this past month.
</P>
<P>
   Working against Rivera is his injury problems. The 22-year-old
has an impressive repertoire, including a mid-to-upper 90s
fastball, but he has yet to make it through a full season without
injury. He started this season in the majors but missed more than
two months with shoulder stiffness. He missed much of his season in
Class A last year with blister problems.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera is healthy again and has been pitching in AAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fine young prospect,'' Schuerholz said. ``We just felt
with our team structured the way we are and with the needs we have
and as close as we are to winning another division title and league
championship hopefully, B.J. Surhoff really adds to our chances of
doing that. He really strengthens us. You have to give up some
value, and we've demonstrated our willingness to do that all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff, who has another year left on his contract, had mixed
emotions about the trade largely for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I don't want to play in Atlanta,'' Surhoff said.
``I'm going to a great situation and I know it's going to work out,
but I enjoy playing here.''

 &HT;    FPL history marked by growth, some criticism
 &HT;    By Jeff Ostrowski
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Florida Power &AMP; Light was born 75 years
ago, and grew up with the state that bought its electricity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, utility conglomerate American Power &AMP; Light launched
FPL to provide transmission lines that would link the state's few
electric utilities.
</P>
<P>
   FPL set up transmission lines hooking up 58 communities from
Miami to Stuart on the East Coast and from Arcadia to Punta Gorda
on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   FPL, which on Monday announced a deal that would make it the
nation's largest utility, embarked on a $50 million expansion in
the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1926, FPL had 76,000 customers and generated 70 megawatts of
power. Those numbers have grown to 3.8 million customer accounts in
Florida and generating capacity of 16,000 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 forced Americann
Miami, but its parent, FPL Group, gradually moved its headquarters
to Juno Beach in the 1980s and '90s to be more centrally located to
the rest of the state, FPL spokesman Bill Swank said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, its first nuclear plant, at Turkey Point in southern
Dade County, began producing power. FPL's nuclear plant on
Hutchinson Island in St. Lucie County opened in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   FPL's history includes two waves of diversification followed by
divestment.
</P>
<P>
   In its early days, FPL accumulated a limestone quarry,
streetcars, phone companies and water utilities, which it sold in
the 1940s and 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   FPL began to diversify again in the 1980s, buying real estate
firm W. Flagler Investment in 1981. The company formed FPL Group in
1984 as a holding company.
</P>
<P>
   FPL Group later bought Telesat Cablevision, insurance company
Colonial Penn Group and Turner Foods citrus groves.
</P>
<P>
   Diversification didn't prove profitable, and in 1990 the firm
wrote off about $750 million. FPL sold off the non-utility
divisions in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   FPL's latest expansion has focused on producing power. In 1997,
FPL Group created FPL Energy, which produces power outside of
Florida and sells it to other utilities.
</P>
<P>
   FPL Energy teamed up with Belgium-based Tractebel in 1998 to buy
gas-fired plants in Boston and Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   FPL also built wind-power facilities in Iowa, Wisconsin and
Texas and bought 35 generating plants from Central Maine Power for
$846 million.
</P>
<P>
   This year, FPL launched FPL FiberNet, a subsidiary that leases
capacity on the company's fiber-optic communications network.
</P>
<P>
   FPL Chairman and Chief Executive James Broadhead has overseen
the expansion.
</P>
<P>
   When Broadhead took over in 1989, FPL was the first company
outside Japan to win that country's prestigious Deming Prize for
``quality control management.'' The award previously honored
Japanese companies such as Toyota and Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the award, Broadhead saw FPL as bloated and slow. He
launched a massive restructuring that eliminated thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He now sees the utility as a leader in reducing pollution from
power plants, but FPL has drawn complaints from environmentalists.
In 1995, the St. Lucie nuclear plant was fined by the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission for a series of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists also criticized FPL for its attempts to power
a plant near Tampa Bay by burning Orimulsion, a cheap, tarlike fuel
from Venezuela. Then-Gov. Lawton Chiles and the Cabinet in 1998
rejected FPL's request to burn Orimulsion, and the company dropped
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Public Interest Research Group has criticized some
FPL plants, including its Riviera Beach operation, for polluting
heavily.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
called Florida the fourth-worst state for power plant pollution.
But while the report ranked four plants owned by St.
Petersburg-based Florida Power, Gulf Power and Tampa Electric among
the nation's 25 dirtiest, no FPL plant made the list.
</P>
<P>
   FPL is converting its Sanford and Fort Myers plants to
cleaner-burning natural gas, and it's installing equipment to lower
emissions at its Riviera Beach plant.

 &HT;    FPL employees, community leaders pleased over merger
 &HT;    By Deborah Circelli, Amy Martinez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUNO BEACH, Fla. _ FPL employees got a different sort of wake-up
call Monday morning when they walked through the lobby of their
Juno Beach headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Banners and posters telling them to check their e-mail to learn
about a deal between ``America's premier power companies'' tipped
them off that soon they could be working for a new company.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 a.m., employees scattered throughout the building to watch
large TV monitors, on which Florida Power &AMP; Light President Paul
Evanson assured them that FPL Group's $13.9 billion deal for
Entergy Corp. of New Orleans would not lead to massive layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Evanson said, it would provide new opportunities
for job growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be the best power company out there,''
he told employees. ``It's a huge power company with incredible
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Evanson, who will remain president of FPL's Florida Power &AMP;
Light subsidiary _ the company that provides millions of Floridians
with electric power _ and oversee the combined companies' regulated
utilities, spoke in a small room at the Juno Beach offices to about
100 employees. The broadcast was aired over the company's internal
news network to offices throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Evanson said some administrative jobs might be eliminated at the
corporate level, but how many has not been determined. FPL Group
and its subsidiaries have about 11,350 employees, including 3,250
in Palm Beach, Indian River, Martin and St. Lucie counties, and a
total of about 8,000 in South Florida. Wayne Ondler, a manager in
FPL's environmental services department, said some employees
obviously are worried, but many think the news is positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not a surprise because we knew the company was
always engaged in looking at opportunities to increase shareholder
value,'' said Ondler, who has been with FPL for almost 17 years.
``I think more people view it as an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Cook, an FPL employee for 18 years and systems manager,
also said employees accepted the news positively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years we've been through three restructurings and
employee reductions. Once you've been through that two or three
times, nothing fazes you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mood at the St. Lucie nuclear power plant on Hutchinson
Island was similar. With 630 employees, the twin-reactor plant is
one of St. Lucie County's biggest employers and accounts for 16
percent of its tax base.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hall, a 20-year machinist who lives in Vero Beach, said he
learned of the deal in a two-page fax. He said employees at the
plant took the news in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age of deregulation, you can't get too
concerned. Job security is not what it once was,'' he said. ``But
at this point, it looks like everything is going to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Thompson, who oversees 11 local International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers unions representing 3,400 Florida Power &AMP;
Light employees, said he was surprised to learn of the deal Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has been negotiating with FPL for a new union contract
after the current one expires Oct. 31. Weekly meetings resume
today. He said he's encouraged that Entergy employees are
represented by the same union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we don't perceive it as negative, but we can't say
what the future will bring,'' Thompson said. ``As far as we're
concerned, we are just going to press forward with the regular
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic development officials in Palm Beach County and the
Treasure Coast so far embrace the deal. It lends the area prestige
as home to the country's largest electric utility, which would help
recruit other businesses, said Larry Pelton, president of the
Business Development Board of Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   Large corporations like to know that other large companies are
nearby when choosing sites for their headquarters, Pelton said, and
knowing that companies the size of FPL and Entergy are based here
is not insignificant.

   ``This demonstrates that this is a good place to do business,''
Pelton said. ``We work with a lot of headquarters and back-office
operations of large corporations. And in their evaluations of an
area, they want to know that other companies of their magnitude are
in the area ... so that they feel comfortable.'' The merger would
have ripple effects in Martin County, where many FPL headquarters
employees live, said Ted Astolfi, executive director of the
Business Development Board in Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can retain the jobs in Juno Beach, that's a major
success for us,'' Astolfi said. ``This has the potential of
providing additional jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran St. Lucie County Commissioner Cliff Barnes was more
subdued: ``It's exciting, but not overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it will have some spin off for our economy,'' he
said.

COMMENTARY: THE EGYPT GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Memo From: President Clinton
</P>
<P>
   To: President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
</P>
<P>
   Dear Hosni: I'm writing you this letter by hand on White House
stationery because it is a personal note from a friend. Hosni, I
have to tell you how disappointed I and all my foreign policy aides
were with your behavior during the Camp David summit. I am going to
be frank with you, you're skating on thin ice here. The number of
people on my foreign policy team, or in Congress, who have a good
word to say about you or Egypt today could be counted on one hand _
maybe on no hands. More and more people are asking me: What exactly
are we getting out of our relationship with Egypt _ not to mention
$30 billion in aid to Egypt since 1978?
</P>
<P>
   Let's review what's happened here. Before the summit I called
you and asked for your support and you said you would try to be
helpful. Then, in the middle of Camp David, while I was at the G-8
summit in Okinawa, I called you, King Abdullah of Jordan, Crown
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and President Ben Ali of Tunisia,
and I asked for your help. I said the summit was totally stuck and
the big problem was Jerusalem. I told you that I didn't expect you
to force Arafat to compromise on Jerusalem. I know how important
that is for the Muslim world. I needed your help to persuade Arafat
to defer the Jerusalem issue _ which we obviously weren't going to
solve _ and to try instead to reach agreement on all the other
issues, which was possible.
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah of Jordan tried to help. You, by contrast, flew to
Saudi Arabia and joined with the Saudis in urging the Palestinians
not to make any compromises on Jerusalem. Well, thanks a lot. I
wasn't asking you to twist Arafat's arm on Jerusalem; I was asking
you to cover his back, while he deferred this issue. But instead of
making that decision easier for Arafat, you made it harder.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the only reason we're losing patience with you.
Where do I start? You just arrested Saad Eddin Ibrahim, an American
University of Cairo democracy specialist who has a U.S. passport
and whose crime seems to be that he was working for democratic
elections in Egypt. I say ``seems'' since you've been holding him
without charges while your press smears his name. (Your press seems
to be free only to spew hate at Israel or spin conspiracy theories
about the United States.) In 19 years as president of Egypt you've
never visited Israel, save for Yitzhak Rabin's funeral. And you
were just re-elected in a one-man election by 94 percent of the
vote. Not as good as Hafez Assad used to get, but close.
</P>
<P>
   I have started to realize, Hosni, that Israel is to Egypt what
oil is to Saudi Arabia _ a hugely distorting factor. Ever since
Camp David, we in the United States have judged Egypt on only one
yardstick _ how nice you were to Israel. And as long as you were
not totally hostile, we made excuses for you and turned a blind eye
to your regime's corruption and lack of democracy. In doing that,
we've done you no favors.
</P>
<P>
   Several times you've said to me that Ehud Barak may be afraid
for his life, and that is why he hasn't been more forthcoming. The
fact is, he showed remarkable courage at Camp David, and it may
cost him his job. You should only be so courageous. You're always
telling us that the Egyptian street won't let you do this or that,
or that if anything happens to you we will have to deal with the
Islamic fundamentalists. Well, have you ever tried to lead your
street? And if you are so intimidated by the fundamentalists that
they shape all your actions, what good are you? Tell me something
Hosni, when was the last time you did something really hard for us
or for the peace process? When was the last time you risked
anything?
</P>
<P>
   Hosni, Egypt is a great country, with a great people. You led
the way with peace with Israel. You were a big help in the gulf
war. It's because we respect the role you and Egypt could play that
we are so disappointed when you don't. Too often, you act as though
we owe you something because you made peace with Israel. Well,
guess what? As they say in Arkansas, we don't owe you diddly. The
Cold War is over. We don't need to buy you away from the Soviets
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is you owe us, and your own people, some real
leadership on regional peace and domestic democracy. You've been
sitting around too long living off your past and Sadat's legacy.
It's time to get moving again, Hosni. One sphinx in Egypt is
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Best regards, Bill.

GOP LEADERS BACK BUSH'S MESSAGE OF MODERATION, DIVERSITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Republican congressional leaders who are used to
calling the shots in Washington are taking a back seat during the
GOP convention to George W. Bush and his message of moderation and
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders are content with their convention roles and are
hoping any momentum from Bush's campaign will help fend off a dozen
or so strong Democratic challenges around the country that could
shift the balance of power on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials say the strategy will work if they can keep
the Democrats from turning the November election in part into a
national referendum on the GOP-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So while the Democrats plan to showcase their congressional
leaders and their positions on a number of issues at their Los
Angeles convention in two weeks, Republicans this week are playing
down some of the more conservative positions of their leaders by
limiting their role in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason is that if the election becomes a national
referendum on the House, it's not good for us,'' said one senior
Republican aide, referring to public opinion polls showing a low
job approval for the GOP Congress. ``That's why we're trying to
keep the focus on individual candidates and Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Although House Majority Whip Tom DeLay might be out of the
public spotlight in Philadelphia, the Sugar Land, Texas, Republican
is spending his time entertaining delegates and lawmakers, and
matching up congressional candidates in need of money with
potential contributors.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's own political action committee, Americans for a
Republican Majority, is hosting a number of events this week,
ranging from a golf tournament to a late night party featuring the
band Blues Traveler.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's political action committee has been given use of five
luxuriously appointed railroad cars parked outside the convention
hall to serve as getaway chambers. When GOP lawmakers and
candidates have had enough of the convention business, they can
retire to a rail car to watch a little television, read, play some
cards or, maybe, entertain a potential contributor. All compliments
of DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mix of fun and business, says one DeLay aide, adding that
his boss is simply ``trying to take care of the members' needs.''
It's much like he does back in Washington, where his Capitol office
provides GOP lawmakers a place to hang out during late night
debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (convention) is a celebration of being Republican. It's
not about pushing one Republican agenda over another,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the convention's
permanent chairman, and House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Irving,
Texas, are following DeLay's lead by hosting a series of events and
festivities designed to both entertain and, when possible, connect
GOP candidates with sources of money needed to run competitive
campaigns in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, for instance, has enlisted the help of country
entertainers Brooks and Dunn to put on a show Wednesday night for
GOP delegates and congressional candidates when they finish their
official convention business of nominating Dick Cheney for vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Armey, DeLay nor Hastert, has been given a major role in
the convention. They're not even making public appearances beyond
Hastert's briefing remarks when the convention opens.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Republican congressional leaders have been called on to
help trumpet Bush's message. Three of them _ caucus Chairman J.C.
Watts of Oklahoma, and Reps. Henry Bonilla of San Antonio and
Jennifer Dunn of Washington _ were named convention co-chairs. They
can not only articulate Bush's agenda, but the put faces to the
diversity he says is a part of the new GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Watts is black and Bonilla Hispanic, and along with Dunn they
represent three groups of voters that Bush is targeting in his race
against Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The convention agenda, meanwhile is crammed with women and
minority speakers, as well as teachers, farmers and small business
people. Only a handful of Washington politicians will speak, and
most of them are not scheduled to appear during prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to put a new face and a new voice to the Republican
Party and challenge the Republican Party to move in a new more
inclusive direction,'' Karl Rove, Bush's chief political
consultant, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing this time is more accurately reflecting our
constituency out there,'' Bonilla said in a CBS News interview.
``What we're going to do is showcase what's happened out there and
some of the traditional faces you've seen at conventions over the
years won't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla was referring most recently to the 1996 GOP convention
in San Diego where more than half the speakers were members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's theme of diversity and moderation makes Republican
leaders more confident about congressional races this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys are positioned so when there's a Bush wave they can
surf it. If not, they'll have enough gas in their engines for them
to make it on their own,'' said Tony Rudy, one of DeLay's senior
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats want to turn this (election) into a debate about
the Republican Congress,'' Rudy said, ``because they don't have a
consistent message of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a message, he added, that ``seems to be connecting out
there ... and it's one that our (congressional) candidates can
embrace.''

 &HT;    Purchase makes Florida group nation's largest utility
 &HT;    By Jeff Ostrowski
 &HT;    and Deborah Circelli
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUNO BEACH, Fla. _ FPL Group, believing that bigger is better,
said Monday it would buy Entergy Corp. of New Orleans _ and become
the nation's largest utility.
</P>
<P>
   FPL would pay $7 billion in stock and assume $6.9 billion in
debt from Entergy. The deal would create a company with 6.3 million
customers in five states, $15 billion in annual revenue and more
than 20,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the marriage? Survival, said FPL Chairman James
L. Broadhead.
</P>
<P>
   Broadhead said the deal ensures that FPL will survive a wave of
consolidation in the energy industry.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation is spurred by the possibility that electric
companies soon will have to compete for customers. Now, power
companies in most states, including Florida, are protected and
regulated monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   Broadhead predicted that only a few dominant utilities will
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger will give us the size, the scale and the scope to
make sure we're one of those companies,'' he said Monday in a
conference call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would push FPL Group, which now has 3.8 million
customer accounts in Florida, past Ohio-based American Electric
Power and California utilities Pacific Gas and Electric and
Southern California Edison in number of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Before this combination of two Fortune 500 companies can take
effect, the deal will go to shareholders of both companies and will
be reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and by
federal utility regulators, a process FPL said will take about 15
months.
</P>
<P>
   Broadhead, 64, would be chairman of the new company, which would
be headquartered at FPL's home in Juno Beach and is so far unnamed.
Broadhead, who last year announced his plans to retire within two
years, said he'd stay at FPL for a year after the marriage is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy Chief Executive J. Wayne Leonard, 49, would be president
and chief executive officer. Leonard would move to Juno Beach from
Neless debt.
</P>
<P>
   FPL shareholders would own 57 percent of the new company, while
Entergy shareholders would own 43 percent. FPL shareholders would
receive one share of the new company for each FPL share; Entergy
shareholders would get 0.585 of a share of the new company for each
Entergy share.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company's 15-member board would be made up of eight
FPL directors and seven Entergy directors.
</P>
<P>
   Broadhead said the deal stems from the friendship he struck up
with Leonard after the two met at industry conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Wayne for some time,'' Broadhead said. ``Through
talking at industry meetings, we came to understand that we had
similar attitudes about the way our companies should be run.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations heated up in late May or early June and were
completed this past weekend, Broadhead said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, FPL was the target of a possible $11 billion
bid from Iberdrola, Spain's second-largest power company.
Negotiations collapsed, however, after Iberdrola withdrew its bid
because of a lack of support from its board.
</P>
<P>
   Although FPL failed to draw a bid from Iberdrola, the market had
speculated that other foreign companies might have been interested.
</P>
<P>
   Broadhead, in an interview with Reuters, declined to comment on
whether another party might emerge to break up the Entergy deal.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between FPL and Entergy includes a $215 million
break-up fee in case either side kills the deal. Termination fees
typically are paid when a company ends an agreement in favor of
another suitor.
</P>
<P>
   The new company expects to pay a dividend consistent with FPL's
dividend policy. FPL Group's annual dividend is $2.16 a share;
Entergy's is $1.20 a share. Entergy's shareholders would receive
$1.26 for each share of the new company, based on a conversion
formula.
</P>
<P>
   The combined utility would have one of the nation's largest
wholesale operations, which sell power to other utilities rather
than directly to consumers. The Wall Street Journal on Monday
speculated that FPL could spin off the profitable unit to form a
separate company, but Broadhead said he has no plans for such a
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wholesale operations are a very exciting part of this,''
Broadhead said. ``As far as spinning it off, we haven't even talked
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although state regulators in Florida, Arkansas, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Texas will review the deal, they do not have
authority to reject or approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Devlin, director of economic regulation for the Florida
Public Service Commission, said the PSC can only verify that FPL's
rates don't rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we see a red flag and feel there is a detrimental effect to
customers, we will bring it to the commission's attention,'' Devlin
said. ``They have the authority to make sure inappropriate costs
are not passed on to the rate payer.''
</P>
<P>
   FPL's deal is just the latest example of consolidation in the
utility industry. Last year, Carolina Power &AMP; Light said it would
buy St. Petersburg-based Florida Progress, a deal that awaits
regulatory approval.

 &HT;    GOP COLLEAGUES PAY TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH DOLE
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects dateline to Philadelphia.
 &HT;    310&AMP;add.
 &HT;    EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The most famous North Carolinian in the GOP was
overcome with emotion and humility Monday after an hour-long
tribute that exalted her many accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am simply overwhelmed,'' said Elizabeth Dole, who addresses
the convention Tuesday night. ``In no way do I feel I deserve such
a magnificent tribute. ... You had me in tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who brought much excitement to the presidential race last
year as a GOP candidate, was honored at an upbeat and moving
ceremony in a hotel ballroom during the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues spoke of her courage, compassion and
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., praised Dole's service as president
of the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``She willingly journeyed into the face of hurricanes and
floods. And in places around the world, like Bosnia and Somalia,
she braved mine fields, civil war, and cholera epidemics to stand
with Red Cross staff and volunteers to reach out to those in the
most dire human need,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., who has known Dole for more than 30
years, said her personal side is even more impressive than her
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through all her years in Washington, no matter what the
pressures or how busy her schedule, she has always found the time
to be a friend, who never forgets a birthday or a special occasion
and who is always there when you need her,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The tribute also included video clips _ some emotional and
others humorous. The lighter side included a salute from her
husband, former Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, and a TV clip of Jay Leno
driving her onto the ``Tonight Show'' stage on a Harley Davidson
motorcycle during her husband's failed 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people thought that was the highlight of the campaign,''
Bob Dole said. ``I can't remember that there was any highlight to
the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   During her long career in public service, Elizabeth Dole held
many high-ranking positions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to heading the Red Cross, she was transportation
secretary under President Reagan and secretary of labor under
President Bush. In her role as transportation secretary, she was
responsible for the U.S. Coast Guard, becoming the first woman to
head a branch of the military.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's tribute, Dole thanked her parents, John Van Hanford
and Mary Ella Hanford, for teaching her the value of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Under their guidance, she showed leadership from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   She was the first female to run for class president at Boyden
High School in Salisbury, N.C., a post that had been off-limits for
girls. Although she did not win, it marked her determination to
take on roles not previously assumed by women.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to be student body president at Duke University,
where she graduated with a political science degree. She also
obtained a master's degree in education and took the first step in
her political career that same year working for Sen. Everett Jordan
of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   To her Republican father's dismay, she toured the South with
Democratic vice-presidential nominee Lyndon Johnson. She later went
to Harvard Law School and was one of 24 women out of a class of 550
who graduated in 1965. She later worked for President Johnson in
the Committee for Consumer Interests and took the same executive
director position when Richard Nixon became president in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she made a run at the GOP nomination, which she
called ``one of the greatest experiences'' of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strongly that somewhere between the streets of San
Francisco, the cornfields of Iowa and the mountain roads of New
Hampshire, I may very well have met and talked to a woman who will
be the first female president of the United States,'' she said. ``I
believe that we have helped to pave the way.''

 &HT;    Judge bans the S-word at Florida burglary trial
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - The legend of Spiderman is common
knowledge in the crime-conscious coastal communities in Palm Beach
County.
</P>
<P>
   Not the web-crawling super hero of comics fame. Most prospective
jurors filing into Judge Kenneth Marra's courtroom Monday recalled
Spiderman as the name of a balcony-scaling cat burglar who breaks
into high-rise condominiums in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Marra was trying to assess the public profile of ``Spiderman''
to insure a fair trial for Derrick James, who is standing trial for
allegedly committing a high-rise burglary in Tequesta.
</P>
<P>
   James, 35, was dubbed by police and news media as ``Spiderman''
after he was named a suspect in more than 100 burglaries from Miami
to Cocoa Beach. He has been convicted in Miami-Dade and Broward
counties and sentenced to 53 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   He is accused of stealing at least $145,000 in goods in 10 Palm
Beach County burglaries. He will have two more trials, with two new
juries, after this one, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   While Marra is barring the use of the S-word during the trial,
he questioned jurors one-by-one what the term Spiderman means to
them to see if they've been tainted by news coverage of James'
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the comic book hero,'' said the first juror called.
He then remembered ``the guy breaking into condos and climbing the
walls.''
</P>
<P>
   The next juror said she remembered something about a high rise
apartment and a burglar going through the window. ``I believe it
was on TV,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another juror said he was ``very familiar'' with the case and
even recognized James, who was sitting at the defense table, from
news photographs.
</P>
<P>
   A few said the moniker meant nothing to them outside the comic
book character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't read the paper,'' said one juror. ``The news is so
depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who linked the name to burglaries were instructed that
only evidence heard inside the courtroom should be considered
during deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Alan, James' attorney, said during a recess that the
Spiderman label imposed on James is so widely known that he didn't
bother seeking a change of venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would probably have to leave the state of
Florida,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection continues today.

COMMENTARY: GOP'S SUMMER OF LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Thousands of Republican activists walked into the
maw of the Philadelphia convention Monday to begin their
reprocessing. They arrived here as well-to-do white conservatives,
a number of whom think trigger locks are unconstitutional and
Social Security is a socialist scheme. But by Thursday night they
are going to be nothing but a big, squishy bowl of inclusion that
likes big hugs all around.
</P>
<P>
   Their reorientation program, otherwise known as the Republican
National Convention, consists mainly of listening to: (a) blacks
and Latinos talking about upward mobility; (b) white women talking
about tax cuts; (c) the kinds of celebrities Bob Dole was
complaining about in 1996; and (d) single moms, people who have
overcome disabilities, people who are at least taking regular
medication.
</P>
<P>
   After an opening program that included a blind man who recited
the Pledge of Allegiance (``He has climbed four of the world's
highest mountains.''), a black woman who sang ``The Star-Spangled
Banner'' (``Gloria is a well-known and forceful advocate for the
homeless.'') and a Latino party activist who cried ``Puerto Rico I
love you!,'' the delegates settled back to wait for the evening's
big prime-time hour, which differed from what preceded only in that
the people on the platform were famous women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In producing a convention that looks like America, George W.
Bush has manufactured one that looks nothing whatsoever like his
party. Still to come is a woman who ``won the Miss America pageant
with an insulin pump under her evening gown.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention did grudgingly provide a few minutes of
cable-only air time Monday to some of the Republican Senate
candidates from hotly contested districts. There was no way to
disguise the fact that they were middle-aged white men in suits
complaining about their opponents, liberal judges and Hillary
Clinton's health care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of abortion and gun control, the platform has been
rewritten to cover all bases while offending no feelings. In one
stroke of genius, the framers scrapped the old, non-inclusive call
for elimination of the Department of Education and the National
Endowment for the Arts in favor of: ``There are too many
departments and agencies.'' Who could argue with that? And who
could not agree with Tommy Thompson, the platform committee
chairman, who told the convention, ``Our title says it all:
Renewing America's Purpose Together.''
</P>
<P>
   In their drive to refashion themselves into non-threatening
winners, the Republicans are laying waste to anything that's left
of the English language as a meaningful political tool. As a public
speaker, Bush is naturally incoherent, and his genius on the stump
is his ability to sound simultaneously sincere and indecipherable.
``If you don't know what you're supposed to know, we'll make sure
you do early before it's too late,'' he said the other day,
discussing education policy in Kentucky. He's still out campaigning
in the heartland, making his way slowly, slowly toward
Philadelphia. The crowds are enthusiastic, and the message is
invariable: If you breathe, here's your man.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who think power resides in Washington
and that's where the most important people are,'' said Rep. Anne
Northup at a rally in Louisville. ``But the truth is, the most
important people are every American, up and down every street.
These are the people that go to work every day. They care about
their children.''
</P>
<P>
   This seems a little tough on the important people who live in
Washington. (None of whom, of course, have anything whatsoever to
do with this convention. The skyboxes are reserved solely for the
homeless.) Do high-priced lobbyists not bleed? Do they not get up
and go to work every day, and hug their children at night?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this convention has nothing bad to say about lobbyists
_ they've been lumped in with the Christian right's agenda as the
Reality That Dare Not Speak Its Name.
</P>
<P>
   There are still a few people worried about John McCain's
prime-time moment Tuesday night. McCain has fallen in the tank for
the Bush campaign so often over the last few days that his suit is
shrinking. But what would happen if his evil spirit took over and
he launched into a bout of truth-telling about the relationship
between the Republican Party and big money?
</P>
<P>
   At this convention, not much. Everybody would probably start
singing ``Michael, Row the Boat Ashore,'' and drown him out.

   Curious facts for curious folks:
</P>
<P>
   Did you know a disproportionate number of people in the drug
policy movement are left-handed?
</P>
<P>
   We didn't either, but Ethan Nadelmann says so. He happens to be
Mr. Drug Policy Movement _ and left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left-handed people learn from an early age what it's like to
be deviant, and that it's OK,'' enthused Nadelmann, 43, a gung-ho
guy _ ``do you mind if I pace?'' _ who was holding forth in his
book-lined Manhattan office.
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann, who has degrees in law and political science from
Harvard and is a former Princeton professor, is the much-admired
and much-repudiated critic of recent administrations' wars on
drugs. Over the years, his left hand has been clasped by a small,
powerful and eclectic group of thinkers, including George Soros,
the billionaire; Walter Cronkite, the former anchor; and George P.
Shultz, the former secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   His latest best friend is Arianna Huffington, the writer and
saloniste, with whom he and others helped create this month's
``shadow conventions'' in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, to discuss
issues like his, which, one may assume, will not be briskly
considered at those other conventions.
</P>
<P>
   He had just been refereeing the in-fighting over the schedule of
events Tuesday in Philadelphia, which will largely reflect his
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 150 people told me they want to speak,'' said Nadelmann,
who pops up on talk shows when the host needs a respectable
flamethrower. ``I'm getting calls saying, `How come you don't have
the hemp issue or the CIA drug-conspiracy issue?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a lightning rod for people who oppose us as well as for
people who don't feel heard. Yeah, we have our lunatic fringe, but
we also have a lot of remarkable people who are smart and
menschy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann, who sees the drug wars as a pricey flop, argues that
drug-related crimes and prison overcrowding will be eased if
offenders are sent to treatment, marijuana is legalized for adults,
and so-called ``harm reduction'' programs, like heroin maintenance,
are encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   He has an affinity for startling comparisons, likening his
``anti-war movement,'' with its focus on how drug laws affect
minorities, to the early days of the civil or gay rights movements.
A divorced father, he tells his 11-year-old daughter that his job
is ``to change bad laws.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nadelmann does more than debate anyone who bumps into him.
He founded the Lindesmith Center, a project of Soros' Open Society
Institute, dedicated to changing drug policy. He advises Soros on
the allocation of about $7 million a year in grants, and he had a
big hand in initiatives allowing marijuana to be dispensed for
medical purposes, passed in a half-dozen states, including
California and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think adults should be punished for what they put into
their bodies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has the cocksure confidence of one who not only believes
that, as he put it, he is doing the Lord's work, but who is
effective enough to be cast as a major antagonist by critics
including Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the Clinton administration's
drug czar, and Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, the president of Phoenix
House Foundation, the drug treatment program.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, a Westchester County rabbi from the American
Reconstructionist movement, Nadelmann has long been attracted to
novel, modern ideas. In his earlier graduate school years, he
bounded onto the relatively untrod discipline of international law
enforcement. Consulting with the State Department's narcotics
bureau, he studied how agents pursued money laundering that crossed
borders. For academic work, he interviewed drug enforcement agents
in 19 countries.
</P>
<P>
   His interests turned toward drug policy. Around 1987, as Nancy
Reagan was saying just say no, he wrote articles begging to differ.
</P>
<P>
   Did you just say yes?
</P>
<P>
   He grinned coyly. ``What's the best way to answer this?'' he
replied, and then described youthful experimentation with drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't go into more details because I'm damned if I do and
damned if I don't,'' he said. ``People will say, `You just advocate
for this because you use,' and if I say I don't, people will say,
`Then you don't know what you're talking about.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't spend much time speaking with users on the street,
although, with a guide, he would take Princeton students on a field
trip to a shooting gallery. On a recent vacation in Europe, he
said, ``I went to visit a little heroin prescription room in
Amsterdam. I biked over there and it was a nice day.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as he is at private persuasion _ Tuesday's roster
includes the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson as well as Gov. Gary E. Johnson
of New Mexico, a Republican _ Nadelmann enjoys the spotlight on
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a huge admiration for a Dennis Ross'' _ the American
Middle East envoy _ ``but he's behind the scenes,'' he said. ``I do
a lot of peacemaking and reconciliation, too, but there's a part of
me that loves public speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was an emotional speaker. He'd cry on the pulpit and I
inherited a large share of that. I never know the first word that
will come out of my mouth. But I'm a very good speaker and I can
move people. I'm a good writer, too, but I don't quite have the
discipline to sit down.''

LAW FIRM PLANS   RADICAL REVISION OF SUMMER PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems like an odd recruiting strategy in a tight labor
market: tell prospective employees that they can expect to work
longer hours and receive fewer perks than they would at rival
companies. That is precisely what a large Washington law firm will
announce Tuesday as it tries to redefine the summer-associate
program that virtually all firms use to woo law students.
</P>
<P>
   Howrey Simon Arnold &AMP; White, which has a roster of blue-chip
clients that includes Intel, Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Procter &AMP;
Gamble, is scrapping its traditional program _ in which law
students spend the summer doing relatively little work, going out
for expensive meals and still getting paid more than $2,000 a week.
In its place will be a ``boot camp'' in which the potential
employees will work 12 hours a day for two weeks on a mock trial,
as well as a two-week stint in one of Howrey's six offices around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Partners at Howrey said they hoped the new program would give
young lawyers a more accurate picture of life at a law firm than a
summer of free baseball and theater tickets does. That in turn
could reduce turnover, which has been rising at most large firms as
many associates have taken advantage of the tight labor market and
have left behind law-firm work that can resemble drudgery in the
first few years for jobs at consulting firms, Internet start-ups
and big companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is looking for ways to make sure people really
understand the life of an associate,'' said Janet Zagorin, the
director of practice development at Gibson, Dunn &AMP; Crutcher,
another big firm. Howrey's new summer program ``is a very, very
interesting idea; it's very different.''
</P>
<P>
   It also brings some significant risks for Howrey, the
74th-largest firm in the country, according to American Lawyer
magazine, and one that focuses on antitrust and
intellectual-property litigation. The firm is both cutting
perquisites for law students who have dozens of options in a good
economy and encouraging them to spend the majority of their summer
at another firm that will try to hire them.
</P>
<P>
   Howrey will mail letters to law students and deans Tuesday
announcing the change, lawyers at the firm said. It will take
effect next year.
</P>
<P>
   Law school officials and lawyers at other firms said they did
not know whether Howrey's idea would spread, but they called it one
of the most notable changes in years to the summer-associate
program, which is the most important recruiting tool for firms.
Each large firm hires dozens of law students, most of them entering
their third and final year of school, for two or three months.
Partners and associates then spend much of the time trying to
persuade the students to join the firm after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Howrey's move is also one of the most dramatic illustrations of
the ways that law firms are scrambling to respond to raises given
to associates earlier this year in an effort to reduce turnover.
The pay increases _ lifting the salaries of first-year associates
at the nation's largest firms to $125,000, from $100,000 _ have
drastically raised firms' costs, causing many to consider
eliminating some practice areas or hiring less expensive outside
lawyers to do more basic work.
</P>
<P>
   Howrey's summer program will save it about $700,000 in direct
costs, and the firm plans to spend some of that money on new
training programs for associates, said Richard Ripley, a partner
who oversees the firm's recruiting committee.
</P>
<P>
   The recent pay increases have also raised the stakes for holding
onto lawyers for more than a few years. The largest increases went
to the least experienced lawyers at most firms, making fourth-year
and fifth-year associates more profitable for firms than their less
experienced colleagues with lower billing rates.
</P>
<P>
   But Howrey has had the same kind of retention problems as many
firms. In June, for example, a lawyer who had quit the firm sent an
anonymous letter to its partners and associates with a long list of
complaints. The ``associates are either leaving like rats from a
sinking ship or are grumbling about how unhappy they are,'' said
the memo, which was passed along by e-mail to dozens of lawyers at
other firms.
</P>
<P>
   With a summer program intended to mimic the kind of work more
experienced lawyers perform, Howrey partners said they hoped to cut
down on the number of associates who leave during their first or
second year, bored by the long hours and the kind of work that
occupies their time then.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the summer-associate programs is that the
bulk of the work that can be effectively done during this very
short period of time is library research,'' said Edward Han, a
Howrey partner. ``Beyond the first year or two of practice, our
actual associates don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   For its two-week boot camp, Howrey will rent a corporate retreat
in Leesburg, Va., where its 50 summer associates and some lawyers
from the firm will spend two weeks. The law students will split
into two teams of opposing lawyers for the mock trial. They then
will depose ``witnesses'' _ played by Howrey employees _ receiving
critiques from the firm's actual lawyers, for example.
</P>
<P>
   During the remaining two weeks, the law students will spread out
across the country and go through a shorter version of the typical
summer-associate program.
</P>
<P>
   The students will receive $12,000 for the four-week program,
which will end in mid-June. The salary is about $500 a week more
than summer associates at other firms receive. But because many
students have large law-school debts, they are likely to spend the
rest of their summer at other firms. ``If you work for 10 weeks,
you pay for a year of law school,'' said W. Stevenson Hopson, the
career services dean at the University of Virginia School of Law,
which sent four of its graduates to Howrey this spring.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Howrey Simon may have a lower acceptance rate than
other firms because nearly all of its summer associates will be
weighing more than one job offer, Hopson added.
</P>
<P>
   Howrey partners said they realized the risk but expected the
lawyers who did accept offers to have a solid understanding of
their new employer. ``We're thinking that by making a better fit,
we will improve our retention,'' Han said.

LAZIO SKIPS CONVENTION TO FOCUS ON NEW YORK SENATE CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ On Thursday night, Republican delegates from
across the nation will gather here to nominate George W. Bush as
their candidate for president, but one particularly prominent
Republican delegate from the state of New York has decided to skip
the climactic night of his party's nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   The delegate _ Rep. Rick Lazio, Hillary Rodham Clinton's
opponent in this year's race for Senate in New York _ was also one
of the few prominent New York Republicans missing from an
invitation-only convention party hosted by Gov. George Pataki and
Bloomberg News Service on Sunday evening. And he turned down an
invitation from convention organizers for a brief,
way-out-of-prime-time speech Monday, instead opting for a swift
visit here on Tuesday for a fund-raiser and a speech with New York
delegates at their hotel. That might be the closest Lazio ever
makes it to the convention floor during this four-day session.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's advisers said that he had decided to steer clear of
Philadelphia because he believed that he could more profitably
spend his time campaigning in New York. But Lazio's campaign
schedule for Monday lists not a single public campaign event _ and
his aides were unable Monday to say precisely what he will be doing
in New York on Thursday night when Bush is nominated in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The question of the whereabouts of Lazio, who for many
Republicans has assumed star status in his role as the man who
might block Clinton's entry into elective office, echoed through
the throngs of revelers eating oysters and lobster salad at
Pataki's party on Sunday, and Monday emerged as one of the few
intriguing questions at a convention at which matters of suspense
have been in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   The answer seems to be that after some negotiations _ and
considerable division among Lazio's advisers, some of whom had
pushed for Lazio to get a large role at the convention _ both
Lazio's associates and organizers of the convention concluded that
it was in neither side's interest for Lazio to have the kind of
high-profile spot here that Hillary Clinton has been promised at
the Democratic convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP convention organizers offered Lazio a minor role in the
proceedings, speaking along with other candidates for Senate, an
offer Lazio turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's chief political strategist, Mike Murphy, said Monday
that Lazio already felt he had lost time campaigning because of his
congressional obligations, which have forced him to spend more time
in Washington than he would have liked. Congress is out of session
this week, and Murphy said Lazio decided to spend just one day
here, and take advantage of the respite to concentrate on his New
York campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have one great day here and then get back to
work in New York,'' Murphy said, speaking in an interview on the
convention floor on Monday. He said that the demand of the campaign
was the sole factor in that decision.
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans here suggested that other things might be
in play for Lazio. For example, at a time when Clinton has been
trying to draw the contest as an ideological
Republican-versus-Democrat, it might not be in Lazio's interest to
be associated with a gathering that is, ultimately, a celebration
of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign spokesman, Dan McLagan, said that appearing in
Pennsylvania ``doesn't move the ball down the field. The campaign's
priorities are in New York _ we're not running for national
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton's campaign moved quickly Monday to stoke the
perception that Lazio was in a bit of a predicament. Clinton's
spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said that Lazio was ``trying to run away
from his party,'' adding, ``In Washington, Rick Lazio is proud to
be a member of the Republican leadership, but in New York he tries
to hide the fact that he's a Republican at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's national co-chairman, Pat Harrison, disputed that
claim Monday night, asserting that she understood Lazio's absence
and said he would have been welcome to enjoy a larger role here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he just has decided that he needs to be campaigning 24
hours a day,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several Republicans suggested the party might have little
interest in providing Lazio a prime position.Convention speakers
have been instructed to avoid critical remarks in general _ and
attacks on President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in
particular. Such restrictions might have proved problematic for
Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to speak directly before her husband on the
opening night of her own party's convention in Los Angeles.

TORRICELLI DROPS HIS BID FOR NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Just three weeks after throwing New Jersey's
Democratic Party into chaos by making a bid for governor of New
Jersey, Sen. Robert Torricelli abruptly abandoned the race Monday
after an array of prominent Democrats said they would not support
him.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, which is coordinating 32 Senate races across the nation,
had asserted that his national stature as a congressional power
broker gave Democrats the best chance to retake the governor's
mansion, which has been controlled by Republicans for 16 of the
last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But after prominent Democrats, including Mayor Sharpe James of
Newark, announced that they would endorse his rival, Jim McGreevey,
in the election next year, Torricelli said that he was ending his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli acknowledged Monday that he was ``humbled'' by his
failure to generate widespread grass-roots support, but said he
could not simultaneously run in a gubernatorial primary while
carrying out his duties heading Democratic Senate efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably somewhat naive,'' Torricelli said of his plan
to quickly win support from party leaders and wrest the nomination
from McGreevey before the Democratic National Convention in
mid-August. ``I thought that people would put their own interests
aside to work toward the goal of something larger.''
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey, who nearly defeated Gov. Christie Whitman in 1997,
has been working ever since to build support for another attempt at
the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   But many political experts said Torricelli himself was to blame
for his lukewarm reception by party leaders, whose support is
crucial in New Jersey primaries because they determine which
candidate's name appears on the party line. During his rapid ascent
in Washington, Torricelli's sharp tongue and hot temper have made
enemies of many Democrats who were only too eager to pay him back
by rallying behind McGreevey. Torricelli's widely publicized
investment in several private stock deals has also hurt his
standing among voters, according to recent public opinion polls.
And his 1996 Senate campaign, which is now entangled in a federal
investigation that has brought guilty pleas from six contributors,
was also a political liability, according to a private poll that
the state party conducted over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Zukin, a political science professor at Rutgers
University, said the decision to withdraw would seriously damage
Torricelli's standing within the party and would be at least a
temporary setback to any presidential ambitions he might harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a politician as seasoned as Torricelli, this is a huge
misstep,'' Zukin said. ``He put a number of powerful Democrats into
a very difficult position by entering this thing, which means he
was going for it. So for him to drop out, this is a fundamental
miscalculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli turned New Jersey politics upside down three weeks
ago, when he began lobbying county chairmen and labor leaders to
support his quest for the party's nomination for governor in 2001.
The governor's office in New Jersey, with broad powers, is
considered one of the most powerful in the country, and the post is
considered the supreme prize in state politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although McGreevey had already gathered the support of many
Democratic leaders and raised $3.2 million for the state party in
late June, Torricelli contended that his candidacy could unite the
state's Democratic Party, which is engaged in a feud so bitter that
leaders from South Jersey now refuse to meet with their
counterparts from North Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge, refused to be muscled
aside. With the help of his political patrons, state Sens. John A.
Lynch and Raymond J. Lesniak, McGreevey locked up the support of
the labor leaders and party chairmen he has courted assiduously
since 1997 and prevented Torricelli from gaining endorsements from
all seven counties in South Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli won the backing of some labor leaders and
endorsements in Camden, Morris, Bergen and Burlington counties. As
recently as last Friday, Torricelli's closest advisers predicted
that he would win the endorsement of party leaders in populous
Essex and Hudson counties early this week and gain a stranglehold
on the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But over the weekend, the state party's polling found that
McGreevey, who has run almost nonstop for the last six years, led
Torricelli among likely primary voters by 35 percent to 31 percent.
When asked whether the controversies surrounding the senator's
personal finances and campaign fund-raising would affect their
decision, more than 20 percent of likely voters said it would make
them less likely to support Torricelli, said a party official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   When James announced his endorsement Monday, along with other
Essex County leaders, including state Senate Minority Leader
Richard J. Codey, it was clear that Torricelli would face a bitter
and divisive primary. The state party chairman, Tom Giblin, said he
was grateful that Torricelli decided to withdraw rather than
further fracture the party, and said Democrats could now focus on
helping Al Gore win the state's presidential vote and electing Jon
Corzine to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite McGreevey's victory however, there were few signs that
the various factions of the party might resolve their differences
soon.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference announcing the endorsements, McGreevey,
42, took a swipe at Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party is greater than any individual's
political ambitions,'' he said. When Torricelli later withdrew from
the race, McGreevey did not return repeated telephone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his withdrawal from the race, Torricelli was
sparing in his praise for McGreevey and refused to offer an
endorsement. Instead, the senator mentioned two U.S.
representatives who might consider seeking the nomination, Bill
Pascrell and Frank Pallone, although most party leaders now
consider that unlikely.

   WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. _ Vice President Al Gore's list of
running mate possibilities seems to be shrinking, based on playful
sign language from his wife Monday during a stroll on the beach in
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore, his wife, Tipper, and daughters Karenna and Sarah
walked along the surf on Figure Eight Island for a photo
opportunity, reporters asked whether Gore had narrowed the field
and how his convention speech was coming.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, ``We're just relaxing, concentrating on my grandson
right now,'' as he pushed a stroller with Karenna's 13-month-old
son, Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   But Tipper Gore suggested in a gesture that the field was
narrowing, holding her hands about two feet apart, closing up the
space then expanding it again. Democrats close to the campaign also
suggested that Gore was getting closer to a final decision.
</P>
<P>
   Names still in circulation include Sen. John Edwards of North
Carolina, Sen. Bob Graham of Florida and Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts. Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader, from South
Dakota, who has visions of the Democrats' recapturing the Senate,
has asked the Gore camp not to raid any Democratic senators whose
replacements would be named by a Republican governor. Of these
three, only Edwards meets that requirement.

 &HT;    Charges fly over possible contamination of N.C. housing site
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. _ Possible contamination of a temporary
trailer park for Hurricane Floyd's victims on Monday prompted
charges of racism against government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a racial thing that we are poor, we didn't have
anything, so you are going to have to accept whatever we give
you,'' said Vernice Lyons, 56, still living at the government
trailer park more than 10 months after Floyd destroyed her home.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal emergency relief officials denied the charges
of racism, but acknowledged Floyd's massive, still unfinished
recovery has left thousands of victims weary and angry.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding from North Carolina's worst natural disaster damaged or
destroyed about 55,000 homes, displacing hundreds of thousands of
people. Many of the 1,171 families still living in temporary state
housing are Hispanics and African-Americans, including the families
living in campers and trailers outside of Rocky Mount, at the
former Fountain Industrial Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there is no environmental racism,'' said Doug Boyd,
who is in charge of temporary housing for North Carolina's
Emergency Management Division.
</P>
<P>
   Hastily constructed last fall, the Fountain Industrial trailer
park is on a former coal ash dump. Toxic arsenic and mercury are
byproducts of coal ash
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the state Emergency Management Agency distributed a
letter to residents saying the site had passed an independent
environment assessment last fall, clearing the way for its use as a
housing site.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists gathered additional soil samples last week, after the
University of North Carolina School of Public Healthraised
contamination concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The results of soil testing could be available as soon as today,
Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency housing official plans to meet Thursday with
residents who, he said, would be relocated if the samples find
evidence of contamination.

PHILADELPHIA DIARY: REPLACING MARY FISHER; CHOOSING TO LOSE GORE; A
SOMBER TEA; A NOT-SO-REPUBLICAN ALERT
</HEADLINE>
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI and MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mary Fisher speech had become an fixture at Republican
conventions. She spoke passionately in 1992 and 1996 about living
with HIV and offered to do a repeat performance in Philadelphia.
The response from the Bush campaign was, well, no direct response.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a short speech about AIDS will be delivered by Patricia
Funderburk Ware, the president of the Preserving Family Well-Being
Foundation, who favors abstinence-only sex education programs. It's
a decidedly more conservative message than the one Fisher would
have delivered. Fisher provides funds for an AIDS research and
education fund, and advocates a broader range of preventive
measures. ``I think it's more important to save lives than
virginity,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another difference. Fisher, whose father, Max, has
given sizable amounts of his auto-body fortune to the Republican
Party, is white. Ware, who worked in the administration of
President Bush, is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was important that it be an African American,''
said Carl E. Schmid, a leading gay supporter of Governor Bush who
discussed the choice with party officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Fitzpatrick, a party spokesman, said simply that Ware ``is
reflective of Governor Bush's call for soldiers in the army of
compassion.'' Ware did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said she thought it would be more powerful for the
delegates to hear from someone with AIDS. ``Having someone with the
disease puts a face on it,'' Fisher said. Her past speeches were
arrestingly personal and, Fisher added, ``maybe it brings it too
close to them.''
</P>
<P>
   So Fisher stayed away from the convention, but her
non-invitation was on the minds of some at a reception Monday for
gay and lesbian Republicans. Like Fisher, they were struggling to
find their place under the big tent the party says it has pitched.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid, addressing a room of about 200, praised the party's
draft platform, which was in line with many policies favored by
gays. ``Unfortunately,'' he told the crowd, ``the very conservative
platform committee'' changed the language. `We have a long road
ahead in our own party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One step on that road, he said, will be a speech to the
convention by Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, who will be the first
openly gay person to address a Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   His topic? International trade policy.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Rep. Jerry Lewis was happily anticipating the party
he was planning to give for the California delegation and
Republican congressmen at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. The theme of
the evening, which was to last until 2 a.a.: Survivor. But in this
version of the wildly popular television show, it's not bikini-clad
coeds who get kicked off the island.
</P>
<P>
   It's Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have booked some actors to do stuff,'' said Jim
Specht, Lewis' spokesman. ``But I don't think there's a plan to do
anything terribly official looking. I think they'll announce the
list of candidates to be kicked off and, well, Al Gore's name might
be the only one on there.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican ladies who usually do not have time for lunch _ about
200 women, including members of the House and Senate _ sat down to
an afternoon tea, hosted by Lifetime Television for Women, in honor
of Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   But a dolorous air had settled in at the ground-floor ballroom
in the Four Seasons Hotel, over the tables, some empty, set with
crumpets, cream and crystal flutes filled with Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   After all, many women attending the tea had hoped that it would
be Dole making her acceptance speech here in Philadelphia, for
either spot on the ticket. Now, instead of being feted on the
convention floor, she was being saluted with petits fours.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy G. Brinker, the founder of the Susan Komen Breast Cancer
Foundation, stopped to pose for a photograph with Dole and said
that she was disappointed that there was no woman on the Republican
ticket. Brinker, though, remained hopeful that there would be one
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I tend to think of progress in breast-cancer terms, in
years and years, not in months,'' she said. When did she expect a
woman? ``Soon. This is an evolution, not a revolution. Politics is
about the art of the possible.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if she was disappointed not to see Dole on the
ticket, Rep. Tillie Fowler of Florida said, ``Oh my, yes. She's
been my friend for thirty years.'' Fowler and Dole once worked
together in the Lyndon Johnson White House.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington, a member of the Republican
House leadership and a deputy convention co-chair, was positively
bouyant. She said that George W. Bush was strong on issues that
deal with women, citing his plans for Social Security reform as an
example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Husbands tend to die seven or eight years earlier than their
wives, so Social Security reform is beneficial for women,'' she
said. She was also a big fan of Dick Cheney, who has opposed
legislation supporting equal rights for women. ``He is married to a
powerful woman, and he knows he needs to listen to a powerful
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The lights dimmed. Piano music tinkled over a canned soundtrack.
Images of Dole in Bosnia, in Serbia, Dole cradling a starving
African child, Dole in hurricane gear, filtered across the screen.
Carole Black, the chief executive of Lifetime, spoke about Dole's
accomplishments. Black, who is a Democrat, is also giving a party
at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles: It is for the elected
women of the Congress and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Rockefeller, an environmental lawyer, stalked the
corridors of the Republican convention Monday, spreading his
gospel, a ``Statement by Larry Rockefeller'' that warns darkly of
Republican extremism.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller, whose uncle Nelson A. Rockefeller was the original
Rockefeller Republican, said that he was going booth to booth, and
tent to tent, to sound an alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must look beyond the gauze and the haze and the happy
promises and look at Bush's record in Texas,'' he said, his leather
satchel leaking manifestoes. ``He is not, despite what some voters
think, a mainstream Republican. As a Republican, I personally feel
I ought to let voters know.'' Rockefeller, who describes himself as
a ``mainstream Republican'' contributed $2,000 to Al Gore's
campaign last year.

   START-UP RECRUITING
</P>
<P>
   A California start-up, DNA Sciences, is introducing a Web site
that will recruit people to donate their DNA to help find genes
that cause disease. The company hopes to get 50,000 to 100,000
people to contribute to its ``gene trust'' by appealing to their
altruism.
</P>
<P>
   The new effort reflects a big change taking place in genetics.
Studies to link genes to disease are starting to be conducted on an
unprecedented scale. While such studies promise to lead to big
medical advances, the collection of genetic data on such a wide
scale is also raising ethical and privacy issues.

to expand the company's role in educational publishing, they were
concerned about the structure of the deal, which offers existing
stockholders the right to buy some additional shares at a
significant discount. Shares of Pearson fell 9 percent, to 18.28

   TAX CUTS IN RUSSIA
</P>
<P>
   Changes in the Russian tax code seek to drag enormous portions
of revenue out of hiding and onto company books by reducing the tax
burden about 20 percent. But many businesses, which pay only a
fraction of what they really owe, say that only deeper cuts and a
fairer system will induce them to pay.

FIRE IN SEQUOIA FOREST IS ONE OF 45 RAGING IN THE WEST By TODD S. c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ More than 1,500 firefighters and a fleet of
helicopters and tankers continued to battle a 63,270-acre wildfire
in the eastern Sierra Nevada on Monday, with the blaze still only
about 15 percent contained and thunderstorms and dangerous dry
lightning forecast, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which destroyed eight homes in a tiny mountain town
over the weekend, started July 22 and has burned through the
Sequoia National Forest about 120 miles north of here. It is just
one of about 45 fires burning over nearly 500,000 acres in
California, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho and Montana. Officials at the
National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, said that hot,
dry weather, lightning without rain and a spate of new fires were
taxing firefighting capacity throughout the region. Training began
today for the Army's 3rd Battalion 16th Field Artillery from Ft.
Hood, Texas, which is being called in to assist firefighters in
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst fire season we've had since 1988,'' said
Michelle Barrett, a spokeswoman at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Eight new fires in the region were reported on Monday, and
Barrett said overworked and exhausted firefighters would soon have
to be rotated off duty for rest. She said officials would also have
to be selective about where they put their stretched resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as we worry about the fires, there's not a blade of
grass or a tree out there that's important as the lives of our
firefighters,'' Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a training accident in Alaska, there have been no
firefighter fatalities in forest fires so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sequoia Forest fire, in an isolated area west of
California Route 395, nine water-spraying helicopters and eight
fixed-wing aircraft dumping flame retardant chemicals supplemented
the efforts of firefighters on the grounds, said Doug Johnston, an
engineer with the Kern County Fire Department. The cause of the
fire is unknown, and 11 firefighters have suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The estimate now is that it won't be fully controlled for
about two weeks,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the fire destroyed houses and trailers in the
isolated hamlet of Pine Creek, part of a broader area known as
Kennedy Meadows, destroying eight buildings and lodges, including
five in an abandoned Boy Scout camp. The Sequoia Forest is a
habitat area for California spotted owls.
</P>
<P>
   A few isolated structures in the area remain at risk, but at
peak summer, the entire population is about 100, according to
Johnston. He said most, if not all, residents had already been
evacuated. Firefighters were bivouacked in two temporary camps. A
total of 51 hand crews, 74 engines, 13 bulldozers and 18
water-tenders have been dispatched to the blaze, where the
firefighters have been hindered by inaccessible terrain and high
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Two smaller fires were also still burning in Southern and
Central California, one on the Pechanga Indian Reservation in the
Cleveland National Forest, just east of Temecula, and another in
the Los Padres National Forest, 25 miles north of Cambria on the
Central Coast, which was expected to be contained by Tuesday.

RUSSIA'S TAX REFORMS WELCOMED, BUT BUSINESSES SAY MORE CUTS ARE
NEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
  By SABRINA TAVERNISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ For much of the last decade, Russia's government had
promised that it would reduce the country's huge tax burden. Last
week it finally did. But the changes, business owners say, do not
go nearly far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, businesses have
been plagued by a tax system so complicated and burdensome that
most have chosen to keep big chunks of their revenue hidden. Armies
of bureaucrats, many of them prone to bribery, make operating even
more expensive and turn company accountants into tax negotiators.
Even losses are taxed, while slender profits can turn to losses
after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul of the Russian tax code aims to drag enormous
portions of revenue out of hiding and onto company books by
reducing the tax burden about 20 percent. But many businesses,
which pay only a fraction of what they really owe, say only deeper
cuts and a fairer system will get them to pay.
</P>
<P>
   A payroll tax is considered one of the biggest drags on
business. Oleg Ryabov, who owns a small blouse-maker with about 50
employees in northern Moscow, says the deepest cuts in the new tax
code passed over him. His seamstresses earn an average of 5,000
rubles a month, or $180, more than double the country's average
wage. Still, that is well below the level at which sharp reductions
in the payroll tax apply. Ryabov's business is eligible for a tax
cut of only two percentage points. He said he would continue, as
before, to show only a third of his workers' wages to the tax
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 15 percent of Russians' wages are eligible for the
deepest cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if we pay what we owe, we just cannot compete,'' said
Ryabov, 39, whose small company is tucked away in the back of a
former machinery factory.
</P>
<P>
   The company pays about one-sixth of what it really owes in
taxes. Any more would make his blouses more expensive than the
Chinese imports at Moscow's biggest outdoor markets. Importers of
such garments often avoid paying tariffs, and the imports come to
the consumer virtually tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   Larger businesses have a harder time trimming officially
reported wages and revenue. One of Russia's biggest cosmetics
producers, Kalina, says it cannot get away with hiding revenue. It
welcomed the tax changes, in particular a flat-rate income tax
reduction to 13 percent from a maximum of 35 percent. The company,
which employs about 2,500 people, will have to withhold far less
from workers' wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say we pay taxes, people look at me as if I am crazy,''
said Aleksandr Petrov, finance director at Kalina, in the Ural
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tax changes so far have been welcomed by many
Russians as a good start. They allow the poorest people for the
first time to take additional write-offs for education and health
care, and reduce the revenue tax, until now 4 percent of company
income, to 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian industrialist Kakha Bendukidze, who heads Uralmash,
a big machinery producer, called on President Vladimir Putin at a
meeting last Friday to further reduce tax rates. High taxes are the
single biggest hindrance to doing business in Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the tax rates are lowered, every businessman is a
criminal,'' Bendukidze said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The government has promised more cuts in 2002 and 2003.

ADVERTISING: THE POPULAR INDUSTRY PARTY THAT WASN'T, AND WHY 
</HEADLINE>
  By STUART ELLIOT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as the curiosity of Sherlock Holmes was piqued by the dog
that did not bark, Madison Avenue is wondering about the party that
is not being thrown.
</P>
<P>
   The party is known as Advertising New York, an annual benefit
event held since 1994 under the sponsorship of three organizations
well-known in the agency industry: the Advertising Club of New
York, Advertising Women of New York and the American Advertising
Federation. The popular event, typically held in June at
Rockefeller Center in midtown Manhattan, has drawn more than a
thousand attendees each year to buy tickets to elaborate food
tastings featuring celebrity chefs from agencies, client companies
and the media.
</P>
<P>
   Profits after expenses have been donated to the charitable and
educational programs sponsored by the foundations of the three
organizations. Typically, each event yielded an estimated profit of
$100,000, said Wally Snyder, president and chief executive of the
advertising federation in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   However, this year June has come and gone without the party
taking place _ and therefore without the money being raised. Also
missing this year was the presentation of annual honors named the
Good Egg Awards that had been awarded in connection with the event.
The awards, meant to promote corporate citizenship had been
presented since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been no shortage this year of awards or parties
in the New York advertising world, primarily because of the ad
spending boom, people became curious when there was no word about
Advertising New York, which has also gone by the name Ad Day in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? The answer is not quite elementary, my dear
Watson, but more the result of a combination of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   First off, it turns out that a committee formed by the three
organizations to coordinate Ad Day met in December 1999 and decided
not to hold it in 2000 and form a task force to rethink the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collective judgment was to step back a year and take a
breath,'' Snyder said, ``to see how it could be refocused and what
more we could be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great program and I loved it,'' he added, ``but it's
a big effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Flahive, president at the women's advertising
organization, said: ``Ad Day has always served as an important
fund-raiser, but I can't think of a recipe for a fund-raiser that
you can repeat year in and year out. Advertising is a business that
prides itself on the new, the different, the cutting edge. People
like change and new things.'' Flahive is also publisher at the
American Park Network in New York, part of the Meredith Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enthusiasm has died down,'' agreed Frank Ginsberg,
chairman, chief executive and creative director at Avrett, Free &AMP;
Ginsberg in New York, who has been one of the most ardent
supporters of the event.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, Ginsberg said, is that because ``the business is
booming,'' there are ``many events where you can get together with
your peers.'' Another reason, he said, was that fewer people seemed
familiar with the purpose of the event as the years went by,
leading to perceptions that it was just another social affair or
schmooze-athon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were asking what all the booths with food at
Rockefeller Center were there for,'' Ginsberg said. ``It wasn't
clear.'' Avrett, Free is part of the Bozell Group unit of True
North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   As enthusiasm flagged, there was also a change in the
composition of the crowds, particularly the volunteers who agreed
to be chefs. (The chefs, including this columnist, did not actually
cook food but stood by as caterers served the dishes and talked
with the attendees who bought tickets to the event.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, we got the top people in the industry to
come,'' said Brett Caldwell, director for events and programs at
the advertising club. ``We're trying to restructure and rebuild it,
to make it the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder at the advertising federation said that he too hoped
``there would be more CEOs'' from the agencies attending as well as
``more clients.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the advertising club is planning to become the
sponsor of the Good Egg Awards. A committee has been formed,
Caldwell said, whose members anticipate resuming the presentations
in summer 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Will there be an Ad Day to accompany an awards presentation when
the Good Eggs are revived? As the saying goes, stay tuned.

MARKET PLACE: GOLDMAN, SACHS THROWS GUTTERBALL WITH AMF BOWLING
INVOLVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

or 888-346-9867.) By PATRICK McGEEHAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Goldman, Sachs led a buyout of AMF Bowling in 1996, some
analysts wondered why a silk-stocking investment bank would risk
sullying its image in such a pedestrian pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   But, after four years under Goldman's control, it is AMF's image
that has suffered as the company has racked up losses and its stock
price has sunk to 75 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Having traded for less than $1 a share for more than 30
consecutive days, AMF _ arguably the biggest name in bowling _ is
in danger of being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and
investors are wondering if the company will have to sort out its
financial troubles in bankruptcy court. People close to the
company, which is based in Richmond, Va., said that AMF's board
discussed a variety of revamping options, including a prepackaged
bankruptcy filing, last week in New York.
</P>
<P>
   AMF is saddled with about $1.2 billion in debt. Its bonds have
been trading for 20 percent to 30 percent of their face value.
</P>
<P>
   When the company releases its second-quarter earnings within the
next two weeks, those investors who still are paying attention will
focus less on what happened in the traditionally slower spring
season than on what the company has to say about its future plans.
After all, the earnings cannot surprise analysts because nobody on
Wall Street follows AMF's stock any more.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Baron, chief executive of Baron Capital, once was one of
AMF's biggest boosters, predicting that the stock price would soar
to $100 by 2003. Now, with his company and its mutual funds holding
more than 11 million shares of AMF, Baron will not discuss AMF.
Through a spokesman, he denied that his funds, the biggest investor
in the company after Goldman, were among the sellers when AMF
shares dropped to a record low of 18.75 cents on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Hare, AMF's chief financial officer, said in an
interview that ``the capital structure needs to be fixed'' but the
company has not settled on a solution. He declined to discuss the
possibility of a voluntary bankruptcy filing and said that the
company had not started negotiating with its creditors. But it is
clear that changes must be made before AMF has to start making much
bigger payments to bondholders in about a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meter is running,'' Hare said ``It's fair for the markets
to say, `Show us the plan.' When we have a plan that we're
comfortable with, you'll see us announce it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Hare acknowledged, the company, its industry
and its employees are all suffering. ``Just the fact that the stock
has not been successful in the last year, I don't think speaks well
for the industry,'' he said, ``We feel a certain obligation to be
successful for the industry at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hare said that company officials have talked to representatives
of the New York Stock Exchange about how to get back into
compliance with the exchange's listing standards. AMF has less than
30 days to come up with a plan. One possibility: a reverse stock
split that would reduce the number of shares outstanding to push up
their price and buy management more time to formulate a solution.
</P>
<P>
   How AMF, under Goldman's control, got into such a bind is a
complicated story that involves Asian economics, American social
trends and the ways of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Goldman led a leveraged buyout of AMF. A year later,
the firm took the company public again, raising $263 million by
selling shares for $19.50 each.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch for the 1997 offering was that AMF would buy bowling
alleys around the United States and capitalize on a growing craze
for bowling in China and other parts of Asia. AMF would make money
two ways: by operating a chain of bowling centers and by selling
the equipment to outfit new ones overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But while AMF was gobbling up alleys and trying to run them more
efficiently, league bowling _ the lifeblood of the bowling business
_ was dying. Leagues, which represent a predictable stream of
revenue from September through March, once accounted for as much as
80 percent of a bowling center's business, said Sandy Hansell, a
bowling consultant in Southfield, Mich. That share has dropped to
about 50 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the summer of 1998, an economic crisis swept across
Asia, wiping out demand for capital-intensive leisure activities
like bowling.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Goldman was the majority owner of a heavily indebted
company in a slow-growth business. The bowling products business,
which had generated about $70 million in cash flow in 1997,
produced less than $10 million in cash flow last year, Hare said.
He said demand for bowling is still growing in some countries,
including England, but ``what we don't see right now are any
markets that have that boom potential.''
</P>
<P>
   AMF's board _ which has Richard Friedman, who runs Goldman's
merchant-banking operations, as chairman _ removed the company's
management. Last year, the directors hired Roland Smith, who
formerly ran the Arby's fast-food chain, as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is slowing the pace of acquisitions while the company
devises a strategy for marketing its 417 bowling centers as a
national chain, Hare said. The company is spending about $10
million to gear all of its centers for what it calls Xtreme
bowling, a nighttime activity aimed at teen-agers and other
recreational bowlers, and is considering an extensive ad campaign,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without a big increase in revenue, the bowling centers are
profitable on an operating basis, said Hansell. And, despite its
slower growth, the bowling business is healthy, with most lane
operators making more money than they ever have, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tough question for AMF and Goldman is how they can relieve
the company of some of its debt burden before it snuffs the life
out of bowling-center operations. It is a rare problem for Friedman
and Goldman's other merchant bankers, who have rolled their share
of strikes, most recently in having a big stake in VoiceStream
Wireless when Deutsche Telekom agreed to buy that company for a
huge premium.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1996, Goldman and its merchant-banking funds put up $260
million for a majority stake in the buyout of AMF. Two other
investment banks, Blackstone Group and Kelso &AMP; Co., bought smaller
stakes, and the company borrowed about $1 billion through bank
loans and bond sales.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Goldman received about $50 million in fees for
advising the company and underwriting securities, including its
initial public offering of stock. Now its 45 million shares are
worth less than that, about $34 million. Goldman officials will not
say how much the firm has lost on its AMF investment, but a person
close to the matter said the firm is feeling ``a lot of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens to AMF, Hansell said, the bowling
business will survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If AMF went belly up, would it be a problem?,'' he said. ``It
would hurt, but it wouldn't be cataclysmic. The other 5,000 bowling
centers in this country would roll along.''

PLATFORM STRIVES TO REACH RIGHT AND CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs to rewrite throughout, subs byline; adds parenthetical
sentence in 5th graf that full text of platform can be found on
www.nytimes.com.)  
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Republican National Convention on Monday
approved a platform intended to both reassure the party's
conservative base and signal to the broader electorate that the
party had been transformed by Gov. George W. Bush's bid for the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the platform
committee, hailed the document's ``positive, uplifting'' tone and
described it to the delegates as a platform that ``every Republican
can be proud of, and one that will carry George Bush to the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   But the effort to satisfy moderate and conservative
constituencies alike, and help ensure a peaceful convention,
carried political risks of its own. Democrats and their allies
quickly seized on the most conservative parts of the platform, like
its call for a ban on abortion, as evidence that little had changed
in the Republican Party beyond rhetoric and imagery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to use the platform like we're going to use George
Bush's record in Texas and Dick Cheney's voting record _ to show
the American people that this is still the same old Republican
Party,'' said Jenny Backus, a spokeswoman for the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The document approved Monday had been carefully managed by
Bush's allies, and much of it bears his unmistakable mark. It
incorporates his policy proposals, and his language, on a set of
issues at the heart of his campaign, from education to tax cuts,
from health care to immigration. In keeping with his theme of
``compassionate conservatism,'' it declares that ``for every
American, there must be a ladder of opportunity, and for those most
in need, a safety net of care.'' (For the full text of the
platform, go to www.nytimes.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and other Bush allies worked hard over weeks of private
and public meetings to ensure that the platform process was free of
the divisiveness of prior years and did not distract from the
upbeat message of the convention and the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   They chose to fight conservatives on some issues _ notably the
governor's education plan _ that they felt were imperative to
underscore the idea that Bush was ``a different kind of
Republican.'' But they removed the abortion issue from contention
early on, declaring that they did not want the plank to change,
even though Bush says his personal position is less restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   The only suspense Monday was whether Republicans who support
abortion rights would win enough support among delegates either for
a minority report or to bring the issue to the floor. They did not,
although they insisted they had come close despite heavy opposition
from the party establishment. They vowed to return to the grass
roots re-energized, and promised a stronger fight on the issue four
years from now.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, all was harmony when the platform was presented to
the convention Monday afternoon, and quickly approved on a voice
vote. Abortion was never mentioned from the podium, although many
delegates were wearing vests, handed out by the Republican National
Coalition for Life, that bore anti-abortion slogans. In the only
allusion to the division on social issues that at times had roiled
the platform committee's deliberations, Thompson declared, ``As
Republicans, there is so much more that unites us than divides
us.''
</P>
<P>
   As passed, the platform embraces Bush's call for ``bold reforms
in education,'' including a strong federal role in more
accountability and more school choice; for ``saving and
strengthening Social Security'' by allowing some private investment
of payroll taxes; for an array of tax cuts; and for a more
inclusive tone on immigration. In sharp contrast to the platform of
1996, it does not call for the abolition of a single federal
agency, and the partisan attacks are markedly diminished.
</P>
<P>
   It drops some of the most controversial elements of the 1996
immigration plank, including tough language about denying benefits
to immigrants and denying automatic citizenship to the
American-born children of illegal immigrants. The original draft,
written by Bush's allies, also sought to drop the demand that
English be officially recognized as the nation's common language,
although delegates essentially restored that provision in
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the repositioning, the platform also reiterates most
of the agenda of the party's social conservatives. It calls for a
constitutional ban on abortion, without exceptions, and the
appointment of judges who ``respect the sanctity of innocent human
life.'' The only change in the plank is a new denunciation of the
recent Supreme Court decision overturning state laws that banned
the procedure opponents call ``partial birth'' abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has noted that he would personally allow abortion in cases
of rape, incest or danger to the life of a pregnant woman, and also
says he does not support a litmus test for judicial appointments.
But abortion rights groups say that by agreeing to the platform he
in fact embraced a litmus test, and that this is a crucial
indication of how he would make appointments to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will trumpet that message across the country,'' said Alice
Germond, acting president of the National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League. ``On this issue, he's neither compassionate
nor kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, allowed
himself some distance from the platform, particularly when
responding to Democratic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased that the platform has departed
substantially from earlier platforms, notably in the areas of
education and immigration,'' he said, but added, ``Governor Bush is
going to run on his record and his views, and it's on that ground
that he'll make his stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush differs as well with the platform's position on gays in the
military; he supports the current ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy,
while the platform flatly declares that homosexuality is
``incompatible'' with military service. The platform also opposes
counseling on contraceptives in school-based clinics, any
recognition of ``special legal protection'' for homosexuals and any
movement to recognize same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The document that emerged was generally praised by delegates,
who were strikingly optimistic on this first convention day.
Moments after the platform's passage, as the strains of Bob Seger's
``Old Time Rock &AMP; Roll'' filled the hall, Cathie Adams, president
of the conservative Texas Eagle Forum, declared herself ``very
happy'' with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to win,'' she said. ``And I'm going to
work hard to make sure we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, now a lobbyist,
described it as ``solidly right of center, a good, solid,
reasonable platform that George W. Bush as nominee won't have to
run away from.''
</P>
<P>
   But Backus, of the Democratic National Committee, asserted that
the platform was a mother lode of out-of-the-mainstream positions,
not only on abortion but also on the environment, school vouchers
and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about stripping away fluffy rhetoric and pretty photo
ops,'' Backus said. ``People want to know what a party stands for
and what a candidate stands for, and that's where the platform is
important.''

 &HT;    Surhoff has strong ties to Baltimore community
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - As happy as the Braves are about the acquisition of
B.J. Surhoff, it might take the 14-year-veteran some time to get
used to the idea. Surhoff has played in Baltimore since signing
there as a free agent in December 1995, and he has strong ties to
the city.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Polly, is from Baltimore and 8-year-old son Mason, one
of their four children, is autistic. Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore has a special program for Mason that Surhoff worries
can't be matched here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets much more complicated because things are important to
me not just as a player anymore,'' Surhoff said. ``If it were just
me, it would be one thing. The other side ... affects me more
deeply off the field. Hopefully I'll do a good job with it.''
</P>
<P>
   One person who understands his concerns but who also thinks
Surhoff will be a ``perfect fit'' in Atlanta is his former college
teammate at North Carolina and fellow New York native, Walt Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been friends a long time,'' Weiss said. ``I've always
held out hope we'd get a chance to play together in the big
leagues. It's been 15 years and it's finally happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff was drafted first overall in 1985 by the Milwaukee
Brewers out of Rye, N.Y. Weiss, who was picked 11th overall by the
A's in the 1985 draft, grew up 20 minutes away in Suffern, N.Y.
They played together for three years at North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real professional guy, a real team guy, real
dependable, plays hard,'' Weiss said. ``He's one of the more
heads-up, intelligent players in the game. He thinks like a manager
would. On top of that, he's talented.... I don't know if you could
have made a better pickup.''
</P>
<P>
   A bonus for the Braves is that Surhoff spent the first part of
his career catching and can still play there as well as first and
third base.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff, who is making $4.1 million this season, has one more
year on his contract worth $4.5 million plus an option for 2002
worth $4.5 million, which kicks in if he plays 120 games or has 372
plate appearances in 2001. Surhoff, like any player who is traded
in the middle of a multiyear contract, can demand a trade after the
season is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does, he'll be the first to have done that here,''
Braves general manager John Schuerholz said.

LAURA BUSH STEPS INTO THE LIMELIGHT &HT;    (EDS: Complete writethru; updates with speech delivered, quotes)
 &HT;    By DAN FREEDMAN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Defying her reputation as a prim,
noncontroversial former librarian, Texas first lady Laura Bush took
a swipe at the Clinton-Gore administration Monday night, telling
delegates to the Republican National Convention that if her husband
becomes president he ``will not change with the winds of polls.''
</P>
<P>
   The wife of Gov. George W. Bush took a giant step into the
limelight on the convention's opening night by alluding to
presidential character _ an issue that regularly registers as a
high priority in public opinion surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him through big legislative successes and a few
defeats,'' Laura Bush said. In a reference to her husband's former
ownership of the Texas Rangers baseball team, she said: ''I sat by
his side during some winning and many losing baseball seasons. But
George never loses sight of home plate.``
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush's remarks were a veiled slap at her husband's
Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, whose critics say
waffles on issues. It also is a jab at President Clinton, whose
presidency has been marked by similar accusations, as well as the
Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's ``core principles will not change with the winds
of polls or politics or fame or fortune or misfortune,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing strong applause, Bush recalled supporters saying they
want their children ``to respect the president of the United States
of American.''
</P>
<P>
   Focusing largely on education, Bush said she and her husband had
tried to impart to their twin daughters the lessons their parents
had taught them, that ``reading is entertaining and interesting and
important. '' Her husband is running for president ``to make sure
every child in America has that same opportunity to grow up
reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking on were the Bush's daughters, Jenna and Barbara; Laura
Bush's mother, Jenna; and former President George Bush and his wife
Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's theme at the GOP convention, ``Opportunity With a
Purpose: Leave No Child Behind,'' was an effort to flesh out Bush's
campaign mantra of ``compassionate conservatism'' by showcasing
speakers focused on improving education and conditions for young
people. Colin Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
spoke about volunteer service.
</P>
<P>
   The convention platform is Laura Bush's biggest stage by far.
She agreed to marry Bush in 1977 on condition that she would never
have to deliver a political speech on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only political promise I ever broke,'' the governor
has told innumerable campaign crowds over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   For Laura Welch Bush, it has been something of a long, strange
trip between the tumbleweed plains of Midland, Texas, where she
cruised Agnes' drive-in for hamburgers, to potential first lady
whose family life is publicly picked over in sometimes excruciating
detail.
</P>
<P>
   In between, there were stops in Houston and Austin as a teacher
and librarian. And there was the barbecue in 1977 where she met
Bush, an encounter she had actually resisted because she did not
think she would have anything in common with someone from a
political family.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes were married in November 1977 when Laura Bush was 31.
</P>
<P>
   Ambition, power and fame are not qualities to which Laura Bush
aspired. Monday night she described herself as being ``a little bit
overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, on the campaign trail, she has grown into the role of
high-profile political spouse. She has stumped on her own, talking
about education. On the campaign plane when she is traveling with
the candidate, Laura Bush is relaxed and informal up to a point,
reminding some reporters of helpful librarians.
</P>
<P>
   Don Evans, a longtime family friend who serves as Bush's
campaign manager, described Laura Bush as ``a lady who's full of
grace'' and ``somebody America will love.''
</P>
<P>
   Has there been a campaign-trail learning curve for her? ``Well,
there is for everybody,'' Evans responded. ``But I guarantee you,
she's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, 53, was the only child of a Harold Welch, a home
builder, and Jenna Welch, who did bookkeeping for him and read
books to Laura aloud.
</P>
<P>
   She knew her future husband just barely in junior high school
before the Bushes moved from Midland to Houston and Bush was sent
to boarding school in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   About the only blip on the screen of her life is when at the age
of 17, she ran a stop sign in Midland. Her car collided with a
vehicle driven by another teen-ager, a boy she knew. He was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was painful, of course,'' she told one interviewer. It
was ``a very tragic time in my life.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush graduated from Southern Methodist University in Dallas in
1968. Like her future husband at Yale, the social turmoil and
experimentation of the 1960s passed her by.
</P>
<P>
   She spent the first part of the 1970s as an elementary school
teacher and librarian in Houston and Austin, earning a master's
degree in library science at the Austin campus of the University of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching in a predominantly minority school in Houston and not
marrying until after age 30 shows she was ``in many ways very
contemporary,'' she once told one interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the Bushes are a classic odd couple. He is at times
a garrulous jokester who bounces off the walls; she is mostly quiet
and demure. But by all accounts, Laura Bush has been the yin to her
husband's yang.
</P>
<P>
   She has a calming effect on him and years ago helped him quit
drinking before it became a problem. But she acknowledges that he,
in turn, adds a few thrills to her life that she might not
otherwise have expected.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was not wild about the idea of her husband running for
governor of Texas in 1994. And earlier this year she told the
Associated Press, ``I was the last person on board'' when the
governor was weighing a White House bid.
</P>
<P>
   But if her service as first lady of Texas is any indication,
Bush may well warm to the role of national first lady should her
husband vanquish Gore. From the governor's mansion, Laura Bush has
raised money and lobbied fiercely for Texas libraries and programs
to teach reading to pre-school children.
</P>
<P>
   The education theme of Monday night's speech drew polite sniffs
from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaigns are asking the spouses to do different things,''
said Joseph Andrew, chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
who as at the Republican National Convention at the behest of
various media organizations. Gore's wife ``Tipper speaks out on
substantive issues'' such as mental health, Andrew said. ``With
Laura Bush, the (Republican) campaign has asked her to talk
non-specific generalities because they can't talk about the issues
or the record ... Texas is one of the worst places to raise
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Andew was referring to studies showing Texas ranking at the
bottom of various social indicators. In one such study earlier this
year by the nonpartisan, Baltimore-based Annie E. Casey Foundation,
Texas ranked 44th among 50 states in rates of child poverty.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Republican Party put on a newly moderate and
disciplined face at the opening of its national convention Monday
night as one of the party's most compelling figures, retired Gen.
Colin L. Powell, challenged delegates to rally behind Gov. George
W. Bush with a genuine commitment to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, put
aside the reference to abortion rights that roiled the convention
four years ago and instead stressed the need for inclusiveness, a
matter that also worries party officials but is considered to be
slightly less divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party must follow Governor Bush's lead and reach out to
minority communities and particularly the African-American
community _ and not just during an election-year campaign,'' Powell
said pointedly in his remarks prepared for delivery to the
convention. ``It must be a sustained effort. It must be every day.
It must be for real.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not spare the party for its record on affirmative action,
saying, ``Some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly and
loudly condemn affirmative action that helped a few thousand black
kids get an education.'' But, he added, ``hardly a whimper is heard
from them over affirmative action for lobbyists who load our
federal tax codes with preferences for special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bush appeared before the NAACP earlier this month, Powell
said, it was not mere window dressing. He quoted Bush's declaration
that ``the party of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of
Lincoln.'' And he said he spoke with Bush Monday and that ``he
wants the Republican Party to wear that mantle again. But he knows
that it will take hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   The address by Powell, and a speech by Bush's wife, Laura, about
education and her husband's values, formed the centerpiece Monday
night of a tightly and painstakingly choreographed presentation by
the Bush campaign and by the Republican Party that was aimed far
beyond the First Union Center. It was intended to persuade the
public at large _ particularly women, independents and even
Democrats _ that their rightful place is in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   After the Bush campaign decreed there would be no searing swipes
at Democrats, Mrs. Bush, in describing her husband, confined
herself to an implicit comparison with Bill Clinton and Al Gore,
whom the campaign often portrays as obsessed by bald political
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   ``His core principles will not change with the winds of polls or
politics or fame or fortune or misfortune,'' Mrs. Bush said of her
husband in prepared remarks. ``I know because I've known him
through big legislative successes and a few defeats. I sat by his
side during some winning and many losing baseball sessions. But
George never loses sight of home plate.''
</P>
<P>
   In a testimonial to her husband of 22 years, she went on: ``He
shares credit and doesn't cast blame. He sets a tone that's
positive and constructive, a tone that is very different from the
bitterness and division that too often characterizes Washington,
D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush, a former teacher and librarian, extolled her
husband's commitment to education and literacy. And she said her
husband was devoted to Head Start, a subject upon which the
Republican ticket has become suddenly vulnerable because of votes
cast against it by Dick Cheney, the vice presidential candidate,
when he was a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``As first lady, I will make early childhood development one of
my priorities,'' she said, ``and George will strengthen Head Start
to make sure it's an early reading and early learning program.''
</P>
<P>
   While George W. Bush was still wending his way eastward to
Philadelphia as part of a six-day tour of swing states, he
dominated the convention Monday. In a play on his nickname _ and an
appeal to women _ the letter ``W'' was emblazoned big and red on
signs throughout the arena. Underneath, in smaller letters, were
the words, ``Stands for women.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Powell were perhaps most striking not only for
what he said but for what he did not say. When he addressed the
Republican convention on the first night in San Diego four years
ago, he also spoke of compassion and people in need. But in that
speech, he dropped in a line that many delegates did not want to
hear: He reminded them of his support for abortion rights and said
that he had been invited to San Diego because the party wanted to
air divergent views.
</P>
<P>
   There was no such reference to abortion _ or talk of dissent _
in the prepared remarks Monday night. People close to Powell
insisted they were not pressured into excising any reference; they
said the general felt it simply did not fit the theme of the night:
``Opportunity With a Purpose. Leave No Child Behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials view Powell as a powerful ally because
he is a popular national figure who exudes tolerance and inclusion.
To make the most of Powell's support, Bush has repeatedly dropped
hints that he would name him to a high-level Cabinet post, like
secretary of state _ and Powell has only encouraged the
speculation. Powell had brushed aside Bush's initial overtures
about his joining the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort by Powell to avoid saying anything that could
stoke unrest among the approximately 22,000 people who crammed into
the hall _ including 2,066 delegates and 2,066 alternates _
underscored the degree to which Republicans are united behind Bush
in their determination to win back the White House. The program ran
with such tight-fistedness that at one point it was 20 minutes
ahead of the minute-by-minute schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Powell focused on Bush's accomplishments in
Texas; he stressed the ``compassion'' in the governor's
``compassionate conservative'' slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Texas, Governor Bush has reached out to all Texans _
white, black, Latino, Asian, native American,'' he said. ``He has
been successful in bringing more and more minorities into the tent
by responding to their deepest needs. Some call it compassionate
conservatism. To me, it's just about caring for people.''
</P>
<P>
   The 37th Republican convention opened when Erik Weihenmayer, a
blind mountain climber, led the delegates in the Pledge of
Allegiance. Throughout the day, a parade of women, blacks, Latinos
and recovered Democrats marched to the rostrum in a show that more
resembled an Up With People jamboree than a hard-driving,
calculated effort to retake the White House. Despite the
understated references to the current administration, the words
Clinton, abortion and impeachment appeared to have been banished
from the scripts Monday. Even Newt Gingrich was far removed from
the action; his role Monday night was as a commentator for Fox
News.
</P>
<P>
   That left the millions tuning in on television with a buffed
view of the Republican Party _ and Bush _ that was far more
moderate than the delegates in the hall who voted Monday for a
platform that hewed to some fiercely conservative tenets, like the
party's call for a ban on abortion. With the usual internecine
maneuvering largely absent, and Cheney already selected as the
running mate, there was little suspense. That was reflected in the
lack of enthusiasm in a roll call to make Bush's nomination
official _ the party's first three-day rolling roll call _ that
drew only the most perfunctory rounds of cheers by delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, said he did not believe
there was a contradiction between the moderate, inclusive message
and the fact that polls of the delegates show that they are notably
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a gap between what Republicans believe
and what their candidate does,'' said Rove, in an interview on
``Political Points,'' the New York Times/ABC News webcast.
``Otherwise, they wouldn't have nominated him. And let me correct.
You said inclusive and moderate. What we're saying is it's
inclusive and compassionately conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the stage-managing, convention organizers had an
easy job because delegate after delegate said the party had not
been so unified since 1984, when Ronald Reagan cruised to a second
term. On the opening night of that convention, in Detroit,
Republicans bashed Walter F. Mondale relentlessly. But Monday
night, party officials expressed such confidence with Bush's
positioning that they said they felt they could go easy on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine a convention that could be more
unified,'' Butch Davis, a delegate from Houston, said.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that the party held its 37th convention here
this week, the first Republican gathering in Philadelphia since
Thomes E. Dewey won the nomination in 1948. The party this year was
determined to underscore its commitment to a state that is not
reliably Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the effort to portray Bush as a leader who could
work across party lines, his name was placed in nomination by his
lieutenant governor, Rick Perry. Perry told reporters that Bush
helped persuade him to defect from the Democratic to the Republican
party more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I proudly place the name of the current governor of the great
state of Texas and the next president of the United States into
nomination, George W. Bush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking from tradition, the Republicans abandoned their
traditional one-night roll calls of states _ which officials said
has become too interminable for a single sitting of prime time
television _ and Monday night began a rolling state-by-state tally
that will be spread over three nights. The party was careful to
juggle which states cast its votes so that Bush would not be
officially nominated before Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   When the roll call came to Arizona, the spokeswoman for the
delegation was not that state's senior senator, John McCain, Bush's
most ardent foe in the primaries, but his wife, Cindy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father and mother strode into the hall at 8:40 p.m. Their
arrival was not announced. But as delegates began catching sight of
these most famous of Republicans, they rose to their feet and a
swell of applause came from the floor. When they were formally
announced moments later, they were greeted with a 30-second
standing ovation and chants of ``Bush! Bush! Bush!''

   (UNDATED) _ ``A prophet is not without honor, save in his own
country and his own house.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, perhaps, Israel will make the concessions that Shimon
Peres has tirelessly advocated to secure a lasting settlement with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, after his unexpected, humiliating rejection by the
Knesset as his country's new president, those words from St.
Matthew's Gospel sounded like history's judgment on the Israeli
politician who was prepared to go further than any other for peace
with the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Shimon Peres, it has been said, was born to suffer. He was the
Labor party prime minister of Israel three times, but never
following victory in his own right. Five times he failed to win an
election, most recently in 1996 when he was narrowly defeated by
the unlamented Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Many a time he has made a comeback, but this setback will surely
prove terminal to a political career that predates the very
existence of the state of Israel. Peres is now 76.
</P>
<P>
   His conqueror was not a political lion like himself, but Moshe
Katsav, a notably uncharismatic member of the opposition Likud
party, and certainly no Chaim Herzog or Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this personal disaster are complex. To a degree,
undoubtedly, they lie in the treacherous eddies of Israeli
politics, and the perceived shortcomings of a man who was never
quite trusted by his countrymen, and who lacked the military
credentials of the former and present Labor prime ministers,
Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary Israelis shared Rabin's early judgment that he was
an ``indefatigable schemer.'' Barak, too, was not much enamored of
him _ making slightly less than convincing his own denial of
charges that he did not privately urge his own supporters to use
the secrecy of the ballot box to vote against Peres.
</P>
<P>
   If that were all, the downfall of Peres would be merely another
cautionary tale for ambitious politicians anywhere. But it is more;
it is a depressing commentary on the prospects for peace after the
collapse of the Camp David summit last week.
</P>
<P>
   If elected president, Peres would surely have used that largely
ceremonial office to keep up the pressure for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   His defeat, taken together with Barak's narrow survival of a
no-confidence motion Monday, is a further sign of a hardening
political consensus that the prime minister has been too generous
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Monday could prove a repudiation not just of Shimon Peres the
man but of an unheeded prophet's entire vision of a ``New Middle
East.'' &QL;

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ So, we are all here at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia. Delegates from across America in
boaters and baseball caps, stetsons and straw hats, some with blue
rinses and some with body piercings, have travelled here.
</P>
<P>
   Perky young women in clompy shoes from Internet news services
and grizzled old veterans with drinking problems from gritty
Midwestern morning papers, celebrity news anchors and even John
Lydon, the former Sex Pistol, have come here to tell the world (or
that section which is interested) about the goings-on.
</P>
<P>
   But what is important, it is made clear roughly every ten
minutes or so, is that we are here ``together.''
</P>
<P>
   It is up there in huge letters inside the stadium where the
delegates are gathered: Renewing America's Purpose, Together.
</P>
<P>
   The last word has a vivid streak of red paint underneath it so
we don't miss it. Sometimes, there is a comma in the slogan, and
sometimes a full stop.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics of a convention are important and nothing is left
to chance, so every visual element has been carefully coordinated.
The podium is not some vast towering Nuremberg-style affair; there
are steps leading up to it from the convention floor. They are
probably called the Steps Of Opportunity to the Podium Of
Achievement, or some such.
</P>
<P>
   At previous conventions, the speakers were in huge towers,
looming over the convention floor. Not this time; this is the City
of Brotherly Love and the Party of Together.
</P>
<P>
   The color blue is everywhere; but it is not the dark, masculine
Oxford Blue of previous conventions. Instead it is a warmer color,
the kind of thing you might use to decorate a child's bedroom. The
team from Changing Rooms has been in.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers have been chosen to complement this. So Monday
morning we had James Rogan, a Californian congressman who is very
likely to lose his seat in the November election because he was one
of the men who managed President Bill Clinton's impeachment last
year, and his constituents are inordinately fond of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan didn't talk about that; he told us about his mother for
fifteen seconds, instead. Then Joan Johnson, a black Republican
from New York state, came to chat. She was swiftly followed by a
slightly limp man who wanted us all to know about farmland
preservation in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   They were all ``together.''
</P>
<P>
   The decor really matters. In the few seconds which most
Americans will watch of all this, they will get an instant
impression of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a Republican Party speaking from the high ground, or are
they chatting away in a ``national conversation?'' It has to be the
latter. Is the color scheme dark, clubby, WASPy and masculine?
Won't vote for them, then.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers come and go against a light-blue background the
color of sky, as well as some nice ferns or plants which make the
whole thing look as it might have been shot outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Well, in a hotel atrium, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Around lunchtime, just in case we had not got the message, there
was a band playing soul and R'n'B classics. There was a black woman
pastor presiding; a large black lady danced with lots of
ill-coordinated white people in button-down shirts.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that this week, we are going to ``get down,''
whether we like it or not. And more importantly, we are going to do
it ``together.'' &QL;

   PHILADELPHIA _ So, we are all here at the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia. Delegates from across America in
boaters and baseball caps, stetsons and straw hats, some with blue
rinses and some with body piercings, have travelled here.
</P>
<P>
   Perky young women in clompy shoes from Internet news services
and grizzled old veterans with drinking problems from gritty
Midwestern morning papers, celebrity news anchors and even John
Lydon, the former Sex Pistol, have come here to tell the world (or
that section which is interested) about the goings-on.
</P>
<P>
   But what is important, it is made clear roughly every ten
minutes or so, is that we are here ``together.''
</P>
<P>
   It is up there in huge letters inside the stadium where the
delegates are gathered: Renewing America's Purpose, Together.
</P>
<P>
   The last word has a vivid streak of red paint underneath it so
we don't miss it. Sometimes, there is a comma in the slogan, and
sometimes a full stop.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics of a convention are important and nothing is left
to chance, so every visual element has been carefully coordinated.
The podium is not some vast towering Nuremberg-style affair; there
are steps leading up to it from the convention floor. They are
probably called the Steps Of Opportunity to the Podium Of
Achievement, or some such.
</P>
<P>
   At previous conventions, the speakers were in huge towers,
looming over the convention floor. Not this time; this is the City
of Brotherly Love and the Party of Together.
</P>
<P>
   The color blue is everywhere; but it is not the dark, masculine
Oxford Blue of previous conventions. Instead it is a warmer color,
the kind of thing you might use to decorate a child's bedroom. The
team from Changing Rooms has been in.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers have been chosen to complement this. So Monday
morning we had James Rogan, a Californian congressman who is very
likely to lose his seat in the November election because he was one
of the men who managed President Bill Clinton's impeachment last
year, and his constituents are inordinately fond of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan didn't talk about that; he told us about his mother for
fifteen seconds, instead. Then Joan Johnson, a black Republican
from New York state, came to chat. She was swiftly followed by a
slightly limp man who wanted us all to know about farmland
preservation in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   They were all ``together.''
</P>
<P>
   The decor really matters. In the few seconds which most
Americans will watch of all this, they will get an instant
impression of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a Republican Party speaking from the high ground, or are
they chatting away in a ``national conversation?'' It has to be the
latter. Is the color scheme dark, clubby, WASPy and masculine?
Won't vote for them, then.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers come and go against a light-blue background the
color of sky, as well as some nice ferns or plants which make the
whole thing look as it might have been shot outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Well, in a hotel atrium, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Around lunchtime, just in case we had not got the message, there
was a band playing soul and R'n'B classics. There was a black woman
pastor presiding; a large black lady danced with lots of
ill-coordinated white people in button-down shirts.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that this week, we are going to ``get down,''
whether we like it or not. And more importantly, we are going to do
it ``together.'' &QL;

ISRAEL'S NEW PRESIDENT KNOWN FROM PARLIAMENT AS `TOLERANT AND
POLITE' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Moshe Katsav, Israel's new president, is a modest,
soft-spoken man who was the country's youngest mayor at 24, and has
since soldiered loyally in the right-wing Likud's political
trenches.
</P>
<P>
   Katsav, 55, was first elected to Parliament in 1977 in Menachem
Begin's landslide and was referred to as ``the tolerant and
polite'' legislator, a certain distinction in the often rancorous
body.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon, is said to have chosen
him as a candidate for the largely ceremonial post because he had
so few enemies. But until the stunning vote in Parliament Monday,
not a single political pundit gave him a chance against Shimon
Peres, a Nobel laureate who was twice prime minister, although
never by election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to compete with someone like Shimon Peres,''
Katsav mused in a pre-election interview with The Jerusalem Post,
whose reporter found him ``remarkably normal.'' It was the kind of
regular-guy image he cultivated in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important for Israel's domestic politics, he is a
Sephardic Jew _ that is, a Jew of Middle Eastern origin _ a native
of Yazd, in central Iran, who came to Israel in 1951 at the age of
5. The eldest of 10 children, he grew up in a tent camp named
Qiryat Malachi, which became a working-class ``development city.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, when Katsav was 24, the camp's voters elected him
mayor. He had by then studied economics and history at Hebrew
University _ the first student from the town to attend university _
and worked briefly as a reporter for the newspaper Yediot Ahronot.
He still lives in Qiryat Malachi with his wife and five children.
</P>
<P>
   Katsav's military service, often a crucial social and political
distinction here, was similarly modest. In contrast to the war
heroes, fighter-pilots, paratroopers and commandos who normally
populate the upper reaches of Israeli politics, he was an ordinary
soldier, serving as a tank loader and a radio operator. He once sat
in jail for a week for refusing a command he thought was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   His strong religious connections undoubtedly helped him, winning
the key votes of the 17-member Shas Party of ultra-Orthodox
Sephardim. On Sunday, one of the Shas spiritual leaders, Rabbi
Yitzhak Kadouri, said he had had a vision that Katsav was favored
by the heavens. As a result, aides to Kadouri called legislators to
urge Katsav's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to contribute to the reduction of tensions within our
society, and I will be the representative of all classes,'' Katsav
said after his election. ``I call on Arabs of Israel, the religious
and secular, Sephardic and Ashkenazic, to see me as their
representative, their president.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Grey men and women are rare in the exotic hothouse
of Israeli politics, but Moshe Katzav, the country's new president,
is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   There are no highlights in his 23-year parliamentary career to
come close to the record of the rugged old political warrior upon
whom he inflicted an astonishing defeat, the Nobel Peace Prize
laureate and former Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the reasons for Katzav's victory is that he is a
Sephardi Jew. The Sephardim _ from North Africa and the Middle East
_ form the bulk of Israel's underprivileged class, and who have
long resented the dominance of the Ashkenazi (European) elite.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, they form the core support of the ultra-Orthodox Shas
party, whose 17 votes played a large part in allowing Katzav to
snatch victory from a confident Peres, stunning all of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Katzav was born in Iran in 1945, moving to Israel at the age of
six where he spent part of his childhood in an immigrants' transit
camp before moving to a troubled new town.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has had a Sephardic president before _ Yitzak Navon _ and
there are a clutch of Sephardis in high places. But few have had
such modest backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   His political career began when he was elected mayor of Kiryat
Malachi, an unappealing town 20 miles north of the Gaza Strip, at
the age of only 24.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only splash of color in his curriculum vitae. The
rest _ economist, educator, military service as a lowly corporal in
the communications _ is without the glamor or controversy of the
76-year-old Peres.
</P>
<P>
   Peres' career is part of the fabric of Israel's 52-year history.
He was a Jewish guerrilla fighter, a leading figure in Israel's
nuclear program, thrice prime minister, signatory of the 1993 Oslo
accord, Labor stalwart, five-time election loser, and more besides.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Katsav, 55, is a minnow. In 1977, he was elected to
the Knesset for the right-wing Likud party, rising to become a
senior figure.
</P>
<P>
   He held a number of second-rank cabinet posts _ transport,
tourism, labor and social welfare _ and was a deputy prime minister
in the Benjamin Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
   His name translates as ``butcher,'' but his reputation is of a
mild-mannered man, who has _ unlike Peres _ avoided making enemies.
</P>
<P>
   He is also an observant Jew, which will have helped win
ultra-Orthodox support, despite Peres's good ties with Shas.
</P>
<P>
   The post of president in Israel is largely ceremonial. But
Katzav's triumph, winning 63-57 in a Knesset secret ballot, will go
down in history as a triumph for Sephardis, often the victims of
discrimination, and as another bad defeat for Barak and his peace
plans.
</P>
<P>
   It will be remembered, too, as the moment that the curtain
dropped on Shimon Peres' 41-year career in politics. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Two longtime executives at 20th Century Fox were
named Monday to share the job of running the movie studio,
succeeding Bill Mechanic, who resigned in June.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gianopulos, who has been president of the studio's
international distribution division since 1994, will join Tom
Rothman, the president of the 20th Century Fox Film Group and a
longtime production executive, as co-chairmen of the movie studio,
said Peter Chernin, president of the News Corp., the studio's
parent company.
</P>
<P>
   ``These jobs are so big and so complicated right now that having
two people to share it is good for both of them,'' Chernin said.
``I did a lot of work, both inside the company and around town,
looking to fill this position and what I finally came to feel was
that I have not just one but two extraordinary individuals right
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothman and Gianopulos said Monday that while their studio
careers had differed in emphasis _ Rothman has more of a creative
and production background and Gianopulos more a concentration in
distribution and the business side _ they intended to fully share
the duties of running the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Jim and I are as optimistic as we are is that we
are a neat fit in that way,'' Rothman said. ``We're both long in
the tooth in this business and between us have covered all aspects
of it, but to be honest, we do have more intensive experience in
different areas.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the two executives will not be rigid about dividing up
the duties, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will work together on the big decisions and share in each
other's areas as much as we can,'' Rothman said. ``But there will
be that primacy in the areas that we each have our respective
expertise in. The idea is for this to be very much of a
partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Mechanic, a widely respected and well-liked
executive, caught much of Hollywood by surprise in June.
</P>
<P>
   The studio had been having a sour run at the box office, from
last fall's ``Fight Club'' to ``Anna and the King'' to this
summer's animated ``Titan A.E.'' But the resignation came right
after the unexpected box office success of ``Big Momma's House''
and just before the release of ``Me, Myself and Irene'' and
``X-Men,'' which both did well.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman said he expected no significant changes. A look at the
movies the studio has released this summer is a good indication of
the kinds of films the two executives intend to release in the
future. He pointed, in particular, to alliances the studio had made
with filmmakers like George Lucas, James Cameron, Robert Zemeckis
and Tim Burton.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, I think originality is the keyword,'' Rothman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And diversity,'' Gianopulos added.
</P>
<P>
   The studio, they said, will continue to shy away from selling
international distribution rights to foreign companies, as many
studios do, and may even buy more foreign distribution rights to
films produced by other studios _ perhaps even DreamWorks, whose
international distribution deal with Universal Pictures is about to
expire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two core agendas of our parent company are the hunger for
content and the ability to distribute it in many different ways on
many different platforms, and an international emphasis in
general,'' Gianopulos said. ``This creates for us a global
perspective, and those continue to be our core strategies.''

DEMOCRAT'S EXIT A RELIEF FOR NEW JERSEY REPUBLICANS
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHERRY HILL, N.J. _ New Jersey Republicans attending their
national convention in Philadelphia on Monday were so stunned by
Sen. Robert Torricelli's sudden withdrawal from the Democratic race
for governor that they seemed not to know whether to celebrate or
lament his exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to Mass yesterday morning really helped,'' joked Donald
T. DiFrancesco, the president of the State Senate and a contender
for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, who had widely been
seen as the underdog in a contest with Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   But DiFrancesco quickly added that James McGreevey could prove
no less formidable an opponent.After McGreevey was endorsed Monday
by the mayor of Newark, Sharpe James, and other officials,
Torricelli bowed out.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco called McGreevey a ``tough candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He almost beat Christie Whitman, he's been campaigning every
day for four years _ he says that openly _ he's got labor support,
he's got African-American support, he's got cities, he's got Sharpe
James,'' DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats' rallying around Jim McGreevey is not good for
Republicans,'' he added. ``I'd rather see them fighting _
fisticuffs, punching, scream, bite, yell, curse.''
</P>
<P>
   If Torricelli's monthlong candidacy had divided New Jersey
Democrats, it had distracted Republicans as well, overshadowing
Rep. Robert D. Franks' uphill run for the U.S. Senate and giving
party leaders reason to think twice about their field of potential
gubernatorial candidates for next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Besides DiFrancesco, of Union County, the leading Republican
contenders are Jack Collins, the Assembly speaker, who is from
rural Salem County at the southern end of the state, and Bret
Schundler, the mayor of Jersey City. None has the statewide name
recognition that Torricelli enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, some Republicans were even promoting the idea of
enticing former Gov. Thomas Kean to make another run _ a notion
Kean did nothing to discourage _ as if only a popular former
governor had the electoral heft to trump a Torricelli candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There did seem to be that juggernaut feeling coming at
people,'' said Robert Stears, a Republican lobbyist attending a
fund-raiser Monday night in Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, the fund-raiser's beneficiary, said, ``The 800-pound
gorilla is back in his cage.''
</P>
<P>
   He had his own reasons to exult, of course. With little chance
of matching the advertising budget of his Democratic opponent in
the Senate race, the multimillionaire Jon S. Corzine, Franks is
almost wholly dependent on journalists for publicity, and the
Senate race was essentially ignored during the commotion
surrounding the Torricelli-McGreevey matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted that the New Jersey media will now be available
to spend more time with the Senate campaign,'' Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans suggested that while Torricelli's departure
would cement McGreevey's status as the presumptive nominee, it
would also deepen the fissures among New Jersey Democrats. They
noted that the rebellious faction of South Jersey Democrats led by
George E. Norcross III of Camden County had promoted Torricelli's
gubernatorial bid to compete with McGreevey's supporters in the
central and northern parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Torricelli's pulling out only makes the rift even worse,''
said Gregg Edwards, DiFrancesco's top aide in the Senate. ``Some of
these folks, particularly George Norcross, will be very bitter
people. They'll just look for one more fight to get into.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, the Assembly speaker, emerged Monday from his hotel
room here, where the New Jersey Republican delegation is staying,
and broke into a broad smile when he was told that Torricelli had
quit the race without endorsing McGreevey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the man who will be the senior senator from New Jersey,
and the assumed leader of the Democratic Party, and he's not for
Jim McGreevey?'' Collins said. ``How can anything be better for
Republicans?''

PEARSON MAKES BID FOR NATIONAL COMPUTER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., D.C., Britain)  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pearson PLC, which has been on an acquisition tear over the last
two years, said Monday that it was buying National Computer Systems
Inc. for $2.5 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of National Computer, the largest scorer of student
assessment tests in the United States, is part of Pearson's
expansion into educational publishing. National Computer had a
profit of $43 million for the fiscal year ended Jan. 29 on sales of
$630 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson, which also owns The Financial Times, already has
extensive education holdings, the centerpiece of which is the
textbook publisher Simon &AMP; Schuster. The addition of National
Computer would allow the company to offer a package of services
permitting schools and parents to monitor the performance of
students and organize remedial work for home and classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said Monday that while they supported efforts
by Pearson's chief executive, Marjorie Scardino, to expand the
company's role in textbook and educational publishing, they were
concerned about the structure of the deal. It offers existing
stockholders the right to buy some additional shares at about half
their value based on Friday's closing price.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson is paying $73 a share in cash, a 26 percent premium to
National Computer's closing price on Friday. Monday, National
Computer rose $13.75, to $71.875. Pearson is raising $2.56 billion
through a rights offering that allows shareholders to buy three new
shares of Pearson at 10 pounds, or about $15 each, for every 11
shares they already own. Shares of Pearson closed on Friday at
20.10 pounds, or $30.13.
</P>
<P>
   The American depository receipts of Pearson were unchanged
Monday at $31.50. Pearson has 625 million ADR's outstanding, and
the company has filed to issue additional shares, which it expects
to list on the New York Stock Exchange within the next several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts and investors were not happy with the strategy of
issuing new stock at a discount to complete the purchase. Shares of
Pearson fell 9 percent, to 18.28 pounds, or $27.40, in London
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that the stock strategy would make the
acquisition price lower because it would reduce investment banking
fees. It would also reduce the amount of additional debt Pearson
would have to take on, and the company acknowledged Monday that it
was not eager to increase its debt load.
</P>
<P>
   One industry executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said he found the price Pearson was paying _ roughly four times
sales _ a high one. A spokesman for Scardino said she was not
returning phone calls because the company was in a quiet period
associated with its pending stock registration in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the rush to expand in educational publishing and
information is increasing demand as more students enter U.S.
schools. At the same time, schools are investing more in textbooks,
in part because of swelling state coffers and in part because of
the public demand for better education. For example, California
will invest $1 billion over the next four years on education, said
Ed Atorino, who follows publishing for Wasserstein Perella.
</P>
<P>
   ``On top of that there is a technology play,'' he said.
``Schools are not only spending on textbooks, they are spending on
software and CD-ROMs. It started in high school, but it is working
its way down.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearson is not the only company determined to expand in
educational publishing. In late June, the Washington Post Co.
announced that it would buy the Quest Education Corp. for $165
million. Quest provides career-oriented education to more than
13,400 students.  &QL;

BUSH CAMP OUTLINES POST-CONVENTION TRAVEL PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush will head for the West
Coast next week as the Republican presidential nominee, with stops
in California and possibly the Northwest designed to take the GOP
campaign into Vice President Al Gore's must-win states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are as many electoral votes (18) in Washington and
Oregon as there are in Michigan,'' Karl Rove, Bush's chief
political strategist, said Monday in discussing Bush's
post-convention travel schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the 1992 playbook of Bill Clinton, who took a bus
trip through the Ohio Valley and then flew West to Spokane and
Seattle after the Democratic convention, Bush will barnstorm the
industrial Midwest after he accepts the Republican nomination here
Thursday night. He then will take a brief respite in Texas after
which he will head West.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said Bush's campaign has lately spent $400,000 on
television ads in Washington. Calling Washington a ``battleground
state,'' at least for now, he added: ``We spend money where we
think it will do us good, not where it will make them worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
scoffed at Bush's advertising buys in a state that has voted for
Democrats in the past three presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have money to place TV (ads) even in places they have no
chance of winning, but want to create the impression that they
do,'' Andrew said in an interview here. ``I think in the end
(Washington) is a state we are going to win and win big. We're on
the air there, and taking nothing for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush already has made five visits to Washington in the past
year, an investment of time that has paid handsome dividends. The
Texas governor scored an impressive win over Arizona Sen. John
McCain in the state's Feb. 29 primary. He raised more than $1
million for his own and Republican Party campaign coffers during a
night of fund-raisers at Seattle's Columbia Tower Club in May.
</P>
<P>
   With unusual candor for a campaign strategist, Rove on Monday
talked about how the Bush campaign is allocating its dollars and
how it is targeting states in the Nov. 7 election.
</P>
<P>
   Washington ``may or may not'' continue to enjoy high priority
with the Bush campaign, Rove said, depending on whether Bush
continues to lead in the polls and on the amount of energy and
fund-raising prowess shown by the state Republican Party. (Bush was
running four points ahead of Gore in a recent statewide poll taken
by the Mellman Group, a Democratic pollster working for Democratic
Senate hopeful Maria Cantwell.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a specific plan for each state,'' Rove added. A key
requirement, he said, is ``an active, energetic home-grown victory
committee in the state.'' Rove said he met with newly elected GOP
State Chairman Don Benton before the Republican National Convention
got under way, and asked: ``Are you holding up your end?''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Williams, chief of staff to GOP Sen. Slade Gorton, said
later: ``We have dramatically increased the state party budget to
reflect the presidential campaign, on the order of 75 percent.'' He
declined to give a specific dollar figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need them and they need us,'' Williams said. ``We know we
have to raise a lot of money in the state, and they are excited
about the prospect of winning a state that has gone Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut tells me Washington state remains on the battleground
list (into the fall),'' Rove said. He added that ``one of the
reasons we are doing well on the West Coast'' is that Green Party
presidential candidate Ralph Nader is siphoning off liberal
activists from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, the strategist who has masterminded GOP gubernatorial
victories in Texas for Bush and former Gov. Bill Clements, as well
as Bush's $90 million presidential juggernaut, said the candidate
will join McCain next week at the Arizona senator's Cottonwood,
Ariz., ranch ``for a day of friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Little love was lost between the two contenders early this year,
especially in the South Carolina primary when such Bush-boosting
Christian conservatives as the Revs. Pat Robertson and Jerry
Falwell made personal attacks on McCain.
</P>
<P>
   While not visible at the podium in this year's GOP convention,
Christian conservatives are ``energized'' behind Bush, Rove added.
``The religious conservatives are a big part of the Republican
base,'' he said.

 &HT;    GOP BEGINS CONVENTION AIMED AT REMAKING ITS IMAGE
 &HT;    EDS: A 1stLD will move following Powell's speech.
 &HT;    By KEN HERMAN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ George W. Bush's high-stakes effort to put a new
face on the Grand Old Party went prime time Monday as 4,132
delegates and alternates gathered here for the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Front and center as the makeover began a four-night, nationally
televised run were retired Gen. Colin Powell, Texas First Lady
Laura Bush and a platform custom-tailored for a compassionate
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Powell praised Bush as a man with a ``passion for inclusion''
but criticized the GOP for opposing affirmative action, a position
shared by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush said her husband is the candidate for a country in
search of a leader who reflects ``its heart and its values and its
leadership in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who will accept the nomination here Thursday night, was
scheduled to address delegates late Monday in a remote broadcast
from Ohio, where he was campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday night session at the First Union Center began with an
excerpt from ``Fanfare for the Common Man,'' setting the tone for a
convention aimed at ending the GOP's image as the gentry's party.
Monday's theme was ``Opportunity With a Purpose: Leave No Child
Behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, this is going to be a different kind of convention
for a different kind of Republican,'' Republican National Committee
Chairman Jim Nicholson told delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's session was different. It included Republican
delegates, overwhelmingly white, on their feet and clapping to the
raucous, up-tempo beat of a black church choir.
</P>
<P>
   Different also meant the Pledge of Allegiance delivered by a
blind mountain climber and a long agenda of blacks, Hispanics and
women on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials hope the party platform, approved here
Monday in a voice vote, also documents the difference. The party's
firm opposition to abortion remains in the platform, but delegates
OK'd a more welcoming approach to minorities and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party is more inclusive, more diverse and more
representative of America than ever before, but we're still the
party of limited government,'' Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Spector said
from the arena's massive stage.
</P>
<P>
   The night's tightly scripted and slickly produced program had
one of its few spontaneous moments when delegates spotted former
President George Bush and wife Barbara entering the hall
unannounced to take their seats. The delegates turned to face the
Bushes and applaud their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   A second ovation, longer and louder, roared through the building
when the former first family was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who served as chief of staff under the elder Bush,
touted his ex-boss' son as the right man to head a renewed effort
for racial harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some call it compassionate conservatism. It's just about
caring for people,'' Powell said in remarks prepared for delivery
in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In pursuing educational reform, as well as in all other parts
of his agenda for Texas, Governor Bush has reached out to all
Texans _ white, black, Latino, Asian, Native American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been successful in bringing more and more minorities
inside the tent by responding to their deepest needs,'' Powell
added. ``He will bring to the White House that same passion of
inclusion. I know he can help bridge our racial divides.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell urged the GOP to follow Bush's lead and reach out to
minorities ``and not just during an election year campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Powell drew boos at the Republican National
Convention in San Diego when he declared his support for abortion
rights and affirmative action, two issues on which he differs with
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention abortion Monday night, but hit hard on
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must understand the cynicism that exists in the black
community. The kind of cynicism that is created when, for example,
some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly and loudly condemn
affirmative action that helped a few thousand black kids get an
education, but hardly a whimper is heard from them over affirmative
action for lobbyists who load our federal tax codes with
preferences for special interests,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, who has campaigned around the country by herself and
with her husband, used her speech to boost the Republicans'
ambitious effort to co-opt education as their issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to teach our children what our parents had taught
us,'' she said in remarks prepared for delivery, ``that reading is
entertaining and interesting and important. And one of the major
reasons George is running for president is to make sure every child
in America has that same opportunity to grow up reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Low-key by nature and reluctant to see her husband run for
president, Mrs. Bush has grown into a full-time campaign trail
partner. The Monday night speech marked her biggest step into the
spotlight. For years, her husband has joked that when he married
Laura Welch, a former librarian and teacher, her idea of a speech
was ``Sssh.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stopped using the line after his wife objected to its
stereotypical nature. But Bush continues to remind audiences that
when he proposed to his future wife in 1977 he promised she'd never
have to give a political speech. Months later, she was giving stump
speeches for her husband in his unsuccessful congressional race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only political promise I ever broke,'' Bush tells
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the GOP broke from convention by beginning the
process of nominating Bush on opening night. Instead of having all
states vote on the third night, an alphabetical

 &HT;    Miller at ease in debut on Monday Night Football
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - During the course of his debut on ABC's ''Monday Night
Football,'' Dennis Miller acknowledged the pace and collisions of
the game were a lot more unnerving from the booth than from his
couch at home, but the comedian didn't show any signs of stage
fright in the Hall of Fame game between the 49ers and Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the telecast, Miller declared, ''If there's
anybody in the stadium more pumped up than me, they wouldn't pass
the league's standardized drug test.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Miller was too pumped up with a gabby but promising
outing that included a number of eclectic references, most notably
the couple that suggested viewers will have to brush up on their
Greek mythology to keep up with him this season.
</P>
<P>
   The meaningless, one-sided nature of Monday's preseason game was
the ideal format to get a first impression of Miller with
colleagues Al Michaels and Dan Fouts, because producer Don Ohlmeyer
is hoping this new team will be able to retain the audience when
the game itself is not compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer said Miller's role was not to provide stand-up comedy,
but more often than not the telecast seemed to be little more than
a stage for him to display his sharp and irreverent wit.
</P>
<P>
   And though a few fell flat, which should be expected over the
course of three hours, for the most part Miller delivered and
boosted the entertainment value of the telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Even his employer was not spared when Miller quipped of ABC,
''People on `Survivor' have a better per diem than we do. I had to
buy a BLT today with fur pelts.''
</P>
<P>
   It was apparent Monday night that Miller will have to watch
force-feeding the humor into the telecast. Not every promo or
situation warrants a wisecrack.Miller did show flashes of being
able to talk football, noting the nifty feet of Patriots running
back Kevin Faulk and that 49ers backup quarterback Giovanni
Carmazzi looked skittish. But overall, the commentary on the
football will need much more bite to offset the steady stream of
jokes.

HEAT'S RILEY GETS MASON IN DEAL FOR JONES
</HEADLINE>
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the chagrin of the Chicago Bulls, Pat Riley appears to have
gotten his man.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the National Basketball Association free-agent
signing period, the Charlotte Hornets and the Miami Heat were on
the cusp of completing a nine-player trade that included the
Hornets' sending Eddie Jones and Anthony Mason to South Florida for
the Heat's Jamal Mashburn and P.J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, the Heat's coach and team president, has pursued Jones
throughout the off-season. And the trade would not only reunite
Mason with Riley, his former coach with the Knicks, but also give
the Heat Jones, the athletic All-Star shooting guard they
desperately need.
</P>
<P>
   Riley has seen his team eliminated by the Knicks the past three
postseasons. He was hoping to announce the deal as early as
Tuesday, an Eastern Conference team official said on the condition
of anonymity Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The other players involved in the trade were believed to be
Ricky Davis and Dale Ellis of Charlotte and Otis Thorpe, Rodney
Buford and Tim James of Miami. There were still contract details to
be worked out, and it was unclear whether the assortment of role
players would change.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, a Hornets team official said the deal was ``almost
done.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami Monday night, fans on talk shows were wondering whether
Riley had given up too much for Jones. The Heat had to acquire
Mason, the player Riley feuded with and suspended while with the
Knicks, to shore up the deal.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the Heat will pursue a deal for Lakers
small forward Glen Rice while using Mason as trade bait. But
another Eastern Conference team official would not rule out further
trades involving Miami. The Heat did not want to part with Brown,
the consummate role player Riley has often kept out of deals.
</P>
<P>
   The only news the Knicks made Monday was orally agreeing to
terms with Kurt Thomas. Thomas, a free-agent forward, will most
likely sign a multiyear extension with the club in the next two
days, a team official said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, whom the Chicago Bulls coveted, and the rest of the 2000
free-agent class can begin signing contracts Tuesday. In a
sign-and-trade deal, Jones could earn more than $86 million over
seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   While Orlando officially overhauls its roster Tuesday with the
signings of Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady _ two of the top five free
agents _ the Bulls are left with $19 million in salary-cap room and
not a single All-Star left to bid on.
</P>
<P>
   After Tim Thomas spurned the Bulls last month to remain in
Milwaukee, their only hope is to perhaps overpay Ron Mercer or
Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana is going to re-sign Jalen Rose and is working out
contract extensions for Reggie Miller and Mark Jackson.
Philadelphia's Toni Kukoc, Seattle's Rashard Lewis and Houston's
Cuttino Mobley are also expected to sign with their current teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic did well, but missed out on the top prize. Tim Duncan
decided to stay in San Antonio, where he is expected to sign a
three year deal with a fourth year option for more than $45
million.
</P>
<P>
   Before most deals were signed, teams were waiting to hear from
the league office what the adjusted salary cap number would be for
next season. A league official said the salary cap would total
approximately $35.5 million _ meaning a team's aggregate annual
salaries for their 2000-1 players under contract must add up to
that number or less.
</P>
<P>
   First-year players with one to six years of experience can sign
for 25 percent of the total unadjusted salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   While several players were still undecided as to where they
would go, the Miami-Charlotte deal became the buzz of the league
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets were ecstatic to acquire Mashburn and Brown. Faced
with the possibility of losing Jones for nothing if he signed with
another team, the Hornets dramatically altered their lineup as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The only real intrigue left around the league is what is going
to happen to Portland's Brian Grant. Cleveland and the Trail
Blazers have been discussing a swap of Grant for Shawn Kemp, but it
is unclear whether Grant wants to play for the Cavaliers, a key
aspect of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Grant has said he wants to play in New York, and the Trail
Blazers have even mentioned Patrick Ewing's name in discussions
between the teams. But it is doubtful the Knicks will part with
their center for Grant, a power forward. What is more, Ewing has a
no-trade clause, so his approval would be required for any such
deal.

A RANCH IN THE ROCKIES FOR FAMED ARTISTS AND NOVICES  
 ELIZABETH HEILMAN BROOKE   
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SNOWMASS VILLAGE, Colo. _ Sheep dung once was up to the windows
of what artists now call the seminar room. The seminar room's floor
is far from level, and its walls are chinked spruce and fir logs,
remnants of a late-19th-century forest fire. But this summer
William Christenberry, a photographer, used this former sheep shed
to show slides for his course called Interaction of Media:
Photography, Painting and Sculpture
</P>
<P>
   Cattle barns and sheep sheds that until 1966 were the heart of
an active ranch here now draw acclaimed and aspiring artists from
around the world. The Anderson Ranch Arts Center, a
four-and-a-half-acre campus eight miles west of Aspen, is a bucolic
center for potters, photographers, painters, printmakers,
woodworkers, sculptors, art historians and critics. From early June
through late September the studios have more than a thousand
professional and novice artists in workshops of one to two weeks on
topics as basic as Making Stuff in Clay and as lofty as The Meaning
of Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally renowned artists come to learn from one another
and from experts in technologically new fields yet to be fully
explored.
</P>
<P>
   New York has Chautauqua, New Hampshire has the MacDowell Colony,
and North Carolina has the Penland School of Crafts. With its Rocky
Mountain backdrop, its heady 8,200-foot altitude and its proximity
to Aspen, Anderson Ranch has in three decades acquired a reputation
for corralling curious artists in search of creative synergy.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch's course catalog is available in January, and half its
courses were full by mid-March. Most workshops are limited to about
a dozen participants, but because of the extensive pottery
equipment, which include a kiln yard with five gas kilns, a wood
kiln, a Japanese Anagama kiln and several electric kilns, ceramics
workshops can enroll as many as 16.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years Doug Casebeer, a former ceramics consultant to the
United Nations, has directed the ceramics program at the ranch.
Casebeer said that artists generally recognize that their
profession can require a selfish self-absorption, but that Anderson
Ranch is an ``arena where we can all come together, leave the egos
at the door, appreciate that everybody has something to say.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer Paul Soldner, the center's first artistic director,
and a fellow ceramic artist, Peter Voulkos, will again teach A
Lifetime of Clay, a workshop that encourages ``mentorship and an
exchange of ideas.'' Late in July, Ah Leon, a Taiwanese ceramic
artist specializing in Yixing-style teapots and sculpture, will
lead The Language of Tea: Dissecting the Teapot, which the catalog
calls ``a total immersion in the tea experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Most workshops meet from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday,
with a break for lunch. Studios are open 24 hours a day. Tuition
ranges from $250 for a one-week course called Art and Mud: A Course
for Teachers, to $550 for a two-week sculpture class taught by the
sculptor Laura Thorne, to $1,295 for two weeks of John Sexton's lab
intensive photography course.
</P>
<P>
   At the cafe these days, which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner
al fresco and cappuccino and biscotti late into the night, the
Texas sculptor James Surls can often be found sitting beside a
60-year-old lawyer, accountant or business executive who has come
to try a first studio art course.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago at age 67, Lloyd Schermer, then chairman of Lee
Enterprises, a media company, decided to take his first drawing
course. ``Taking a course in art, for Pete's sake. I was
terrified,'' Schermer said. Since then he has taken classes in
watercolor, figure drawing, oil, acrylic, collage and monotype
(single print) and has become an enthusiastic monotype artist.
</P>
<P>
   Relying sometimes on wood type he salvaged from one of his
newspapers in Missoula, Mont., Schermer has painted and sculptured
and sold more than 100 of his works, which are in the collections
of the National Museum of American Art at the Smithsonian
Institution, the Aspen Institute, the Tribune Co. and the Hearst
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Schermer and his wife, Betty, have been donors to the ranch and
served on its board; the meeting hall dedicated in 1999 was named
for them.
</P>
<P>
   In August performers from Jazz Aspen will fill the ranch with
music. In past years B.B. King stopped by for an impromptu
performance. Larry Rivers, the painter, once picked up his
saxophone and surprised students with an unexpected riff.
</P>
<P>
   Artists come from as far away as Nepal, Jamaica and Japan. There
are children's workshops for ages 6 through 15.
</P>
<P>
   Artists can apply for short or long residencies. Past visiting
artists have included the Japanese ceramist Takashi Nakazato, the
performance artist Laurie Anderson and the painters Red Grooms and
Jim Dine.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch, with an annual budget of $2.8 million, has 55,000
square feet of studios and housing and offers as many as 150
scholarships a year. Full-time art students and art teachers are
offered a 50 percent discount on tuition for courses in which space
is available.
</P>
<P>
   Surls, the sculptor, who has been an invited artist in residence
for two years, said that the ranch center had given him ``a
midcareer jump, a new lease on life, a second wind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in the same West of Remington and Russell,'' he
said. ``Today there is an incredibly complex set of references. I
think everybody conjures from his environment. The landscape here
is beautiful. The weather is great. My work has totally opened up.
This terrain change has created a head change.''
</P>
<P>
   James Baker, a photographer and 14-year veteran of the ranch who
has been its executive director for five years, said it offered the
``gift of time and space, an opportunity to blend idealism with
pragmatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker added: ``At a time when our economy is so strong, we've
got everything we want except what we really need. You can see that
yearning. Society needs this type of fulfillment. To be human is to
create, and people need opportunities to create.''

FEDERAL AGENCY INVESTIGATING DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS AT LOS
ALAMOS LABORATORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal civil rights agency is investigating possible
discrimination against Asian and Asian-American employees at the
Los Alamos National Laboratory, said spokesmen for the laboratory
and the University of California, which manages it.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos is the second federal weapons laboratory to be
investigated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for
possible discrimination. Last year, the agency began an
investigation of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory after
claims by nine Asian-American scientists and engineers that they
were subjected to racial bias in pay and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Some Asian and Asian-American scientists at both laboratories
also claim that they have been unfairly singled out as possible
security risks after the arrest of Wen Ho Lee, a former Los Alamos
scientist who has been charged with mishandling nuclear data. Lee
is a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Both laboratories are managed by the university under a contract
with the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Malaspina, a university spokesman, confirmed the
investigation and said both the laboratory and the university would
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, we do not tolerate discrimination or
profiling,'' Malaspina said.
</P>
<P>
   While a commission spokesman would not comment on specific
investigations, he said that in general, legal action could result
if evidence of discrimination is found, and if the institution
being investigated declines to accept the remedies that the
commission proposes.
</P>
<P>
   The legal office at Los Alamos recently sent a memorandum to
about 350 current and former Asian and Asian-American employees of
the laboratory, informing them of the investigation ``alleging
discrimination against Asian and Asian-American employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Roark, a spokesman for Los Alamos, said California law,
which governs the university's operations, required the laboratory
to inform its employees that as part of the investigation the
commission had requested information from their personnel files on
matters like their ethnicity and place of residence.
</P>
<P>
   Roark said that because the commission had not yet revealed the
specific accusations it was investigating, the laboratory could not
comment on the action.

 INS CITED FOR POOR CHECKS ON CITIZENSHIP By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department's inspector general issued a
report Monday detailing the litany of errors committed by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service as it rushed to naturalize 1
million citizens in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's eagerness to shorten its backlog of citizenship
applications in that time led it to naturalize at least 180,000
immigrants _ or 18 percent _ without proper criminal background
checks.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has acknowledged that the errors allowed
several hundred immigrants with criminal convictions to obtain
American citizenship, and that it is in the process of reviewing
many of those cases to determine if the citizenship should be
revoked.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which the inspector general's office
described as the largest it had ever undertaken, found that the
immigration agency ignored a number of warnings, including its own,
as it pressed to meet its goal of naturalizing 1 million applicants
by Sept. 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``INS failed to address known system weaknesses before
implementing a program that they knew would tax that system as it
never had been taxed before,'' said Robert L. Ashbaugh, acting
inspector general. ``The results were predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying the agency has fixed much of what was broken, an
observation that is underscored in the report, the immigration
agency played down the findings Monday and called many of them
outdated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in this report that is new,'' said Maria
Cardona, an agency spokeswoman. ``This is a report about a system
that is no longer applicable. That was then, this is now.''
</P>
<P>
   While the report chronicles a series of missteps by the
immigration agency _ including hiring improperly trained workers
and failing to wait for FBI background checks on applicants who had
been fingerprinted _ it cleared the White House of accusations that
it manipulated the citizenship program to boost voter rolls for the
1996 election. The agency and its commissioner, Doris M. Meissner,
``were not acting out of partisan political motives,'' the report
states.
</P>
<P>
   The actions of Vice President Al Gore came under review because
he and his ``reinventing government'' operation had suggested ways
for the immigration agency to decrease the citizenship backlog. Jim
Kennedy, a spokesman for Gore, said the report backed what the vice
president and the White House had been saying about the
naturalization program all along, ``namely that it was an effort
designed to reduce the backlog of citizenship applications and not
to further any inappropriate political end.''
</P>
<P>
   In written answers to questions from the inspector general, Gore
denied any political motive to the effort to reduce the backlog.
But the report makes it clear that the Clinton administration took
an interest in the program's progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found evidence that White House officials were interested
in INS's naturalization program for a variety of reasons, including
`political' reasons that related to the November 1996 election,''
the report states, ``but from the evidence we did not find those
interests resulted in improper actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Those interests, however, ``added to the significant pressure
that already existed on INS,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   At least one White House aide, Douglas Farbrother, who was
assigned to work on Gore's reinventing government team, reported to
the inspector general that he was told by Elaine Karmack, Gore's
senior policy adviser, that the citizenship program was linked to
the upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
   Farbrother's own electronic mail messages to Gore and Karmack
showed that he was keenly aware of the link as he criticized the
agency for falling down on the job of producing ``a million new
citizens before election day.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Farbrother, Karmack said President Clinton had
heard about a backlog in citizenship applications in Southern
California. ``The president was interested in naturalization
because he thought this group would mostly vote for him,''
Farbrother said he was told.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then asked Gore to have the reinventing government
program ``take a look'' at the backlog, Farbrother said Karmack
told him.
</P>
<P>
   Karmack denied making these statements, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the subcommittee on
immigration, said he was troubled by the implications of the report
and planned to hold hearings on its findings when Congress
reconvened in September. ``The American people have a right to know
that this agency will bow to political pressure from the Clinton
administration,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also chronicles how the immigration agency mishandled
the job of processing a million citizens, permitting unqualified
people to become naturalized. But the inspector general said it was
impossible to come up with a figure of how many citizens were
wrongly approved or rejected.
</P>
<P>
   An auditor hired by the government found in 1997 that 180,000
immigrants did not undergo background checks, mostly because the
system for fingerprinting people and verifying the results was not
working.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said its own audit uncovered 8,400 immigrants who
could have been ``wrongly naturalized'' because they had criminal
records or for other reasons. Of those, the agency's general
counsel winnowed the list to 600 who had criminal convictions and
had lied about them on their citizenship applications. So far, 140
have had their citizenship revoked. The rest are being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   While the report praises the agency for revamping its background
check system, it concludes that the INS must create uniform
standards for citizenship applicants. There are no standards for
determining whether an applicant can speak English or is of ``good
moral character,'' which leads to inconsistencies and unfairness in
the treatment of applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency now faces a backlog of 1.1 million
citizenship applications, down from its high of nearly 2 million
early last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``INS has made little progress toward ensuring that
adjudicators, once they have the requisite tools _ like the results
of criminal history checks or the applicant's file _ know how to
use them,'' the report states.

POWELL CHIDES GOP BUT SAYS BUSH WOULD BRIDGE RACIAL DIVIDES &HT;    (EDs: Recasts lede; updates with quotes, details from speech;
pickup: Powel is perhaps)
 &HT;    By ERIC ROSENBERG
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Colin Powell, one of the nation's most prominent
African Americans, criticized the Republican Party Monday night for
its traditional opposition to affirmative action, asserting that
``the issue of race still casts a shadow over our society.'' But
Powell told delegates to the Republican National Convention that
Texas Gov. George W. Bush would heal racial rifts and reach out to
minorities if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must understand that cynicism exists in the black
community,'' Powell said in a prime-time address to the 2,066
delegates _ more than 90 percent of whom are white.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``the kind of cynism that is created when, for example,
some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly and loudly condemn
affirmative action that helped a few thousand black kids get an
education,'' he said. ``But hardly a whimper is heard from them
over affirmative action for lobbyists who load our federal tax
codes with prefences for special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell called on Republicans to reach out to minority groups
``and not just during an election year campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans must help the poorest Americans, he said, adding
that ``the world is watching to see if all this power and wealth is
just for the well to do, the comfortable, the privileged.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush introduced the retired Army general in a live broadcast
from a school classroom in Westerville, Ohio, a Columbus suburb.
Praising Powell for years of government service, the governor
hinted that there may be a high-profile postion for Powell if Bush
is elected president. ``I hope his greatest service to America
might still lie ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell is considered a favorite for Bush's secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Powell praised Bush, saying the governor ``can help bridge our
racial divides'' and ``has been successful in bringing more and
more minorities inside the tent by responding to their deepest
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Some call it compassionate conservatism. To me, it's
just about caring about people. He can do the same thing as
president. He will bring to the White House that same passion for
inclusion'' that he has shown as governor in reaching out ``to all
Texans _ white, black, Latino, Asian, Native American.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, 63, the chairman of the joint Chiefs of Staff under
President George Bush, the Texas governor's father, also said that
improving the lives of American youth should be the country's top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the problems we worry about go back to how we raise
our children. We either build our children or we build more
jails,'' he said, adding that it is ``time to stop building
jails.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell noted that giving children ``what they need to be
successful in life ... has become the passion of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the retired general became chairman of America's
Promise, a national organization that mentors young people, using
faith-based and community organizations to help solve social ills.
</P>
<P>
   Powell did not mention abortion, a key hot-button issue on which
his views run counter to those of Bush and many of the delegates
here. Powell supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Monday's GOP convention activities was
``Opportunity With a Purpose: Leave No Child Behind.'' It was an
effort flesh out Bush's campaign mantra of ``compassionate
conservatism'' by showcasing speakers focused on improving
education and conditions for young people generally.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Powell, Monday's speakers included Laura Bush,
wife of the Texas governor, who spoke about education.

   Powell considered running for the Republican presidential
nomination in 1996 but ultimately declined. In the current
campaign, he aggressively dissuaded Bush from considering him as a
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Powell is considered a likely contender for secretary of
state should the governor win the election. The selection would
reunite Powell with Richard Cheney, the presumptive vice
presidential nominee and secretary of defense under President Bush.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Powell is perhaps best remembered for his role as Joint Chiefs
chairman in helping plan Operation Desert Storm, the massive 1991
war effort to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   He initially opposed use of military force to turn back Iraq's
1990 invasion of the oil kingdom. But once President Bush and the
allies decided to fight, Powell helped devise a strategy of using
overwhelming force. No U.S. troops should be put into harm's way
unless they are supported by sufficient numbers to rapidly defeat
the Iraqi military, Powell reasoned, drawing a key lesson from his
Vietnam war experience.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's history with Republican presidents dates to the Richard
Nixon era. While in the Army, Powell served in 1972 as a White
House fellow, a program that exposed him to the inner workings of
the president's Cabinet. While there, he impressed Caspar
Weinberger and Frank Carlucci, both of whom later served as
secretaries of defense.
</P>
<P>
   During the Reagan administration, Powell was the top military
aide to Weinberger and later became the president's national
security adviser. In 1989, under President Bush, Powell, at 52,
became the youngest chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the nation's
highest military post. He is the only African American to have
served in the position.

NEW YORK PLANS MORE INSECTICIDE FOR STATEN ISLAND TO COMBAT WEST
NILE THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced Monday that the city
would re-spray all of Staten Island on Wednesday and Thursday with
the pesticide Anvil as a ``prudent measure'' against the mosquitoes
carrying the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the number of dead birds found with the virus on
Staten Island _ 13 at last count _ prompted the additional
spraying. No dead birds with the virus have been found in
Manhattan, the Bronx or Brooklyn, and three have been found in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal Cohen, the city's health commissioner who made the
announcement with Giuliani, also said Monday that an increasing
number of mosquitoes found in traps in Staten Island was prompting
the city to act.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that the spraying, scheduled from 10 p.m. Wednesday
to 5 a.m. Thursday from trucks, was aimed at killing those
mosquitoes not reached by the ground-spraying of Staten Island on
July 19-20 and July 24-25.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a population of mosquitoes that have recently
fed who are not in the air on any given evening,'' Cohen said. He
estimated that the initial ground-spraying of Staten Island might
have missed 10 percent to 20 percent of the mosquito population.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes feeding on birds infected with West Nile virus become
carriers of the virus, and may then infect animals the insects bite
subsequently, including humans.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the virus killed seven people and made 55 others ill
in the New York area. Infected birds indicate that the virus is
present.
</P>
<P>
   No human has been found with the virus this year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, New York has sprayed pesticide throughout
Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn to kill
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, health officials in Stamford, Conn., announced that
they had found a dead crow infected with the West Nile virus, the
first infected bird found in that state. A Stamford health official
said that area residents had collected 200 dead birds for testing
in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   And in New Jersey on Monday, tests showed that six more crows
found dead there were also infected with the virus, including the
one found in Union County, state health officials said, bringing
the total found infected so far this year in that state to 15
according to the state health department.
</P>
<P>
   All counties in New Jersey spray bodies of water to kill
mosquito larvae, and Sussex County has done limited ground spraying
for adult mosquitoes, said Sharon Southard, a spokeswoman for the
state department of environmental Protection.

 OFFERS POUR IN FOR FORMER ORACLE EXEC

<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ray Lane, the former president and chief
operating officer of database software-maker Oracle Corp., said
yesterday that he will never work as a company executive again and
will instead focus on less time-consuming jobs like serving on
boards of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Since his departure, Lane says he has been recruited to be chief
executive or director for about 50 firms. He would not discuss
details about those offers, which he said are from Internet
companies and other large businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I want to be the one in control of my time,'' said
Lane, 53, and the father of a young child. ``It depends on the
quality of life you want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything else to prove,'' he added. ``If I take
another operations role, then it's just me trying to prove
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane's remarks came during a telephone interview in which he
announced that he is joining the board of Sheer Networks, a
Sunnyvale firm that creates software to manage telecommunications
networks. It is Lane's first new job since his high-profile
retirement from Oracle in July after Larry Ellison, the company's
chief executive, stripped him of most of his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Including the directorship at Sheer Networks, Lane now serves on
five corporate boards. He is also a director for Marimba, C-bridge
Internet Solutions, Software Technologies Corp. and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said he joined Sheer Networks' board because it has
developed technology that could make managing telecommunications
networks much easier. He invested his own money in the company,
describing it only as a ``significant'' amount.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Oracle, Lane led the Dallas office of business
consulting firm Booz-Allen &AMP; Hamilton. There was no word whether
Lane would begin consulting again in addition to his board
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Greenbaum, an analyst for Enterprise Applications
Consulting, a software consulting company in Berkeley, was
skeptical that Lane could stay away from the executive ranks for
long.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum said Lane may a need a break after managing Oracle
through difficult times. But the analyst suspected that Lane would
probably find serving on a board to be less satisfying than running
a multibillion-dollar company.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced executives like Lane, Greenbaum said, are in big
demand these days. He predicted that Lane could be lured to lead
one of them if the offer is big enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software industry is full of second acts and deathbed
conversions,'' Greenbaum said. ``I would take Lane's announcement
with a grain of salt.''

 BEST ADVICE ON INVESTING _ SIT DOWN AND READ
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; COLUMN BY ARTHUR LOUIS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q:  &LR; I am a student, interested in investing in stocks. I have &LR; 
 &LR; about $3,000 saved up in a certificate of deposit. How do I go &LR; 
 &LR; about picking stocks? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A: Investing is a skill like any other, only more so. It takes a
lot of time, study and application if you hope to do it right _ and
even then you may fail.
</P>
<P>
   Buy regularly _ and read thoroughly _ such investor-oriented
publications as Barron's, the Wall Street Journal and Smart Money.
Also, pay close attention to the business coverage in your friendly
local newspaper (hint, hint).
</P>
<P>
   Read all the books you can find on investing. Browse a
good-sized bookstore and pick the titles that pique your interest.
Do the same at the nearest branch library.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some books I would particularly recommend: ``A Random
Walk Down Wall Street,'' by Burton J. Malkiel; ``One up on Wall
Street,'' by Peter Lynch; ``The Intelligent Investor,'' by Benjamin
Graham, and ``The Battle for Investment Survival,'' by Gerald M.
Loeb.
</P>
<P>
   Don't slavishly follow any writer's advice. The idea is to
become familiar with the conventional wisdom, to soak up some
unconventional wisdom and to learn the jargon. Once you know how
the so-called experts think, you will be prepared to start thinking
for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   I also suggest that you open a brokerage account promptly, even
if you plan to wait a while to invest. That way you can gain access
to the broker's research archives, which allow you to explore
facts, statistics and recommendations pertaining to thousands of
stocks. Most brokers make it possible to do this online.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I am obligated to mention that investment novices with
small amounts of money ought to at least consider investing in a
mutual fund. Mutual funds offer diversification and professional
management. The catch is that professional management isn't
necessarily worth much; most mutual funds fail to match the
performance of the stock-market averages.
</P>
<P>
   One type of mutual fund that matches the market _ precisely _ is
an index fund. The performance benchmark for most stock-oriented
mutual funds is the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, so you might want to buy
shares in a fund that emulates that index.
</P>
<P>
   But picking your own stocks is more fun.
</P>
<P>
   One intriguing alternative would be to sign up with one of the
new online brokers that let you build your own mutual fund with
small amounts of money and at low commission costs. (See my article
about these brokers in today's Business section on Page E1.)
</P>
<P>
   Death and Taxes
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a senior with substantial individual retirement
accounts. My daughter is the beneficiary of these accounts. After I
die, she obviously will have to pay income tax as she withdraws the
money. But what about the estate tax? Are the IRAs counted as part
of the estate for tax purposes?
</P>
<P>
   A: Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller says IRAs
generally are included in the estate for tax purposes. There are
some arcane, complicated exceptions to that rule, however, so you
ought to touch base with a financial planner, accountant or tax
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Your daughter will have choices to make when it comes time to
withdraw the money from the IRAs. How she proceeds will depend on
whether you have reached the age at which you are required to make
annual withdrawals from your IRAs. The cutoff is April 1 of the
year after you reach age 701/2.
</P>
<P>
   If you die after the cutoff date, your daughter will have to
withdraw money from the IRAs at least as rapidly as you were
required to do so. Your minimum withdrawal schedule will have been
determined from age expectancy tables provided by the IRS in its
Publication 590.
</P>
<P>
   If you die before the cutoff date, then your daughter will have
two choices. She can withdraw all the money from the IRAs by the
end of the fifth year following your death. Or, she can take
withdrawals based on her own life expectancy, using the IRS tables.
Those withdrawals would have to begin before the end of the year
following your death.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Weller notes, your daughter would not have to pay
an early-withdrawal penalty. There is no penalty because the
withdrawals are required by law.
</P>
<P>
   Post-Acquisition Math
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have some shares of Ziff-Davis and ZDNet, both of which are
being acquired by Cnet. Can you tell me how to figure out how many
shares of Cnet I will receive?
</P>
<P>
   A: You will get 0.3397 shares of Cnet for every Ziff-Davis share
you own, and 0.5932 Cnet shares for every share of ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   Before that happens, however, Ziff-Davis will spin off shares of
its Key3Media trade-show and conference business. You will get one
share of Key3Media for every two shares you hold in Ziff-Davis. As
part of the spin-off, you also will receive a special cash dividend
of up to $2.50 per Ziff-Davis share. The precise amount hasn't been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: In last week's column, I advised a reader that the
institutions at which he holds his IRAs will be able to tell him
what portion of the money he withdraws is taxable. I have since
been informed by institutions and other sources that this generally
is not true _ that the institutions usually do not keep the
necessary records. So you had better keep track of this yourself,
noting each year which of your IRA contributions are deductible or
non-deductible. (Check copies of your tax returns to remind
yourself what you did in past years.) If, for example, you have
$10,000 in a traditional IRA, and you made $6,000 in nondeductible
contributions, then $6 out of every $10 you withdraw will not be
taxable.
</P>
<P>

 &LR; moneybag &LR; sfgate.com,  &LR; or to Arthur M. Louis, Moneybag column, 901

NEW ONLINE BROKERS LET YOU BUILD YOUR OWN MUTUAL FUND AT A  BARGAIN
PRICE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY ARTHUR M. LOUIS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Four new Internet-based brokerage firms have
begun offering investors the opportunity to create their own mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   They are capitalizing on a widespread, growing discontent with
conventional funds.
</P>
<P>
   Although they differ in details _ most notably, their fee
structures _ all four firms offer investors the opportunity to pick
their own stocks and assemble diversified portfolios at low cost.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that at least some individuals can make out
better financially by creating home-brewed mutual funds, rather
than entrusting their money to mutual-fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds hold more than $4 trillion in investor assets, says
John Collins, a spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, the
fund industry's chief trade organization. On the surface, that
seems to suggest that there is hardly any discontent at all.
</P>
<P>
   But many people who invest in mutual funds do so grudgingly.
</P>
<P>
   Those who participate in 401(k) retirement plans at work usually
have no choice but to channel their money into funds. Their
employers require it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people with limited assets who want to invest on
their own often choose mutual funds because the funds offer
convenient diversification. For a few hundred or a few thousand
dollars, a mutual-fund shareholder can buy a stake in dozens or
even hundreds of companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, mutual funds have some glaring faults.
</P>
<P>
   Their most unforgivable fault is that they can't seem to
consistently beat or even match the stock market averages.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, close to 80 percent of equity mutual funds
have performed worse than the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, the fund
industry's principal benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to injury, mutual funds charge substantial
management fees despite their inferior performance. The average is
somewhat more than 1.2 percent of assets per year _ year after year
after year.
</P>
<P>
   Over many years, that can take a heavy toll on investor wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Another common gripe against the funds is that most of them are
not tax efficient. By and large, fund managers buy and sell stocks
frenetically, without regard to the tax consequences for their
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   That may not bother people in 401(k)s and other tax-deferred
plans, but it can be extremely annoying to people who hold fund
shares directly.
</P>
<P>
   By law, any capital gains realized when a fund sells stock must
be passed along to the fund shareholders, who then must dig deep to
pay the tax man.
</P>
<P>
   Riding to the rescue are brokerage firms called
Sharebuilder.com, BuyAndHold, Foliofn and eInvesting, all of them
created in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Each is designed to let individual investors gain greater
control over their investments.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish this, they let investors buy stocks in specified
dollar amounts, rather than according to the number of shares. This
means that the investors can buy one share of a particular stock
and even a fraction of a share.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you have only $2,000 and want to spread it
evenly among 10 stocks, you can do it. If one of the stocks that
interests you is Berkshire Hathaway, which recently was priced at
close to $60,000 per share, you can allot $200 to buy 1/ 300th of a
share.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing in the real world as 1/300th of a share
of Berkshire Hathaway _ or any other stock. To get around this
problem, the brokerage firms pool the purchases (or sales) of all
their customers, piecing together fractional-share transactions to
make whole shares.
</P>
<P>
   On the broker's account books, however, the individual with $200
to invest in Berkshire Hathaway will be credited with ownership of
1/ 300th of a share _ no more, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the brokerage firms _ Sharebuilder.com, which began doing
business last November, and BuyAndHold.com, which opened shop in
December _ are designed mainly for low-asset investors _ those with
only a few thousand dollars or even a few hundred to invest.
</P>
<P>
   They feature extremely low commission costs, which allow
investors to make small purchases and sales without giving up a
substantial percentage of their assets.
</P>
<P>
   Foliofn, which began operating last March, and eInvesting, which
is still in the startup phase and not yet accepting accounts, are
designed for somewhat more upscale customers _ those with assets in
the tens of thousands of dollars and higher.
</P>
<P>
   Sharebuilder.com ( &LR; www.sharebuilder.com &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; is a unit of Netstock
Direct, a broker-dealer based in Bellevue, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   It lets its customers select investments from a list of 2,000
stocks and charges as little as $2 per transaction _ far below the
average online brokerage commission of $15 or so. Each investment
can be as small as the investor chooses; there is no minimum.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the $2 commission, you have to be willing to
invest on a regular, automatic basis, and you may have to wait up
to a week before the broker places your order, along with all the
others it has accumulated from customers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the firm's commissions on one-shot transactions
executed instantly run as high as $19.95 per transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Seely, Sharebuilder.com's chief executive, says most of his
firm's customers have been putting together portfolios of three to
10 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Sharebuilder.com encourages clients to make fixed-dollar
purchases at regular intervals, after the manner of dividend
reinvestment plans. Seely considers his firm's investment program
an improvement over DRIPs, however, because only about 1,000
companies offer DRIPs. That is half the number of stocks on
Sharebuilder's list.
</P>
<P>
   Seely points out that such investor favorites as Microsoft,
Cisco Systems and Dell Computer do not offer dividend reinvestment
plans, but they can be bought through Sharebuilder.com.
</P>
<P>
   Marisa Williams, 25, of Oakland, an editor with a
management-consulting firm, says she switched her securities
account to Sharebuilder from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to save
money on brokerage fees.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to put some of her money in a self-directed brokerage
account because she wasn't entirely satisfied with the mutual funds
offered by her company's 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only having to pay $2 per trade has encouraged me to invest on
a regular basis,'' she says. She opened her account a few months
ago with $5,000 and has been putting in more money every week. She
now has a portfolio of seven stocks _ mainly consumer and Internet
issues _ worth close to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful that you can do it yourself,'' she says. ``You
are totally in control.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's BuyAndHold ( &LR; www.buyandhold.com &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; also lets
customers pick from a list of about 2,000 stocks. It executes
customer transactions twice each market day, during a one-hour
period in the morning and another one-hour period in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Investors can invest as little as $20 at a time, and the
commission for a purchase or sale is a flat $2.99.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Breen, chief executive of BuyAndHold, boasts that his firm
allows customers to ``control their diversification and risk'' _
something that is harder to do when they buy mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the executives of the other firms, he is willing to say
how many customers he has: 90,000. The average account is close to
$2,000, he indicates, so total customer assets amount to about $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   Foliofn ( &LR; www.foliofn.com &LR; ), based in Vienna, Va., was founded
by Steven Wallman, a former commissioner with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. After leaving the SEC a couple of years ago,
he founded Foliofn as a viable alternative to mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   In years gone by, such an enterprise wouldn't have been cost
efficient, says Nancy Smith, a Foliofn vice president. But thanks
to the Internet, the savings on labor and other costs are great
enough to let Foliofn provide its services at reasonable rates.
</P>
<P>
   The firm doesn't charge by the transaction. Rather, it imposes a
flat fee of $29.95 per month or $295 per year.
</P>
<P>
   That is roughly what the average mutual fund charges to manage a
portfolio of $25,000. Foliofn's services should appeal to investors
with considerably more than that, but its fee might seem too pricey
to those with considerably less.
</P>
<P>
   However, you get a lot for your fee. You can buy and sell shares
as often as you please in up to 150 different companies. The
transactions are executed twice per market day _ early in the
morning and late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The most mysterious of the four brokerage firms is eInvesting.
</P>
<P>
   Based in San Francisco, it recently was acquired by E-Trade
Group, one of the pioneer online brokerage firms. That appears to
have complicated its planning.
</P>
<P>
   It has said in the past that it will begin operating next month,
but now that isn't certain, says Ben Phillipps, vice president for
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Phillipps says eInvesting might charge a fee based on the amount
of assets in a customer's account. Just how large that fee might be
is up in the air, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   However, he stresses that eInvesting will go out of its way to
cater to its customers' most extreme quirks. He says, for example,
that if someone wants to emulate an index fund by investing a few
dollars in each of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stocks, ``we expect to
be able to accommodate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Kinnel, a research analyst with Morningstar Inc., the
Chicago firm that tracks mutual-fund performance, calls the
build-your-own movement ``innovative'' and ``really interesting.''
He expects it to put pressure on the fund industry to reduce its
fees.
</P>
<P>
   However, he warns that many individual investors don't have
enough time or savvy to make sensible choices when they pick their
own stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not smarter than the market,'' he says, ``you may as
well just buy an index fund or buy the services of a fund manager
you think is smarter than the market.''

 COURT FIGHT DRAWS MILLIONS TO MUSIC SITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY BENNY EVANGELISTA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With Napster Inc.'s survival hanging in the
balance last week, traffic to its Web site exploded past some more
well-known sites like ESPN.com, Disney.com, MSNBC.com and
Priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Web monitoring service PC Data Online,
Napster's site attracted 5.8 million visitors last week, reaching
7.3 percent of the total Web audience.
</P>
<P>
   That moved Napster into first place for the first time in PC
Data's list of top online music sites, easily pushing RealNetworks
Inc.'s Web site Real.com into second place.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's surging Internet popularity is exactly what members of
the Recording Industry Association of America hoped to stop.
Napster's popular computer software program allows its 20 million
members to share free copies of songs with each other, a practice
the record industry fears will undercut revenues for companies and
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Hall Patel
issued a preliminary injunction ordering Napster to stop all
copyright infringements. But Friday, U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
judges blocked the injunction until at least mid-September with a
last-minute stay.
</P>
<P>
   The court drama helped Napster.com traffic surge 92 percent
during the week, peaking at 849,000 unique visitors on Friday, the
day the injunction was blocked, according to another online
audience measurement service, Nielsen/NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of people downloading the Napster program doubled
last Friday, when the stay was issued, compared to the number on
July 25, the day before Patel's ruling, Neilsen/NetRatings said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in the downloads of Napster on the heels of the
court stay is a strong indication that digital downloading has hit
critical mass among American Web consumers,'' said Allen Weiner,
vice president of analytical services at NetRatings.
</P>
<P>
   Napster's court problems also helped boost the ratings of Scour,
which operates a program that shares music and movie files. Scour,
which also has been sued for copyright infringement, ranked 10th on
PC Data's latest list in the music category with 1.29 million
visitors. It was the first time Scour cracked the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Napster was also the top site in PC Data's entertainment
category. The San Mateo startup didn't even rank in that category
the previous week, when the site had only 1.75 million unique
users, or 2.2 percent of the total Web audience.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Napster was not that far behind overall leaders
Microsoft.com, which had 12.8 million users, and Netscape.com, with
10.4 million users.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last several months, Napster has gravitated in the 1.8
million, sometimes 2 million unique weekly users'' range, said PC
Data Online spokesman Jim Carey. ``This clearly just sent it over
the top. It's clear there is a draw to it now because of the court
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey said PC Data Online records show only one jump to match
Napster's huge rise last week. That occurred last April, when
Microsoft.com saw its traffic jump from about 3 million visitors
per week to about 10 million visitors the week the U.S. Justice
Department won its landmark antitrust case against the Redmond,
Wash., software giant.

 WEB-ONLY ADS FOR W HOTEL'S ELITE CLIENTELE
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY CAROL EMERT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Internet ads get a bad rap. Derided as too small
to attract a passing glance from surfers, banner ads generate
clicks from fewer than one-half of one percent of the people who
see them.
</P>
<P>
   It seems odd, then, that Web ads are the only type of mass
advertising being used to launch a chichi new W Hotel in Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, owner of the ultra-hip W
Hotel chain, is eschewing traditional media in favor of a digital
campaign it believes will be a hit with the W's core customers _
wired, wealthy business travelers in their thirties and forties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the marketing to stand out in the same way we believe
the hotel stands out,'' said Diane Briskin, director of sales and
marketing for Starwood. ``We're taking a risk with this because if
it doesn't work, it could hamper us. But because (Silicon Valley)
is so tech-driven, we feel it's the best place to make this stab.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for W Suites Newark will debut next week. One
hundred of the hotel's 174 rooms opened for business last
Wednesday; the fully wired hotel, where suites go for $199 to $389
per night, will be fully operational in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The digital campaign could prove a bellwether in the fledgling
world of online advertising, where technologies change almost daily
and marketers are still trying to figure out how to reach customers
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   One big plus: The two-week campaign costs half as much as
Starwood would have spent in conventional media, Briskin said.
Other W Hotel launches have been advertised in magazines including
Vanity Fair and Travel &AMP; Leisure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this campaign will be used as a model (by other
advertisers) if it's successful,'' said Mark Stephens, media
director for Lot 21, an interactive ad agency in San Francisco. If
it works, the campaign will demonstrate that the Web truly can
``syphon off money from other media,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve the most visual impact with surfers, Starwood opted  &LR; 
 &LR; against the most common form of Web advertising _ banner ads, the
small rectangles that appear at the top of Web pages. Instead, it
chose ``superstitials,'' 25-second animated ads that fill about
half the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The ad for the W Suites Newark opens with a hand planting a seed
on a map of Newark. A watering can showers the map and a sunflower
grows and blossoms. Next, text appears describing various amenities
and giving surfers the option of jumping to the W Web site to make
a reservation. Surfers may also sign up for e-mail newsletters or
e-mail copies of the ad to others.
</P>
<P>
   Superstitials, developed by Unicast Communications of New York,
are invisibly ``streamed'' onto a surfer's hard drive and play
automatically when a subsequent page comes up. The ads have a
high-quality, broadcast look and unwind at a constant speed that
does not require wide bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Black, an executive with Grey EMedia who helped develop the
W Suites Newark campaign, points to several advantages Web
advertising has over conventional media.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of W Suites Newark, a promotion for hotel guests to
accrue bonus points can be discontinued when the promotion ends, as
opposed to magazine ads, which are static.
</P>
<P>
   The Web ads are also highly targeted. They will be shown on just
five sites, most of which have pronounced skews toward high-income,
technology-oriented business executives: InformIT.com,
Stockmaster.com, Thomasinvest.com, Edgar.com and Time.com. If any
of the sites fails to attract clicks, the ad can easily be switched
to another site.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important from a marketer's standpoint is the ability
to gather information, such as e-mail addresses, that can be used
in future marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   And the campaign's ``viral marketing'' component creates
publicity for the hotel at no extra cost. Viral marketing is the
practice of customers forwarding e-mailing promotions to each
other, the digital realm's version of word-of-mouth advertising.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plenty of disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   While superstitials are becoming more accepted among Web
publishers, they are still accepted on a paltry 250 sites. That's
because superstitials require a different technology than other
types of interactive advertising, and Web site publishers worry
they might muck up their site.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers are also wary of superstitials because of their
potential to annoy users since the ads pop up unexpectedly and
interrupt the surfer's online experience.
</P>
<P>
   Black said less than 1 percent of surfers click to get rid of
Grey's superstitials. The trick is to make sure the ads reach
people who are interested in the brand by running them on highly
targeted sites, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number who click off the ad is such a minute group of
people that we don't care because the overall results at the end of
the day are so much better'' than with banner ads, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of surfers who click on Grey superstitials ranges as
high as 12 percent of those who see the ads.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers must also be careful not to show ads too many times
to the same person. The W Suites Newark ad is designed to be shown
a maximum of three times in one day and one time per browser
session, according to Hilary Fadner of Unicast.

 U.S. TO RECEIVE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON SEARCHING
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY KELLY YAMANOUCHI &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A University of California at Berkeley professor
plans to give an unusual gift to the federal government: a database
that will handle searches of all of the federal government's Web
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Computer science professor Eric Brewer is building the
``privately financed'' site using search-engine technology he
developed for Inktomi Corp., the Foster City company he co-founded.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, now chief technology officer and chief scientist for
Inktomi, has formed a foundation to build the database that will be
filled with many as 100 million pages that users can search in less
than a quarter-second, according to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   The search engine at  &LR; www.firstgov.gov &LR; , which can direct users,
for example, to Web pages such as one that allows them to track
their Social Security benefits, is scheduled to be up and running
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer wasn't unavailable for comment but a federal official on
the board overseeing the project speculated Brewer may be doing it
for free in gratitude for the federal government's assistance in
developing Inktomi's Internet search technology.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Brewer ``developed one of the most
successful Internet search technologies with the help of government
grants.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Web site is part of a larger project to develop a
``high-speed, high-tech, user-friendly government,'' Clinton said
during a recent Webcast.
</P>
<P>
   The government also plans to develop more government Web pages
as part of the effort. Eventually, Clinton said, people will be
able to compete online for government grants and contracts to buy
goods and services.

 &HT;    If it's smart, GOP won't repeat 1992 debacle
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about a contrast in conventions. The last time the
Republicans convened to nominate a George Bush, the Monday-night
headline was that Pat Buchanan had declared a culture war _ we
begin bombing in 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This time? Laura Bush comes before the nation with the
press-stopper: Literacy good. Illiteracy bad.
</P>
<P>
   You might say, in other words, that no news from Night 1 is very
good news for the Republican Party. Or from Night 2, or Night 3.
</P>
<P>
   If George W. Bush was paying attention behind the scenes during
the 1992 convention in Houston's Astrodome, he was learning how not
to win a nation's heart.
</P>
<P>
   You don't win it by repeating the phrase ``family values'' every
other sentence, as speaker after speaker after speaker did in the
Astro-drone. They so cheapened an already two-bit phrase that when
all was said and drummed it couldn't have been weighty to an ear
mite.
</P>
<P>
   What did ``family values'' mean? Was it chastity and bottomless
wells of virtue? The opposite of Bill Clinton with his personal
flaws? One will say that with subsequent events that would cripple
Clinton's administration this litany was fair warning. Yes. And it
was unfortunate that people applauding in the Dome in '92, people
like Newt Gingrich, Bob Livingston, Dan Burton, Henry Hyde and Bob
Bahr, later would have the rhetoric come back and bite them where
it hurts, in ye olde private parts.
</P>
<P>
   Purity and reality
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, with George W.'s own playboy past as inferential fodder
we can put this type of piety aside and consider issues of
governance.
</P>
<P>
   In '92 with Buchanan setting the tone with his bellicose assault
on foreigners and homosexuals, with anti-abortion protesters trying
to shut down Houston women's clinics, the convention was as mean as
it was ponderous.
</P>
<P>
   (It's said that the Houston Astros vacated the Dome this year
because of economic issues. Another theory is that they couldn't
shake the bad vibes left by the GOP convention.)
</P>
<P>
   With the pronounced attempt to portray the party as ``family
values'' incarnate, as America most pure, the most remarkable
moment in '92 may have come when Mary Fisher, a former aide to
Gerald Ford, a mother infected with HIV, stepped to the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I am female and contracted this disease in marriage, I
am one with the lonely gay man sheltering a flickering candle from
the cold wind of his family's rejection,'' she said, to a bare
smattering of applause. Or was it jewelry rattling?
</P>
<P>
   That was a singular pause in a gathering that, in rhetorical
texture, couldn't have been more divisive. Bush doesn't want that,
and certainly doesn't need it. His mission this week is to modulate
a media event that will try to put a fuzz-focus on his party's
dagger edges. He has succeeded in helping tone things down already
by removing from the GOP platform a call for an
English-as-official-language law and the denial of automatic
citizenship to children of illegal immigrants born on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will seek to avoid entirely the abortion issue, although he
can't dodge it forever, witnessed by the unremittingly anti-choice
voting record of his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will seek to win the presidency as a voice of moderation.
In some ways, therefore, the toughest crowd he faces this week is
not the one in the nation's living rooms but the one inside
Philadelphia's First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will be addressing a body that is heavily seasoned with the
hard-right elements that Buchanan was serenading with his ``culture
war'' speech. The Texas delegation, for instance, is teeming with
religious conservatives to whom moderation is no virtue.
</P>
<P>
   And so now, everybody in unison, one, two, three: Literacy good
. . .

CLINTON DERIDES REPUBLICANS, AND HER OPPONENT, AS EXTREMISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the Republican convention opened on Monday with
appeals to moderate voters, Hillary Rodham Clinton warned an
audience here not to be deceived by the GOP's ``well-scripted
show'' intended to conceal what she called the party's extremist
record.
</P>
<P>
   Mocking Gov. George W. Bush's slogan of ``compassionate
conservatism'' at the National Urban League's annual convention on
Monday in Manhattan, Clinton used especially caustic language to
criticize the Republicans for trying to promote ``political
amnesia,'' and linked her rival in the New York Senate race to
conservative policies favored at the top of the party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Without using the name of her Republican opponent for the U.S.
Senate, Rep. Rick A. Lazio, Clinton scoffed at his efforts to
present himself as moderate. For the first time in weeks, she
linked Lazio to the reign of Newt Gingrich _ a strategy she seized
upon when Lazio entered the race but then quickly dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes around calling himself mainstream,'' she said,
mockingly stretching out both syllables. ``I guess his service as a
deputy whip to Newt Gingrich is considered mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also reminded her audience of some items from the
Republican record, hammering at the words and deeds of both Bush
and his vice presidential choice, Dick Cheney, and attacking their
plans to keep the convention free of dissent. Republican leaders,
including Bush, have said they would not spend time criticizing
Clinton, a frequent target of some GOP members.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton did not seem to feel the need to reciprocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need leaders who won't just talk the talk of equal
opportunity,'' she said, her voice noticeably hoarse from a week of
intense campaigning for the U.S. Senate seat from New York. ``We
need leaders who have, and are, and will walk the walk with all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   She repeatedly referred to Cheney as Congressman Cheney _ and
targeted his voting record as a member of Congress in the 1980s. No
less than three times in a 30-minute speech, she noted Cheney's
1986 vote against a resolution urging freedom for Nelson Mandela,
who was in a South African prison.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has defended his 1986 vote by saying that Mandela's
group, the African National Congress, was then considered a
terrorist organization. He has lately praised Mandela, who became
president of South Africa after the dismantling of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also reminded the audience of Bush's visit to Bob Jones
University _ the South Carolina campus that at the time had banned
interracial dating. And she told them that Bush has said that
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas were his model Supreme
Court justices.
</P>
<P>
   The last comment went far with the crowd, which responded with a
groan. Clinton nodded, pausing for effect. ``We need to make sure
everybody knows that,'' she said, drawing a roar of laughter from
the audience. ``The strategy of the other side is to induce a case
of political amnesia in every one of us,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Flood, a spokesman with the Lazio campaign noted that
invoking Lazio's ties to Gingrich did not work for Clinton in the
past. ``New Yorkers know the Lazio record and they know he's a
mainstream candidate,'' he said.

GRIFFEY'S HOMECOMING IS HALF-EMPTY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe you can't go home again, as Ken Griffey Jr.
seemed to be suggesting Monday, but Barry Larkin was having no
second thoughts about staying home and missing his opportunity to
play shortstop for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had offered me a multiyear contract, I would have been
here,'' Larkin said, before slipping into his uniform, still and
perhaps forever a Cincinnati Red, to play the Mets on Monday night
at soggy Shea Stadium. ``But it worked out for me. Yes, it did.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day the major league trade deadline mercifully arrived,
sparing paper mills potential inventory depletion from servicing
baseball's rumor mill, Larkin arrived to say, hey, no hard
feelings, the Mets wound up with Mike Bordick, while he secured the
three-year contract extension he'd all but given up on.
</P>
<P>
   He got to stay home, which is all he wanted after a lifetime in
Cincinnati and 14 terrific years with the Reds and what could
possibly be wrong with that? Larkin was still booed by those
unmistakably sophisticated New York baseball fans when he batted in
the first inning, even louder than Griffey, who spurned the Mets
without so much as sleeping on it last December. Then Griffey
forced Seattle to ship him to the team in whose uniform his father
of the same name enjoyed his best days, and signed for less money,
a mere $116.5 million, than the open market would have paid.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a modern-day triumph of hometown loyalty
over greed, at least until Junior got off to a slow start, the Reds
sank under .500 and stuffed their best pitcher, Denny Neagle, into
George Steinbrenner's bottomless pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the attempted trade of Larkin to the Mets, who wanted
to send him a plane full of welcoming teammates, which he called
``flattering,'' but not the point.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Griffey had to say during the period it seemed he
might be leaving, Larkin said: ``His response was, `I didn't travel
3,000 miles to come home and play with you for one year,''' Larkin
said. ``He told me he was going, too.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of a threat, Griffey said one place he never went
was to the Reds' new owner, Carl Lindner. ``I didn't express that
to management,'' he said, though he also insisted: ``I wouldn't
have deferred as much money as I did to have someone sell off my
teammates. I didn't come here to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite the contrast to the ebullient Larkin, Griffey seemed so
weary in the pregame clubhouse, so dour, you wanted it to all be an
act. No one with that much natural talent and grace should be as
unhappy, feel as unappreciated, as Griffey seemed when he stared
vacantly and whispered his answers as if he were on death row.
</P>
<P>
   He began the game with 32 home runs and 91 runs batted in, power
numbers that no one could quibble with. Yet he was hitting only
.241, and though the Reds had recently climbed over .500 and back
into the Central Division race, they hadn't exactly been the
Seattle Mariners. That's another rub. Junior's old team took some
of the money it saved by not keeping him to hire some pitching.
They're in first place without him and, no matter how logical
baseball minds may avoid casting this as a reflection on him, this
is an extremely sensitive soul who often sees glasses half-empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that's been said this season has been negative,''
he said. ``If I go 4 for 4 and hit three home runs and didn't hit
the fourth one out, it's like I didn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't recall much positive national response to his signing
with the Reds. He believes the news media has dogged him for eight
months with innuendo and outright lies. He said he has been accused
of everything from signing with the Reds only so his father, a
coach, would become manager to calling up a cable sports network to
complain that another center fielder's highlights were being shown
more than his.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about playing baseball in Cincinnati? ``Hanging
out with my family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good, honest response, except he never had one good
thing to say about playing baseball with the Reds, a small-market
team that, under fan fire, dug deep to keep Larkin, its longtime
linchpin, probably at the cost of future help elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey said he might have considered the Mets had he not been
given 15 minutes to make up his mind, an account that was disputed
by team officials in Seattle. At 35, the proud owner of a 1990
World Series ring, staying put made all the sense in the world for
Larkin. Junior's another story, though. He may have very well been
better off batting in front of Mike Piazza, in New York.

GRIFFEY AND LARKIN SAY NO TO THE METS ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two Reds who turned down deals to become Mets _ Ken
Griffey Jr. and Barry Larkin _ turned on New York again Monday
night in Cincinnati's 6-0 victory at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey went two for five with two runs scored, and Larkin
singled home a run in the seventh. Dante Bichette drove in three
runs for the Reds, whose starter, Scott Williamson, blanked the
Mets for six innings before leaving with a spasm in his left
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the first for the Mets on this homestand, which
opened with six victories.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours before the game, Mets players knew for sure that
they had not added or lost any teammates by Monday's nonwaiver
trading deadline. This, they hope, is the group that will carry
them into the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   When they took the field, on a damp, misty night, they
encountered two Reds who could have been a part of their group.
Griffey and Larkin both vetoed potential deals to the Mets within
the last year. When Larkin struck out in the first inning, a
delighted Mets crowd jeered him for rejecting a trade to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson (4-7) allowed baserunners in each of his innings, but
the Mets were 0 for 6 against him with runners in scoring position.
The right-hander gave up six hits and two walks, striking out three
and outpitching the Mets' Glendon Rusch.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch left in the seventh inning after Pokey Reese reached base
on a fielding error by third baseman Robin Ventura. Larkin singled
off Rick White to bring in the first unearned run Rusch has allowed
this year. The Mets' left-hander worked six innings, allowing four
earned runs on seven hits and a walk as his record dropped to 7-8.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch had allowed only four runs in 19 innings during the second
half of the season. But he matched that total by the third inning
Monday night, mainly because of trouble with the Reds' third and
fourth hitters _ Griffey and Dante Bichette.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey had one hit in 10 career at-bats off Rusch before this
season. But that hit was a homer, and Griffey homered again off
Rusch in April. His hits stayed in the park Monday night, but they
were no less harmful to Rusch.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Stynes led off the game with a single, and after Larkin
struck out, Griffey singled Stynes to third. When Bichette doubled
to the center-field warning track, Griffey came around to score
behind Stynes as the Reds took a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   One of Griffey's few flaws as a player is that he sometimes
slides awkwardly, and he did so Monday night, starting his slide
late and knocking right knees with catcher Mike Piazza. Griffey
limped back to the dugout _ where he saw Bichette score on a
groundout to put the Reds ahead, 3-0 _ but he stayed in the game
and soon did more damage.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the third, Griffey lined one toward the
right-field corner, good for a double. Bichette singled him home to
increase the Reds' lead to 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch was having little trouble with the rest of the Reds, and
he resumed his solid pitching immediately. Sean Casey ended the
inning with a double-play grounder, and Rusch held the Reds without
a run or a hit for the next three innings.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets could not do much with Williamson and they failed
to convert on their chances. With one out in the first, Edgardo
Alfonzo singled to move Derek Bell to second. That brought up
Piazza and stirred the crowd, but Piazza grounded into a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   That at-bat began a string of futility for the Mets. They left
one runner in scoring position in each of the first five innings,
including the second, when Williamson issued two wild pitches that
advanced Ventura two bases. That gave Williamson a
major-league-high 19 wild pitches, matching a Reds record.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, who was the National League's rookie of the year
last season as a reliever, also walks a lot of hitters, averaging
6.5 walks per nine innings. But he walked just two and threw no
more wild pitches after the second.

 &HT;    GOP BEGINS CONVENTION AIMED AT REMAKING ITS IMAGE
 &HT;    EDS: Updates Powell quotes; minor editing throughout
 &HT;    By KEN HERMAN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ George W. Bush's high-stakes effort to put a new
face on the Grand Old Party went prime time Monday as 4,132
delegates and alternates gathered here for the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Front and center as the makeover began a four-night, nationally
televised run were retired Gen. Colin Powell, Texas First Lady
Laura Bush and a platform custom-tailored for a compassionate
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Powell praised Bush as a man with a ``passion for inclusion''
but criticized the GOP for opposing affirmative action _ a position
shared by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush said her husband is the candidate for a country in
search of a leader who reflects ``its heart and its values and its
leadership in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who will accept the nomination here Thursday night,
addressed delegates late Monday via satellite from Ohio, where he
was campaigning. ''I'm on my way to Philadelphia and we are on our
way to victory come November,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday night session at the First Union Center began with an
excerpt from ``Fanfare for the Common Man,'' setting the tone for a
convention aimed at ending the GOP's image as the gentry's party.
Monday's theme was ``Opportunity With a Purpose: Leave No Child
Behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, this is going to be a different kind of convention
for a different kind of Republican,'' Republican National Committee
Chairman Jim Nicholson told delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's session was different. It included Republican
delegates, overwhelmingly white, on their feet and clapping to the
raucous, up-tempo beat of a black church choir.
</P>
<P>
   Different also meant the Pledge of Allegiance delivered by a
blind mountain climber and a long agenda of blacks, Hispanics and
women on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials hope the party platform, approved here
Monday in a voice vote, also documents the difference. The party's
firm opposition to abortion remains in the platform, but delegates
OK'd a more welcoming approach to minorities and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party is more inclusive, more diverse and more
representative of America than ever before, but we're still the
party of limited government,'' Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Spector said
from the arena's massive stage.
</P>
<P>
   The night's tightly scripted and slickly produced program had
one of its few spontaneous moments when delegates spotted former
President George Bush and wife Barbara entering the hall
unannounced to take their seats. The delegates turned to face the
Bushes and applaud their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   A second ovation, longer and louder, roared through the building
when the former first family was introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
under the elder Bush, touted his ex-boss' son as the right man to
head a renewed effort for racial harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some call it compassionate conservatism. It's just about
caring for people,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In pursuing educational reform, as well as in all other parts
of his agenda for Texas, Governor Bush has reached out to all
Texans _ white, black, Latino, Asian, Native American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been successful in bringing more and more minorities
inside the tent by responding to their deepest needs,'' Powell
added. ``He will bring to the White House that same passion of
inclusion. I know he can help bridge our racial divides.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell urged the GOP to follow Bush's lead and reach out to
minorities ``and not just during an election year campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Powell drew boos at the Republican National
Convention in San Diego when he declared his support for abortion
rights and affirmative action, two issues on which he differs with
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention abortion Monday night, but hit hard on
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must understand the cynicism that exists in the black
community. The kind of cynicism that is created when, for example,
some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly and loudly condemn
affirmative action that helped a few thousand black kids get an
education, but hardly a whimper is heard from them over affirmative
action for lobbyists who load our federal tax codes with
preferences for special interests,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush, who has campaigned around the country by herself and
with her husband, used her speech to boost the Republicans'
ambitious effort to co-opt education as their issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to teach our children what our parents had taught
us,'' she said in remarks prepared for delivery, ``that reading is
entertaining and interesting and important. And one of the major
reasons George is running for president is to make sure every child
in America has that same opportunity to grow up reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Low-key by nature and reluctant to see her husband run for
president, Mrs. Bush has grown into a full-time campaign trail
partner. The Monday night speech marked her biggest step into the
spotlight. For years, her husband has joked that when he married
Laura Welch, a former librarian and teacher, her idea of a speech
was ``Sssh.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush stopped using the line after his wife objected to its
stereotypical nature. But Bush continues to remind audiences that
when he proposed to his future wife in 1977 he promised she'd never
have to give a political speech. Months later, she was giving stump
speeches for her husband in his unsuccessful congressional race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only political promise I ever broke,'' Bush tells
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the GOP broke from convention by beginning the
process of nominating Bush on opening night. Instead of having all
states vote on the third night, an alphabetical ``rolling roll
call'' that will have several states voting each night began
Monday. Bush picked up 283 votes from delegations from Alabama to
Iowa. It takes 1,033 votes to win the nomination. Several major
states passed, including California and Florida, and will vote
later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's 30 votes for Bush were announced by Cindy McCain, wife
of Arizona Sen. John McCain, Bush's most serious challenger in the
primaries. McCain released his delegates to Bush on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was placed in nomination Monday afternoon by Texas
Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, who stands to gain a lot politically if Bush
wins.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Texas Constitution, Perry would become governor if
Bush leaves office and would serve through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, convention officials kept under wraps the name of
the person who would nominate Bush, promising only that it would be
a rank-and-file delegate. Statistics show that Perry, as a
middle-aged white male, fits the delegate profile here.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-three percent of the 2,066 delegates are non-Hispanic
whites, according to an Associated Press survey. Sixty-one percent
are male.

IN FLORIDA, CLINTON RAISES FUNDS FOR DEMOCRATS AND SNIPES AT GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL H. LAVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ President Bill Clinton took on the
Republicans and their platform Monday in a series of Florida
appearances that raised more than $1.2 million for the Democratic
party and rallied support for his plan to expand Medicare to
provide prescription drug insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Medicare beneficiaries at a community center in
Tampa, the president continued his attack on the host of tax cuts
being passed by the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may hear, if you turn on the television, the Republicans,
when they meet in Philadelphia in convention, talking about all
their tax-cut bills and how wonderful they'd be for you,'' Clinton
said. ``But what they don't say is that if you take all their
tax-cut proposals in total, it spends the entire projected surplus
of the country for the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He compared tax-cut legislation being sent to him by Congress to
the choices a diner faces at a well-stocked restaurant: ``When I go
to a cafeteria, everything I see looks good,'' he said, ``but if I
eat it all, I'll get sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by Bill Nelson, the Florida insurance commissioner,
who is running for the Senate, Clinton also told Democratic donors
in Tampa, and later in Palm Beach, that the Republican goal was to
blur the differences between the parties on health care, the
economy, gun control, the environment and other issues that matter
to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their strategy is to talk about compassion,'' and ``it's a
brilliant strategy,'' Clinton said. ``It's a pretty package, and
they're hoping if they wrap it tight enough, nobody will open it
before Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raising reception here for Nelson, the president said
that the Democratic strategy should be to stay positive _ ``You
don't have to say a bad word about our opponents,'' he said _ and
to explain to voters how the parties differ.

LAURA BUSH, POWELL INTRODUCE BUSH'S APPROACH TO EDUCATION WITH
FAMILY TOUCH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Laura Bush and retired Gen. Colin Powell brocaded
Gov. George W. Bush's approach to education issues with a family
touch and the feeling of brotherhood Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Powell, parting with Bush, also scolded his fellow
Republicans for opposing affirmative action policies.
</P>
<P>
   It was Episode One of the summer drama mini-series known as the
Republican National Convention. Fitting the party's efforts to
reach beyond the stereotype of its core supporters, neither of the
two star players was a white man.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush said her husband, the Texas governor who once served
as managing partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, ``won't
lose sight of home plate'' in a crusade for student literacy and
other advancements. She said he is a purposeful man who can inspire
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, positioned for a cabinet job if Bush wins the
presidency, was introduced by the candidate in a live video feed
from the campaign trail in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The retired general praised Bush's ``compassionate
conservative'' message and his record on education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that he can help bridge our racial divides,'' said
Powell, the first black chairman of the military's Joint Chief of
Staff and a key strategizer in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly putting aside the evening's tender tone, though, Powell
said the party must reach out to minorities ``not just during an
election year.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks get cynical, Powell said, when ``some in our party miss
no opportunity to roundly and loudly condemn affirmative action
that helped a few thousand black kids get an education, but you
hardly hear a whimper when it's `affirmative action' for lobbyists
who load our federal tax codes with preferences for special
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's wife, promised by her husband 23 years ago that she would
never have to give a political speech, and Powell, delivering a
kind of encore of his speech on opening night of the 1996 GOP
convention, closed an evening officially dedicated to education.
Voters have indicated that education is their top concern.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, citing improvements in Texas public school test scores,
has said he has established a record of education reform.
</P>
<P>
   But before Monday night's speakers opened their mouths,
Democratic officeholders gathered at a union hall here and said
Republicans were putting on a false front.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, a potential running mate for the
Democratic presidential contender, Vice President Al Gore, cited
the oil industry background of Bush and his ticket mate, former
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Texaco ticket hears oil companies loud and clear, but
when it comes to kids who can't get a fair start to life, they
simply smile and nod and do nothing,'' Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial urged voters to look beyond ``a
wonderfully orchestrated picture of black and brown and white
faces'' at the podium and examine the delegates, who are
overwhelmingly conservative white males.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also announced they were airing two TV commercials
criticizing Bush for resisting an expansion of a childrens' health
program in Texas and for appointing a chemical company lobbyist to
enforce environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the sports arena that houses the convention, however, the
personal politics practiced by Laura Bush and Powell was
unbothered.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's wife, a former librarian and Houston teacher,
mentioned the couple's college-bound twin daughters, Jenna and
Barbara. The twins, generally kept out of the campaign spotlight,
watched their mother's speech from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to teach our children what our parents taught us,
that reading is entertaining and interesting and important,'' she
said. ``And one of the major reasons George is running for
president is to make sure every child in America has that same
opportunity to grow up reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush said she learned from watching her husband fight
state legislative battles and suffer through losing baseball
seasons that ``his core principles will not change with the winds
of politics or fame or fortune or misfortune.''
</P>
<P>
   When the governor grew up in Midland, she said, he ``developed
the strength and the consistency of conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's parents, former President George Bush and first
lady Barbara Bush, moved the family from Midland to Houston as
their eldest son turned 13.
</P>
<P>
   The former White House occupants were in the convention audience
Monday night as their daughter-in-law spoke. She said that if she
becomes first lady of the nation, she will make early childhood
development programs one of her priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Powell promoted Bush to the hilt Monday night, but he also
seemed to challenge the party's appetite for ``law and order''
stances. Bush pushed for a tougher juvenile justice system in his
campaigns for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to stop building jails in America and get back to
the task of building our children,'' Powell said. ``Our children
are not the problem, they are our future. They are America's
promise.''
</P>
<P>
   America's Promise is the name of a children's advocacy group
headed by Powell, who has resisted Republicans' encouragement to
run for president or vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1996 speech, Powell drew scattered bos and hisses from
GOP delegates when he endorsed abortion rights and affirmative
action, which are opposed by Bush and the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Without the stagecraft that Republican planners are using to try
to make this year's convention entertaining, delegates adopted the
Republican Platform 2000 without debate Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstering the night's convention theme, ``Opportunity With a
Purpose: Leave No Child Behind,'' the platform rescinded the GOP's
call for abolishment of the Department of Education. The change was
brought about at Bush's behest in hearings last week.
</P>
<P>
   The platform contains an unprecedented GOP outreach to
minorities and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offer not only a new agenda, but also a new approach _ a
vision of a welcoming society in which all have a place,'' it says.
``To all Americans, particularly immigrants and minorities, we send
a clear message: this is a party of freedom and progress, and it is
your home.''
</P>
<P>
   But the platform champions traditional GOP issues such as tax
cuts, and highlights Bush's goal of providing government aid for
charitable and religious organizations that run social programs.
The platform also sticks with Republican opposition to abortion,
gay rights and sex education.
</P>
<P>
   In another piece of official business that was overshadowed by
featured speakers, musical entertainment and a professional
wrestler, Bush's name was officially submitted Monday for the
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The deed was done by Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, who chairs the Texas
delegation and would become governor if Bush wins the Nov. 7
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I proudly place the name of the current governor of the great
state of Texas and the next president of the United States into
nomination, George W. Bush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture was uncontested, even by supporters of U.S. Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, who won seven Republican primary states
before conceding the nomination to Bush in March. McCain told his
delegates here Sunday to support Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP commenced its novel ``rolling roll call'' of states
Monday night, registering the nominating votes of delegates from
Alabama to Iowa in alphabetical order. Former candidate Alan Keyes,
more conservative than Bush, got a few votes.
</P>
<P>
   The process continues piecemeal through Thursday, abandoning the
tradition of calling the roll in a single night and avoiding a
tedious process that would be ignored by edited broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Voter surveys made public Monday showed Bush ahead of Gore, but
not by as much as was indicated in competing polls released the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles Times poll showed Bush with 44 percent and Gore
with 39 percent of the support of registered voters, less than the
10-point lead documented by the same poll in June. A new NBC-Wall
Street Journal poll showed Bush at 44 percent and Gore at 38
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's Austin-based political strategist, said during
a breakfast with reporters that the race would probably tighten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election is far from over,'' Rove said. ``This race is
going to be by Labor Day single digits one way or the other ...
there are going to be points after the Democratic convention where,
in all likelihood, we're going to be behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic convention starts Aug. 14 in Los Angeles.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: COMEDY CENTRAL'S NEWS PARODY AT THE CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When George W. Bush announced that Dick Cheney would be his
running mate, Jon Stewart drily observed:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney has opposed the Equal Rights Amendment, busing and
abortion, but he is in favor of prayer in schools. So he should
really help Bush open up the Republican Party to the
much-sought-after white conservative vote.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, beginning Tuesday night, the anchor of Comedy
Central's news parody, ``The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,'' is
taking his frisky brand of political commentary to the Republican
Convention. Stewart is a comedian, not a journalist, and this may
prove a distinct advantage over the network anchors, who must
report the events as they occur, no matter how dull.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when politicians have become cautious and bland,
political commentary is having a heyday, especially late at night,
with David Letterman, Jay Leno, Bill Maher and Stewart, whose show
is on at 11 p.m. (with several rebroadcasts). In recent months,
``The Daily Show'' has been attracting a lot of media attention
with its election coverage, especially since signing on Bob Dole
and Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, as convention
commentators. But for many people _ especially teen-age boys _ the
program has also become a regular source of news and a way to
deconstruct daily headlines with fashionable irony.
</P>
<P>
   The network says that its cockeyed coverage attracts about
500,000 viewers per show, or 2 million during its four-night week,
a sizable audience for cable. Though its attention is now on
politics, ``The Daily Show'' lampoons science, culture and business
as well. For example, its writers recently jumped on the megadeal
in which Nabisco, a food company, is being acquired by Philip
Morris, a food company that is also a cigarette company. With a
studied look of disbelief and using the warning label on a package
of cigarettes as a prop, Stewart described the deal as combining
Nabisco, ``the people who bring you Oreos, Ritz crackers and Cream
of Wheat,'' and Philip Morris, ``the people who bring you low birth
weight, infant mortality and, oh, the old favorite, emphysema.''
</P>
<P>
   Because ``The Daily Show'' is far more enjoyable when compared
with the traditional newscasts, it could actually encourage young
people to watch the nightly news _ if only to make fun of it.
Certainly the network news programs could use the jolt. Look what's
advertised on them: painkillers, laxatives, denture adhesives,
cholesterol medications, weedkiller and Chevrolets. ``The Daily
Show'' is sponsored by cool cars, cell phones and movies _ and its
big corporate sponsors for its ``Indecision 2000'' election
coverage include Yahoo, Volkswagen and Snapple.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, Stewart's show offers a satiric interpretation of
events that touches on larger truths and even larger fears. At its
worst, it's silly and crude (though some of the most sophomoric
bits are, admittedly, the funniest, like a recent raucous feature
on the Queen Mother).
</P>
<P>
   Compare ``The Daily Show'' coverage of the human genome project
with coverage by the network news programs. Tom Brokaw began the
NBC report like this: ``A day for the ages at the White House
today, that's how President Clinton described it.''
</P>
<P>
   Over on ABC, Kevin Newman, sitting in for Peter Jennings, said,
``It isn't often we can begin with something like this: The main
story is a day for the ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rather at CBS was more circumspect. After declaring that
``the recipe for humankind'' will ``revolutionize the diagnosis,
treatment and prevention of disease,'' he cautioned that genetic
mapping ``also raises questions about what is medically possible,
desirable and ethical.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, though, reacted the way many of us did upon
encountering the mysterious visuals that accompanied the genome
story on every broadcast (including ``The Daily Show'') _
indecipherable computer images, acres of test vials, weird helixes
and symbols. ``Scientists crack the human genetic code,'' he
announced, ``and yes, it will be used for pure evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 37, doesn't have a squared-off anchor physique or an
anchor's height (he's 5-foot-7) or a deep anchor voice, but he has
fine comic timing (which includes a good repertory of eye rolls and
suppressed giggles) and lots of self-deprecating charm. He projects
no need to appear unassailable.
</P>
<P>
   Like the network anchors, however, he has a book out, and these
books flag the difference between them and him. The Big Three have
chosen portentous topics like ``The Century'' (Peter Jennings),
``The Greatest Generation'' (Tom Brokaw) and ``People of the
Century: One Hundred Men and Women Who Shaped the Last One Hundred
Years'' (Dan Rather). Stewart's book, a collection of his essays,
is called ``Naked Pictures of Famous People.''
</P>
<P>
   When Middle East peace talks broke down, Stewart announced the
news like this: ``Good news for war buffs. The Middle East peace
talks have ended in failure.'' Further into the broadcast, he
explained, ``It soon became apparent that Barak was from Mars and
Arafat was from Venus.'' Of course, Stewart is spared the gruesome
necessities that go along with being a real television journalist.
The terrible Concorde crash that dominated the network news last
week was a nonstory for ``The Daily Show.'' Some news events can't
be mocked.
nn
</P>
<P>
   Even more than its ``Saturday Night Live'' model, ``The Daily
Show'' is structured basically like a regular newscast, with a half
hour of headline news, features and commentary. The features aim to
be far more absurd than the networks _ like a segment by Vance De
Generes (comedian Ellen's brother) on ``The Blackout of 2000,''
when Manhattan's Upper East Side experienced 20 minutes of reduced
power, which actually forced some people to turn off their
air-conditioners and reset their VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   In another feature, ``The Daily Show'' used the same video that
ABC News did in its account of a Russian immigrant family in
Brooklyn that is fighting to keep custody of a pet monkey named
Cookie. (The animal is a Cercopithecus diana monkey, which is an
endangered species.) But while ABC's Bill Blakemore offered a
sympathetic yet balanced report, Stewart didn't hide his
appreciation of the situation's absurdity. ``Experts across the
board support the state's position,'' he said, ``saying Cookie is a
rare beast of the wild who deserves to live as nature intended _ in
the Detroit Zoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the show's humorists are hard pressed to match the
eccentric wit of ABC's Robert Krulwich, whose excellent report on
the human genome uncovered the amazing overlap between humans and
other species _ not just chimpanzees, as expected, but cows,
roosters and baker's yeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Daily Show'' is also a talk show, with a live audience and
with a regular spot reserved for guests, most often actors,
musicians or writers on promotional tour. In these segments,
Stewart's humor is more piquant than acid, and he unashamedly fawns
over his sexy female guests while revealing embarrassing details
about his own childhood and dating life (or former dating life _ he
married recently). He was even nice and respectful to Joe Eszterhas
and let him read from his nasty book ``American Rhapsody.'' Still,
Stewart did greet the shaggy, overweight, unbuttoned guest with a
gentle barb. ``This looks like a parole meeting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's no small feat to pull off this eclectic vision of breaking
news, which relies on film clips and graphics to tell its stories.
In addition to its crew of field reporters and commentators, ``The
Daily Show'' has a large backstage contingent of writers, producers
and technicians. The show is sending 94 people to the Philadelphia
convention. But casting Stewart, who also writes much of his own
material, as the anchor 18 months ago _ replacing Craig Kilborn _
has proved to be the crucial ingredient to the 4-year-old program's
success. Ratings have increased 43 percent since he took over.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly his convention coverage won't be predictable. On the
day of the vice presidential announcement, Stewart showed a video
clip in which Bush explained his choice of Cheney, who had been
running the vice presidential screening process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed by the thoughtful and thorough way he
approached his mission,'' Bush said emotionally, ``and then I
realized the person who was best qualified to be my vice
presidential nominee was working by my side.''
</P>
<P>
   At that Stewart turned to the camera. ``And Bush added,'' he
said earnestly, ```and once (Cheney) took off his glasses and let
his hair down, I also realized he was beautiful.''' Who knows,
maybe the Republican Convention can be fun.

TORRICELLI DROPS HIS BID FOR NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to change `16 of the last 20 years' to `most of
the last two decades.') 
By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Just three weeks after throwing New Jersey's
Democratic Party into chaos by making a bid for governor of New
Jersey, Sen. Robert Torricelli abruptly abandoned the race Monday
after an array of prominent Democrats said they would not support
him.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, which is coordinating 32 Senate races across the nation,
had asserted that his national stature as a congressional power
broker gave Democrats the best chance to retake the governor's
mansion, which has been controlled by Republicans for most of the
last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But after prominent Democrats, including Mayor Sharpe James of
Newark, announced that they would endorse his rival, Jim McGreevey,
in the election next year, Torricelli said that he was ending his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli acknowledged Monday that he was ``humbled'' by his
failure to generate widespread grass-roots support, but said he
could not simultaneously run in a gubernatorial primary while
carrying out his duties heading Democratic Senate efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably somewhat naive,'' Torricelli said of his plan
to quickly win support from party leaders and wrest the nomination
from McGreevey before the Democratic National Convention in
mid-August. ``I thought that people would put their own interests
aside to work toward the goal of something larger.''
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey, who nearly defeated Gov. Christie Whitman in 1997,
has been working ever since to build support for another attempt at
the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   But many political experts said Torricelli himself was to blame
for his lukewarm reception by party leaders, whose support is
crucial in New Jersey primaries because they determine which
candidate's name appears on the party line. During his rapid ascent
in Washington, Torricelli's sharp tongue and hot temper have made
enemies of many Democrats who were only too eager to pay him back
by rallying behind McGreevey. Torricelli's widely publicized
investment in several private stock deals has also hurt his
standing among voters, according to recent public opinion polls.
And his 1996 Senate campaign, which is now entangled in a federal
investigation that has brought guilty pleas from six contributors,
was also a political liability, according to a private poll that
the state party conducted over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Zukin, a political science professor at Rutgers
University, said the decision to withdraw would seriously damage
Torricelli's standing within the party and would be at least a
temporary setback to any presidential ambitions he might harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a politician as seasoned as Torricelli, this is a huge
misstep,'' Zukin said. ``He put a number of powerful Democrats into
a very difficult position by entering this thing, which means he
was going for it. So for him to drop out, this is a fundamental
miscalculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli turned New Jersey politics upside down three weeks
ago, when he began lobbying county chairmen and labor leaders to
support his quest for the party's nomination for governor in 2001.
The governor's office in New Jersey, with broad powers, is
considered one of the most powerful in the country, and the post is
considered the supreme prize in state politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although McGreevey had already gathered the support of many
Democratic leaders and raised $3.2 million for the state party in
late June, Torricelli contended that his candidacy could unite the
state's Democratic Party, which is engaged in a feud so bitter that
leaders from South Jersey now refuse to meet with their
counterparts from North Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge, refused to be muscled
aside. With the help of his political patrons, state Sens. John A.
Lynch and Raymond J. Lesniak, McGreevey locked up the support of
the labor leaders and party chairmen he has courted assiduously
since 1997 and prevented Torricelli from gaining endorsements from
all seven counties in South Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli won the backing of some labor leaders and
endorsements in Camden, Morris, Bergen and Burlington counties. As
recently as last Friday, Torricelli's closest advisers predicted
that he would win the endorsement of party leaders in populous
Essex and Hudson counties early this week and gain a stranglehold
on the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But over the weekend, the state party's polling found that
McGreevey, who has run almost nonstop for the last six years, led
Torricelli among likely primary voters by 35 percent to 31 percent.
When asked whether the controversies surrounding the senator's
personal finances and campaign fund-raising would affect their
decision, more than 20 percent of likely voters said it would make
them less likely to support Torricelli, said a party official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   When James announced his endorsement Monday, along with other
Essex County leaders, including state Senate Minority Leader
Richard J. Codey, it was clear that Torricelli would face a bitter
and divisive primary. The state party chairman, Tom Giblin, said he
was grateful that Torricelli decided to withdraw rather than
further fracture the party, and said Democrats could now focus on
helping Al Gore win the state's presidential vote and electing Jon
Corzine to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite McGreevey's victory however, there were few signs that
the various factions of the party might resolve their differences
soon.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference announcing the endorsements, McGreevey,
42, took a swipe at Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party is greater than any individual's
political ambitions,'' he said. When Torricelli later withdrew from
the race, McGreevey did not return repeated telephone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his withdrawal from the race, Torricelli was
sparing in his praise for McGreevey and refused to offer an
endorsement. Instead, the senator mentioned two U.S.
representatives who might consider seeking the nomination, Bill
Pascrell and Frank Pallone, although most party leaders now
consider that unlikely.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Jeff Zucker, the executive producer of NBC News'
convention coverage, wanted a live interview Monday night from the
First Union Center with one of the event's most highly sought-after
guests: George P. Bush, the telegenic, 23-year-old nephew of the
Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   But to NBC officials' dismay, the Republicans turned down the
request, and not because young Bush is camera-shy. No, Zucker
contended, NBC was spurned because it was only covering the
proceedings in prime time Monday night on its cable channel, MSNBC,
which garners substantially lower ratings than the broadcast
network.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that ABC News was to provide a full hour and CBS News
at least 30 minutes of prime time coverage starting at 10 o'clock
Monday night knocked NBC down a few notches in the interview
pecking order, Zucker said. ``It's a game,'' he observed. ``They
have divvied out guests accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, after a reporter inquired about Zucker's
complaint, the Republicans informed NBC that they could have the
young man on the air, and spokesmen for both NBC and the convention
sought to play down the episode. But the incident was instructive
about a reality of the media hierarchy here: Cable television may
provide more coverage, but the broadcast networks are still the
kings.
</P>
<P>
   That enduring truism is reflected in the way the convention
program is structured: virtually all the major speeches this week,
from those of Laura Bush and Gen. Colin L. Powell on Monday night
and continuing with Sen. John McCain and Elizabeth Dole on Tuesday,
the vice presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, on Wednesday and Gov.
George W. Bush on Thursday, are to take place between 10 p.m. and
11 p.m. That just happens to be the hour on every night that one or
more of the over-the-air networks will be covering the Philadelphia
proceedings live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is geared for the 10 to 11 o'clock hour,'' said Tom
Hannon, the political director of CNN. ``They're obsessed about
getting their message across in the 10 to 11 hour, and that is
their driving concern. People say that the conventions are for
cable, but as far as the parties are concerned, the conventions are
for the most eyeballs they can get.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting aims of the parties and the networks have led to
an odd standoff: as the conventions become ever more scripted and
ever less newsworthy in the strictest journalistic sense, the
networks become ever less interested in covering them. Yet the
conventions vie for the network cameras as vigorously as ever, and
the networks still show up in vast numbers, but with scaled back
prime-time coverage plans.
</P>
<P>
   According to Thomas E. Patterson, a Harvard professor of
government and the press, convention coverage on ABC, NBC and CBS
has declined from 50 total hours in 1976 to 12 hours in 1996, and
this year, he reported, that total may dwindle to 10 hours. He told
a conference here on Saturday, sponsored by the Harvard's Joan
Shorenstein Center on the Press, that if the networks were to
abandon the conventions altogether, the audience for the gatherings
would be cut in half. In 1976, the conventions had an average
prime-time rating of 28; by 1996 it had dropped to about 17.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Patterson did not place all the blame for the erosion of
network attention on the broadcasters. ``The parties need to loosen
up a bit, and allow for a little more conflict and spontaneity,''
he said, adding that recent polls show that ``those who might be
expected to watch said it's the lack of suspense that's keeping
them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even keeping awake could be a problem. Zucker, who has been
detached from his normal producing duties at the ``Today'' program
to oversee the party gatherings, seemed a bit underwhelmed Monday
at the prospect of supplying four nights of coverage, principally
on MSNBC, the network's cable channel. NBC will also cover the
proceedings on its flagship channel on Wednesday and Thursday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting Monday afternoon in an air conditioned trailer,
Zucker and Elizabeth O'Connell, the news executive producer of
special events, gave out assignments to the correspondents for the
night of cable coverage _ David Bloom was to answer viewers' e-mail
from the floor, for example _ and presented an overall theme for
the three-hour program, the ``soft side of the Republican party.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were to fan out and report on the conservative bent of
the delegates and try to score interviews with more coveted
Republican luminaries. (George P. is widely considered a
significant ``get,'' as are the presumptive nominee's parents, who
were to appear on MSNBC Monday night.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the event does not exactly enthrall Zucker. ``I'm not
sure it's not a colossal waste of time and money,'' he said after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker is not a lone voice. Many in the news business, both in
print and broadcast, mutter to one another about the gargantuan
size of the press corps here _ 15,000 plus, or more than 7 for
every delegate _ and the puniness of the story. ``Great drama and
great TV and great journalism are built on conflict,'' Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans seem unfazed about the lack of drama. Their big
worry is to keep up the pace and make sure they exploit the
television moment. On the convention floor Monday, Ed Gillespie, a
Bush adviser who had been working on the convention for six weeks,
was preoccupied with the endless logistics. Between cell phone
calls placed to find one of the evening program's participants, he
explained that the schedule was merely the most rational use of
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the featured speakers are in the 10 o'clock hour,'' he
said, ``and that's the point at which the most people will see the
Republican convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannon said that from his vantage point, Republican operatives
are not about to start worrying about filling that hour with
breaking news. ``These guys are in the business of knowing who
their audience is,'' he said, even if their focus on packaging may
be overblown. ``Bob Dole lost in '96,'' he added, ``but they still
think they had a great convention.''

SPORTS COLUMN: RIDING THE WAYVE IN A TRADING FRENZY
</HEADLINE>
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trade deadline is supposed to be for contenders. Does that
mean the Chicago Cubs, who traded for Rondell White, consider
themselves contenders?
</P>
<P>
   Only four games from first place when Monday night's games
began, the Cincinnati Reds suddenly appear to be contenders. Does
that mean they blundered by trading their No. 1 starter, Denny
Neagle, for four minor leaguers a few weeks ago?
</P>
<P>
   Why do the Atlanta Braves consistently make brilliant trades?
Why were they able to extract B.J. Surhoff, a solid veteran, from
Baltimore when the Yankees could not?
</P>
<P>
   The deadline passed at 4 p.m. Monday so it's safe to come up for
air, at least until later this month when contenders begin making
waiver deals in time to make players eligible for postseason
rosters. But Monday's dizzying flurry of trades that climaxed a
four-day cascade of deals was stunning.
</P>
<P>
   Teams made nine trades involving 29 players, outdoing Friday's
flurry of activity that produced six trades involving 25 players.
Adding in the weekend activity, teams traded 69 players in 20
transactions, ensuring good scorecard sales all over the country in
the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds did not join the list of traders Monday, though it was
not for a lack of trying. They were part of discussions that, if
concluded successfully, would have produced a four-team trade that
would have plunked Pedro Astacio into the Reds' starting rotation.
Astacio, whom the Yankees had also pursued, would have replaced
Neagle, whom the Yankees successfully pursued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to sign Neagle and we couldn't so we traded him,''
said General Manager Jim Bowden of the Reds. ``Same with Larkin. We
didn't want to get stuck with draft choices who might never play in
the majors. We traded two, signed one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden referred to Barry Larkin, who was at Shea Stadium Monday
night as the Reds' shortstop. Had he accepted the trade the teams
made, he would have been the Mets' shortstop, but he didn't and
instead signed a contract extension, which the Reds had said they
would not give him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to sign them or trade them,'' Bowden said. He
added that he was not second-guessing himself for Neagle now that
the Reds had improved their playoff chances. ``We'd do it again,''
he said. ``We know we don't have to worry about free agents
leaving. The same team can come back next year and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden went after Astacio because he is signed beyond this year
and could have been traded elsewhere next winter. Besides the Reds
and the Colorado Rockies, the four-way trade would have included
Toronto and Oakland. Presumably, in a pitcher-studded transaction,
Kevin Appier would have gone from Oakland to Toronto, Chris
Carpenter from Toronto to Colorado, Astacio from Colorado to
Cincinnati and Scott Williamson from Cincinnati to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just one of the thousands of discussions that never
reached fruition. Another was the Yankees' desire to place White in
left field. First they wanted him, then they were wary of a damaged
knee, then they were said to have made a late bid Sunday to get
him. By then, however, the Cubs had struck opportunistically.
Despite the fact that the Cubs had won 15 of their previous 19
games and had leaped from 16 1/2 games from first to 8 1/2, they
did not obtain White with the idea of contending for the National
League Central championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very much were focused on making ourselves as competitive
as possible for 2001 and beyond,'' said Andy MacPhail, back in the
trenches as the Cubs' acting general manager. ``While a player on
the disabled list could be a risk for a contender, it's not a risk
for us. We felt we had a unique opportunity to land a high-caliber
player who can help us be a competitive team from 2001 forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, however, did not want to take White without working
out a contract extension. He rejected a four-year offer, but the
Cubs exercised his 2001 option for $4 million, then agreed to a
two-year, $14 million extension that White, if he has 502 plate
appearances next season, can accept or reject, which would allow
him to become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   In last Friday's trading frenzy, the Cleveland Indians, a
distant second in their quest to win a sixth successive division
title, turned over 20 percent of their roster in a matter of hours.
The Braves, who have a solid division lead, have nevertheless
created the same ratio of change in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They traded for Andy Ashby for their starting rotation, they
signed Scott Kamieniecki and Stan Belinda, who had recently been
released, for their bullpen, they claimed Paul Bako to be a backup
catcher and Monday they acquired Surhoff for the outfield position
that Reggie Sanders did not fill as they had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Surhoff trade was just another example of the brilliant work
John Schuerholz has done as the Braves' general manager. (Part of
his work was not trading John Rocker to Cleveland, a deal that had
been reported as having been virtually done.) The Yankees wanted
Surhoff but did not satisfy the Orioles' desires or demands. The
Braves did.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are the feelings of the Baltimore owner, Peter Angelos,
toward his Yankee counterpart, George Steinbrenner, had something
to do with the Orioles' decision to send Surhoff to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The decision affects the Mets as much as it does the Yankees.
Surhoff's presence in the Braves' lineup will make them tougher for
the Mets to catch.

   PHILADELPHIA _ Thousands of Republican activists walked into the
maw of the Philadelphia convention Monday to begin their
reprocessing. They arrived here as well-to-do white conservatives,
a number of whom think trigger locks are unconstitutional and
Social Security is a socialist scheme. But by Thursday night they
are going to be nothing but a big, squishy bowl of inclusion that
likes big hugs all around.
</P>
<P>
   Their reorientation program, otherwise known as the Republican
National Convention, consists mainly of listening to: (a) blacks
and Latinos talking about upward mobility; (b) white women talking
about tax cuts; (c) the kinds of celebrities Bob Dole was
complaining about in 1996; and (d) single moms, people who have
overcome disabilities, people who are at least taking regular
medication.
</P>
<P>
   After an opening program that included a blind man who recited
the Pledge of Allegiance (``He has climbed four of the world's
highest mountains.''), a black woman who sang ``The Star-Spangled
Banner'' (``Gloria is a well-known and forceful advocate for the
homeless.'') and a Latino party activist who cried ``Puerto Rico I
love you!,'' the delegates settled back to wait for the evening's
big prime-time hour, which differed from what preceded in that the
people on the platform were famous women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In producing a convention that looks like America, George W.
Bush has manufactured one that looks nothing whatsoever like his
party. It's going to be hard to top the woman who ``won the Miss
America pageant with an insulin pump under her evening gown.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention did grudgingly provide a few minutes of
cable-only air time Monday to some of the Republican candidates
from hotly contested districts. The Senate hopefuls were hopefully
off-message _ middle-aged white men in suits complaining about
their opponents, liberal judges and Hillary Clinton's health care
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of abortion and gun control, the platform has been
rewritten to cover all bases while offending no feelings. In one
stroke of genius, the framers scrapped the old, noninclusive call
for elimination of the Department of Education and the National
Endowment for the Arts in favor of: ``There are too many
departments and agencies.'' Who could argue with that? And who
could not agree with Tommy Thompson, the platform committee
chairman, who told the convention, ``Our title says it all:
Renewing America's Purpose Together.''
</P>
<P>
   In their drive to refashion themselves into nonthreatening
winners, Republicans are laying waste to anything that's left of
the English language as a meaningful political tool. As a public
speaker, Bush is naturally incoherent, and his genius is his
ability to sound both sincere and indecipherable. ``If you don't
know what you're supposed to know, we'll make sure you do early
before it's too late,'' he said the other day, discussing education
policy in Kentucky. He's still out campaigning in the heartland,
making his way slowly, slowly toward Philadelphia. The crowds are
enthusiastic, and the message is invariable: If you breathe, here's
your man.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who think power resides in Washington
and that's where the most important people are,'' said Rep. Anne
Northup at a rally in Louisville. ``But the truth is, the most
important people are every American, up and down every street.
These are the people that go to work every day. They care about
their children.''
</P>
<P>
   This seems a little tough on the important people who live in
Washington. (None of whom, of course, have anything whatsoever to
do with this convention. The skyboxes are reserved solely for the
homeless.) Do high-priced lobbyists not bleed? Do they not get up
and go to work every day, and hug their children at night?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this convention hasn't had much to say about lobbyists
_ except one really nifty swipe by Gen. Colin Powell. They've been
lumped in with the Christian right's agenda as the Reality That
Dare Not Speak Its Name.
</P>
<P>
   There are still a few people worried about John McCain's
prime-time moment Tuesday night. McCain has fallen in the tank for
the Bush campaign so often over the last few days that his suit is
shrinking. But what would happen if his evil spirit took over and
he launched into a bout of truth-telling about the relationship
between the Republican Party and big money?
</P>
<P>
   At this convention, not much. Everybody would probably start
singing ``Michael, Row the Boat Ashore,'' and drown him out.

EDITORIAL: ISRAEL'S FRACTIOUS PARLIAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 1:
</P>
<P>
   In a series of votes Monday, Israel's parliament made clear its
uneasiness over peace talks with the Palestinians. But at the end
of the day, Prime Minister Ehud Barak remains in office with a
chance to revive the compromises discussed at the failed Camp David
summit meetings if the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, shows
more flexibility on Jerusalem. Polls show that Israeli voters are
far more willing than their elected representatives to support
reasonable compromises as the price of a durable peace.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament's biggest surprise was Moshe Katsav's upset of Shimon
Peres for the largely ceremonial office of president. Peres, a
former prime minister and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, was an
architect of the Oslo peace agreement with the Palestinians in
1993. He is one of the last active members of Israel's founding
generation and has made great contributions to Israel's development
and its survival during his six decades in political life.
</P>
<P>
   Peres' presidential candidacy was backed by Barak's One Israel
Party and seemed assured of a majority. But he fell four votes
short in the secret ballot election and lost to Katsav, a veteran
of the conservative Likud Party. As president, Katsav will receive
credentials from diplomats, issue pardons recommended by the
government and carry out other honorary functions. Born in Iran, he
is Israel's first president with non-European origins, a welcome
advance for a group long excluded from the top ranks of the Israeli
political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Of more immediate political significance were two failed votes
of no confidence in the Barak government. Various parties are
unhappy with some of the concessions discussed at Camp David, like
turning over up to 90 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian rule
and allowing some Palestinian sovereignty within Jerusalem. But
they could not muster the required 61 votes, in part because these
parties fear new elections would erode their current strength.
</P>
<P>
   Although Barak survived, he mustered only about 50 votes in his
favor from the 120-seat parliament, a disturbingly low level of
support, and not nearly enough to pass crucial legislation. He will
have to use the three-month parliamentary recess that begins later
this week to reorganize his Cabinet and rebuild his coalition.
Barak's challenge is to convert the clear support for peace in the
country into a stable parliamentary majority.

DR. RENE FAVALORO, 77, HEART SURGERY PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIC NAGOURNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Rene G. Favaloro, a pioneer in heart-bypass surgery and a
revered figure in Argentina, was found dead on Saturday at his home
in Buenos Aires. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The police said his death appeared to have been a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Favaloro, who left a successful career in the United States to
create a top-level teaching clinic in his home country, was
distraught over his hospital's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a carpenter and a dressmaker from a small town in
Argentina, Favaloro achieved renown on Nov. 30, 1967, when he
performed an operation at the Cleveland Clinic on a patient with a
potentially deadly coronary artery blockage.
</P>
<P>
   After stopping the heart, Favaloro took a section of vein from
the patient's leg and sewed one end to his aorta. Then, much the
way a driver might use a side road to go around a traffic jam,
Favaloro attached the other end to the blocked artery, beyond the
blockage.
</P>
<P>
   That was not, as it turned out, the first time for the
procedure. After Favaloro, a little-known surgeon, had announced
his results, two prominent surgeons said they had already performed
the procedure. One, Dr. David C. Sabiston Jr. of Duke University,
performed the first, in 1962. Two years later, Dr. H. Edward
Garrett, an associate of Dr. Michael DeBakey, performed another.
</P>
<P>
   Those operations had been done in response to deteriorating
conditions on the operating table. Favaloro's procedure was
planned. It was also the first to be reported in a medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really the person who should get credit for introducing
coronary bypass into the clinical arena,'' said Dr. Robert H.
Jones, a professor of surgery at Duke who was a friend of Favaloro.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the operation, Favaloro returned to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Geronimo Favaloro was born on July 14, 1923, the son of
Juan B. Favaloro and Ida Y. Raffaelli. The lone member of the
family to have a university education, according to The Times of
London, was an uncle who was a doctor, and Rene was inspired to
follow his path.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from medical school, he agreed to fill in for
several months for an ailing country surgeon in Jacinto Arauz, an
impoverished village 300 miles west of the capital. Twelve years
passed before he made his way to the Cleveland Clinic where,
despite lacking some credentials, he was taken on as, essentially,
an apprentice, according to Dr. Delos M. Cosgrove, co-chairman of
the heart center at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   When Favaloro returned to Argentina, he set to work raising
money for a $55 million heart clinic. After it was completed in the
early 90s, he treated thousands of patients, often for no charge,
and trained hundreds of surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   He received numerous entreaties to run for president and was a
member of a commission formed in 1983 to investigate the
disappearance of more than 6,000 Argentines under the military
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, fortunes began to sour. Favaloro's wife, the
former Maria A. Delgado, died several years ago. The couple had no
children.
</P>
<P>
   The finances of the Favaloro Foundation, as the hospital was
known, became grim. About a year ago, Cosgrove recalled, his friend
told him that he could not make it to Toronto for an important
medical conference, because of financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, according to Reuters, Favaloro told Health
Minister Hector Lombardo that his clinic was having serious
financial problems. In a recent letter to the editor of La Nacion,
the newspaper, he said other hospitals and state-owned medical
centers owed the foundation $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going through the saddest period of my life,'' he wrote.
``In the most recent times, I have been turned into a beggar.''
</P>
<P>
   Favaloro's secretary found his body in the bathroom of his
apartment. There was a wound to his chest. A gun was nearby.

STEPHEN KING PROMISES TO CONTINUE E-TALE AFTER NEAR BREAK-EVEN IN
FIRST WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A week into the horror writer Stephen King's closely watched
experiment with self-publishing on the Internet, King said Monday
that he is about to break even.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers are eager to see how many people download the first
chapter of King's new electronic novel, ``The Plant,'' about a
vampiric vine's assault on a publishing house, in part because the
venture tests the proposition that marketing and distribution via
the Web can reduce authors' dependence on conventional publishers,
at least for famous writers with plenty of money and fans.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on his Web site, King estimated that readers
downloaded 152,132 copies in the first seven days, and he promised
that he would continue writing new installments, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   He had asked readers voluntarily to pay him a dollar for each
chapter downloaded, and had said he would stop writing if he did
not receive payments for 75 percent of them. But King reported that
116,200 had paid or promised to pay, meeting his threshold to
continue writing. He said 93,200 had already paid by credit card
through Amazon.com, which is collecting for him.
</P>
<P>
   Estimating the proportion of downloads by readers who are paying
required some finesse, said William Thornton, who operates the
site. He said that readers had downloaded a total of 227,000
copies, but some were lost to user error and had to be repeated. To
account for repeats, King adjusted his assessment down to a number
he considered ``fair,'' Thornton said.
</P>
<P>
   After just seven days, ``The Plant'' will soon be in the black.
King said he spent about $124,150 on his self-publishing effort,
including two advertisements, in Publishers Weekly and USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Conxion Corp., a computer server company that is
handling the downloads, said each download cost less than 2 cents.
With $116,000 in payments promised, after seven days King is out
roughly $10,000. He has few additional costs, and will soon be
earning a profit on his experiment.
</P>
<P>
   On his Web site, King estimated that if he wrote 10 or 11
chapters, his readers might ultimately download 1,673,452
individual installments and pay him a dollar for each. ``Do the
math,'' he wrote. ``It's pretty good math, if people keep coming
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The next installment appears this month.

EDITORIAL: IMAGE AND REALITY ON EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Aug. 1:
</P>
<P>
   The first of four theme nights at the Republican Party's
meticulously planned national convention focused on what has become
George W. Bush's signature issue _ education, particularly
education for young, poor children. In terms of giving this
convention a softer and more inclusive feel, this was a wise
choice. Yet it also illuminated the central paradox of a conclave
marking Bush's emergence as the party's trend-setter. On the one
hand, the vast convention hall was positively awash in soaring
language and inspiring individual success stories designed to
highlight Bush's signature promise that no child, no matter how
disadvantaged, would be left behind. On the other hand, the same
delegates who cheered this vision in prime time had earlier
ratified a platform that defines a narrower, less generous world in
which the federal government has virtually no role to play in
shaping the country's educational future.
</P>
<P>
   This paradox revolves around a fundamental question about Bush's
candidacy, a question he can go a long way toward answering in his
acceptance speech Thursday night. Does his noble rhetoric about
compassionate conservatism spring from a genuine determination to
lead his party toward a more activist role in education, or is it
just empty salesmanship? Based on the numbers, the rank-and-file
seems willing to be led. In a New York Times survey of delegates to
this convention, 26 percent ranked education the No. 1 issue in
their states, whereas four years ago the economy was No. 1 for the
same number, and education received a measly 2 percent. Yet it was
not clear whether they were prepared to spend more money on the
problem than their leaders in Congress, who for the last eight
years have often tried to cut education spending.
</P>
<P>
   True to Bush's desire to convey optimism on even the most
difficult issues, last night's menu of speeches and visuals was
relentlessly upbeat and demographically inclusive _ a fourth-grade
teacher from North Carolina discussing math and science, a video
from a largely Hispanic school in El Paso, brief testimonials to
the virtues of parental involvement and after-school enrichment,
and a speech by his wife, Laura, about her experience as a teacher
and their joint commitment to education. The evening was topped off
by an inspirational testimonial to community and volunteer service
from probably the most popular Republican in America, Gen. Colin
Powell.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of the platform was quite different. At Bush's
insistence, the committee dropped a harsh and long-standing
provision calling for the abolition of the Department of Education.
The document also quoted lofty pledges that under a Bush presidency
no American child would be ``segregated by low expectations,
imprisoned by illiteracy, abandoned to frustration and the darkness
of self-doubt.'' Yet when the document turned to substance, it
pointed in a direction opposite to that proclaimed in Bush's
oratory. The platform insisted that ``the role of the federal
government must be progressively limited as we return control to
parents, teachers and local school boards.'' The platform then goes
on to extol remedies like those celebrated in Monday night's
displays _ charter schools, parental involvement and the like _
while writing off Title I, the main federal program aimed at
disadvantaged children, as a $120 billion failure.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the only person in Philadelphia who can fix this
disconnect. This is a nation in which a lot of children are in
trouble _ 11 million with no health insurance and nearly 13
million, one in five, living in poverty, untouched by the present
prosperity. Head Start could handle 1 million more eligible
children with more generous financing. It may be too much to expect
Bush to redesign his proposed $1.3 trillion in tax cuts in order to
pay for these and similarly worthy ventures. But even those who no
longer doubt the sincerity of his belief that no child should be
left behind have a perfect right to ask him how he means to balance
the scales.
