METS DEFEAT BREWERS, 7-2 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Other than the absence of walks, Hideo Nomo looked
pretty much like the Hideo Nomo the New York Mets had released in
spring training, not the revitalized right-hander who carried a 9-3
record into Monday night's game for the Milwaukee Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Reed, meanwhile, finally looked like the Rick Reed of the
last two seasons and very little like the slumping right-hander he
has been for most of this year for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo (9-4) allowed six runs in five innings, including solo home
runs by Robin Ventura, Darryl Hamilton and Mike Piazza, while Reed
(10-3) allowed two runs in seven strong innings. As a result, the
Mets pulled into a first-place tie with the Atlanta Braves in the
National League East with a 7-2 victory at County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which pushed the Mets a season-high 21 games over
.500 at 64-43, may have proved costly, however. After raising his
average to .318 with a single and a double, Rickey Henderson left
the game after the top of the third inning with a strained right
hip.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's condition was listed as day to day. Shawon Dunston,
in his first appearance with the Mets, took Henderson's place in
left field.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in his family was happy that the Mets had acquired
Dunston from the St. Louis Cardinals just before the nonwaiver
trading deadline on Saturday night. Everyone except the 36-year-old
Dunston, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because I'm the player,'' said Dunston, who grew up a
die-hard Mets fan in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn.
That is where Dunston will live with his parents for the rest of
this season, but it was clear he would rather be in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Stability was the main issue, said Dunston, who lives in
northern California in the off season. But after speaking with his
father, Jack, on Sunday, Dunston decided to report to the Mets,
which he did on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like my father told me, `You were stable for 12 years in
Chicago,''' Dunston said. ```You're not the only player ever to be
traded. They traded Willie Mays. They've traded a lot better
players than you. You're just another player to be traded.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are Dunston's eighth organization since 1995, including
two stints apiece with the Giants and the Cubs. ``The business part
is kind of difficult,'' Dunston said. ``But my father put it in
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets owe Dunston's father. Henderson left Monday night's
game after legging out a third-inning double. The 40-year-old
Henderson barely made it to third with a headfirst slide on a fly
ball to right and removed himself after being stranded there.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were up, 2-0, at the time, thanks to the bungling
Brewers defense. Henderson had led off the game with an infield hit
when Nomo fielded his grounder up the line, then tagged first
baseman Mark Loretta instead of tagging Henderson or touching the
base, which Loretta was standing on.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson then stole second and scored on Edgardo Alfonzo's
double. Alfonzo took third on John Olerud's groundout to second,
then scored when Jose Valentin tried to backhand Piazza's grounder
at shortstop. Valentin's glove came up too soon, the ball went into
left-center field and the Mets had a two-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was still 2-0 when Ventura and Hamilton _ in his second game
with the Mets _ belted consecutive home runs off Nomo to open the
fourth. One out later, Rey Ordonez singled to left. Reed sacrificed
him to second, and Dunston lined a run-scoring single in his first
at-bat with the Mets to give Reed a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Jenkins homered off Reed in the fourth inning to make it
5-1. But Piazza answered with a solo homer of his own, his 22d, in
the fifth to restore the five-run lead. And even though Reed was
touched for another run in the bottom of the fifth, the Mets still
led, 6-2.

RETAILER SEES ONLINE SHOE STORE AS WAY TO GROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas Lt. Gov. Gary Sherrer was there Wednesday when Topeka,
Kan.-based Payless ShoeSource formally launched www.payless.com,
the company's new storefront on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Sherrer talked about the pressure that e-commerce is placing on
traditional businesses and said those businesses have to adapt and
not be afraid to change.
</P>
<P>
   The Payless site was built by Payless employees, the Systems
Integration division of IBM Global Services and Organic Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The site puts the company's self-service shoe store concept
online, letting shoppers on the Web browse by size. Online
customers can return or exchange purchases at any Payless
ShoeSource location in the United States, and they can download a
$2 in-store coupon from the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payless.com gives the company another opportunity to
strengthen its brand, and provides Payless ShoeSource with a new
platform for growth,'' said Ken C. Hicks, Payless president.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the explosion of Internet shopping reaches more and more
families, we strongly believe we can maintain our position as the
leader in delivering high-quality, fashionable shoes _ both online
and in-store,'' said Rhonda Wells, director of e-commerce for
Payless.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out lots of people have ideas about free services
available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Several readers gave a thumbs-up to free Internet service
provider (www.netzero.net. NetZero, based in California, places a
small box outside a user's Web browser that flashes ads every 15
seconds in exchange for free Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Quinn wrote to say that he'd tried several local low-cost
providers, had problems and eventually tried NetZero.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has four local access numbers and I rarely get a busy
signal,'' Quinn said. ``NetZero, for me, is great.''
</P>
<P>
   A reader named Dave left a voice mail endorsing NetZero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had it for a couple of months and it works pretty well.
You have to look at the advertising, but it's free,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn also said he uses www.juno.com, a free e-mail service that
doesn't require a user to have an Internet account.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry and Bill Shereck of Shawnee wrote to say they share photos
over the Web free using www.PhotoPoint.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We post pics of family, friends, and what's going on with us,
birthdays...'' the Sherecks said. ``Our family and friends are in
Chicago, Fort Worth, Minneapolis...West Coast to East Coast. Saves
the time of e-mails, and they can look them up again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site allows users to e-mail their photos to the
PhotoPoint server, add captions, organize them into albums, and
send out announcements to their friends and family. The photos can
be kept private, for certain users only, or shared with anyone who
visits the PhotoPoint site.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of free stuff out on the Web. This isn't one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version of the ``big corporations will give you free
money'' e-mail rumor involves IBM. The e-mail contends that
``Hewlett-Packard and Gateway have just merged to form the biggest
computer supplier in the world! Bigger than Dell, bigger than IBM,
bigger than them all!
</P>
<P>
   ``In response to this amazing merger, IBM has set aside 250,000
free computers to reward and keep its most loyal and trusted
customers! I've already got mine, read on to see how you can get
yours!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Gateway and H-P haven't merged. And IBM isn't offering free
computers with 19-inch monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The bogus chain letter is a variation on a theme, such as the
one that went around awhile back saying Microsoft boss Bill Gates
would send you money if you forwarded an e-mail to a certain number
of friends.
</P>
<P>
   At least I guess it was bogus. Bill never sent me anything.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
It's as certain as the sunrise. Place the Sacramento Monarchs on
the same court with the Comets, and there will be an entertaining
fight right down to the wire.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The teams battled for a full 40 minutes Monday night at Compaq
Center. And for the second time in three meetings this season, the
Comets breathed a heavy sigh of relief in the end, escaping with a
75-70 triumph before a crowd of 10,668.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Swoopes and Cynthia Cooper teamed up for 48 points as the
Comets ran their record to 20-4 and extended their lead in the
Western Conference to three games over second-place Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Thompson reached 1,000 points in her career, scoring 10 to
climb to 1,007. She also did an admirable job of defending
Sacramento's Yolanda Griffith, the second-leading scorer and No. 1
rebounder in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets employed a transition defense that kept the Monarchs'
frantic run-and-gun attack in check for most of the contest and
turned 16 Sacramento turnovers into 22 points. Still, they had to
fight and claw to get past the most improved team in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just great basketball when you can have a team play as
tough as Sacramento did tonight and still we come away with a
win,'' said Cooper, who scored 18 of her 22 points in the second
half. ``Really, down the stretch, they never gave up, and we never
gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that way when the teams met July 11 at Compaq Center, the
Comets running up a 23-point lead over the first 20 minutes, then
hanging on to post a 68-63 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs are no longer candidates for the Western Conference
cellar or any position close to it, unlike their first two years in
the league during which Cooper once exploited them for a
league-record 44 points in one game.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento is a terror on the perimeter with Kedra Holland-Corn
and Ruthie Bolton-Holifield, strong on defense and dominant on the
backboards now that Griffith has come over from the American
Basketball League to set up camp in the middle of the lane.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets, led by 26 points from Swoopes, built nine-point
leads in the first and second halves but never could rest
completely until the final buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems we have talked about so much,'' said
Comets coach Van Chancellor, ``is that the expectations for this
team are so high, when another team comes back on us it's always
something that we did wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't necessarily the case tonight. Sacramento made some
really good plays. And they are just a handful for us.''
</P>
<P>
   That was especially true of Griffith, who had 10 rebounds,
including four off the offensive glass. The Monarchs threatened to
use 14 offensive boards as the springboard to another upset over
the Comets, just as they had done in a 74-63 home triumph in June.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffith had to struggle against the defense of Thompson to
get her 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton-Holifield, meanwhile, continued to be one of the bigger
pests with which the Comets have had to cope. She and Tangela Smith
were a particularly large headache down the stretch as the Monarchs
fought back from a 53-44 deficit near the middle of the second half
to go ahead 64-62 with 6:14 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The two-point edge came courtesy of Bolton-Holifield (16 points)
on one of her 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper, who scored eight straight points as the Comets built
their nine-point second-half edge, came through with a pair of free
throws that gave the Comets the lead for good at 65-64.
</P>
<P>
   Following Bolton-Holifield's trey, Sacramento turned the ball
over four times _ once on a shot-clock violation _ and missed six
consecutive field-goal attempts. But while the Monarchs, who had
lost three of their previous four games, may have been sputtering,
they were hardly dead.
</P>
<P>
   A trey by Holland-Corn off an inbounds pass pulled Sacramento
within 72-67 with 34.6 seconds left. That scene was revisited with
24.3 seconds remaining as Smith, usually a liability from 3-point
range, took an inbounds pass and knocked one down as the Monarchs
closed within 73-70.
</P>
<P>
   But Swoopes sank a pair of free throws to close the scoring, and
the final seconds ticked off with Cooper clutching the ball with a
look of satisfaction on her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, I just felt like me,'' said Cooper. ``I
felt like the old me. A lot of people are saying different things
about me, but I felt like me again. I was getting the ball, I was
getting it at the right times, and I was able to do my thing.''

WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES CONTINUE TO FIGHT UNEMPLOYMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Randy Hariton's ``reasonable accommodation''
dangles from a cord around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Hariton, considered legally blind, sometimes peers through a
small magnifying glass _ which he brought from home _ to read
printed material.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Haley, Hariton's manager at PC Plus in Lenexa, also
provides a 17-inch monitor for Hariton's use.
</P>
<P>
   That's what it took to integrate one worker with a disability
into one workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Randy can do the work. That's all that matters,'' Haley
said.
</P>
<P>
   But, nine years after the Americans with Disabilities Act was
passed to reduce workplace barriers for persons with disabilities,
many employers aren't saying the same thing. They don't have
experience in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The act guarantees workers with disabilities the right to
``reasonable accommodation'' to help them perform the essential
functions of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Because of publicity about big-dollar discrimination lawsuits
and expensive work site accommodations, advocates for workers with
disabilities say most employers fear recruiting or hiring employees
with physical or mental impairments.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 Census Bureau's Current Population Survey found that
less than one-third of the nation's 16 million working-age,
non-institutionalized persons with disabilities were employed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the National Organization on Disability Harris Poll
found that only three out of 10 working-age adults with
disabilities were employed full or part time, compared with eight
out of 10 persons without disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the Harris Poll found, three out of four of the
unemployed adults with disabilities said they wanted to be working.
</P>
<P>
   The national Job Accommodation Network has found that 20 percent
of the time, reasonable accommodations for workers with
disabilities have cost the employer nothing; 60 percent of the
accommodations cost less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers with disabilities say the greatest barrier to
mainstream employment isn't financial. It's attitudinal.
</P>
<P>
   A professional woman who describes herself as severely deaf has
been looking for a job in the Kansas City area for months. She has
excellent corporate experience and good references, but she isn't
getting past the interview stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read speech, so many people have no idea they're
interviewing someone with a disability,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say until the end of the interview that I can't hear
well. Suddenly, the door that seemed to be swinging wide open
shuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman's references tell her that when they receive calls
from potential employers, the questions focus on her disability
rather than her work. Those questions could be considered
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   According to the act and subsequent case law, prospective
employers may ask job candidates if they require any special
accommodations to perform the tasks as described. Interviewers are
not supposed to ask applicants if they have disabilities that might
impair their abilities to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who is severely deaf requires special telephones but
otherwise functions in the corporate world because of her ability
to read lips.
</P>
<P>
   Still, workers who are deaf often report difficulty dealing with
co-workers who seemed to be uncomfortable under their direct gazes
or who misjudged their lack of conversation as a lack of teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   That's why some workers with disabilities applaud corporate
diversity training but criticize it for sometimes failing to go far
enough. They say organizations also should teach nondisabled
workers how to interact with disabled persons.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates contend such education might help reduce the number of
complaints filed against employers. As of the 1998 fiscal year,
91,000 complaints had been filed.
</P>
<P>
   The chasm separating skilled workers with disabilities from
mainstream employers is large, but some bridges are being built.
</P>
<P>
   Some organizations are expanding diversity training from a focus
on race and gender. Others are reaching out to sheltered workshops
and schools to find trained or trainable staff members.
</P>
<P>
   One Kansas City example that has earned national acclaim is the
integration of persons referred from IBS Industries Inc., a
sheltered workshop, to a General Services Administration
requisition office. Workers there have won productivity and
accuracy awards for their data entry.
</P>
<P>
   Another bridge was crafted by Alternative Resources Corp.'s
REACH program. ARC is a nationwide staffing services company that
specializes in technology-related jobs. Its REACH program places
persons with disabilities into technical-job openings posted by
ARC's clients.
</P>
<P>
   ARC's REACH program is what brought Randy Hariton to PC Plus.
The staffing service was prepared to provide any accommodation that
might be needed, though in Hariton's case none was.
</P>
<P>
   David Grant, ARC's project support specialist in Kansas City,
said the staffing service works with area vocational rehabilitation
groups and government offices to identify people for work force
mainstreaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of businesses fear the ADA and getting into trouble,''
Grant said. ``Knowledge is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that knowledge includes awareness of tax breaks, federal
funding for training, and assistive technology for workers with
disabilities, Grant said. Grants can be directed to employers,
rehab centers, staffing services or sheltered workshops.
</P>
<P>
   There remains plenty of legal wiggle room about what is a
disability and what is a reasonable accommodation. The U.S. Supreme
Court this summer continued to narrow the definitions by saying, in
essence, that correctable or corrected disabilities did not have
the same protection under the act.
</P>
<P>
   Experts remind business owners that, because interpretations of
the law are evolving, it's wise to obtain counsel from labor
lawyers or human resource experts when dealing with
disability-related employment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite continued worries and questions, the Society for Human
Resource Management reports positive views from employers who are
experienced hirers of persons with disabilities. The employers cite
employee loyalty and willingness to work as key attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, 87 percent of businesses that hired people with
disabilities told Mason-Dixon pollsters they would encourage other
employers to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Count Haley, Randy Hariton's supervisor at PC Plus, among the
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this month, Hariton won't have a job through the
staffing service company anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hiring Randy full time,'' Haley said.

 COMPLAINTS ABOUT HMOs RISE 49 PERCENT IN MISSOURI  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Missouri Department of Insurance received
580 complaints about health maintenance organizations last year, up
49 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Insurance spokesman Randy McConnell attributed the
higher number of complaints last year partly to consumer education
provisions of the 1997 Missouri managed-care legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance regulators said the highest number of complaints last
year, 266, involved denials of claims. The department received 162
complaints related to claim denials the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997-98 HMO complaint index is available from the department.
The index gives HMOs a rating of 100 if the department received a
``normally expected'' number of complaints about them, based on the
HMO's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   A rating of less than 100 is considered better than average, and
a rating of greater than 100 signifies more complaints than would
normally be expected.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers do not reflect complaints that are filed and
resolved within an HMO's internal grievance process.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs, a form of managed care, emphasize cost controls and
preventive care. They are at the center of a debate in Congress
over patient rights.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said the complaint numbers were useful to consumers
and companies shopping for health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers can be used as a tiebreaker'' after looking at
affordability and accessibility, McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers may obtain free copies of the complaint index by
calling (800) 726-7390.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Department of Insurance is currently tabulating a
1998 complaint ratio index of companies that write accident and
health insurance in Kansas. The report is expected to be available
in mid-August.

MAYOR KEEPS HIS JOB WHILE IN JAIL AWAITING TRIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   REEDS SPRING, Mo. _ Police are saying the mayor of Reeds Spring
is a child pornographer. To out-of-towners, that accusation alone
is enough to lock up 68-year-old Joe Dan Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   But here, they're willing to wait a while before they pass
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear from folks in Kansas City and St. Louis and
Springfield, and they're ready to hang the man,'' said Doug
Patrick, co-owner of the Bass Pro Shop in town. ``But last we
heard, he hasn't been convicted of anything yet. Until he is, I'm
pretty sure the law says he's an innocent man. So we'll wait before
we judge the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Course, if he is found guilty, it don't get much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Locals say Dwyer grew up here, then moved away, saw the world,
joined the service. Later, after he was injured in a logging
accident, he came back to Reeds Spring, a town of 411 about 30
miles south of Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 months ago, federal officials say, Dwyer and
25-year-old Emily Laird picked up a teen-age girl in Manhattan,
Kan., and drove her to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged reasons were simple, if seedy. According to the
indictment and court records, they paid the 15-year-old for sex,
and used her to make child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as the three prepared to part, Dwyer handed the girl a
camera and some film, asked her to take nude pictures of herself
and her friends, and to send the photos to him.
</P>
<P>
   When law enforcement arrived in Reeds Spring last summer, it
made for quite a spectacle, as FBI agents hauled crates of sex
videos and boxes filled with sex toys from Dwyer's house.
</P>
<P>
   And the case grew more unsavory this winter, as Dwyer was
accused of trying to pay three women to commit perjury at his
trial, to lie on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Whitley, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, said he
couldn't say much about the pending case. A federal magistrate
ruled Dwyer, because he was reported to have approached the three
women, will remain in prison until his trial, which will not take
place before October.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this age of media trials, it's hardly surprising that
locals aren't rushing to judgment. There's a different pace to a
place like this than in the big cities of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick noted that in most cases, the man elected mayor of Reeds
Spring serves as mayor for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or until he gets tired of the job,'' he said. ``Being mayor
here is more about who's willing to take the job, not who wants it
the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Barb Meeker owns the Spring House, a doll shop that boasts a
front door leading straight to the Reeds Spring, the source of the
mountain water that first prompted pioneers to stop here. She
pointed out that Dwyer is still mayor, despite the fact that a
federal judge insisted that he remain in prison while awaiting his
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all wonder if this is a for-real thing,'' she said. ``After
all, he has done a lot for this city and has always seemed to be
such a nice gentleman. Maybe we've all been wrong, but we all
appreciated him while he was here.''
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, for his landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   His house sits on Missouri 13//265, which serves Reeds Spring as
both a main street and a conduit to the outside world. It's a
necessary conduit. Reeds Spring doesn't have a grocery store;
hasn't for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   And if locals can't eke out a living from the Ozarks tourists
who stumble upon the town, they often struggle to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer's home looks nice, though fairly routine: brown-painted
wood and white trim.
</P>
<P>
   But the yard is such a sight that it's marked on the hand-drawn,
photocopied tourist map of town. The yard climbs one of the steep
hills that hem this place in. But Dwyer replaced the natural
underbrush with a hillside of plate-sized stones. The stone garden
contains a waterfall, as well as metal statues of an eagle, an
alligator, a Tyrannosaurus rex and a couple of Greek gods. In
addition, locals goggle at the maze of dog runs through the place
that lead to, it is said, air-conditioned doghouses.
</P>
<P>
   At Christmas, Dwyer used to light the place up as if it were the
Country Club Plaza, drawing steady streams of gawking motorists
from Branson and Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   In a poor town, it meant a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, if you put his place on Ward Parkway, it looks out of
place and kind of annoying,'' said Curt Wakefield, owner of K.C.
Outpost, a garage and towing service on the edge of town. ``But
here, well, he put a $70,000 house in a $10,000 neighborhood, and
it looks pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   People think enough of him, in fact, that the road that runs
behind his property is named Joe Dwyer Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Life goes on without Dwyer. The city clerk, as always, handles
the day-to-day business of the city. The mayor pro-tem is around to
handle any hirings or firings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're absolutely willing to wait until after the trial before
we pass our own judgments,'' said Kacee Anderson, the clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this town can't afford to wait forever for its mayor to
return. It looks as if two highway expansions in the Ozarks will
make it easier to bypass this town. And many are concerned about
what they might mean to livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very confusing time for the people living here,''
said Christie Chase, a longtime resident and correspondent for an
area newspaper. ``Everybody knows everybody here, and it's sad to
see something like this happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But before too long, we're going to need a new mayor in here,
someone who can help this town survive. We're not in a hurry yet,
but we will be soon.''

WOODS TRIUMPHS IN MATCH MADE IN (TV) HEAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ It ended on the 17th green, with
darkness falling on the golf course and Tiger Woods enjoying
another moment in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Winning a match that was both different and controversial, Woods
overcame an early two-hole deficit to defeat David Duval, 2 and 1,
in the Motorola Showdown at Sherwood, a match-play exhibition
unlike any they play on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Woods nor Duval could control what people thought of the
event, nor could they control how many people watched the ABC
network telecast. And while Woods earned bragging rights and $1.1
million for winning, it remained to be seen whether the event will
spark a more intense rivalry between the world's two top-ranked
players, who have never dueled down the stretch of a major
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Woods nor Duval wanted to lose, of course, and with a
prime-time television audience tuning in, Woods turned up his game.
After losing the first two holes, Woods won four of the next six
and led from that point on, holding off a late rally by Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, both Woods and Duval said they liked the concept, and
they did not rule out the possibility of doing it again. It was the
first network telecast of a golf event in prime time, and both
players hoped it would fuel more interest in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like another chance to do it, because I know I can play
better against him than I did today,' said Duval, the world's No.
2-ranked player, who received $400,000. Both players will
contribute $200,000 to charity, divided between The First Tee youth
golf initiative and charities of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was pretty cool,'' Duval said. ``My desire is
that this brings more people to the game. When Tiger turned pro in
1996, golf became cool, not a dorky game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect. I was a little apprehensive. But
I enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, the world's No. 1-ranked player, said his desire to
participate in another event like this would depend on how it was
received by the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the concept was great, and maybe we could do it a
different way, have maybe the top four players involved,'' Woods
said. ``But a lot will depend upon the ratings and how many people
were interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval started quickly at Sherwood Country Club, winning the
first two holes. Duval made an 8-foot birdie putt at No. 1, and
Woods then made an early mistake, losing No. 2 on a bogey when he
missed a 5-foot par putt.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods came back to win the par-3 third hole when Duval hit
his tee shot into the front bunker, then hit a poor bunker shot
that sailed 25 feet past the hole, leading to a bogey. Woods evened
the match with a birdie on the par-5 No. 4, when he chipped his
third shot to within 5 feet and then made the putt.
</P>
<P>
   Woods took the lead for good at the par-3 No. 6, when Duval hit
his tee shot into a creek, while Woods hit his 7-iron tee shot to
within 8 feet of the hole. Woods then made his best putt of th day
at No.8, making a 30-footer for birdie to go 2 up.
</P>
<P>
   Woods went 3 up at No. 12, making a 15-footer for birdie, before
Duval rallied to win No. 13 and No. 14. At No. 13, Woods hit his
tee shot into the water, which led to a bogey, while at No. 14, he
missed a 6-foot putt for par. But the match turned in Woods's favor
for good at No. 16, when Duval hit a 300-yard tee shot that landed
flush against a rock in the middle of the fairway. The rock
formation is a quirky feature in the course designed by Jack
Nicklaus, one that Duval will not soon forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best tee shot I hit all day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the worst breaks I've even seen,'' Woods said.
``I mean, he hit it right into the middle of the fairway, and it
lands on Jack's concoction in the middle of the fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval was forced to take a drop behind the rock and a penalty
stroke because of an unplayable lie. That led to a bogey which put
Woods 2 up again, and the match ended at the par-3 No. 17, when
Woods hit his putt for birdie close to the hole and Duval conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started slowly, but the momentum shifted, and that's one of
the things I love about match play,'' Woods said. ``When you get
momentum in match play, it's like basketball. You can just ride
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere at Sherwood was different from most tournaments,
with the gallery of about 2,000 cheering loudly for both players.
Woods has been an immensely popular player since winning three
consecutive U.S. Amateur titles before turning professional, while
Duval has become one of the game's most recognizable players after
winning 11 times since November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Floodlights were erected at both the 17th and 18th holes, and
when the match neared its conclusion, the lights began to take
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Duval played in Hartford, Conn., on Sunday and then flew
cross-country that night, but he did not blame fatigue for the
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wasn't as sharp as I wanted to be,'' Duval said.
``That's what was disappointing. But as far as the match itself, I
thought it was a great idea. We're both hoping it was good for
golf.''

WOODS THE STAR OF THIS TV SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 GLF-WOODS-DUVAL-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By BOB DUFFY 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ There can be no minimizing the
historical significance: Tiger Woods is the finest par-3 golfer in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he's better than David Duval, at least, and since this
twilight-league encounter _ the first golf match ever beamed to the
world in prime time _ was supposed to prove something cosmic, that
must be it.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Woods's 2-and-1 victory, which ended under light
towers installed by ABC in the Santa Monica Mountains Monday night
at Sherwood Country Club, didn't do anything to rearrange the
planetary order.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Duval teed off ranked first and second in the world,
respectively, and that's how they wound up after touring 17 holes
of this par-72, 7,025-yard layout that Jack Nicklaus carved around
_ and occasionally through _ the tony neighborhoods of this
oversized quarry. And truth be told, things wouldn't have been any
different if Duval had prevailed. All right, he would have pocketed
the $1.1 million winner's share and Woods would have gotten the
$400,000 consolation prize, but while those figures count to the
tax man, they don't exist in the official world of golf. For
despite the ballyhoo that preceded it, this was an exhibition,
nothing more, which the participants readily acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   For proof, one need only inspect the attire of Woods's caddie,
Steve Williams. Under the baking desert sun that greeted the
players on the first tee, Williams was wearing shorts, a no-no in
PGA Tour events. In fact, his boss fought to gain Williams that
privilege when event officials tried to force him to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that this is an exhibition,'' said Woods, ``and my
understanding is that it's permissible to wear shorts in
exhibitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger wound up wearing the pants in this argument, and Williams
stayed in shorts. Thus, any pretenses about the true implications
of this match _ aside from TV ratings _ were cast aside before it
began.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of camaraderie, rather than combat, was reinforced
before the first shot when photographers asked Woods and Duval to
pose together. That they did, and the normally phlegmatic Duval
even indulged in a bit of improvisational comedy, placing his arm
around Woods and persuading his opponent to do likewise. That's not
the normal prelude to a round of golf that actually means
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw the way we compete,'' said Woods, ``we tried our
best to beat each other, but in the spirit of friendship. We
competed as gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the gentlemen began competing, Duval seized the early
advantage, winning the first two holes. Woods promptly erased that
deficit and began to assert his mastery on the par-3s _ of which he
won four and halved the other.
</P>
<P>
   Woods won the 188-yard third hole, hitting a 7-iron 20 feet from
the hole, then putting within a foot. Duval, who bogeyed the hole,
conceded the gimme. Woods squared the match with a birdie on the
par-5 fourth, and he went in front for good on the sixth when Duval
almost drowned a duck in the lake that borders the green of the
186-yard par 3. Woods nailed an 8-iron within 10 feet, and Duval
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the great thing about match play,'' said Woods, who
hadn't played or practiced since the British Open last month. ``You
can be down early and come right back. Then it's a matter of
momentum. Today was a perfect example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   He was 2-up at the turn after yet more par-3 superiority on the
eighth, when he buried a 30-foot putt from the back of the green
for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it fell,'' he said. ``I thought I missed it
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval seemed done for by the next par-3, the 12th, where Woods
hit a 5-iron _ ``I pushed it, to be honest,'' he said _ that landed
8 feet from the flag and canned the birdie, going 3 up.
</P>
<P>
   But Duval, who had flown in Sunday night after finishing 11th in
the Greater Hartford Open and felt ``I didn't play all that well; I
managed,'' made things interesting by winning the par-4 13th when
Woods drove into the water and the par-5 14th when Woods's second
shot landed in the gallery of some 2,000 lining the right of the
green.
</P>
<P>
   That at least guaranteed that the show would go on until the 11
o'clock news, but it became a formality on the par-4 16th. There
Duval chose to hit driver _ ``my best shot of the day,'' he
lamented _ and his reward was an unplayable lie when it landed in
the rock gargoyle Nicklaus installed some 185 yards from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the worst breaks I've ever seen,'' said Woods,
who nonetheless took advantage to go 2-up with two holes left when
Duval conceded.
</P>
<P>
   It ended on the next hole _ a par-3, of course _ when the
players halved with pars.
</P>
<P>
   By then, darkness had descended, forcing Duval to doff the
trademark wraparound sunglasses that seem to serve as a shield to
his soul. As a matter of fact, he seemed more relaxed than he has
in any regulation tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty cool,'' he said of the experience, smiling
expansively as he did throughout the postmatch press conference.
``David Duval doesn't think of himself as being involved in
something like this. I was flattered to be invited. It was kind of
cool _ playing in the dark, with the lights on.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed. So did his audience. And that summed up the real
achievement of this duel in the sun and moon.
</P>
<P>
   A good time was had by all.

SMELLY BLOOM ATTRACTS 10,000 TO GARDEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MARINO, Calif. _ The broad bloom of the world's largest
flower _ and the rotting smell that inspired its ``corpse flower''
name _ drew a record crowd Monday to the Huntington Botanical
Gardens, with people waiting more than two hours for the rare
sight.
</P>
<P>
   A main attraction is the fleeting beauty of the first
Amorphophallus titanum to bloom in California and only the 10th in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The tightly furled, petal-like bloom began to unfold Sunday
evening as the Huntington was closing. Its rich, velvety maroon
interior, measuring three feet across, was fully displayed by early
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, though, is likely the last opportunity to admire the
flower before it dramatically dies, collapsing under its own
weight. It likely will never bloom again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience,'' said
Maritza Cain, who brought her niece, mother and grandmother from
Reseda. ``I had seen one of the documentaries on it. I had to see
it in person.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Herminia Cain, spent as long as she could peering at
the bloom as a steady stream of people moved through the covered
patio where the flower was on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like a cornucopia. I like everything, the form, the
size, the color,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz over the bloom drew the largest single-day crowd to the
Huntington, 10 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, with nearly
10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen crowds like we have today,'' said Catherine
Babcock, the Huntington's communications director. ``We're sorry we
had to turn people away. We hope they can get in again.''
</P>
<P>
   Attendance surpassed the 8,200 people who came on a Thursday in
May when admission was free, the roses were in bloom and notable
manuscripts and artifacts from President Washington were on
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what to expect. They've been fabulous,''
Babcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Although usually closed Mondays, the Huntington opened to show
the flower _ normally found in equatorial tropical rain forests _
blooming in semiarid Southern California. Tuesday's 9 a.m. opening
will be earlier than usual to accommodate the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance more than doubled last week, compared with a normal
week. The crowds have been getting larger each day, but Monday's
turnout stunned Huntington officials.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic backed up nearly two miles from the main entrance onto
San Marino and Pasadena streets. The parking lot was closed at 2
p.m. so the crowd inside could clear before the Huntington closed
about three hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, patrons joined a serpentine line that wound under
the warm sun across the Huntington's verdant grounds and through
all possible shaded areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there would be a crowd, but I certainly didn't
expect this for a Monday,'' said Tammy Sparks, pushing her
6-month-old son, Duncan, in a stroller near the front of the line
of flower fans. ``We're lingering in the shade as much as possible.
There's a lot to look at, so he's doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duncans, from Valley Village, were fairly fortunate.
Arriving when the Huntington opened at 10:30 a.m., they waited only
20 minutes to get in the parking lot, 30 minutes to buy a ticket
and 60 minutes to spend 5 minutes or so with the awesome blossom.
</P>
<P>
   The botanical gardens' patrons were able to walk up to the
flower without waiting Friday. Bill Figueroa of Culver City even
spent nearly an hour taking photographs of the then-emerging bloom.
</P>
<P>
   The flower's opening was eagerly awaited all weekend after
Huntington officials noted the noxious odor was beginning to
release Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Corsino of Pasadena said she was inspired to buy a
Huntington annual membership after coming to view the emerging
bloom on both Saturday and Sunday. The longer wait didn't bother
her Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to stand in a park. It's such a magnificent place,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The only place to avoid was anywhere downwind of the flower.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one spot where you could smell it. I stayed there
for about 30 seconds,'' Corsino said.
</P>
<P>
   Named bunga bangkai, or corpse flower, in its native Sumatra,
the flower's awful odor is compared to rotting flesh. The odor is
passed off in a vapor aided by the heating of the flower as it
grows.
</P>
<P>
   People had to contend with the warm sun a lot longer than the
smell.
</P>
<P>
   With so many, including many children and seniors, soaking in
the warm sun, dozens of staffers left their offices to hand out red
and blue umbrellas for shade and cups of water for thirst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it's all hands on deck,'' said Carl Foote, the
Huntington's personnel director, waiting for a tray of water cups.
</P>
<P>
   The kindred spirit of the flower fans was demonstrated by Lars
Jorgensen, who handed out water while waiting in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect this crowd, but it doesn't surprise me,'' said
Jorgensen, who tends a garden of California natives at his Pasadena
home. ``This is profoundly interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing as fast as 4 inches a day, the flower went from bulb to
nearly 6 feet in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Rising from a pot in the center of the loggia off the
Huntington's Scott Gallery, the flower is only the 10th specimen of
the Amorphophallus titanum to bloom in the United States since the
first recorded bloom at the New York Botanical Garden in 1937.

CUBA GETS BETTER OF UNITED STATES
</HEADLINE>
 PAN-PANAMBASEBALL-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By JOHN POWERS 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba _ Three outs from the end, the Cuban reserves
were already standing at the top of the dugout steps, flags in
hand, ready to rhumba. Fidel's finest had already shown up the
Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards this year. There was no way they
were going to lose a gold medal to a bunch of minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   So Cuba's ``amateurs'' threw ace righthander Jose Contreras on
one day's rest, watched him hammer the United States baseball team
into the ground with 13 strikeouts and snatched the Pan American
Games title for the eighth straight time with a 5-1 victory at
CanWest Global Park Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed, but I don't think you can be any more
proud of this team,'' said coach Buddy Bell, after the US had to
settle for the silver medal for the seventh time. ``This is the
first time our guys have ever been involved in something like this.
Trying to put a team together in two or three weeks is a tough
task. What we've done is entirely acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had already achieved their main goal _ qualifying
for next summer's Olympics in Sydney _ by beating the Mexicans in
10 innings in the semifinals. Still, after handling the Cubans,
10-5, in the round-robin, they wanted to go for the golden
knockout, which no US team had managed since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted this as much as we've ever wanted any game,'' said
designated hitter Jon Zuber, a Philadelphia Phillies farmhand who
homered off David Cone last year.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, did the Cubans, who'd had an extraordinarily shaky
tournament (by their standards) and had pitcher Danyso Baez defect
here Sunday night. After the US nailed them with five ninth-inning
runs in their first go, the Cubans had to dump a game (as in 8-1)
to the Canadians to avoid meeting the Americans again in the
semifinals and risking their Olympic ticket. Then they had to come
from two runs down to beat Canada Sunday to get here.
</P>
<P>
   So even through Contreras had thrown 88 pitches in Saturday's
quarterfinal with the Dominican Republic, coach Alfonso Urquiola
put him back on the hill to throw another 107 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they don't care about anybody's health over
there,'' said Bell. ``But the guy's a horse. I've seen him
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Contreras had pitched against the Orioles in Havana, so he
wasn't going to be cowed by a lineup of farmhands who had had a cup
of coffee in The Show.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out eight in a row in the first three innings with
fastballs and splitters, and after Milton Bradley ripped him for a
double, Contreras bagged another five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he stepped on the rubber, he kept getting guys
out,'' shrugged Zuber. ``Why wouldn't you leave him out there?''
</P>
<P>
   All the Cubans needed they got in consecutive at-bats with two
out in the fourth, when Orestes Kindelan (their all-time home run
leader) and Gabriel Pierre took US starter Brad Penny out of the
yard to left-center and right. When Kindelan came up again in the
sixth, he hit a two-run shot off reliever Derek Wallace into the
jury-box bleachers in right field to make it 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans did manage to get the tying run to the plate with
two out in the eighth. But second baseman Juan Padilla went
vertical to snare Adam Kennedy's liner and closer Maels Rodriquez
struck out the side in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   So it was another silver lining for the Yanks, who also lost the
1987 crown after beating the Cubans (with pitcher Jim Abbott) in
the round-robin. Back then, they were still trying to do it with
college kids. That experiment ended after the St. John's University
varsity went to Argentina last time and lost to everybody including
the Netherlands Antilles.
</P>
<P>
   This time, with Olympus on the line, the US sent guys who play
for money. And once they lost their opener to the Canadians, they
realized that this wasn't quite Triple A.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have bull's-eyes on our chests because of who we are,''
said Bell. ``Our guys have never been under this kind of pressure.
But they handled it very well.''

MAN PUTS UP CASH TO NAB PETTY THIEF, MAKE COMMUNITY SAFE

<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ Ralph Abruscato paid only $125 for a car
stereo last year, but now he's willing to pay a $500 reward for
help in catching the thief who stole it.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old resident of one of America's safest cities said
Monday that he's willing to pay a high price to rid his
neighborhood of even one small-time crook.
</P>
<P>
   ``My rationale is that I noticed that the only people (who) do
anything for anyone else is if there is something material to be
gained,'' Abruscato said. ``This has shattered my illusion that
Simi Valley (northwest of Los Angeles in neighboring Ventura
County) is a safe place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Simi Valley police Lt. Neal Rein said he has never heard of
anyone offering a reward for this type of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see reward signs up for lost cats or dogs, but this is
very unusual,'' Rein said. ``There's nothing preventing a person
from offering a reward, but they can't go around putting up their
own dead-or-alive posters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sony stereo was stolen either July 19 or 20 when Abruscato's
Mazda 323 was parked in a carport at his apartment complex. Police
took a report and dusted for prints.
</P>
<P>
   Abruscato bought a new stereo and now parks his car under a
street light where he can see it from his apartment. He has been
passing out fliers advertising the reward but so far has no leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have a duty to one another,'' Abruscato said. ``I've
learned that if you really want to snuff out crime, you've got to
pony up the cash.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WHEN the gun sounded to open the NBA free-agency season late
Saturday, a field of horses did not exactly gallop out of the
starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   Which was not entirely unexpected in an offseason when the
league is trying to come to grips with a whole new set of
salary-cap guidelines that have limited movement among veteran
players while simultaneously trying to adjust to new on-the-court
rules concerning how the game is played.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle of both changes are the Rockets, whose
style of play had become to the term plodding what Madonna is to
shocking, a cliche, at the very same time when an overnight
makeover became virtually impossible to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   When Keith Van Horn signed a six-year, $73 million contract
extension with the Nets, it officially wiped out the crop of
talented young free-agents-to-be over whom teams like the Rockets,
Bulls and Suns had been licking their chops _ and stockpiling
salary-cap space _ for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   With the new collective bargaining agreement, it suddenly made a
lot more sense _ and many more dollars _ for the likes of Shareef
Abdur-Rahim, Kobe Bryant and Damon Stoudamire and the rest to re-up
with their current teams than to go out on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be the offseason when the Rockets took
continued steps toward construction of a championship contender
while also pumping new life into the roster and laying the
foundation for the franchise in the 21st century. Nobody would
disagree with the notion that fresh legs are needed. Add in the
desire in the league to put the run-and-gun back into an
increasingly ponderous, elephantine game, and the need for new
blood was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Thus did the Rockets enter into their brief and wrongheaded
dalliance with Toronto concerning a possible trade of Hakeem
Olajuwon for a package that included a couple of first-round draft
choices. It is an educated guess that the Rockets might have used
one of those No. 1 slots to pick 18-year-old Jonathan Bender, the
latest high school phenom to make the jump to the NBA. The selling
point, come referendum time in November, would have been that while
you're voting to build the Rockets a new arena, they're
constructing the first championship team to play there. That's a
salesmanship job if there ever was one, and thanks to head coach
Rudy Tomjanovich, it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the job of getting the Rockets up out of their
first-round-fodder playoff position of the past two seasons is a
rather intriguing and perhaps quite difficult one. Which is why
considerably more time could pass before anything changes with the
club.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros allowed the Major League Baseball trading deadline to
pass over the weekend because they are already strong and deep and
know their roster will be strengthened soon by the return of Moises
Alou, Ken Caminiti and Ricky Gutierrez. All that matters to them is
what happens in October when the playoffs arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets were idle on the same weekend because they must
carefully take their time to figure a way out of their current box
with little money to spend under the salary cap, while also looking
ahead to October, when training camp opens.
</P>
<P>
   We know now that Olajuwon will be back, and it's a pretty safe
bet that so too will Scottie Pippen and Charles Barkley. The
coaching staff believes it can get more of a return on the big
investment in Pippen if the new rules open the game up and allow
for more athleticism. That's not to say that Big Chief Triangle,
Phil Jackson, won't continue to try to wangle a deal to get Pippen
back running his three-cornered offense in LA.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who is wearing out his fingers dialing up other teams
to get them interested, will be back after his ego is massaged
enough, because this is where he can get the best deal.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Rogers of the Clippers, one free-agent target, has
already signed with Phoenix, and thoughts of Mitch Richmond are
probably a pipe dream with only the $2 million cap exception to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   So the Rockets bring back from the Rocky Mountain Revue a
glowing report on Bryce Drew at the point and good word that
Michael Dickerson and Cuttino Mobley ran the floor and finished in
the running game. Second-round picks Tyrone Washington and Venson
Hamilton were active, and free agent Devon Gray opened some eyes.
First-round suspect Kenny Thomas begged off with injury. If you
know his track record, no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Now the real fun begins. It's back home for some horse trading.
If only they can find a horse.

A PRODUCTION, NOT COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ The Southland was the stage for riveting
theater, its denizens dazzled by the bravura athletic performance
of two peerless protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   But enough about Pete Sampras' straight-sets victory over Andre
Agassi Sunday in the final of the pro tennis tour stop at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 and No. 2 tennis players in the world supplied the
kind of drama that largely was lacking a day later when the two top
golfers on the planet teed off at Sherwood Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   The match-play event between David Duval and Tiger Woods was a
made-for-television production. And indeed, it had a scripted feel
to it right down to the result, a 2-and-1 victory for Woods, the
most illustrious product of the Southern California Junior Golf
Association.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the Benjamins some 2,000 spectators parted with for
the privilege of watching Duval and Woods spar, the gallery could
have been mistaken for one of those studio audiences the networks
bring in to provide a suitable soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   The usual gallery decorum gave way to loquacious declarations of
support for both golfers but mostly for Woods. The paying public
seemed to embrace the event well enough but the see-for-free
television audience will have the loudest voice.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the difference between what transpired Monday
and your garden-variety sporting event, which produces a clear-cut
winner and loser.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's out on the results until the Nielsen ratings trickle
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``How high the ratings are is going to determine how special
this event is,'' conceded Woods after closing Duval out on the 17th
hole.
</P>
<P>
   If Woods sounded as though he were talking about another sport,
not his own, there's a good reason. The evening had all the pomp
and procrastination of a Monday-night football game. On the first
tee, Duval and Woods were itching to hit. They were ready to
rumble.
</P>
<P>
   There was just one hitch and it wasn't in either golfer's swing.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about a gust of wind or the whir of a camera,
either. It wasn't a spectator sauntering across the fairway or any
of the other disturbances that golfers on the PGA Tour are inured
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have three or four minutes,'' said a man wearing an
ABC polo shirt and a headset.
</P>
<P>
   The guy with his eye on his watch might as well have been
wearing a striped shirt and a whistle. To be sure, antsy
quarterbacks and anxious linebackers have dealt with such delays
for years. But for golf, this represented a new partnership, a
prime-time relationship with plenty of strings (and wires)
attached.
</P>
<P>
   On that first tee, hours before the artificial lights came on
and cast an eerie glow on the 17th and 18th holes, Duval and Woods
got an illuminating look at the flashy partner rounding out their
threesome for the first of perhaps many rounds to come.
</P>
<P>
   If not for all the money television brings to the game, it could
easily be confused with the weekend hacker who jiggles the coins in
his pocket when his playing partners are putting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was pretty cool to be a part of this, but it's nice
that it's over in a sense,'' Duval said. ``I didn't know what to
expect. It's a tough round.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval knew for sure it wasn't his day when he sent a perfect
drive into the descending darkness on No. 16, and it landed in the
middle of the fairway _ in a rock formation booby-trap that forced
him to take an unplayable lie.
</P>
<P>
   Woods won that hole and the next to secure the $1.1 million
winner's cut.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who pocketed $400,000, was able to laugh about his stroke
of bad luck later. Indeed, he and Woods both did a commendable job
of subjugating their competitive instincts well enough to crack
jokes and smiles throughout the three-hour tour of Sherwood.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't have been easy for Duval, being both glib and good
on five hours' sleep. He had traveled across country Sunday night
after firing a fine final-round 63 in the Greater Hartford Open.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, meantime, came to the match well rested, having not
played a competitive round since the British Open. In that respect
he was like Sampras, who took time off after winning Wimbledon and
then resurfaced in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods battles Duval for supremacy down the stretch of a
Grand Slam event, as have Sampras and Agassi, it'll really mean
something. What passed for competition Monday was merely prelude. &QL;

UNIMAGINED SHOT WRECKS DUVAL'S CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ The showdown beat the sunset Monday, but
David Duval had less luck with Tiger Woods _ in large part due to
hard luck on perhaps the best shot either of them hit all day.
</P>
<P>
   In professional golf's first live golf competition in prime
time, Woods held off Duval 2 and 1 in an 18-hole match-play event
at Sherwood Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC-televised match showcased the two best golfers on the
planet _ both have been ranked No. 1 in the world this year _ as
well as the scenic Jack Nicklaus-designed Sherwood layout.
</P>
<P>
   Especially showcased was the 16th hole, where Duval's late
charge faltered because he hit a shot better than he could have
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   After Woods had seemingly taken control of the match with a
three-stroke lead with six holes remaining, Duval won two of the
next three to pull within one going into the 16th.
</P>
<P>
   There, he hit his drive nearly 300 yards and right down the
middle of the fairway _ and into a bush-surrounded rock formation.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who wound up winning that hole and closing out Duval with
a conceded hole-halving par on No. 17, called Duval's drive ``one
of the worse breaks I've ever seen _ David hit a drive right down
the middle of the fairway and right into Jack's little
concoction.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, asked to describe his misfortune on No. 16, called it
``the best shot I hit all day. I hit it right where I was aiming.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who has played in three Shark Shootouts at Sherwood, knew
all about the rock formation down the center of the fairway on No.
16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've aimed at it every time I've played here,'' he said. ``I
just never hit it before.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition, which started at about 5 p.m. to accommodate a
night-time east coast viewing audience, turned out to be a primer
on the essence of match play:A lead, even an early lead, means less
than momentum _ which can switch quickly. And breaks can halt or
help momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Duval struck first, only to be nearly knocked out of contention
by Woods, who subsequently needed his own late surge to hold off
his charging rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about match play is I was down early and able
to come back,'' said Woods, who trailed by two holes after two were
played. ``The big thing of match play is the momentum changes. For
some reason, the big Mo gets on your side.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval had it early, birdieing the 385-yard, par-4 first and
winning 522-yard, par-5 second when Woods conceded a three-foot par
putt, then missed his own six-footer for par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't practiced much since the British open and my short
game showed it,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   But Duval opened the door for a Woods comeback on the 188-yard
third-hole, plugging his tee shot in a green-fronting bunker _ one
of five bunkers he hit in the competition. Woods then went for the
middle of the green, lagged his putt close and won with a par to
cut Duval's lead in half.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be three first of five straight holes won by
Woods, who followed with wins on the 541-yard, par 5 fourth, the
186-yard, par 3-sixth, 166-yard, par-3 eighth and 202-yard, par-3
12th.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game did not feel very good today,'' said Duval, who hit
two hazards and Jack's rock in addition to the five bunkers. ``I
managed it well but didn't get around very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods included three birdies and a conceded holes in that
charge, the concession coming after Duval landed his eight-iron tee
shot into the water hazard fronting No. 6, and Woods hit an
eight-iron to within 10 feet of the flagstick.
</P>
<P>
   The five-hole run put Woods 3-up with six holes to play and
seemingly in command, but Duval jumped right back into contention
with wins on the 459-yard, par-4 13th and 534-yard, par-5 14th.
</P>
<P>
   A missed birdie putt on No. 15 cost Duval a chance to tie the
match, setting the stage for his unfortunate drive on 16.
</P>
<P>
   Woods wound up winning on a day he was less than Woods-like on
the long holes, playing Sherwood's five par-5s at just 1-under-par.
</P>
<P>
   But the former Anaheim Western High School star had enough to
win in front of a hometown crowd that he said provided his biggest
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain excitement you get playing in front of your
home crowd,'' said Woods, who called Monday's play and past L.A.
Opens some of his most memorable experiences on tour. ``That's
probably the most excited I will get outside of playing in
majors.''

ANGELS SHAKY AT FULL STRENGTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Throughout the 1999 baseball season the battle
cry of the Angels has been, ``If only.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If only Mo Vaughn hadn't twisted his ankle . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``If only we had Gary DiSarcina's glove . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``If only Tim Salmon wasn't injured . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``If only Jim Edmonds was back in the line up . . .''
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, the Angels should have run out of if onlys before
their 12-4 loss Monday night to the Kansas City Royals before
17,029 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Vaughn's ankle is healed; DiSarcina is back at short;
and Salmon's wrist is better.
</P>
<P>
   Top that off with Edmonds' return to the line up Monday night as
DH and everything should have been just fine in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   If only starter Jack McDowell had pitched a better game.
</P>
<P>
   As for Edmonds, his return was marked by a 2-for-4 night at the
plate. His first hit came in seventh, a single to right center. His
second hit, a double in the eighth, scored Todd Greene for the
Angels' fourth run.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss, McDowell's record dropped to 0-3. Royals starter
Jose Rosado picked up the win. He is now 7-8.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough night in Anaheim, but there were some bright
spots. Down 11-0, the Angels showed some signs of life in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Greene led off the bottom of the seventh with a single and
Edmonds moved him to third with his first hit of the season. Troy
Glaus followed with his second double of the night, scoring Greene
and Edmonds for the Angels' first two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Walbeck moved Glaus to third with a single and Glaus scored
when Andy Sheets hit into a fielder's choice for the first out of
the inning. Darin Erstad went down swinging for the inning's second
out. A DiSarcina grounder ended the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals handled McDowell early, scoring five runs on five
hits in the first. To his credit, McDowell got little support from
his fielders, as his teammates committed two errors in the opening
frame.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, Royals lead-off batter Johnny Damon reached second
on a base hit after right fielder Tim Salmon mishandled the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, Carlos Feebles got aboard with a single. Carlos Beltran
knocked in Damon with a single of his own.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth batter, Mike Sweeny, got on when he was hit in the
right shoulder by a McDowell curve. At that point, Collins began
working reliever Al Levine in the Angel bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   After he walked the No. 7 batter, Jeremy Giambi, McDowell got
into a shouting match with home plate umpire Al Clark. The pitcher
had to be restrained by catcher Walbeck, then Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, McDowell gave up a two-run homer to Dye, which
gave the Royals a 7-0 lead.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Willie Morris, the writer and editor whose life and work reveled
in the endless contradictions of the South and the region's
ghostlike hold on its native sons and daughters, died on Monday at
St. Dominic Hospital in Jackson, Miss., at 64.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said a hospital official.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who turned his childhood in Yazoo City, Miss., into a
place almost as complex and resonant as William Faulkner's
Yoknapatawpha County, went from a country boy to a Rhodes Scholar
to a literary Wunderkind, becoming editor in chief of Harper's
Magazine at age 32.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Truman Capote famously said that all Southerners
eventually come home, if only in a box, Morris returned to
Mississippi in 1980 and never stopped exploring what he once
described as ``the old warring impulses of one's sensibility to be
both Southern and American.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote on subjects ranging from his childhood English fox
terrier in ``My Dog Skip'' to the intersection of football and race
in ``The Courting of Marcus Dupree''; hunkered down in his favorite
Mississippi haunts like Doe's in Greenville, Lusko's in Greenwood
and Bill's Greek Tavern in Jackson, and delved into the interplay
of past and present that defines Southern life.
</P>
<P>
   Still, rather than being merely a vivid interpreter of Southern
life, Morris was someone ahead of his time in exploring the
confluence of region and nation, and how the South's distinctive
experience of race, family and history was so deeply a part of the
nation's experience as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie said that Mississippi is America writ large,'' said
Richard Howorth, owner of Square Books, the literary haunt in
Oxford, Miss. ``And to understand Willie you have to know that he
had this amazing knowledge of American history. And I think his
understanding of the South and curiosity about the South was very
much a part of his understanding and curiosity about America. He
understood the South as only a Southerner could, but his
perspective was so much broader than just thinking and writing
about the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Morris was born on Nov. 29, 1934, in Jackson. When he was
6 his family moved to Yazoo City, a town on the edge of the
Mississippi Delta, which at roughly the same time nurtured figures
as diverse as Mike Espy, later to become Mississippi's first black
congressman since Reconstruction and then secretary of agriculture;
Haley Barbour, former national chairman of the Republican Party,
and Zig Ziglar, the motivational speaker.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Henry, ran a gas station, and Morris grew up in the
teeth of the segregation era, in an environment he came to see as
wondrous and horrific, where blacks and whites lived together in
parallel universes that were utterly apart and intimately entwined.
He played taps for the American Legion at military funerals, became
a part-time sports writer for The Yazoo Herald and dreamed of
ascending to the landed gentry who defined the social and economic
overclass of the Delta.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than send Morris to the University of Mississippi,
his father had him go to the distant and alien environs of the
University of Texas in Austin. He had, he later observed, no sense
that ``there were ideas, much less ideas to arouse one from
oneself.'' But after two years of pranks and fraternity hi-jinks,
he came to see that books could be, as he later put it, ``as
subversive as Socrates.''
</P>
<P>
   He became editor of the student newspaper, The Daily Texan,
where he was asked to resign after the newspaper accused the
governor and state Legislators of colluding with oil and gas
interests. After graduating, he went to Britain as a Rhodes
Scholar. Then he returned to Texas to edit The Texas Observer, a
feisty gadfly publication.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to California and then to New York, where he was hired
at Harper's Magazine in 1963. In 1967 he became its youngest editor
in chief ever and a major literary figure in a city he came to call
``the Big Cave.''
</P>
<P>
   He presided over one of the legendary eras in magazine
journalism, hiring David Halberstam to write about Vietnam, Larry
L. King to write about Washington, and printing a 45,000-word
excerpt of William Styron's ``Confessions of Nat Turner'' and
90,000 words of Norman Mailer's ``Steps of the Pentagon,'' about a
Vietnam War protest march, which took up the entire March 1968
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after becoming editor in chief he also published his
autobiography, ``North Toward Home,'' which was a memoir as social
history that tried to make sense of the epic changes rattling
through the South and what they said about the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But after new ownership took over the magazine, Morris found
himself at war with the management and resigned in 1971, and most
of his staff members followed.
</P>
<P>
   Morris lived and wrote for several years from Bridgehampton,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In ``North Toward Home'' he wrote about how he felt as if
``someone had taken some terrible weight off my shoulders''
whenever he left the South.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, he decided to return home. He moved to Oxford as
writer in residence at the University of Mississippi. He moved 10
years later to Jackson and spent his time evoking the clattering
cacophony of warring emotions _ love, hate, chauvinism, despair
and, above all, a sense of something unshakable _ that so many
Southerners feel toward the region.
</P>
<P>
   Morris is survived by his wife, JoAnne Prichard of Jackson, and
his son, David Rae of New Orleans.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Not all of his work was critically praised. A 1973 novel, ``The
Last of the Southern Girls,'' received tepid reviews. And his
memoir of his days at Harper's, ``New York Days,'' struck some
reviewers as conventional and nostalgic. But few doubt that he
captured the South's transition from the days of segregation and
the complexities of the Southern experience like few, if any,
writers of his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work in `North Toward Home' became a mantra for
Southerners who fled the South seeking worlds where they could be
free and open in their thought but could never escape the love-hate
relationship all Southerners carry within them about the place of
birth,'' said William R. Ferris, chairman of the National Endowment
for the Humanities, and a longtime friend from Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Morris drank too much bourbon and red wine, smoked too many
Viceroys, stayed up too late and caroused too much. Indeed, friends
have marveled at his ability to defy most of the conventions of
good health. But, like his writing, his life style betrayed a
singular personality, given to long, rambling evocative
conversation, and the indelible stamp of his early days in Yazoo
City. And friends and admirers say that whatever barbs he could
fling at the South's failings were leavened by the degree to which
he was, in the end, such a quintessential Southerner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie was such an honest voice, clear, vivid, never
ambiguous,'' said David Sansing, a retired University of
Mississippi historian. ``I think people were willing to accept a
lot of things from Willie because he didn't fuss at us or belittle
us or demean us, because essentially he was one of us. The great
thing about `North Toward Home' is how well it showed how sometimes
you have to leave a place to really see it. He had to leave the
South to really confirm his own Southernness. But, of course, he
came back. Richard Wright once said, `I got out of the South. But I
never got the South out of me.' Willie knew the same thing.''

SONICS FREE AGENT MOVES SIMMERING IN SWEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Compared to the Portland Trail Blazers, who unleashed
fireworks, the Sonics celebrated the start of NBA free agency with
a candlelight vigil.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics president Wally Walker knows that won't be the last
analogy between him and his Blazers counterpart and Sonics
predecessor, Bob Whitsitt. But Walker is counting on Mitch Richmond
and Vin Baker to make it the worst comparison anyone will make.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers, who reached the conference finals last year with
what was widely regarded as the most talented team in the West,
picked up star guard Steve Smith from Atlanta and free agent
forward Detlef Schrempf from Seattle, while unloading Isaiah Rider
and his retinue of parole officers, counselors and bail bondsmen.
</P>
<P>
   In one day, the Blazers went up in basketball IQ about 100
points. Some might contend that puts them at 110, but others will
say Smith and Schrempf give Portland the one championship
characteristic it lacked _ veteran smarts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Sonics did nothing in free agency's first two
days but the expected housekeeping _ renouncing Schrempf and other
free agents while re-upping second-year forward Jelani McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes went undropped throughout the day as their two primary
targets, Richmond and Baker, were engaged in different varieties of
the big sweats.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond, 34, has been in the Sonics' cross hairs throughout the
offseason, to the point where it can be said that their strategy
came down to getting him at the expense of Schrempf.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sonics had chosen to stay over the salary cap, NBA rules
would have allowed them to re-sign Schrempf for an unlimited
amount, although reality dictates it would be less than what he
made in the final year of his contract, $3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sonics renounced Schrempf and the other free agents
(Olden Polynice, Aaron Williams, Drew Barry and John Crotty) to get
below the cap, they would have the money to sign Richmond, but
leave Schrempf with a cap-exception salary of $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, as expected, chose the latter option, which last
week prompted Schrempf to suggest that his hometown club drop dead.
Monday, he laughed at the funeral, signing with Portland for two
years at $2.1 million per.
</P>
<P>
   The Richmond-for-Schrempf ``trade'' hasn't worked yet because
Richmond's old club, the Washington Wizards, will neither pay him
top dollar to stay, nor (for the moment) sign him and trade him to
Seattle for Hersey Hawkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making Mitch sweat,'' said one NBA insider. The
strategy apparently is designed to make the Sonics halt their
Richmond vigil and drop down to less attractive free agent options
such as Shandon Anderson, Vernon Maxwell or Cedric Ceballos before
those players, too, are snapped up.
</P>
<P>
   Then perhaps Richmond would be inclined to re-up with the
Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are against success, but the Wizards have little to
lose. Critics will drill Washington if it loses Richmond for
nothing. The drilling will be lessened only slightly by the arrival
of Hawkins, whose salary and position make a sign-and-trade
workable.
</P>
<P>
   So while the Sonics join Richmond in the sweatbox, the guy who
really needs to be there, Baker, is perspiring in another way. He's
apparently hoping the Sonics really aren't serious about including
a weight clause in his contract that will cut his salary if he
comes in as the poster mammal for the Makahs.
</P>
<P>
   How embarrassing will it be for Baker to allow a weight clause
to prevent him from rejoining the Sonics?
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the world's elite athletes, an NBA All-Star and
presumptive U.S. Olympian, who is offered about $87 million
guranteed for the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
   For that kind of money, Jenny Craig could be his private
nutritionist and Richard Simmons his private trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming that Baker puts down his fork long enough to consider
the alternative, he should recognize the foolhardiness of his
position. And if he doesn't, he'll make Rider look like a candidate
for MENSA.
</P>
<P>
   Given the new realities of the salary cap and the limited
options among free agent power forwards, the Sonics really have no
choice but to give Baker the sun, stars and moon (but no moon pie).
</P>
<P>
   That predicament disturbed Schrempf, who Monday released a
four-paragraph statement after his Portland signing that ended
with: ``I believe that Portland has a legitimate chance to win an
NBA championship in the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   By implication, he's saying the Sonics do not. Money issues
aside, Schrempf the fitness hound was appalled that Baker turned
out so self-destructive last season, and that no amount of cajoling
by coaches or team leader and buddy Gary Payton could remedy the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are betting about $87 million that Schrempf has
misjudged Baker, as well as about $40 million that Richmond will be
a significant improvement over Schrempf.
</P>
<P>
   As you might surmise, Richmond and Baker aren't the only ones in
full sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Better add another candle to the vigil, Sonics fans.

FUNDS FLOW FOR ROGAN, SCHIFF AS CAMPAIGNS DRAW ON VOTER EMOTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE CONDON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hollywood's A-List has opened up their checkbooks
to support state Sen. Adam Schiff's bid to oust Rep. James Rogan,
but the Republican incumbent is ahead three to one in fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan in fact has become the leading fund-raiser in Congress
this year, a byproduct of his status as a national political
celebrity stemming from his role as a House prosecutor in President
Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Schiff and Rogan campaigns released the details late last
week of who is financing what has become the most closely watched
congressional race in the nation _ even though local voters won't
ultimately get to choose a congressman for another 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat raised $506,610 in the first six months of 1999,
compared with $1.5 million for Rogan, who has already surpassed the
$1.2 million he raised for his November 1998 race. Rogan has
already spent $622,726, mostly on an aggressive national mail
campaign to conservatives still angry that Clinton was not ejected
from office. Rogan reported having $949,445 cash on hand as of June
30, the closing date for a fund-raising period that ran from
January through June. Schiff reported $436,634 cash on hand and
that he has so far spent about $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff's campaign contribution list reads like a who's who of
top Hollywood power brokers. Among those who have given $1,000 or
$2,000 contributions so far: David Geffen, Norman Lear, Steven
Spielberg, his wife, actress Kate Capshaw, designer Calvin Klein,
outgoing Warner Bros. CEO Robert Daly, director Sydney Pollack,
former Universal Studios chief Lew Wasserman, producer Sandy
Gallin, composer Hans Zimmer, actor Michael Douglas, and singers
Jackson Browne and Don Henley.
</P>
<P>
   But for every Spielberg on Schiff's campaign contribution list,
Rogan has two Texas housewives and a retiree from Wisconsin. While
Schiff made big money at a fund-raiser on the DreamWorks animation
campus earlier this year, Rogan scored with his national mailer to
conservatives targeting the impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Rosales, Rogan's campaign manager, said the congressman has
to raise money from outside the district because Democrats have
made him a national target.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of Jim's increased profile,'' said Rosales.
``He's a national figure now and a hero to a lot of people. (The
contributors) don't want Congressman Rogan defeated by the likes of
(DreamWorks partner) David Geffen or left-wing extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff said Rogan is mimicking the campaign strategy of former
Orange County Republican Rep. Bob Dornan, who financed his
campaigns with pleas to conservatives nationwide. Schiff said he
will likely have to do a national mailer, too, just to compete with
Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disturbed by it, frankly. I'd think he'd like it if
conservatives from Texas, Alabama and Georgia got to decide who
represents us in this district,'' Schiff said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Rogan nor Schiff is expected to be challenged in the
March 2000 primary, but the campaign for the general election is in
full swing even though it won't happen until November 2000. Schiff
was recruited by Democrats who are targeting the incumbent to exact
revenge for his role in the impeachment. From the beginning, Geffen
and television producer Lear pledged their support to eject Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   But the impeachment trial turned Rogan into a national political
celebrity among Republicans. There was even an effort by California
Republicans to draft him to run for the U.S. Senate. A national
mailer he sent out in the spring asked donors to respond to a
``pledge of support,'' related to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not let Bill Clinton, the Hollywood liberals or the
labor union bosses throw you out of Congress simply because you did
what was right,'' read the pledge, which contributors were asked to
sign. ``I want you to know how proud I am of you, (Congressman)
Henry Hyde and all the Republican Impeachment managers. President
Clinton should have been removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiff sent out a mailer of his own on the impeachment issue.
Authored by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., it criticized Rogan as a
right-winger intent on throwing the Democratic president out of
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Re-electing James Rogan has become a national crusade for the
radical right,'' Boxer wrote. ``Let's focus on electing Adam and
removing Rogan as a positive ending to this sad chapter in our
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Hollywood support, Schiff, a former federal
prosecutor, is also heavily supported by lawyers, most of them from
his district or elsewhere in Los Angeles County. Of the individuals
who gave his campaign a contribution of $200 or more, 30 percent
identify themselves as lawyers. Of Rogan's top contributors, 5.2
percent identify themselves as lawyers. Rogan is a former county
prosecutor and Municipal Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   While Rogan did not have movie stars and directors on his list,
he did get major support from political action committees
associated with local entertainment companies, including Viacom,
The Walt Disney Co. Employees PAC, the Motion Picture Association
of America Inc., Sony Pictures Entertainment, Metro Goldwyn Mayer
and Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Under Federal Election Commission rules, candidates do not have
to itemize the contributions of people who gave less than $200.
Rogan scored big in this category, raking in $555,650 from small
contributions. The campaign has reported that 20,000 people have
contributed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the individuals who gave more than $200 to the Rogan
campaign, 30 percent were from out of state, 25 percent were from
within the district, 21 percent were from within the county of Los
Angeles, and 24 percent were from elsewhere in California.
</P>
<P>
   On the Schiff side, 14 percent of his top contributors were from
addresses in the district, 63 percent from within the county of Los
Angeles, 15 percent outside the county but within California, and 8
percent outside of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The 27th district includes Glendale, Burbank, La Canada
Flintridge, Pasadena, Sunland, Tujunga, Los Feliz, Altadena, San
Marino and South Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Under campaign finance rules, an individual can give a candidate
a maximum of $1,000 for the primary and $1,000 for the general
election. Schiff has already accepted the $2,000 maximum from most
of his Hollywood supporters, while most of Rogan's contributors
nationwide have only given their first $1,000 to his effort.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan has been raising more than Schiff, but he's also spending
a lot to raise money. National bulk mailings are very expensive,
and he has spent $638,000 of the $1.5 million he has raised. Rogan
reported spending $259,368 just for postage. Schiff has spent
$70,000 of his $506,000 in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff has been benefiting from the anti-impeachment backlash.
Besides all those celebrities, he's also getting help from an
Internet site dubbed MoveOn.org. So far, visitors to the site,
which is dedicated to defeating House impeachment managers like
Rogan, have given Schiff about $70,000, said Steve Gray-Barkan, a
consultant for the Schiff campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff made three unsuccessful bids for state legislative seats
before he was elected to the state Senate in 1996. Before that
race, the state Democratic party paid little attention to him. Now
Democrats nationally are strongly supporting him, and he's received
much attention from the Democratic National Congressional Campaign
Committee. He received $1,000 contributions from campaign
committees for Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys; Assemblyman
Gil Cedillo, D-Los Angeles; Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.; and Rep.
Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I. In all, he is reporting contributions from
34 different campaign committees from various Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan is also being heavily supported by Republican campaign
committees, with contributions of $1,000 from 16 separate
committees for Republican members of Congress. Rogan also received
generous support from corporate political action committees, raking
in cash from Bell Atlantic, General Electric, America Online,
Browning-Ferris Industries and Bayer.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff had few corporate PAC sponsors, but he did well among
unions and trade associations, including those associated with
teachers, lawyers, plumbers, boilermakers and blacksmiths.
</P>
<P>
   The contest will be a rematch of sorts. Rogan has beaten Schiff
twice, once in the June 1994 special election in Rogan's first run
for the state Assembly and again in the regular election in
November 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1996 Rogan won a seat in Congress, replacing
long-time Republican Rep. Carlos Morehead, who retired after
holding the seat for more than two decades. In the same election,
Schiff was elected to a four-year term in the state senate, in a
district that includes the entirety of Rogan's congressional
district.
</P>
<P>
   The region had been a Republican stronghold for decades, but
Schiff and two Democratic Assembly candidates won seats in 1996.
Throughout the 1990s, Democratic voter registration has been rising
in the area, in part due to an influx of new younger voters and
minorities. President Clinton won the area in both 1992 and 1996,
becoming the first Democrat to win in Glendale since Franklin
Roosevelt. Democrats now have 45 percent of the registerd voters
compared to 39 percent for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, Rogan was elected to a second term with 50.7
percent of the vote against a candidate he outspent by more than
two to one. But Schiff, with the advantage of being an incumbent
state senator, is considered a much more formidable opponent.

MAN PUTS UP CASH TO NAB PETTY THIEF, MAKE COMMUNITY SAFE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ Ralph Abruscato paid only $125 for a car
stereo last year, but now he's willing to pay a $500 reward for
help in catching the thief who stole it.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old resident of one of America's safest cities said
Monday that he's willing to pay a high price to rid his
neighborhood of even one small-time crook.
</P>
<P>
   ``My rationale is that I noticed that the only people (who) do
anything for anyone else is if there is something material to be
gained,'' Abruscato said. ``This has shattered my illusion that
Simi Valley (northwest of Los Angeles in neighboring Ventura
County) is a safe place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Simi Valley police Lt. Neal Rein said he has never heard of
anyone offering a reward for this type of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see reward signs up for lost cats or dogs, but this is
very unusual,'' Rein said. ``There's nothing preventing a person
from offering a reward, but they can't go around putting up their
own dead-or-alive posters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sony stereo was stolen either July 19 or 20 when Abruscato's
Mazda 323 was parked in a carport at his apartment complex. Police
took a report and dusted for prints.
</P>
<P>
   Abruscato bought a new stereo and now parks his car under a
street light where he can see it from his apartment. He has been
passing out fliers advertising the reward but so far has no leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have a duty to one another,'' Abruscato said. ``I've
learned that if you really want to snuff out crime, you've got to
pony up the cash.''

GARCIA FANS 10 AS MARINERS WIN FIFTH STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Freddy Garcia had reached his limit Monday night. In
pitches, true _that's why he was removed with two outs in the
eighth inning _ but also in winless starts. In his past two
outings, Garcia had no victories. For most other pitchers, that's
not news. But this is steady Freddy.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Moyer has endured two five-start stretches without a
victory. John Halama's longest is three. Jeff Fassero had a
six-start drought in April.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, the 22-year-old who had never pitched above Class A
before last season, has not gone more than two starts without a win
this year. He snapped his latest streak Monday by beating the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays, 4-0, before 45,118 at Safeco Field. The win was the
fifth in a row for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to do the same no matter what happened before,'' Garcia
said of his consistency, as lively music of his choosing pumped
through the clubhouse after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the past, and you have to deal with the future. I won
tonight, but tomorrow that's past.''
</P>
<P>
   For everyone else, though, his performance won't soon be
forgotten. Of all of Garcia's 11 victories, said manager Lou
Piniella, Monday night's was the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as good as he's pitched,'' Piniella said. ``This game
here, the 10 strikeouts tell the story. One walk _ that's
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella was booed as he visited the mound when Garcia allowed a
leadoff single in the eighth. He was cheered when he left him in to
face Dave Martinez and Bubba Trammell, both of whom Garcia retired.
</P>
<P>
   That brought Garcia's pitch total to 126, so Piniella called for
a reliever. More boos. Garcia trotted back to the dugout. Wild
cheers. Garcia lifted his cap in appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember, Freddy's never pitched into
September,'' said Piniella. ``We're very careful with our young
pitchers. But we're careful with everybody. We don't want to run
high pitch counts on anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Steve Sinclair walked his one hitter, but a refreshed
Jose Paniagua fanned John Flaherty on three pitches, then closed
things out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia matched his career high of 10 strikeouts when he whiffed
Fred McGriff for the second out of the sixth. He had struck out 10
in five innings in a loss at Los Angeles July 9. Garcia won his
next start, against San Diego in the Mariners' first Safeco Field
victory, but had a no-decision on July 22 and a loss at Kansas City
last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he allowed a double to Devil Rays leadoff hitter Terrell
Lowery. But Martinez popped up, Trammell struck out and McGriff
lined out to end the inning. Garcia would leave four more runners
in scoring position, something that has been a hallmark of his
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's real impressive about Freddy is when he gets in
trouble, he bears down more,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Two more Rays struck out in the second, and Garcia _ using a
devastating change-up _ fanned the side in the third after a
leadoff single by former Mariner Paul Sorrento. When Trammell and
McGriff struck out to open the fourth, Garcia had whiffed five
Devil Rays in a row, and gotten his last seven outs on strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was getting the breaking ball and change-up over,'' said
Sorrento, who has been in town for several days as his wife gave
birth to their second child. ``He made the pitches when he needed
to. For a young kid, he kept his composure. Even when he got
behind, he threw strikes, and that was key.''
</P>
<P>
   It's often said that the measure of a rookie _ whether he's a
keeper or a fleeting phenom _ is how he performs the more times he
faces a team. Monday's start was Garcia's third outing against the
Devil Rays, and he now owns a 2-0 record and a 1.53 earned-run
average against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was the best we've seen him,'' said Devil Rays manager
Larry Rothschild. ``His curveball was good and his change-up was
real good.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the fourth, the Mariners broke out against
Tampa Bay's rookie right-hander, Mickey Callaway. Alex Rodriguez
singled, and with one out, Callaway walked two hitters to load the
bases. A wild pitch scored Rodriguez and advanced the runners, and
a Dan Wilson single and Russ Davis sacrifice fly increased the
Mariners' lead to 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The M's scored again in the seventh when Edgar Martinez singled
in Ken Griffey Jr., who tripped rounding third base. The Devil Rays
appealed the play, saying Griffey missed the base, but were
unsuccessful.

 HOUSE SET TO LIMIT WINE SALES ON INTERNET  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Legislation that would limit Internet wine sales is
expected to steamroll through the House Tuesday, delivering a heavy
blow to California wineries and, opponents contend, running a sneak
attack on electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes Monday, opponents were crafting last-ditch
strategies to soften the bill by limiting it to sales to minors or
amending it to treat guns the same as alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   But with a similar measure having swept through the Senate 80 to
17, opponents have all but conceded that a major expansion of
government control over alcohol, ``the 21st Amendment Enforcement
Act,'' will soon become law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hypocrisy of this whole thing is, there's not a member in
Congress today who's not fighting for the title of champion of high
tech and champion of e-commerce and champion of the Internet,''
said Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif. ``And now, when they have their
first opportunity to vote, a lot of them are going to vote to
disadvantage e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow state attorneys general to prosecute in
federal court anyone who sells alcohol directly to consumers in
violation of the maze of state liquor laws that the 1933 repeal of
Prohibition left in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the underlying arguments about regulating alcohol
have changed remarkably little. But if the mob, the speakeasy and
bootlegged gin were the totems of Prohibition, the emblems of the
1999 wine war are the Internet, boutique Napa Merlots and boozy
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, consumers who live in the 20 states that permit some
direct alcohol shipments can ship wine home from a tasting room or
buy it through the Internet or direct mail. But in the remaining
states, direct shipments are illegal, and in five they are a
felony.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesalers and their allies say the bill will stop teenagers
from making alcohol cyberpurchases and help states uphold law and
order. If wineries ``don't abide by the law,'' said bill sponsor
Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., ``that would be just like somebody
selling pot over the Internet and saying you can't stop my right to
sell pot over the Internet. If the sales are legal, it's great; if
the sales of alcohol are illegal, then it's electronic
bootlegging.''
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers contend that it is a classic Washington plot hatched
by the powerful liquor wholesalers to protect their
state-sanctioned monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What gives them the special privilege, the status of royalty
in this country, that allows them to say, `Everything has to pass
through our little hands, otherwise it can't be done?''' said John
Dyson, owner of Williams &AMP; Selyem Winery in Healdsburg and
Millbrook Winery in New York. ``If you want to buy L.L. Bean boots
from Maine, right, nobody says you've got to have a distributor of
boots in the state of Indiana or California.''
</P>
<P>
   As many a Napa Valley tourist has discovered, direct shipping
from wineries to most out-of-state consumers has been illegal for
years. But along came the Internet, and with it the explosive
potential for small wineries _ who have long had trouble getting
their boutique wines onto liquor store shelves _ to bypass local
wholesalers and sell directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Liquor wholesalers hold a card that other industries can only
dream of _ their own constitutional amendment, the 21st, passed in
1933 to repeal Prohibition. As part of a compromise to win
ratification, the amendment prohibits ``the transportation into any
state ... of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws
thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   For any other product, a state ban on ``importation'' from other
states would violate the Constitution's Commerce Clause, which
forbids states to restrict interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   As constitutional law professor Lawrence Tribe put it in a 1995
symposium on ``Constitutional Stupidities,'' the upshot is that
there are only two ways a private citizen can violate the
Constitution: ``One is to enslave somebody. ... The other is to
bring a bottle of beer, wine or bourbon into a state in violation
of its beverage control laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Most states require alcoholic beverages to be sold only through
state-licensed wholesalers. The original intent was to prevent the
Mafia from controlling liquor distribution. The effect, many
economists say, was to create state-sanctioned monopolies that shut
out small wineries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of large distributors look on wineries of our size as a
nuisance,'' said Ben Zeitman, owner of the Amador Foothill Winery
near Placerville. ``They can't sell much, and the larger (wineries)
are banging on them to sell 10 percent more each year and
threatening to leave if they don't, so they don't want to sell
small premium wines.''
</P>
<P>
   David Dickerson, spokesman for the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers
of America, said the new legislation gives states needed authority
``to go after the perpetrators,'' meaning California wineries.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson, the Healdsburg vintner who once served a stint as deputy
mayor of New York City, retorted, ``The cynicism of this campaign
is breathtaking. I've been and out of government since I was (New
York) agriculture commissioner in 1975, and I've never seen a more
cynical campaign in my life. The idea that they are somehow
protecting underage drinkers by protecting them against buying a
$15 bottle of wine from Millbrook in New York is so fatuous that
nobody actually believes it, but it gives the legislature a reason
to go vote for this.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet grew more popular, the conflict intensified.
Last spring, the wholesalers drew a winning hand when Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, got wind of reports that minors in his state were
buying alcohol in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch introduced the current legislation, and Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., attached the measure to a big juvenile crime bill.
Suddenly, it passed the Senate, and all sides predict House passage
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vintners have been scrambling in vain for allies in the
high-tech industry. ``There has been precious little response,''
said Wayne Thevenot, president of the Electronic Commerce
Association, who says the bill invites lawmakers to regulate
anything sold over the Internet, from ``steamy underwear'' to
``dirty pictures or anything that anybody just doesn't happen to
like at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarborough said his bill in no way threatens the Internet. ``If
you want to move pot from Amsterdam into America, it sets a bad
precedent, but if you're shipping sweaters from J. Crew to San
Francisco over the Internet, it's perfectly fine.''

 BAY AREA RAPID TRANSITORY MADNESS  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Welcome to Mayor Willie Brown's Park 'n' Schlep. Instead of driving
into San Francisco, you can park here at colorfully desolate and
wind-ravaged Candlestick Point, and we bus you to and from
beautiful downtown San Francisco.
<P>
   That's Brown's plan, though da Mayor hasn't yet officially
approved my Park 'n' Schlep name.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of being a downer, I wonder: With all the shuttle
buses zooming into the city, and all the new ferryboats and trains
unloading people at shuttle-bus stops, and all the added public
transit necessitated by all the new hotels, shopping/ movie
complexes and ballparks in our new transit-first city, aren't we
steaming toward buslock?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should combine the sports of shopping and skydiving,
dropping planeloads of parachute-popping folks into the air above
Union Square. Bonus: They'll scare away the pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   OH GOODY, more frank talk about Bill Clinton's sex life!
</P>
<P>
   Hillary talks it over in Talk magazine, her first public
admission that Bill has been a bad boy.
</P>
<P>
   But is Clinton really a serial fondler, or is this new insight
into our president's troubled sexual psyche part of a vast
wife-wing conspiracy?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary says that Bill is aware of his problem, and since the
Monica scandal he ``has been working on himself very hard ...''
</P>
<P>
   So coming soon: Bill thumping himself in the chest with an index
finger and announcing sternly, ``I did  &UR; not &LR;   &LR; have sexual relations
with this man, Mr. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   CREEPING TOWARD US, Los Angeles is. Scientists say downtown L.A.
is moving north at a rate of one-fifth inch per year.
</P>
<P>
   If L.A.'s advance isn't halted by the San Gabriel Mountains, Los
Angeles will move into San Francisco in about 127 million years,
just about the time we'll be getting the city's parking crisis
under control.
</P>
<P>
   MERRY CHRISTMAS. Macy's is celebrating the start of the holiday
season with its traditional display of battery-powered dancing
Santas.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for the big summer frankincense blowout sale.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars, notes Wes Haley, believe that Jesus actually was
born in the summer. I point out to Wes that some scholars believe
that Santa's workshop is on Maui.
</P>
<P>
   I won't be pressured into starting Christmas festivities early.
I want to keep the season's spirit as pure as possible, so I'll
wait until after Halloween to assemble the plastic Christmas tree
and decorate my front lawn with my Star Wars Nativity scene.
</P>
<P>
   THE CANDLESTICK Park 'n' Pray shuttle service advocated by
Willie Brown is a fine idea.
</P>
<P>
   But why not a closer, more scenic parking lot?
</P>
<P>
   Treasure Island! Linked to the city with bus and ferry shuttle
service.
</P>
<P>
   No need to junk the plans for Treasure Island housing, amusement
parks and/or gambling dens. Simply raze the island's existing
buildings to make room for the parking, build a flat roof over the
parking level and build your parks, casinos, dorms for mayor's
girlfriends, etc., on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   YO QUIERO Pendleton, the great American shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Clem and Jean Falbo bought a Pendleton shirt and sent me the
label, which tells the story of Pendleton's founder, a pioneer
weaver named Thomas Kay.
</P>
<P>
   ``(He) made Oregon his home. It is here that Pendleton Originals
are created. ... They embody values and traditions rarely found
today, including how Kay's Great, Great, Great, Great Grandchildren
lovingly crafted the garment you now hold in your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same label: ``Assemble (sic) in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   What a heartwarming story: Descendants of the founder of a great
American clothing industry now earn a few pesos a day sewing
lumberjack shirts in a Mexican factory.
</P>
<P>
   DO NOT GO gentle into that good night. Light it up one last
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Neptune Society of Northern California, which scatters ashes
of loved ones at sea, has a new twist.
</P>
<P>
   The Neptuners, in conjunction with a San Diego company, will
load your ashes into fireworks shells and send you out as part of a
fabulous Fourth of July-type fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
   The first such aerial burial off the coast of San Francisco,
just last month, fittingly scattered the remains of John Kotowski
Sr., a missile and rocket scientist.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't mind going out that way. Having often been accused of
blowing stories out of proportion, it would seem a fitting finale.
</P>
<P>
   But two simple requests:
</P>
<P>
   One, my heirs are to receive royalties should the Neptune people
adopt my suggested advertising catch-phrase: ``No, it's not
snowing, Honey. That's Grandpa!''
</P>
<P>
   Two, please have me cremated first.

 UCSF Stanford's Reserve Fuels Debate Over Mount Zion Closure  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
While administrators hint they must close money-losing Mount Zion
Hospital, critics of the UCSF Stanford Health Care merger are
asking why the system would take such a drastic step when it is
sitting on a $501 million cash reserve.
<P>
   The size of the UCSF Stanford reserve, revealed in a budget
document obtained by the Chronicle, has fueled debate over whether
closure of Mount Zion is the best way for the troubled hospital
system to solve its financial problems. Administrators have said
Mount Zion accounted for $24 million of the $31 million operating
loss that UCSF Stanford Health Care has had in the first six months
of this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, UCSF Medical School Dean Haile Debas
sent the school's faculty an e-mail Friday, in which he seemed to
suggest UC should consider withdrawing from the merger rather than
let Mount Zion be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of Mount Zion is completely interlinked with that
of UCSF in our academic, clinical and social mission,'' Debas wrote
in an e-mail obtained by the Chronicle. He added that closure would
have ``serious ramifications ... to the future of the merger.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The e-mail is significant because it's the first hint that a
high-ranking UCSF official might be considering unraveling the
two-year old merger of Stanford and UC teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Debas, who is on sabbatical in Oxford, could not be reached for
comment. His e-mail said he has made undisclosed
``recommendations'' to UCSF Chancellor Mike Bishop and UC President
Richard Atkinson based on his personal belief that ``UCSF must
reexamine its own future.''
</P>
<P>
   Merger critic Warren Gold, president of the UCSF Faculty
Association, said it sounds to him as if Debas is ``drawing a line
in a the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The twin revelations _ of the sizeable cash reserve and the
Debas e-mail _ kept UCSF Stanford on the defensive yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   UCSF Stanford spokeswoman Laurie Itow confirmed yesterday that
the system had $501 million in liquid investments as of June. But
she said the system needs a reserve of this size _ the fund is
equivalent to 119 of operating cash _ to maintain its A+ bond
rating.
</P>
<P>
   Experts differed on the size of the reserve fund. Henry Kotula,
a hospital accounting expert in Pleasanton, said good bond ratings
permit companies to borrow money at more favorable interest rates.
Kotula said UCSF Stanford's cash reserve are actually lower than
the levels recommended by bond rating services like Moody's or
Standard and Poors.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Blum, a health care economist who represents a
coalition of UCSF Stanford employee unions, said the issue came
down to values. Blum said hospital administrators should use some
of that reserve to make up for operating losses, rather than focus
solely on mainting a bond rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of what being a non-profit corporation is all
about,'' Blum said. ``You accumulate reserves to make up for the
years you fall short.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Colombo, who follows bonds for the Income Securities
Advisor newsletter in Miami Lakes, Florida, called a slight slip in
bond rating ``not that big a deal.'' On a $100 million borrowing,
for instance, dropping from a AA to an A rating would boost annual
interest payments from $4.88 million to $5.02 million _ an added
expense of $140,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The financial picture at UCSF Stanford should become more clear
in a few weeks, when the state legislature completes an audit that
the privately-controlled system only agreed to under pressure from
state Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough.
</P>
<P>
   Speier could not be reached for comment yesterday on the cash
reserve dispute nor the Debas e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But the timed release of the two issues was clearly part of a
campaign by merger opponents to increase pressure on the
beleaguered hospital system to find some way to staunch its red ink
that doesn't include closing Mount Zion.

 S.F. Exceeds Minority Goals in SFO Expansion  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
San Francisco has surpassed its goals in hiring minority and women
contractors to work on the new $2.4 billion San Francisco
International Airport expansion project, according to a report to
be released today.
<P>
   In the year ended June 30, the airport commission said $215
million in contracts were awarded to minority- and female-owned
businesses. For the entire project, which is California's largest
public works venture, these enterprises received approximately $650
million in contracts, or 27 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of construction, the new international terminal,
will be completed next year and will effectively double the size of
the airport from 2 million to 4 million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the airport commission and the San Francisco Human
Rights Commission set a goal that 11 percent to 12 percent of the
work on this portion of the project would be for minority-and
female-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The largest minority contract, more than $23 million, was
awarded to the San Francisco African American firm Scott-Norman for
plumbing, heating and other mechanical work. Marinship
Construction, another African American company, won the $10 million
contract to build the fire station. And Kwan Henmi Architects,
whose principal is an Asian American woman, received the contract
to design three ``Airtrain'' stations to transport travelers
between terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Airport Director John Martin said the project has exceeded its
minority and women hiring goals ``by splitting bigger contracts
into smaller pieces, establishing a surety program to assist
minority and women contractors in getting bonded so they could
qualify for public construction work, and setting aside certain
contracts for small business.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the airport stipulated that only small businesses
could bid on the contract to operate and manage the new 5,000-stall
parking garage for airport employees and tenants. This piece of the
project, which will generate $200,000 in annual management fees,
was awarded entirely to minority bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The new international terminal and additional 3,000 parking
spaces for travelers are scheduled to be completed next summer. The
light rail links and BART station will be be finished by 2001.

 Janitors Strike Scrubbed  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Following a weekend of marathon negotiations, the union
representing about 3,500 San Francisco janitors reached a tentative
contract agreement with employers yesterday and called off a
threatened strike.
<P>
   A final vote on the accord likely will be held by union members
next week, said Isobel White, a spokeswoman for Local 87 of the
Service Employees International Union, whose members clean nearly
all downtown office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative four-year pact guarantees regular salary increases
as well as preferential treatment for more-senior janitors. In
return, the union agreed to do away with the traditional ``hiring
hall'' system of doling out job assignments to part-time workers
from a central location.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not an easy negotiation,'' said Bob Ford, lead
negotiator for the Building Owners and Managers Association. ``We
didn't get everything, they didn't get everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he termed the pending contract ``a fair settlement'' and
said employers ``feel good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Union janitors now make between $9.80 and $14.05 an hour. Their
current contract expired at midnight Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Talks continued throughout the weekend, with the union and
employers finally coming to terms around 3 a.m. yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Tension between the two sides rose considerably in recent days
as hundreds of janitors staged noisy demonstrations on downtown
streets and employers threatened to bring in nonunion workers in
the event of a strike.
</P>
<P>
   The real sticking point in the talks, sources said, was the San
Francisco hiring hall, the last such facility for janitors in the
United States. Union leaders reportedly were reluctant to part with
a system that allowed them to serve as an intermediary in keeping
their members employed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, janitors would no longer convene at a
central location to receive assignments. Instead, employers would
maintain an agreed-upon list of workers in descending order of
seniority. The employers would contact each janitor individually by
phone as jobs came up.
</P>
<P>
   Building owners had argued for more flexibility in hiring,
although union leaders perceived this as a move toward assigning
work to lower-paid janitors.
</P>
<P>
   The pending accord would protect senior workers while shifting
the initiative in the hiring process away from the union and toward
employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hiring hall has been part of the process for a long
time,'' said Richard Leung, president of Local 87 of the janitors'
union. ``It's hard to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he termed the tentative contract ``a tremendous
victory'' and stressed that ``both sides get something.''
</P>
<P>
   Leung said he believes union members will support the accord
once it can be explained to them in detail. A vote will be held, he
said, after the legal paperwork is completed and translations are
made into several languages.
</P>
<P>

 _ SF CHRON  
 Deal Cooking to Buy the California Culinary Academy  &HT;     By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Career Education Corp. of Illinois has agreed to buy the California
Culinary Academy in an all-cash deal valued at $31 million, the
companies said yesterday.
<P>
   The sale of the San Francisco cooking school was brokered by a
group of academy shareholders who have been unhappy with the
school's aggressive expansion plans which, they say, appeared
likely to sacrifice profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1977, the academy has trained more than 5,600 people
for restaurant careers through its 30-week baking and pastry chef
program and 16-month culinary arts degree program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the cooking academy operated out of the old
German Social Hall at Polk and Turk streets, the school runs two
restaurants and satellite ``college of food'' campuses in San Diego
and Salinas (Monterey County) that offer 24-week restaurant
training programs. Total enrollment in all programs is 850
students, whose tuition ranges between $5,000 and $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the academy bought six buildings in New Orleans
with the intent to develop them into an $18 million culinary
academy comparable to the San Francisco operation. The new campus
would have a capacity of 1,200 students.
</P>
<P>
   But existing shareholders were upset with the New Orleans
expansion because it looked costly, particularly in view of the
academy's lackluster financial performance.
</P>
<P>
   Many shareholders have lost money since the academy went public
six years ago. The stock was issued at $6 a share and has traded as
high as $9 before recently falling back to the $6 range. Career
Education Corp. offered $6.50 per share.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans expansion was to have been funded by the
issuance of $7 million worth of convertible preferred stock, which
would have further diluted the value of existing shares, investors
said.
</P>
<P>
   One major shareholder, who asked not to be identified, said a
nucleus of investors decided they wanted to get their money out.
Even though the stock is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange,
trading is thin because there only are 3.8 million shares
outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management's plans were just too grandiose,'' said the
shareholder. ``There was all this focus on the New Orleans
expansion, and they lost sight of the fact they're running a
business that should produce results for the shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm reported a modest profit of $713,000 for the first nine
months of the fiscal year, up from a loss of $413,000 for the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders blocked an attempt to get investor approval for the
new stock issuance in June. Instead, directors Theodore Crocker,
the academy's former CEO, and William DeMar, an Alameda real estate
developer, formed a committee to find a merger partner.
</P>
<P>
   It was this committee that struck the deal with Career Education
Corp., a 5-year-old company with more than 16,000 students training
for careers in the fashion industry, computer industry, business
services and culinary arts. It operates 25 schools in 14 states,
including six culinary academies.
</P>
<P>
   Culinary Academy chief executive Keith Keogh said the New
Orleans expansion will continue, as planned, once the merger takes
place. But a spokesman for Career Education Corp., Bill Klettke,
said no final decision has been made. ``It's still under review,''
Klettke said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens with the New Orleans campus, Klettke
said existing students of the San Francisco school still will get
all the classes they need to complete their certificate or degree
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about this acquisition,'' Klettke said. ``The
California Culinary Academy has an excellent reputation and
location, and it will help us solidify our presence on the West
Coast.''

CYBER-STOCK BUBBLE BURSTS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  While the rest of the stock market is holding its own, Internet
stocks have been battered lately by a glut of new initial public
offerings, putrid earnings reports and investor fears about
inflation.
<P>
   Such high-visibility speculative favorites as Amazon.com,
America Online and eBay have plummeted 30 to 40 percent and more
since the end of March. The Dow Jones industrial average, by
contrast, is up nearly 9 percent for the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the Internet slump began, market experts were
warning that the bubble must burst _ that the prices of these
stocks had gotten far ahead of themselves, outstripping reasonable
estimates of future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But speculators resolutely ignored the warnings, and Internet
stocks kept on rocketing.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they have turned sour, things could get even worse,
warns Owen Fitzpatrick, an investment manager with Bankers Trust in
New York. ``It's tough to put a proper value on Internet stocks,
because most of them don't have any earnings _ so there's no
telling how far prices might drop,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no upside barrier,'' Fitzpatrick says, ``and it's
hard to find a barrier on the downside. It will be tough going over
the next several weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   So, how did all this happen?
</P>
<P>
   There seem to be almost as many answers as there are Internet
stocks. Many experts are blaming the chronic failure of most
Internet companies to earn money, as well as newly awakened
investor fears about inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But the most persuasive answer is that there are, in fact, too
many Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A stock market, as people sometimes forget, is ruled by supply
and demand. The supply of Internet stocks is increasing at the rate
of a dozen or so a month, as practically every company with an
Internet identity rushes to take advantage of the investor mania
and go public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of Internet stocks now _ a big supply,'' says
Paul Brahe, director of research with Preferred Capital Markets in
San Francisco. ``Earlier on, when there were only a few, everyone
wanted to own those.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony O'Bryan, a technical analyst with A.G. Edwards and Son in
St. Louis, says: ``Some of the money that is going into these new
stocks is coming out of the likes of Amazon.com, eBay and America
Online.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnesandnoble.com is attracting investor dollars that
previously went into Amazon.com. Juniper Networks, based in
Mountain View, is one of the new investment alternatives to Cisco.
China.com is an alternative to Yahoo, while Ask Jeeves is an
alternative to Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   The list could go on and on.
</P>
<P>
   The stream of new Internet IPOs also has alerted investors to
the fact that the industry's earlier players, previously thought to
have carved out secure niches for themselves, may face damaging
competition.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet stocks as a group are performing weakly, it is
generally the old favorites that are performing worst.
</P>
<P>
   This is reflected in the performance of TheStreet.com Internet
index, consisting of 20 relatively large Internet-related stocks,
which closed Monday down 16 percent from the end of March. The more
broadly based Interactive Week Internet index, with 49 members, was
down 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks also are being squeezed by investor
disillusionment over their earnings _ or, in most cases, lack of
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Because investors have been so enthusiastic about the Internet's
supposedly vast commercial potential, it has become common for
Internet companies to go public before they earn a cent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the companies that have gone public have gone public a
lot earlier than companies usually do,'' notes Keith E. Benjamin,
an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same sort of phenomenon that inspired many infant
biotech companies, some with absolutely no revenues, to go public
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, almost the entire roster of publicly held Internet
companies is wallowing in red ink. With no earnings against which
to compare prices, their stocks are being valued on expectations,
hopes, even dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, dreams end. And they are never an adequate
substitute for real earnings _ or the immediate prospect of
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Less-than-scintillating financial reports last month from two
prominent Internet companies served as a wake-up call for many
investors.
</P>
<P>
   On July 21, Amazon.com _ which has never reported a profit _
announced that it lost $138 million in the second quarter, or six
times more than it lost a year earlier. Its revenues rose nearly
threefold from a year earlier, but only 7 percent from the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com investors clearly were not happy with the report.
They pounded the stock price down nearly 20 percent during the next
four trading sessions.
</P>
<P>
   There was more bad news for Internet investors on July 26, when
eBay reported that its second-quarter net income _ it is one of the
few Internet companies that actually earns a profit _ fell by 70
percent even though revenues more than doubled. EBay stock dropped
8 percent in two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of uncertainty surrounding this earnings
season,'' remarks Shaun Andrikopoulos, an analyst with Deutsche
Banc Alex. Brown in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Acuff, market strategist at Salomon Smith Barney in New
York, says Internet profits ``are not coming along as fast as
people hoped. A company can say `Our sales are fantastic,' but at
some point they have to produce profits. You can't just keep
telling people that eventually the profits will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Also dragging on the Internet stocks are investor fears about
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in congressional testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan renewed his threat to raise interest rates to combat
inflation if the economy overheats.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later the U.S. Labor Department issued a report
suggesting that the overheating may have begun. It said labor costs
in the second quarter rose at their fastest rate in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation, while it can play havoc with planning at almost any
kind of business, is especially worrisome for investors in Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Companies with solid current earnings tend to be least affected
by inflation because they can muddle through periods of customer
budget-tightening. But those for whom earnings are a vague, distant
prospect may never see the earnings materialize if the economy goes
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a low-inflation environment, investors are willing to pay
for earnings that might not develop until two to five years from
now,'' says Stewart J. Pillette, of Pillette Investment Management
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you think inflation is going to accelerate, then you
have to believe the Fed will tighten. And if it has to tighten too
much, that will cause a recession, and you may not see those future
earnings after all.''

 &HT;    MOST OVER 45 ENJOY SEX REGULARLY, SURVEY FINDS
 &HT;    Embargoed by source for release Wednesday, Aug. 4.
 &HT;    Repeating in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most Americans age 45 and older are having sex at
least once a week and enjoy it, according to a survey released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey, conducted on behalf of the seniors group AARP
for its magazine Modern Maturity, found sharp differences in sexual
attitudes among men and women, and those with and without life
partners.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found differences by age, with middle-aged
respondents having sex more often and enjoying it more.
</P>
<P>
   The mail survey of 1,384 adults was conducted in March with the
assistance of John McKinlay of New England Research Institutes and
NFO Research Inc. of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This survey is unique because it looks at the attitudes,
behaviors and life circumstances starting at age 45, as compared to
studies that start at ages 59 or 60,'' said Constance Swank, AARP
research director.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are some generational differences, we found that a
majority of mid-life and older adults feel good about their lives
right now, and 67 percent of men and 57 percent of women say a
satisfying sexual relationship is important to that quality of
life,'' Swank said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that middle-aged and older couples have a
regular sex life, with more than 60 percent of men and women aged
45 to 59 reporting they engaged in sexual intercourse at least once
a week.
</P>
<P>
   For men and women over 75, the frequency declined to about 25
percent having intercourse once a week. Over all, more than 60
percent of respondents with partners said they had intercourse at
least once a month.
</P>
<P>
   However, the frequency dropped sharply for those without life
partners. While more than half of all men and women with partners
reported intercourse at least once a week, only 6 percent of men
and one-half of 1 percent of women without partners had intercourse
that often.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 80 percent of the men and 96 percent of
the women without partners had not had sexual intercourse in the
past six months.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between couples and single adults were reflected
in other forms of sexual activity, including kissing and hugging,
caressing and oral sex. The survey found that men _ with and
without partners _ engaged in self-stimulation about eight times
more frequently than women.
</P>
<P>
   Men of all ages were more likely to think about sex than women,
with 28 percent of males and 5 percent of females age 45 to 59
having sexual thoughts more than once a day. For those over 75, 18
percent of men and 57 percent of women reported not having any
sexual thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Men were more likely to think sex was important in their lives
and was a critical part of a relationship. Women were more likely
to say they did not particularly enjoy sex or that they would be
happy never having sex again, although less than 20 percent of the
women gave such answers.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings of the survey were:
</P>
<P>
   _ About 10 percent of men and 7 percent of women have ever used
medicines, hormones or other treatments to improve sexual function
or activity. Slightly more than half of those who have tried such
treatments are currently using them.
</P>
<P>
   Among men taking treatment, sexual activity increased from 25
percent to 33 percent having sex at least once a week. But because
of the small number of people taking treatment, the survey found
the increase was not enough to be significant.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of men and women taking such treatment said it
increased their enjoyment of sex and had a positive effect on their
partner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Older people found their partners both more physically
attractive and romantic than young people, but at least half of all
age groups gave their partners the highest rating for being
physically attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Six of 10 men and half of the women in their 40s and 50s gave
their partners top rating as physically attractive, while 64
percent of men and 57 percent of women aged 75 and older said the
same of their partners.
</P>
<P>
   _ Older and younger women have sharply different attitudes
toward sex.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of women aged 45 to 59 said ``people should not
have a sexual relationship if they are not married,'' compared to
two-thirds of women 75 and older. Among men, 28 percent of those
aged 45 to 59 and half of those over 75 said sex should only be for
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   _ Over all, a third of the men said they were ``somewhat
satisfied'' with their sex life, while nearly a third of the women
said they were ``extremely satisfied'' with their sex life.

 &HT;    Ohio police force not representative of residents
 &HT;    By Christine Vasconez
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dayton Police Department's sporadic minority
recruitment tactics have netted little, except for its ranking as
the whitest force among major police departments in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the department has struggled with its facade,
attempting to make it more closely represent the 40 percent black
people who live here. However, 88 percent of its police force is
white.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 years, Dayton Police Department's racial makeup
has changed little. And it's most recent crop of recruits, despite
being diverse, won't change the overall percentage of minorities in
the department.
</P>
<P>
   The 90th recruit class, which graduated Thursday night at the
Dayton Convention Center, included three black males, seven
females, one Native American male and 10 white males.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew several Dayton police officers and it's something I
thought of during high school,'' said recruit Eric Henderson, who
is black.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson wasn't necessarily a byproduct of the police
department's recruiting efforts, rather he was a security officer
at Elder-Beerman and officers told him about the entrance exam.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton has the lowest in percentage of blacks on the force with
12 percent compared to the other seven large police departments in
the state, according to the 1997 Bureau of Justice Statistics. Most
of the other departments employ at least 20 percent blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. John Huber, the academy commander, said the next class _ the
91st _ has no blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minorities we have are better than not having any at
all,'' Dayton police public information officer Carol Johnson
said.``We've had classes where there aren't any.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's recruitment techniques, like cadet school and traveling
to predominantly black colleges or universities that offer criminal
justice as a major course of study, have failed to increase the
black presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anyone assigned to recruiting at this point,''
Maj. Barbara Temple said.``We do some recruiting, maybe not the
best recruiting in the world, but we do it in the confines we're
given. I don't know why we have such a low minority rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Akron, Cincinnati and Canton police departments mirror
their communities. For example, the Akron Police Department is 26
percent black and the city's population is 25 percent black,
according to 1990 U.S. Census and U.S. Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those departments operate year-round recruitment teams
or units, while Dayton only recruits at churches, job fairs and
schools for two months every two years, when the entrance test is
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   During that same time, a police officer visits colleges in other
states to recruit, like last year's trip to Georgia and North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we ended up with one person from Georgia or
North Carolina that made it to the test,'' she said. ``Obviously,
that's not worth it. We put a lot of expense in it and got no
return.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Academy counselor Joe Saluke said the city needs to focus
its efforts in town and consistently throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   He also believes part of the responsibility of recruiting lies
with the city and the Civil Service Commission, which ultimately
hires the recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Dayton hired Trent Grooms, a Columbus professional
recruiter, a couple months before the test. Dayton police didn't
have recruitment costs available.
</P>
<P>
   A Dayton police hiring and recruitment committee recently formed
to study long term and short-term solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will recommend the Civil Service Commission change
testing from a general knowledge test to an aptitude test, which
she said will maintain minorities in the hiring pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still batting around items, looking at the whole process
because sometimes the pen and pencil test doesn't tell if someone's
a good officer,'' she said. Temple favors testing people every year
so those interested in police work don't get swept up by the
higher-paying private sector jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen City's charge for diversity
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Police Division has increased its black
population to 26 percent, not really by choice but by court order.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago the federal government, the city and the
Fraternal Order of Police signed a consent decree requiring every
Cincinnati recruit class be 34 percent black and 23 percent female.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Police Academy Director Ted Schoch said the federal
order was issued mainly because the department had miserably failed
in the past to reflect the city's black population of 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That added pressure pushed the division to hire a recruitment
unit: four recruiters _ two of whom are black _ one sergeant and
one clerk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed. We are aggressive. We think nothing of
raiding other police agencies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising ranges from radio commercials to billboards
plastered on city buses with men and women clad in blue. Since the
order, Cincinnati has met the minority requirements for every
class.
</P>
<P>
   Schoch estimates Cincinnati spends $25,000 just on advertising
and $20,000 on travel expenses for the recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Cincinnati started what Dayton gave up in the
early 90s after no success _ a cadet intern program.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year program targets minorities, offering free college
tuition if the person maintains a 2.0 grade point average and
attends six hours of college courses per quarter or semester. The
cadet also gets paid to work for the police division 32 hours a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception, one black male and two females, are in the
academy this year.
</P>
<P>
   For Dayton and other law enforcement agencies across the
country, why they have low minority represenation is the most
difficult question. Next is how to change it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe historically there has been a mistrust of police for
whatever reason, whether that mistrust is actual or perceived,''
Dayton information officer Johnson said. ``People feel they don't
want to be a part of something that has been a negative experience.

 &HT;    Richards' tip: Ignore Bush
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As the Democrats struggle to figure out how to
lasso George W. Bush's rising presidential star, the first Democrat
to lose to him is ready with this advice:
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't pay any attention to him,'' former Gov. Ann
Richards said on ``Larry King Live'' last week. ``I would tell
them, number one, get a message and, number two, light a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't mess with Texas' governor, says Richards, now a Washington
lobbyist and supporter of Al Gore's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd let (Bush) be who he is going to be,'' said Richards, who
in 1994 got an up-close-and-personal look at Bush's ability to
stick to a narrow set of issues.
</P>
<P>
   Richards' advice comes as Democrats struggle to find the best
way to make their case that Bush is a do-little governor with
``right-wing priorities.'' The Democratic National Committee is
working overtime at putting Bush in a box with fanatic gun
enthusiasts, school voucher proponents who would wreak havoc on
public schools, big business, people who oppose hate-crime laws and
folks who want HMOs to run roughshod over the ill and downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-governor's advice also comes as Gore finds himself having
to contend with Bill Bradley's race for the Democratic nomination
while Bush has become a prohibitive favorite for the GOP nod.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Bush's biggest headache may be Steve
Forbes' self-financed effort to show that Bush is not far enough to
the right for GOP primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Gore campaign has taken Richards' advice. Criticism
of Bush from Gore, the Democratic front-runner, has been relatively
low-key. The vice president stepped it up a notch in Houston on
Wednesday in a speech to the National Council of La Raza. Without
mentioning Bush, Gore interpreted the governor's ``compassionate
conservatism'' as a plan for ``letting people fend for themselves
or hope for crumbs of compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest Democratic fire on Bush _ a possible hint of things
to come _ has come from the Democratic National Committee. Six of
the 11 topics on the DNC's Web site index page are dedicated to
Bush bashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Wimpy Bush'' he is called.
</P>
<P>
   In a ``daily hit'' this week, DNC National Chairman Joe Andrew
noted that Texas ranked 48th in the Children's Rights Council's
list of best places to raise children. Texas was 29th when Bush
took office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's rhetoric about his accomplishments in Texas
don't meet the reality. While he tries to advance his political
career, many Texas children are being left far, far behind,'' said
Andrew. ``I guess George W. Bush's compassionate conservatism
doesn't apply to children.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of message that Roy Romer, the DNC's national
general chairman, would like to see more of from Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Romer believes it's time to rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president and Bradley have both got to make their own
calls as to when they get directly one on one with Bush because
there is still a primary going on,'' he said. ``I'll tell you that
very soon we've got to get this campaign joined, and the joining is
on basic gut issues.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gore tried to pick a political fight with Bush by
offering up a tax-cut plan that doesn't stray much from the one now
being pushed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't squander the surplus and also keep our economy
strong. You can't have your cake and eat it, too. Come to think of
it, it sounds a little like `compassionate conservatism,''' Gore
said, referring to Bush's campaign credo.
</P>
<P>
   But at Gore 2000, despite rumblings about a campaign not yet
hitting on all cylinders, there is no public talk of major changes
in its approach to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is on our candidate and getting the vice president
out there and laying out his agenda for the people to see and
showing the people who Al Gore is and what he is all about,'' said
campaign spokesman Roger Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said there are no immediate plans for Gore to try to
make the case that Bush is unqualified to lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is up to the voters to decide, not for us. We
think our candidate is more than qualified. He is an exemplary
leader and has shown demonstrated leadership throughout his
career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore strategy is just not cutting it, says Richards, who
believes the vice president faces the challenging chore of moving
out of a president's shadow. Bush's father did it in 1988 when he
became the first incumbent vice president elected to the White
House since Martin Van Buren in 1836.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that they have been at it so long that it's really
hard to be fresh,'' Richards said of Gore. ``He has been the vice
president. He has been the heir apparent, and everybody has been
focused on Al as the next president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And they don't have focus,'' she said of the Gore campaign.
``They are all over the place. One day it is mental health. The
next day it is more money for cancer. All of these really good
causes. But you've got to have discipline; you've got to have
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a talent Richards says Bush has in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you said to George, 'What time is it?' he would say, 'We
must teach our children to read.' . . . He is very disciplined, and
he knows what his message is, and he's going to give you that
message no matter what,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the current Democratic effort, the party's Texas
gubernatorial nominee last year, Garry Mauro, tried to show voters
that Bush is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Richards says Bush is a great connector with people. He reminds
her of another Texan who wound up in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is Lyndonesque,'' she told King. ``You know how Lyndon used
to get you by the arm . . . and he whispers in your ear, `How's
your mama and all them.' That kind of wonderful personal approach,
and by the time you got through, you gave him whatever he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you run against George Bush, he is going to have one
message,'' said Richards. ``He is going to say that message until
the world gags and everybody else is going to be able to say it
back.'' Richards said she believes the Democrats may have an
opening to go after Bush on gun issues. She now blames her loss to
Bush on her opposition to allowing Texans to carry concealed
weapons. In 1993, she vetoed a nonbinding referendum on the issue.
In 1995, Bush signed a concealed weapons bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost the race really over guns,'' said Richards. ``That was
the number one issue. . . . I still think it's insane that we allow
people to put guns in their pockets and walk down the street. But a
majority of Texans did not agree, and George Bush was four-square
in favor of concealed weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas in May, Gore, without mentioning Bush, showed that he
sees guns as a defining issue: ``We don't need more concealed
weapons in our malls and our movie theaters and on our streets.''

 &HT;    Circle unbroken for an old man, JFK Jr. and the sea
 &HT;    By Heather Graulich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Boston Whaler bounced across a
choppy Gulf of Mexico, its captain a twentysomething fishing guide
in sport sandals and camp shirt. He talked about moody tarpon.
</P>
<P>
   We half-listened. My mother and I hadn't come to Naples, Fla. to
fish.
</P>
<P>
   She sat in the bow of the rental boat, the plastic box wedged
between her feet. I tried to find a scrap of shade under the boat's
canvas top.
</P>
<P>
   Life really does circle around in mysterious ways. Two days
earlier, somber and black-clad Kennedys had boarded the impressive
Navy destroyer USS Briscoe and said goodbye to JFK Jr., scattering
his ashes into a cold Atlantic that had claimed him once before.
Sailors in dress whites stood watch, as did legions of media.
</P>
<P>
   And here we were, 48 hours later, committing the ashes of
someone we loved to the sea, someone who long ago may have smiled
upon a little boy named John-John.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Beary Jr., my mother's father, had died in March at 86,
peacefully, in his bed at my parents' Rhode Island home. Years
before, after retiring from the U.S. Secret Service, he took on a
last assignment for extra pension: guarding President Kennedy
during Sunday Mass.
</P>
<P>
   I imagined my grandfather slowly scanning the church, glimpsing
John-John in the pews. Maybe he had thought to himself, ``Fine boy,
no trouble,'' the same endearment he'd bestow on all his grandsons
a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe John-John noticed the tall, broad-shouldered man in
the dark suit who always seemed to be around on church days, the
dead-serious man who would suddenly wink at you when no one else
was looking.
</P>
<P>
   His strong hands would be folded and John-John wouldn't know
then, would never know, that those same hands had cradled Franklin
Delano Roosevelt as he lay dying. Hands that would hold his father,
too, if need be. It wasn't needed, not then, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   John-John grew up, and Jim Beary grew old. He retired to Naples
with his wife, and played golf almost every day. They taught
grandchildren to swim and fed us grapefruit and guava from their
yard. My grandfather remained dead-serious, sharing his favorite
Secret Service stories with family but always holding a little bit
back _ with a wink. He had lived a life dedicated to protocol, but
he never liked ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why my mother and I had come to Naples, found a boat
with no name and a skipper with no uniform. We wore shorts and
sneakers. The captain pulled the Whaler to within a few hundred
yards of the Naples Pier and idled the engine.
</P>
<P>
   No one else watched as my mother took the black plastic box out
of a grocery bag, then pulled another plastic bag out of the box.
She made a hole in it with her finger and slowly poured the ashes
into the green Gulf. I watched the waves pull them away, below.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather loved the water, like John Jr. And he, too, was
now with his bride in the same warm sea where her ashes had been
scattered 10 years earlier. The Whaler headed for port, the fishing
guide lounging back, steering with his feet. I smiled at the sweet
simpleness of the day, and for the smallest moment, I imagined the
gentle movement of tides, and an old man seeing a younger one for
the first time in many years, and giving him a wink.

 &HT;    Flying's the pits, but it's entertainment
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, Fla _ Sitting around in airports is
not high on my list of pleasurable pastimes but it's not as bad as
the grumps would have us believe. All it takes is an appreciation
of the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   My advice to the novice flyer would be to check in early. The
day before your flight would be best; that's how long you'll be
standing in line, until you've missed your departure, at which
point the airline will offer you a couple of bucks to go have lunch
while they figure out what to do with you. Truth is, they're hoping
you'll get tired and go away.
</P>
<P>
   Always allow extra time for the security check because you're
going to be stuck behind some guy with a belt buckle that sends the
metal detector into a squealing frenzy. It will then take a
militant-looking lady with a wand ten minutes to determine that the
suspect is not an inept terrorist who didn't have sense enough to
smuggle his weapons aboard on the caterer's truck.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of food. . . don't bother. Ever since the airlines
discovered that passengers who starve to death en route have
absolutely no effect on corporate earnings, they have become
insensitive to the traveler's need for sustenance. You should eat
before you leave home, unless you have a yen for a $5 airport hot
dog and a surly waitperson who introduces herself as ``Sarah'' when
the nameplate pinned to her wilted lapel clearly reads
``Heatherlynne.'' If your luck runs out altogether, maybe you'll
run into the family I had breakfast with this morning.
</P>
<P>
   An obviously harried young mother carrying snorkels and trailing
two small rogues and an android I assumed to be her husband, was
seated at the table next to mine. I ordered pancakes and decaf. Our
chat was brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've spilled your syrup,'' she whined, pointing to the mess
around my plate, ``and now my little boy's knee is all sticky.'' I
apologized, saying that had I known her kid would be crawling
through my plate, I would have been more careful.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if for some reckless reason you should find yourself
already on board and hungry, do not fall for the old, ``Would you
like to have lunch with us today?'' routine, because while you're
thinking real food, the flight attendant is handing you a box
containing one mushy apple, a candy bar, and a plastic cookie with
somebody's grandmother's name on the wrapper. Better you should eat
the box and order some fruit juice with vodka as a chaser.
</P>
<P>
   And when is someone going to invent a guide for the hapless
traveler showing where the cheap seats are located? I want one like
the guy next to me always has. ``I only paid $49.95 for this
flight,'' he gloats, ``and they threw in a rental car.'' I tell him
to shut up because I've had to mortgage my two cats just to get
this far.
</P>
<P>
   In the unlikely event you make it to the gate at all, an
indifferent agent who really doesn't give a fat rat's backside that
your 97-year-old aunt is waiting for you in Buffalo, callously
informs you that your flight has already been closed out, but if
you hurry to the window you can watch it (and your luggage) being
pushed back from the gate.
</P>
<P>
   But do not despair, fellow traveler, because you still have a
couple of choices left. You can either sit by the window and watch
everybody (ITAL) else (END ITAL) go somewhere, or you can do what I
do _ turn around and observe the unfolding human spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a show. Right now I'm watching a lovely young thing
wearing half-a-dress and platform sneakers reapply her underarm
deodorant as she waits to check in. The man behind her is curiously
riveted to her left armpit.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, airline travel is the pits (literally), but the
floor show makes up for it.

 &HT;    Don't let inflation eat up retirement income
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the scariest thing about investing when you are retired
or getting close?
</P>
<P>
   If you answered ``losing money in the stock market,'' experts
say you're wrong. ``The answer is inflation,'' explained Mark
DiGiovanni, a certified financial planner in Atlanta. ``We lose
sight of that because of relatively mild inflation of recent
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason: People live longer these days, and many retire
younger. Even modest inflation will rapidly reduce buying power as
the years go by.
</P>
<P>
   At age 65, Americans can expect to live another 15 to 19 years,
depending on race and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation will presumably last longer than that. If it averages
4 percent, DiGiovanni pointed out, a dollar's worth of goods will
cost $2.19 in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   That's why financial planners suggest that stocks should be a
part of your portfolio, even in retirement years. Those who stay
with super-safe investments _ including money market funds,
certificates of deposit and bonds _ can expect solid, steady
returns that provide less purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to balance your investments, keeping some readily
available to meet your needs and putting the rest in
growth-oriented investments, such as stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Some would advise putting a set percentage of your money in
money markets, bonds and stocks.
</P>
<P>
   DiGiovanni takes a different approach. He starts with the
presumption that while the stock market is volatile, it never stays
down forever. Data from Ned Davis Research Inc. shows that the last
nine complete cycles in stocks _ from a peak through a decline and
back up _ have averaged 33 months. Measured by the Dow Jones
industrial average, each peak has been higher than the one before.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, DiGiovanni suggests that retirees base their
allocations on when they will need their money, not on those set
percentages.
</P>
<P>
   It should be relatively easy to figure out how much income you
will need from your investments in the next year. For example, if
you expect to spend $40,000 and you expect to receive $25,000 from
pensions and Social Security, then the remaining $15,000 will have
to come out of your portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   That $15,000 should be tucked into money market investments,
DiGiovanni recommends. You won't make much interest, but you won't
get hurt by stock market or interest rate volatility.
</P>
<P>
   The money you will need in the second and third year from now
should be invested in short- and intermediate-term bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pay better than money markets, but there is not much
volatility due to interest rate changes,'' DiGiovanni said. If you
are really risk-averse, you can put an extra year's needs into
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The third and last allocation is whatever you have left. ``That
can probably be put into fairly conservative stocks,'' he added.
``Let's say the market tanks 25 percent, and it's down for a year
and a half. You don't have to sell a single stock during that bear
market.''
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, you can sell stocks to replenish your money
market and bond investments. If the markets follow the recent
pattern, you can avoid doing that while the market is down.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, you have built a three- or four-year safety net for
your investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know you have assets to take care of you through a
correction and into the next recovery, it's not going to bother you
that much,'' DiGiovanni explained. ``When you realize you don't
have to sell stocks for the next three or four years, then it's
easier to stay in your stocks. You don't have to liquidate anything
when the market is down.''
</P>
<P>
   Other financial advisers agree with DiGiovanni's thesis but
disagree about the details. Some say the safety zone should be
longer, meaning that bond holdings should be enough to cover five
to seven years. That's worth consideration. After the Depression,
it took more than two decades for the markets to regain lost
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest slightly more adventurous stock investments.
``You could buy middle-of-the-road index or growth-and-income
mutual funds,'' said Michael K. Stein, a certified financial
planner in Colorado. Still, his goal is conservative growth.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanni, a long-distance runner, has been a runner for 30
years. His financial explanations tend to reflect that experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I raced, I found I did better if I didn't look at my feet
or at the guy in front of me,'' he said. ``The farther out I
looked, the better I did. It kept me focused on where I wanted to
get, not on where I was now.''

 &HT;    Don't let inflation eat up retirement income
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the scariest thing about investing when you are retired
or getting close?
</P>
<P>
   If you answered ``losing money in the stock market,'' experts
say you're wrong. ``The answer is inflation,'' explained Mark
DiGiovanni, a certified financial planner in Atlanta. ``We lose
sight of that because of relatively mild inflation of recent
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason: People live longer these days, and many retire
younger. Even modest inflation will rapidly reduce buying power as
the years go by.
</P>
<P>
   At age 65, Americans can expect to live another 15 to 19 years,
depending on race and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation will presumably last longer than that. If it averages
4 percent, DiGiovanni pointed out, a dollar's worth of goods will
cost $2.19 in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   That's why financial planners suggest that stocks should be a
part of your portfolio, even in retirement years. Those who stay
with super-safe investments _ including money market funds,
certificates of deposit and bonds _ can expect solid, steady
returns that provide less purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to balance your investments, keeping some readily
available to meet your needs and putting the rest in
growth-oriented investments, such as stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Some would advise putting a set percentage of your money in
money markets, bonds and stocks.
</P>
<P>
   DiGiovanni takes a different approach. He starts with the
presumption that while the stock market is volatile, it never stays
down forever. Data from Ned Davis Research Inc. shows that the last
nine complete cycles in stocks _ from a peak through a decline and
back up _ have averaged 33 months. Measured by the Dow Jones
industrial average, each peak has been higher than the one before.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, DiGiovanni suggests that retirees base their
allocations on when they will need their money, not on those set
percentages.
</P>
<P>
   It should be relatively easy to figure out how much income you
will need from your investments in the next year. For example, if
you expect to spend $40,000 and you expect to receive $25,000 from
pensions and Social Security, then the remaining $15,000 will have
to come out of your portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   That $15,000 should be tucked into money market investments,

get hurt by stock market or interest rate volatility.
</P>
<P>
   The money you will need in the second and third year from now
should be invested in short- and intermediate-term bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pay better than money markets, but there is not much
volatility due to interest rate changes,'' DiGiovanni said. If you
are really risk-averse, you can put an extra year's needs into
bonds.
</P>

 &HT;    Daycare surveillance: Big mother is watching
 &HT;    By Marcus Franklin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Karen Bramwell periodically likes to drop in on
her two young sons at daycare, but those personal visits aren't
always possible with her bustling work schedule.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Proctor &AMP; Gamble logistics manager logs onto the
Internet to see her 3-year-old Robbie and 18-month-old Kyle at Kids
R Kids, a Mason, Ohio childcare center equipped with surveillance
cameras. With a log-in and password provided by the center,
Bramwell and other parents can access the camera's images via the
Internet to see what the little ones are up to. The timed and dated
photos can be updated with the click of a button.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that I can take a glance at my children
throughout the day just to see what's going on,'' Bramwell, 38,
said. ``I can look in and check on them without disrupting them.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance cameras, primarily the domain of airports and other
high-traffic areas, are popping up in daycare centers _ partly in
hopes of curbing potential abuse and neglect, but also for reducing
separation anxiety levels between parents and their kids.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio has a record of at least one licensed child-care center _
Kids R Kids _ with the camera-Internet feature and officials at
another center are seeking a license to open a second facility in
Harrison Twp. with surveillance cameras, said John Allen with the
Ohio Department of Human Services, which regulates child care
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Harrison Twp. facility is a client of Washington-based
WatchMeGrow.com, a company that provides the service for 50
childcare centers throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto
Rico. Richard Suplee, spokesman for the company, said business has
``quadrupled in size and speed over the last year.'' The company,
one of a handful that offers the service, began in November 1996,
he said. Suplee guessed that as many as 200 to 250 centers use the
feature.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts say the feature merely capitalizes on parents'
``guilt and paranoia.'' Others predict that Internet-accessible
cameras will become as popular in daycare centers as cribs and
playpens. National child-care advocates second-guess the
prediction, saying the feature is unlikely to significantly reduce
child abuse in daycare facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the DayMetro Community Family Association, a
not-for-profit Dayton organization, plan to open the
6,200-square-foot DayMetro Childcare Center this month. DayMetro,
which runs a center for 28 toddlers in Trotwood, expects to win its
state license soon. Camera-Internet service at DayMetro will be
provided by Atlanta-based ParentNet.
</P>
<P>
   For an additional $20 a month, parents can use the service and
even e-mail their school-age children at the center, which takes
youngsters up to 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it hasn't opened, the center has already filled half
of its 100 slots _ primarily because parents are drawn to the
camera-Internet feature, claims Yvette Haber, DayMetro's childcare
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a parent,'' Haber said hypothetically. ``I don't to want
to go 10, 12 hours a day without seeing my children. You're worried
sick, especially if you're a new mother. This way, the camera
speaks for the child and eliminates all of the worry.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tomi Emmerick, 32, pays a surprise lunch visit to her son's
current daycare center in Fairborn, the boy thinks it's time to go
home. When Emmerick leaves the facility _ without 2-year-old
Nicholas at her side _ he gets upset and cries, the heartbroken
mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to leave him when he gets like that, but I
have no choice because I have to get back to work,'' said Emmerick,
who plans to enroll Nicholas in DayMetro when it opens. The
surveillance-Internet feature is prompting the change, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be able to watch him from time to time during the day
and he won't be expecting us to take him home. We won't disturb his
day,'' Emmerick said of herself and her firefighter husband,
Ronald. ``Plus I miss him so much during the day and I just want to
see what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Emmericks believe camera surveillance may improve the
quality of Nicholas's care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we don't trust the caregivers, but knowing that
somebody is most likely watching them, they're more likely to pay
attention to how they're dealing with the children,'' Tomi Emmerick
said. ``It's nice that they don't know who's watching them and how
often.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kirkpatrick of Prevent Child Abuse America, a
Chicago-based not-for-profit child advocacy group, said cases of
abuse and neglect are unlikely to plummet because of surveillance
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 80 percent of child abuse is committed by parents or
by parent substitutes such as foster parents,'' he said. ``Parents
are assuming that abuse will be going on within camera range. It's
certainly not a guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Chace of the Alexandria, Va.-based Security Industry
Association suspects that surveillance cameras in childcare centers
will probably ``become the norm over the next 10 years.'' Only an
inevitable court battle will curtail usage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to get a daycare employee who may raise the
question of why they're constantly under surveillance or parents
may sue because of something they thought they saw,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The not-for-profit association represents 350 electronic
security manufacturers and distributors. Chace said the trend ``can
be equated to a knee-jerk reaction to reports of mistreatment at
daycare centers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It satisfies the paranoia and it plays upon parents' guilt and
there's a market for that. Security is a psychological tool.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bramwell and her family relocated to Dayton two months ago,
she didn't seek a childcare center with surveillance cameras even
though her kids' old facility in New Jersey had them. Instead,
Bramwell placed greater emphasis on curriculum, philosophy, and
interaction between students and teachers. It didn't matter that 70
percent to 80 percent of the parents at Kids R Kids use the
service, according to owner and director Doris Moore.
</P>
<P>
   She said while the surveillance does give her confidence that
nothing bad is happening, it's ``just a nice perk'' which allows
her children's New England grandparents to see the children a
couple of times a week via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like getting snapshot photos every day in the mail,''
Bramwell said. ``It's an extra bonus it wasn't a deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that it comes down to the care. If I can't
feel comfortable when I'm not watching them, then I've got a
problem.''

   Y2K: Jittery Atlantans stockpiling food and cash
</P>
<P>
   By Bill Hendrick
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More than half of metro Atlantans are concerned that
computers might stall at midnight Dec. 31, and nearly one-third are
planning to put aside some cash just in case, according to a new
poll by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Take Lynn Winn, 36. The Coweta County schoolteacher plans to
draw a little extra cash out of the bank, and she plans to have
plenty of baby formula on hand for her infant son, Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she's not so concerned that she would avoid
being on an airplane while the zeroes are rolling over, in part
because her husband, Mike, 44, is a Delta Air Lines pilot, and he's
not concerned about flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere in Delta you see little stickers saying, `Y2K
safe,' '' he says. ``So if I'm flying, I won't be worried. We're
prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody the Winns know is taking such a moderate view. ``I
have friends who are panicking and all but making bomb shelters,''
Lynn Winn laughs. ``I'm concerned, but not that much.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that, of the 95 percent of metro Atlantans who've
heard about the Y2K bug, 41 percent are ``somewhat concerned'' that
it will affect them, while 12 percent are ``very concerned.''
Thirty-one percent are jittery enough that they're planning to set
aside cash.
</P>
<P>
   The problem relates to computer systems that recognize only the
last two digits of a year, and thus could read the numbers ``00''
as 1900 rather than 2000. And, many people fear, that could cause
computer systems to break down, disrupting basic services such as
electricity, water, sewerage and even gasoline supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Announcements seem to come out daily from government agencies,
banks and other companies that they have the glitch under control.
But, poll respondent Darryl Gillette asks, if so many people are so
sure there won't be many people are so sure there won't be
problems, why are the agencies and firms trying so hard to balm
fears?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Armageddon's coming, but I do see some
problems,'' says Gillette, a 25-year-old computer scientist.
``There could be lots of computer crime. You could see your bank
account emptied by hackers. The stock market could take a hit. It
is a very serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He contends that confused computers will be easier for crooks to
crack. ``I plan to take out as much money as I can out of my
account until maybe mid-January. A lot of companies started working
on this a couple of years late, and now they're just crossing their
fingers. But the computer security issue could wreak havoc. It's a
legitimate fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that people under 30 are more worried than their
elders, women are more concerned than men and African-Americans are
more nervous than whites.
</P>
<P>
   It also found that folks with a college education are
significantly more likely than those with high school diplomas or
less to be withdrawing extra cash before Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   When the poll was taken, in April and May, 18 percent of metro
Atlantans said they were setting aside food, water or other
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Eversole, 45, the owner of a construction company, says
she's not one to panic, but that she plans to take no chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be the end of the world,'' she
continues, ``but I have a couple of generators. If I see salmon on
sale, I'll buy 15 cans at a time, and meat you don't have to keep
in the refrigerator in case power goes out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Lamar, 49, says she's worried about how a computer glitch
might affect Wall Street, so she's selling some stocks to put in
money market funds, and plans to keep a little more cash at home
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``October's always a bad month for the market, and this could
make it worse,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work for Fannie Mae, and I know a lot of mortgage companies
are not prepared. I'm afraid there'll be problems notifying
customers, posting mortgage payments.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamar is also leery of air travel. ``I fly all the time, but I
won't be flying in late December.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she's stockpiling flashlights, candles, batteries and
some food.
</P>
<P>
   Several national polls have revealed similar skittishness about
what could happen on or after New Year's Eve. A recent Associated
Press poll found that nearly a third of Americans plan to stock up
on supplies, and 25 percent will take extra money out of the bank.
The AP poll of 1,008 adults found that 11 percent expected major
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Journal-Constitution's poll, it found that women were
more worried than men, and that younger people were more concerned
than older ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Bank is preparing for the chance that many
Americans will take cash out of banks. It's ordered $50 billion of
new currency put into circulation to handle any runs on banks or
ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the state Emergency Management Agency is urging
people to prepare for possible disruptions, and will participate in
a Y2K drill for law-enforcement and relief agencies. ``It's going
to be strange,'' says Gerald Celente, a New York social scientist
and author of ``Trends 2000.'' ``You've got the exhilaration of
welcoming in the year 2000, but equally, you've got in your brain,
'What the hell's going to happen? Will life on Earth be the same
tomorrow?' ``
</P>
<P>
   It's all but certain, he predicts, that this conundrum will make
more people party in familiar digs, which means Y2K celebrations
may well produce a baby boomlet nine months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be safe, a lot of people will ring in the new millennium
with a bang,'' he says. ``And I don't mean fireworks.''

   GRAULICH-COLUMN _ James M. Beary Jr., my mother's father, had
died in March at 86. Years before, after retiring from the U.S.
Secret Service, he took on a last assignment for extra pension:
guarding President Kennedy during Sunday Mass. I imagined my
grandfather slowly scanning the church, glimpsing John-John in the
pews. Maybe he had thought to himself, ``Fine boy, no trouble.'' My
grandfather loved the water, like John Jr. And he, too, was now
with his bride in the same warm sea where her ashes had been
scattered 10 years earlier. (Graulich, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 &HT;    The Bengal with heart
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Ky. _ Bengals left cornerback Corey Sawyer has the
coolest nickname on the team _ ``C-saw.''
</P>
<P>
   But you know what makes him hot? When people look at his
``measurables'' and either snicker, laugh or shake their heads and
walk away.
</P>
<P>
   The six-year veteran from Florida State admits he's not the
tallest, fastest or strongest cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have a heart,'' he said. ``I love the game. I have a
desire to play football. And that's what takes me to the next
level, because I love to compete and make plays. I think that's
what makes me a different player than the rest of the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer led the Bengals with four interceptions in 1997 and
seemed to be on his way to a huge 1998 when his 58-yard
interception return for a touchdown beat Detroit, 34-28, in
overtime on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   But he suffered torn left knee cartilage a week later while
making a tackle against Green Bay and the defense struggled on the
way to a 3-13 record.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sawyer's back, looking for something he doesn't get much of
_ respect.
</P>
<P>
   While courting free agents Ken Irvin, Cris Dishman, Ashley
Ambrose and Ryan McNeil _ none of whom signed with Cincinnati _ the
Bengals re-signed Sawyer (3 years, $1.7 million) as an insurance
policy after drafting West Virginia cornerback Charles Fisher in
the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer is listed No. 1 on the depth chart, but how long will
that last?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going into (the season) with any preconceived
notions,'' head coach Bruce Coslet said. ``If he's one of the two
best corners, he'll start.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer has 12 starts in 60 career games, so just like his
nickname, he's used to the up-and-down ride on the seesaw. If he
hears footsteps, he ignores them.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those corners they wanted to bring in to replace me, none
of them are here (except Fisher),'' Sawyer said. ``I've been here
six years, and I've been fighting in and out of the lineup.
Fighting is no problem for me because I love to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are saying: 'Just let Corey go out there and
do his thing.' Until that happens, no one will know how good I will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   All good NFL cornerbacks have short memories. When they get
beat, they forget about it and fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play this game as a game,'' Sawyer said. ``Once I get beat,
I feel I have to make up that score. I've got to intercept a ball,
cause a fumble or knock down a pass. Until I do, I won't be
satisfied. I just feel that's the way I need to be to compete in
this league. It's a competitive match and I have to owe 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about respect _ and I'm going to get that. One way or
another, Corey Sawyer's going to get some respect around here.''

 &HT;    For McNeil, choice of Browns makes perfect sense
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEREA, Ohio _ Ryan McNeil had a two-word answer to the question
about why he chose the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' the highly regarded cornerback asked after taking
the practice field for the first time Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But surely a player in the prime of his career, one who led the
NFL with nine interceptions for the St. Louis Rams two seasons ago,
could have found a greener pasture. Unless he knows something the
prognosticators don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a short list of teams I wanted to play for and this was
one of them,'' said McNeil, who signed a one-year deal as a free
agent over the weekend. ``You always want to go where you feel
comfortable. I've been on losing teams the last few years and
that's something I was trying to shy away from.''
</P>
<P>
   The last three years, McNeil has played on teams that went 4-12,
5-11 and 5-11. So he comes to an expansion team? A team thought
capable by most so-called experts of winning somewhere between four
and seven games at the most?
</P>
<P>
   This is a smart career move?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's technically not an expansion team,'' he said. ``It's
really not, especially on the defensive side of the ball. We've got
a great defense. That's what I'm excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   Where McNeil, once a high second-round draft choice of the
Detroit Lions, fits into the overall scheme of the defense isn't
clear. It's hard to believe he won't be starting at right
cornerback eventually, even though the Browns say they are pleased
with Antonio Langham's work at that spot through the first 10 days
of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good looking athlete,'' head coach Chris Palmer said of
the 6-foot-2, 192-pound newcomer. ``He's tall and he's got range.
It'll be interesting. We'll rotate him around.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer did not rule out a scenario in which Corey Fuller, his
other starting corner, could be shifted to safety. It was Fuller,
in fact, who suggested the switch to Palmer, and it was hard to
tell which pleased the coach more _ McNeil's fluidity on the field
or Fuller's unselfishness off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corey has the physical attributes (for safety) and he's
tough,'' Palmer said. ``He's just a guy who wants to win. He's a
'football player,' and those are the kind of guys you want around.
You don't want guys who are going to go around sulking and
wondering how all of this is going to affect them.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Langham has agreed not to fall into that latter
category, even if his role suddenly starts to shrink.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's said all the right things,'' Palmer assured.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McNeil has a lot of catching up ahead of him. For one
thing, he needs a new number. Assigned No. 18, he looked like a
quarterback. Then there's adjusting to defensive coordinator Bob
Slowik's various schemes, but McNeil says that shouldn't be a
problem because he's had five defensive coordinators in the last
six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll probably take me about a week to get into the flow,'' he
said. ``I'm in a situation where guys have a head start and my main
focus is to learn as much as I can. There's nothing I haven't seen
before. It's just a matter of picking up the terminology.''
</P>
<P>
   This is McNeil's third one-year contract in as many seasons.
After his big year in 1997, the Rams blocked his ability to switch
teams by designating him as their ``franchise player.'' He earned
$3.2 million, but he missed the preseason, didn't start until the
fifth game and his interception total fell to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you throw my way?'' McNeil wondered. ``That's pretty
much what happened.''

   PEIJING _ Some say bonsai, some say peijing. Peijing is the
Chinese counterpart to bonsai. It is new to many, but it actually
predates bonsai, and an Athens, Ga. couple are taking the lead in
the horticultural trend of growing peijing, which translates to
``landscape in a pot.'' (May, Atlanta Journal-Constitution.)

 &HT;    Unplug computer, but stay in touch while on vacation
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year, when you go on vacation, make sure your computer has
a good time, too.
</P>
<P>
   I'll let you worry about boarding the dog and the cat, leaving a
light on to discourage burglars and making sure that someone picks
up the mail and newspapers. But maybe I can help with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's talk about the most important computer-related
chore. Make sure you unplug that sucker. This is the time of the
year when there are violent thunderstorms. Even though your
computer is turned off and plugged into a surge protector (you'll
notice they call those gadgets ``surge protectors,'' not
``lightning protectors''), it can be turned into a crispy critter
by a close lightning strike on a power or phone line. So unplug
both the phone and the electrical lines to it.
</P>
<P>
   Some people will think this is overkill. And the odds are
against a lightning strike. But it does happen. A lightning strike
at my brother's house was so severe that his clock radio literally
exploded, embedding pieces of plastic in the sheetrock of his
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Next, if e-mail is important to you, and if you plan to travel
with a laptop or to a place where you'll have access to computers,
make sure you know the local access numbers for your Internet
provider. Or, if it doesn't have local access numbers where you are
traveling, check out one of the Web-based free e-mail services.
Outfits such as Hot Mail and Yahoo! offer a way to get your mail
from anywhere you can reach the Web, so no local access numbers are
needed.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of my friends use an auto-responder while they are away.
That's a ``canned'' message automatically sent to people who e-mail
you while you are away. The message explains that you are on
vacation and will respond when you return. Some Internet providers,
including MindSpring, offer this service. (Various e-mail programs
have this ability, too, but to use it with your e-mail program,
unless you get all your mail at work, you'd have to leave your
computer turned on while you are gone. That's a terrible idea.)
</P>
<P>
   Personally I think that using an auto-responder is a bad idea
anyway. Telling everyone who e-mails you that you are away from
home for an extended period is like hanging a banner on your front
door saying ``Attention, burglars _ the house is vacant.''
</P>
<P>
   It's far better to e-mail or tell the people you know that
you'll be away, or to simply log on remotely and get your e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   There's a less-obvious thing for some of us _ mostly people who
have been around the Internet for a long time _ to remember. It's
very much akin to remembering to stop delivery of your newspaper. I
belong to various mailing lists, special interest groups that send
me e-mail on topics of personal interest several times a day. I
usually send a message asking to be taken off the mailing list
before going on vacation. What with the incredible amount of junk
mail that we all get, the added e-mails make coming home and
logging onto my e-mail for the first time after a week away into an
unpleasant prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't belong to a mailing list, you may want to send
notes to any friends you correspond with regularly and ask them to
hold off on e-mail until your return. Since so many people send
e-mail attachments these days _ including photos _ you could easily
spend an hour downloading everything the first time you log on
after vacation.
</P>
<P>
   OK, have a good time on your vacation. I promise not to write to
you while you are gone.

TEXAN RIDES HORSE ON 109TH BIRTHDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Levi Brawley has cowboyed all over Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But at his age he doesn't swing up into the saddle with the
greatest of ease. In fact, the folks at the Mason Care Center in
the Texas Hill Country had to give him a leg up last week when he
celebrated his 109th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the center say they have checked state records and
they believe Brawley is the oldest living Texan. Certainly he's the
oldest to be riding around on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   ``For his age, he's pretty active,'' said Karen Van Cleave, the
care center activity director. ``He does really great.''
</P>
<P>
   Brawley talked about his birthday for weeks, workers at the care
center said. He bragged about it to anyone who would listen. He
went over it frequently with his nephew who also lives at the
center.
</P>
<P>
   He liked telling everyone he was about to be 109. Now, center
workers say, he has already started informing those around him that
next July 24, he'll be 110.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't exactly asked for another horseback ride, not
officially anyway, but it's not out of the question. ``Oh, yeah,''
he said in a telephone interview. ``I would like to do it again. I
hope I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Brawley, who is known around the care center as ``Uncle Levi,''
spends much of his time in a wheelchair these days and he had to go
through a few exercises to strengthen his legs before he could ride
a horse last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just so cute about it,'' Van Cleave said. ``When we
would see him around the center, we would tell him, `Levi, you have
to do those exercises if you want to ride that horse,' and he would
start lifting his legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Brawley said the exercises weren't all that tough. It has only
been a couple of years since he last rode, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The birthday ride wasn't exactly down a dusty trail or across a
wide vista. Former Mason County Judge Tommy Reardon brought an aged
and experienced horse to the center for Brawley to climb onto.
</P>
<P>
   Once aboard, Brawley turned his steed and they just did a few
steps around in front of the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very short,'' Van Cleave said. ``Actually it was just
in front of the building. We couldn't keep him on there too
terribly long.''
</P>
<P>
   The ride didn't last long, but Brawley was spiffed up
nonetheless. The Tony Lama company presented him with a pair of
boots, and the Commercial Bank in Mason gave him a set of spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a wonderful birthday,'' Brawley said.
</P>
<P>
   The birthday party was well attended. Not everyone signed the
guest book, but workers counted more than 500 plates of goodies
walking off.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters from local newspapers and TV stations covered the
event, but met with a rather reticent Brawley. He didn't understand
what all the fuss was about, Van Cleave said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were able to elicit a few sentiments from Brawley,
though. When asked about the secret of his longevity, he answered:
``I've lived a good life all my life. I respect women. And I never
did worry about nothin'. If there's any worrying to be done, I let
the other fellow do it.''

PATIENT PRONUNCIATION IS SOUTHERNERS' WAY TO BEAT HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Y'all, it's hot.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever said it's hard to melt brown sugar was wrong because I'm
going to be a sweet, sticky puddle any second now.
</P>
<P>
   Truly, we are having a sun storm in Texas. Huge, hot sunbeams
are falling from the sky like cats and dogs. Of course, given a
choice between the two, sunshine or animals, I'd rather have
sunshine because I don't think sunscreen and a hat would make much
difference if a bulldog fell on my head. Let's hope that doesn't
happen. And I'm allergic to cats. I like them, but they make me
sneeze no matter what the weather is like.
</P>
<P>
   So what was I talking about? Yes, the heat. Did I say it's hot
outside? What happened to the ozone? Can't we make some more? Let's
put a little less money into bombs and bullets that penetrate armor
and divert some of it to studying this weather situation more
intensely.
</P>
<P>
   To the other extreme, however, it's just as bad in the Midwest,
where I lived for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Every winter, as I complained incessantly about the bitter cold,
my friends would tease me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I much prefer cold weather to that terrible heat down
South,'' they would say. ``What do you guys do when it's 100
degrees outside?''
</P>
<P>
   I'd pause a moment and look contemplative before replying,
``Well, we just take our shoes off and run up and down the sidewalk
chanting, `I'm not hot. I'm not hot.'''
</P>
<P>
   That always left 'em slack-jawed.
</P>
<P>
   My husband says they didn't respond because they actually
believed me. I think it was because of the drawl. Midwesterners are
exceptionally polite. To them, we spoke so slowly that they had to
wait two or three minutes before responding just to make sure that
we had finished speaking. We might just be thinking about our next
sentence or paying homage to a comma. I'm not making fun of us. I
love my Southern roots.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I am making fun of us, but in the nicest way. It's the heat
that makes us talk like English is our second language. If we
started speaking faster, it would take a lot of energy and our
heart rates would increase. Our central nervous systems would be
stimulated. Our metabolism would soar. Heck, we'd have a stroke
right there on the sidewalk in our bare feet. How would that look
to the rest of the world?
</P>
<P>
   Our speech patterns are simply an adaptation to our environment.
Monkeys can grasp things with their feet. Giraffes have those long
necks to help them reach the leaves high up on the trees. And
Southerners speak slowly primarily for the purpose of driving folks
from other parts of the country batty.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason we drag our vowels across our tongues like a
mule plowing a field of rocks is because _ read this slowly now _
y'all, it's just too hot to rush.

   &UR; To bolster your coverage of the hunt for Osama bin Laden and
the one-year anniversary of the Aug. 7, 1998 bombing of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa, The New York Times Syndicate is offering
six excerpts, described in detail below, from the book, ``Unholy
Wars,'' by John K. Cooley. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -- A veteran foreign correspondent for ABC-TV News, Cooley has
written widely on the Middle East and North Africa. In 1996 he won
the George Polk Memorial Award for more than 40 years of global
coverage. He is the author of five other books on the Middle East,
including ``Payback: America's Long War in the Middle East'' and
``Libyan Sandstorm: Qaddafi's Revolution.'' --
</P>
<P>
   -- The following excerpts will be released on the wire Tues.,
Aug. 3, in category codes ``k'' for commentary and ``a'' for
general news. --
</P>
<P>
   PART I: ``Osama bin Laden: The Early Years'' -- This Saudi exile
charged in the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa last year tops
the FBI's ``10 Most Wanted'' list, with a $5 million reward for his
capture. The first excerpt describes how his father, an industrious
immigrant, built a fortune from scratch, and how, as a university
student, young Osama bonded with Prince Turki bin Faisal al-Saud.
It tells how the bin Laden company's bulldozers and other equipment
cut roads, storage depots, bunkers and base camps in Afghanistan
which, on Aug. 20, 1998, would be the targets of retaliatory
strikes by U.S. cruise missiles. (slugged: BC-OSAMA-WEALTH-ONE)
</P>
<P>
   PART II: ``Terrorists from Freedom Fighters: Recruiting for the
Holy War'' -- Only after the U.S. Embassy bombings on Aug. 7, 1998
did disturbing facts begin to trickle out about how Osama bin Laden
and his corporate empire provided a bankroll for the recruitment
and training of volunteers in the ``holy war'' against the former
Soviet Union, from 1979-89. Those zealous volunteers would soon
provide a pool of talent _ men whose skills would be turned to
unholy wars of global terror. (slugged: BC-OSAMA-TALENT-TWO)
</P>
<P>
   PART III: ``Deadly Skills: the Training to be A Holy Warrior''
-- This excerpt details the sort of top-notch training and military
discipline which turned bands of novices and rogues into an
adversary strong enough to defeat the Red Army. The CIA-managed
training was conducted by U.S. military special-ops forces and
Pakistan's powerful intelligence service. (slugged:
BC-OSAMA-JIHAD-THREE)
</P>
<P>
   PART IV: ``Bin Laden and the Worldwide Jihad'' -- In August
1990, when Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait, Osama bin
Laden was shocked to learn that King Fahd of Saudi Arabia had
invited U.S. troops to defend the kingdom. To him, this was
treason. After the Persian Gulf War, when the Americans did not all
withdraw, bin Laden revolted against the royal family. He moved to
Sudan, increased his personal fortune and expanded his support for
the world's most dangerous terrorist organizations.
(BC-OSAMA-TERRORISM-FOUR)
</P>
<P>
   PART V: ``The Jihad Comes to America'' -- On the morning of Aug.
7, 1998, the jihad against America would become real. Truck bombs
devastated the area around the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The bombs killed 224 people and injured
more than 4,500, in attacks that were perceived almost instantly to
bear Osama bin Laden's signature. This excerpt details and updates
information on the capture and fate of the bombers as well as the
aftermath of the controversial U.S. cruise-missile retaliatory
strikes. (slugged: BC-OSAMA-EMBASSIES-FIVE)
</P>
<P>
   PART VI: ``They Unsheathed Their Knives ... and Were Pointing
Them At Our Backs'' -- Some experts call it ``blowback'' _ the
aftermath of U.S. involvement in the Afghan war. It consists of a
global drug trade; of U.S. weapons openly sold in Pakistani
bazaars; and of highly trained, highly motivated men, who turned
against their former benefactors and vowed to eradicate the ``Great
Satan'': all traces of secular Westernized culture. The
all-too-tragic results have been seen at recent sites of terror _
among them, Khobar Towers, the World Trade Center, CIA headquarters
in Langley, Va., and the U.S. Embassies in East Africa. (slugged:

   &UR; By JOHN K. COOLEY &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Adapted from ``Unholy Wars: Afghanistan, America and International
Terrorism,'' by John K. Cooley. Reprinted by permission from Pluto
Press, London. c.1999 by John K. Cooley. &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, after months of tortuous negotiations, an American
TV news team managed to establish contact and to interview Osama
bin Laden _ in a mountain hideaway in Afghanistan, guarded by the
Taliban. He was considered by the U.S. government and many allies
to be the most dangerous international terrorist at large.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, bin Laden called for the murder of
Americans and Jews, wherever they might be, castigating Americans
as ``the biggest thieves in the world and the (worst) terrorists.''
He praised, and sometimes implied personal responsibility for, the
World Trade Center bombing in New York in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed a desire to drive Western, especially American,
influence and interests from the Arab and Muslim worlds. He vowed
to drive the Saudi royal family from power and destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the name Osama bin Laden was unfamiliar to many in
the West. News reports sparsely recounted how he built his vast
fortune as a Saudi Arabian citizen and became a leader and
financier of a complex global terrorist network that grew out of
the bloody Afghan ``jihad,'' or holy war.
</P>
<P>
   The truth about how bin Laden achieved his wealth and what his
activities actually have been over the years is still largely
untold.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Laden, had a
rags-to-riches story: He founded a formidable construction dynasty
after emigrating in the mid-1940s to Saudi Arabia from Yemen as a
very young man. Poor but industrious, he got a job as a bricklayer
for Aramco, the Arabian-American Oil Co., and earned one Saudi
riyal _ the equivalent of about 20 U.S. cents _ per day.
</P>
<P>
   Like other immigrants from his region, the Yemeni coastal
province of Hadhramaut, east of the big seaport of Aden, bin Laden
deposited his riyals in a tin box and spent frugally on himself.
</P>
<P>
   In past centuries, the trading ships of the Hadrami Arabs had
voyaged out to Indonesia and China, bringing back spices, incense,
myrrh and frankincense from the Far East and the Indian
subcontinent. That was generations before the merchants of England
and Salem, Mass., made their fortunes in the China trade of the
19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Even before independence, when Britain gave up its colonial grip
on Aden and South Arabia in 1967, Hadrami merchants, clerks and
moneychangers had migrated north to seek their fortunes in Saudi
Arabia. These fortunes _ earned by dint of hard work and good luck
combined _ built or contributed to Saudi business and banking
dynasties. Today some of them also finance radical Islamic causes
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Once the elder bin Laden had saved enough to go into business
for himself, he founded a construction firm and started modestly
with small jobs. By the early 1950s he had moved into building
palaces for the House of Saud in Riyadh. Eventually, bin Laden won
the highly lucrative contract for a Medina-to-Jeddah highway in the
holy province of Hejaz, after a foreign contractor had withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the bin Laden name was legendary in Arab construction _
especially in the Saudi kingdom and in Jordan _ for every sort of
major road, airport and other infrastructure project. The firm
attracted engineering talent from all over the world and amassed a
huge fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Mohammed, as he came to be called, developed a reputation
for piety as well as wealth, jetting from one Arab construction
site to another. He once had the unique experience of saying, in
one day, morning prayers in East Jerusalem (before Israel's 1967
conquest of the holy city), noon prayers in Medina and evening
prayers in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, his reputation for piety rubbed off on the firm. By
1966, when his aircraft crashed and he was killed, bin Laden had
developed a conglomerate of companies and was the biggest private
contractor of this type in the world, owning 90 of the largest
Caterpillar excavators then in existence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its religious credentials _ useful later when it would
become a financier of the Afghan jihad _ the firm was short on
management knowhow. For a time, Saudi King Faisal appointed the
owner of a smaller construction company to watch over the financial
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the Islamic tradition of polygamy, bin Laden
fathered no fewer than 52 children with various wives. One of his
sons, Osama, had already attracted the attention of the Saudi royal
family.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, at age 23, Osama bin Laden was finishing studies in
economics and marketing at Jeddah University. He already had a
close friendship with Prince Turki bin Faisal al-Saud, who shared
his fervent ideas about the decline and decadence of Islam and
Islamic political dynamism.
</P>
<P>
   Osama appreciated Prince Turki's honesty and antipathy to
corruption _ qualities he believed were not always found in the
Arab world's royalty or rulers. And, for his part, the prince seems
to have regarded Osama as an ernest young man who burned with a
pure, hard flame of devotion to religious principles.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, Osama bin Laden was running much of the elite
construction business that his father had built from scratch. Under
his guidance, the company expanded its reputation for professional
excellence and a ``can-do'' spirit in major projects. His
inheritance from the family fortune was soon augmented by the huge
business earnings.
</P>
<P>
   It was a politically tumultuous time. In neighboring
Afghanistan, a fierce 1978 revolution had resulted in a Marxist
government and brought a sizeable amount of Soviet aid. But
non-stop in-fighting among the parties and protest demonstrations
among the devout Muslim citizenry were followed by a Soviet
invasion. This was an outrage to bin Laden, who seized the
opportunity to join forces against the ``godless'' Red Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was enraged and went there at once,'' he said in a 1993
interview with Robert Fisk of the London Independent, one of the
first journalists to spot bin Laden as a key mover in the Afghan
holy war and, perhaps more significantly, in the larger jihad
against America that would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Turki sent bin Laden to Peshawar, Pakistan, to scout out
the possibilities of raising an Arab volunteer army. Soon bin Laden
set up a base for the Afghan warriors, within easy reach of
Pakistan's powerful intelligence and security service, the
Interservices Intelligence Directorate _ known as ISI _ but
apparently not supervised by them.
</P>
<P>
   As the war rolled on, bin Laden was organizer, financier,
fighter and Islamic role model. He eagerly imported bulldozers and
other heavy equipment to cut new roads and tunnels. Operating out
of Karachi, Pakistan and Afghanistan, he agreed to build bases and
training camps, as well as landing strips for the private jets of
warlords and Muslim and Arab dignitaries. He built deeply buried
bunkers and tunnels in the mountains for command posts and
telecommunications centers to secure the communications against the
radio traffic analysts and codebreakers of the Red Army.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, bin Laden quickly became acquainted with Abdullah
Azzam, a charismatic Palestinian leader, who had made a name for
himself with fiery sermons in Zarqa, Jordan, addressed to
Palestinians fleeing the Jordanian army's crackdown in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Azzam, later a founder of the Hamas Islamic resistance movement
in Gaza and the West Bank, had rejected the authority of Yassir
Arafat's mainstream Palestine Liberation Organization and other
smaller groups as too Marxist and not Islamic enough. He believed
they depended too much on the Soviet ``Great Satan,'' the usurper
of Muslim Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In liaison with the generals running Pakistan's ISI, Azzam
outlined his need for weapons, transportation and incomes. Bin
Laden promised to be generous with financing and began fundraising
and organizational journeys throughout the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the bin Laden financial and construction empire
strengthened its ties with the Saudi royal family, winning a $3
billion ``contract of the century'': the full restoration and
reconstruction of the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
</P>
<P>
   Also proving to be a brave foot soldier, bin Laden suffered a
shoulder wound in combat near Jalalabad. Under the approving eye of
Pakistan's ISI officers, he cultivated and guarded his good
relations with the two main ethnic Afghan warlords: Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar and Ahmad Shah Massoud.
</P>
<P>
   Even more crucial for his later global enterprise in private
terrorism, bin Laden used as a regional power base in Pakistan the
Binoori mosque in Karachi's Newton district. The prayer leader
there was a certain Mullah Mohammed Omar, then an unknown young
cleric, but by 1998 the leader of the Taliban and the most powerful
man in Afghanistan.

</P>
<P>
   It could be called a strange love affair that went disastrously
wrong: the alliance, during the Afghan war, between the United
States and some of the most fanatical followers of radical Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Four a quarter century after the onset of the Cold War in 1946,
the Soviet Union was perceived to be the principal threat to
American interests in the Middle East, as elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, decided by a tiny
coterie in the Leonid Brezhnev-era politburo, jolted President
Jimmy Carter in the White House and his foreign-policy team. They
perceived the foolhardy invasion not only as a major international
threat, but also as a rare opportunity to undermine the already
tottering Soviet empire lying north of Afghanistan, in Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In cooperation with Pakistan's Interservices Intelligence
Directorate (ISI), Saudi financing and Pakistani logistical
support, the CIA managed the program to send into battle a
mercenary army of Islamic volunteers. The tacit consensus was that
the Muslim religion, fundamentally anti-Communist, if translated
into politics, could be harnessed as a mighty force to oppose
Moscow in the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   This impetus to support the anti-Soviet ``jihad,'' or holy war,
was amplified by President Ronald Reagan's men _ especially his
director of Central Intelligence, William Casey. By 1981, when new
sources of secret financing were needed for the Afghan campaign,
the bin Laden enterprises were on a short list of possible donors.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Sultan bin Abdul Azziz, the powerful Saudi defense and
aviation minister, told a high-level American business and
investors' delegation that the bin Laden firms had done great
things for the kingdom. To both Saudi intelligence and the CIA,
Osama bin Laden, through his personal reputation as an astute
businessman and a pious Muslim, seemed an ideal figure to play a
leading role.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden would pay, with his own and company funds, for the
recruitment, transportation and training of the volunteers who
flocked in, first to Peshawar, Pakistan, and then to Afghanistan,
from the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, parts of Europe and
America. He collected enough millions from his family and corporate
holdings and from donations by rich Arab Persian Gulf merchant
families, to organize Al Qaeda, the Islamic Salvation Foundation,
to support the jihad.
</P>
<P>
   He established a network of Al Qaeda centers in Saudi Arabia,
Egypt and Pakistan, through which he recruited, enlisted and
sheltered thousands of Arab volunteers. It is this large fraternity
of Al Qaeda alumni which is still internationally active _ not as
freedom fighters, but as terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those bin Laden recruited turned out to be zealous
Muslims like himself, and brave soldiers. Some, however, were
criminals, who emerged from places such as Algerian or Tunisian
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Girardet, one of the most perceptive journalists covering
the war, estimated in summer 1983 that already there were between
80,000 and 150,000 full-time guerrilla fighters. Their pay had to
compete with what some had earned, or might earn, in more peaceful
civilian callings. The figures for ``regulars'' did not include
hundreds of thousands of Afghan and Pakistani civilians who
functioned as part-time fighters.
</P>
<P>
   After several long visits to different fronts, Girardet
determined that the resistance movement was operating, with varying
efficiency, in as many as 300 different regions throughout
Afghanistan's 28 provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA, through an ISI-managed logistical framework, tried to
supply and pay the guerrillas; in practice, pay and equipment in
the field often had to come directly from outside donors such as
bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   During the peak period for foreign volunteers _ which spawned
bin Laden's Al Qaeda and various lesser foreign terrorist networks
_ up to 5,000 non-Afghan fighters streamed into the Peshawar area.
Easily 10 times that number would train or fight; others rested,
trafficked in drugs and arms or led the good life in Peshawar.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them, as an Egyptian newsman who visited his compatriots
remarked, were drawn by the adventure and religious prestige,
involving a kind of emotional ``high, attached to feeling part of
the jihad.'' Some were university undergraduates or, like the
Taliban who appeared in 1993, students of Islamic colleges, known
as ``madrassas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the young men, from poorer Arab countries such as Yemen
or Sudan, had been working in the wealthy Persian Gulf oil emirates
and were ripe for recruitment there. They had grown tired of being
reduced, with their non-Arab, Asian colleagues, to proletarian
status. Others were self-financed or backed _ a notable example was
Egypt's cleric, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman _ by tight-knit communities
of followers.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who took up arms, the ideological core group were
believers who were politically, as well as emotionally or
materially, engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike training, recruiting for the jihad in the United States
was not handled directly by the CIA, despite its overall management
role. Various local cover groups, often legitimate Muslim charities
and mosque communities in cities such as New York, Detroit, Los
Angeles and other large centers of Arab-American population,
shielded the agency.
</P>
<P>
   If directly run by the men from Langley, Va., such activities _
as well as the weapons training in America _ would have been a
flagrant violation of the CIA's charter.
</P>
<P>
   The sites for induction and initial indoctrination of the future
holy warriors were modest and humdrum. One was in New York's Arab
district, in Brooklyn, on Atlantic Avenue. Another was a private
rifle club in affluent Naugutuck, Conn. There were similar
locations within the large Arab immigrant and Arab-American
districts in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area, Detroit and
Dearborn, Mich.,
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, the Alkifah Refugee Center was also known to the
Arabs, Arab-Americans and Muslim travelers from abroad who met and
worked there as the ``Al-Jihad'' center. This was because both
recruiting and fund-raising for the Afghanistan jihad went on
there.
</P>
<P>
   The funding came from charitable donations for Afghan refugee
relief in the United States. Most probably, there were also
hard-to-trace monies from the World Muslim League and other
missionary and charitable organizations located in Pakistan, such
as the Tablighi Jamaat, a vast international Islamic missionary
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Among the key figures in the Brooklyn operation was bin Laden's
old friend, Abdullah Azzam, a fiery speaker and founder of Hamas.
In the early and mid-'80s, he toured the United States recruiting
for Afghanistan. But he was probably also raising funds for Hamas
and its post-1987 Palestinian revolt against Israel in the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
   Azzam was killed by a still-mysterious car bomb in Pakistan in
1987 _ it greatly upset bin Laden. Suspects included Israel's
Mossad intelligence agency; the Soviet KGB or its Afghan adjunct,
the Communist Afghan KHAD; the Pakistani ISI; and even the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The blind Egyptian prayer leader, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, also
had been a recruiter, sending his sons to fight in Afghanistan.
Later, with other suspects, he was convicted in the 1993 World
Trade Center bombing and an aborted conspiracy to bomb the United
Nations headquarters, along New York's East River, as well as
traffic tunnels, bridges, FBI headquarters and government offices.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman and the others frequented the Atlantic Avenue
headquarters and often prayed in nearby mosques. An investigation
on ABC's July 12, 1993, ``Day One'' magazine program aired details
of Azzam's recruiting activities in no fewer than 26 American
states.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Brooklyn jihad workers, including El Sayyid Nosair _
he later was convicted of the 1990 murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the
Jewish Defense League leader _ trained as gunmen at a shooting
range in Naugutuck, just west of the highway from Bridgeport to
Waterbury.
</P>
<P>
   Recruits for Afghanistan, according to later New York court
documents, also trained in rifle shooting there. Nosair's course on
the AK-47 assault rifle _ the standard, Soviet-made weapon used by
the mujahedeen _ was held as late as the summer of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Afghan war was nearly over, but as Pakistan's
former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto remarked on the ``Day One''
broadcast, the dispersal of the fighters had begun toward new
target countries. ``They are all over the world,'' she said.

</P>
<P>
   As John Collins, senior American military analyst at the
Congressional Research Services, noted in 1987, it takes little
expertise to pour epoxy on movable machinery or sugar into gas
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Quite another matter, however, is strategic sabotage, which
requires activists and organizers who can mobilize people and
coordinate their actions in demonstrations, strikes, riots,
boycotts, production delays and in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   The zealous young men of the Afghan ``jihad'' would develop an
expertise in sabotage and various martial and murderous skills _
methods that were used successfully in Afghanistan, and also after
1989 in violent actions against their own Third World governments
and in anti-Western terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, as seen from CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., the
program to ``train the trainers'' of the holy warriors followed the
principle of elevating combat into an expression of religious
fervor.
</P>
<P>
   In a pyramidal training scheme, the CIA was the overall manager;
U.S. special-ops forces and a coalition of assorted allied
specialists were the main instructors. Pakistani officers were the
students who would experience tough courses in endurance, weapons
use, sabotage, killing techniques, battle communications and other
skills. Later, in the schools and camps of Pakistan and
Afghanistan, they would impart these skills to the scores of
thousands of fighters _ the mujahedeen _ and send them into battle.
Often, though not always, the same kind of process applied to the
use and distribution of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Selected officers of the Green Berets _ officially the U.S. Army
Special Forces _ many of them seasoned veterans of Vietnam, took
draconian secrecy oaths and then began the covert assignments for
the war in Afghanistan: training native, or indigenous, guerrillas
to fight the Communist foe.
</P>
<P>
   A few men of the Green Berets and the British Special Air
Service (SAS), elected to go beyond the role of trainers. They
volunteered for scouting and back-up roles with the warriors they,
or their colleagues, had trained.
</P>
<P>
   Many Green Berets were already familiar with one of their most
important training sites, Fort Bragg, N.C., the base of the U.S.
Army's 82nd Airborne Division and the site of the John F. Kennedy
Special Warfare Center, a school of guerrilla and counter-guerrilla
warfare which the author, as a newspaper correspondent covering the
Pentagon, visited shortly before the ill-fated 1980 Iranian hostage
rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   There Col. Charles (``Chargin' Charlie'') Beckwith began
training his elite Delta Force to free the Americans held captive
in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. At that point, much of the adventure
in Afghanistan was still in the planning stages. Soon, however,
Beckwith decided to move his training to a smaller and more secure
area.
</P>
<P>
   That area, which Beckwith called ``Camp Smokey,'' was actually
the CIA's Camp Peary. It too would soon play a central role in
training for the Afghan war. Camp Peary, nicknamed ``The Farm'' in
the American spy world, was and probably still is the CIA's main
place of training for spies, infiltrators and covert operators. Its
very existence was a classified secret until various visitors
discovered it and began to write about it in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Farm is a parcel of land about 25 square miles in area, just
northeast of Williamsburg, Va., running between U.S. Route 64 and
the James River. Some of the future Afghan warrior-trainers,
chiefly Pakistanis sent by their country's Interservices
Intelligence Directorate (ISI), were probably able to see Beckwith
and his men train for the Iranian mission on a model of the
occupied U.S. Embassy compound, rehearsing all their hypothetical
moves once they got over the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Peary was also where members of the CIA Career Training
Program, many of them officers seeking advancement and new
assignments in covert action in Afghanistan and elsewhere, studied
and worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Paramilitary training also went on at another CIA-used Army
Special Forces site, Harvey Point, N.C., and at another Virginia
site, Fort A.P. Hill, off the Washington-Richmond interstate
highway. Like Fort Lee, Va., it had an authorized area for
parachute jumping. There, pilots and other personnel were supposed
to practice CARP (Computerized Airborne Point Release Flying) _ a
skill that misfired in the operation on the Caribbean island of
Grenada in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But it was apparently used effectively for supply drops to the
Afghan fighters against the Red Army, as well as very effectively
in the 1991 Operation Desert Storm to free Kuwait from Saddam
Hussein's occupying Iraqi troops.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort A.P. Hill and also at Camp Pickett, Va., the Green
Berets and U.S. Navy Seals instructed key Pakistani officers and,
occasionally, visiting senior mujahedeen of Afghan or Pakistani
origin, in infiltration techniques and ways of extracting
``friendly wounded,'' enemy prisoners or captured weapons from
behind enemy lines.
</P>
<P>
   The more successful aspiring guerrillas being trained were
inculcated with the Cold War principle that ``brainpower replaces
firepower'' as the foremost fighting implement. They were also
taught the tenet of Sun Tzu, the classical Chinese theoretician of
the art of war: ``to subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme
of skill.'' In other words, use deception, ruse and evasion as much
as possible to defeat him, rather than conventional, frontal-style
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Along with courses in surveillance and counter-surveillance; how
to write reports according to CIA standards; how to shoot various
weapons; and the running of counterterrorism, counter-narcotics and
paramilitary operations, there was classroom instruction in the
all-important subject of recruiting new agents, couriers and
assorted helpers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the training given to the holy warriors in such
techniques as how to stab an enemy sentry from behind or strangle
him with a garrote, the fact was that murder and assassination _ of
senior enemy leaders, at least _ were forbidden to the CIA by law.
Indeed, on Dec. 4, 1981, President Reagan signed executive Order
No. 12333. ``No person,'' the order stated, ``employed by or acting
on behalf of the U.S. government shall engage in, or conspire to
engage in, assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   This confirmed and solidified a ban on political assassination
passed by Congress after a surge of CIA scandals in the 1970s,
involving such bizarre measures as trying to murder Fidel Castro
with poison or exploding cigars.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the wording contradicted the curricula for
the Afghan trainees, or at least limited the targets of the lethal
methods _ acts such as strangulation, murderous karate chops and
how to use a sniper's rifle with telescopic sights to eliminate a
designated enemy officer.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the holy warriors often brought traditional
techniques to the table. For example, the time-honored Afghan
method of throat-cutting needed no CIA or U.S. congressional
authorization. It terrified Russian personnel met on the
battlefield or captured as hostages, many of whom preferred an
instant conversion to Islam over death by a dagger drawn across the
throat. The technique was also later exported, notably to Algeria,
and used there to sinister effect against the military and some
foreigners as well.
</P>
<P>
   One subject learned from the foreign instructors was indirect
sabotage. In the context of the Afghan war, this meant destroying
crops belonging to a tribe or village committed to the Soviets or
otherwise reducing or degrading the production at facilities
controlled by the Communist regime in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '90s, however, it became a favorite export of some
of the holy warriors, who, for example, tried to apply it to
destroy industrial enterprises _ especially those connected with
oil and natural gas _ benefiting foreign investors or the military
regime in Algeria, albeit without notable success.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition and arson was probably the most prized craft acquired
during the training for Afghanistan. This required detailed
knowledge about explosives and incendiary devices _ what kind, how
much, where placed, how triggered. It encompassed the making and/or
use of sophisticated fuses, timers and explosives; the creation of
fuel-and-fertilizer and other unconventional bombs; and
remote-control devices for triggering bombs and mines. These
capabilities were later transferred to the volunteers' home
countries; evidence of their mastery would crop up repeatedly in
actions against the Israelis in occupied Arab territory such as
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, under the U.S. presidency of George Bush, the CIA drank
champagne to celebrate victory of the anti-Soviet jihad. Indeed,
the Red Army had been defeated and ultimately sent home humiliated
by a volunteer army of religious believers who were disciplined
into a powerful force.
</P>
<P>
   But in the light of the next decade, that ``victory'' would come
into harsh question. The experience of the jihad _ and allying with
one another _ left indelible marks not only on the spirit of the
dying Soviet superpower, but also on the destinies of several
thriving nations.

</P>
<P>
   In August 1990, when Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces invaded
Kuwait, Osama bin Laden was shocked by the decision of King Fahd to
invite Americans to defend the Saudi kingdom. To him, it qualified
as treason.
</P>
<P>
   During the Afghan holy war, bin Laden had worked with Americans
to expel the Soviet ``Great Satan.'' But already he and his
acolytes had begun to prepare for far larger jihads to come _
targeted against impious Arab governments overly beholden to the
corrupt and satanic West.
</P>
<P>
   After the Soviet defeat in 1989, bin Laden left the Afghan
scene, without being drawn into the bloody struggles between rival
clan warlords. He returned to Saudi Arabia to tend to the family
construction business at its Jeddah head office. Reportedly, Prince
Turki bin Faisal al-Saud urged him to keep bankrolling the
mercenary volunteers based in Pakistan _ this to ensure survival of
a mobile strike force that could be used to fight Islamic causes
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   By then, however, the scope of bin Laden's purposes likely very
much exceeded Turki's. Bin Laden was reorienting the training of
men in his Al Qaeda organization to specialize in urban guerrilla
warfare, aimed at destabilizing Western societies and governments.
And he was backing Islamic militants who had begun to challenge the
governments in Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, the Philippines and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Prince Turki reportedly reassured bin Laden that U.S.
troops would all withdraw from the kingdom as soon as Saddam
Hussein was defeated _ and they would not be stationed near the
Muslim holy places.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, when U.S. troops did not entirely leave, bin Laden
revolted against the royal family. Saudi security, already highly
uneasy about his activities, had held onto bin Laden's passport
during the 1989-91 period, hoping to prevent or at least discourage
his contacts with exiled Saudi dissidents, accusing the kingdom of
police corruption and abuse of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, along with a number of Afghan war veterans, bin Laden
moved to Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, and was welcomed by Hassan
al-Turabi, the leader of Sudan's National Islamic Front (NIF).
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1980s, bin Laden and his business associates had
been watching for investment opportunities in Sudan. Now, one of
his companies, Al-Hijrah for Construction and Development, Ltd.,
contracted to build a modern airport for Port Sudan, on the Red
Sea, and a highway link to Khartoum. His trading company, Wadi
al-Aqiq, Ltd., operating with his Taba Investment Co., obtained a
near monopoly over Sudan's main agricultural exports: gum arabica,
corn, and sunflower and sesame products.
</P>
<P>
   So too, his Al-Themar al-Mubarakah Agriculture Co., Ltd.
acquired large tracts of land near Khartoum and in eastern Sudan.
Together with affluent NIF members, bin Laden invested $50 million,
a controlling interest, in an Islamic bank.
</P>
<P>
   His work force included hundreds, perhaps thousands, of militant
veterans of the Afghan ``jihad,'' or holy war. By January 1994,
according to U.S. intelligence reports, bin Laden was financing at
least three guerrilla or terrorist training camps for Egyptian,
Algerian, Tunisian and Palestinian rebels, in cooperation with the
NIF.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his assets and construction projects, bin Laden
helped his hosts by facilitating purchases of Saudi oil for
cash-poor Sudanese at subsidized prices. He took a large house on
Al Mashal Street, in a suburban quarter of Khartoum, located near
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Following his arrival, messages flowed regularly between
Washington, Riyadh and Khartoum, asking Sudan's opposition leaders
to scale down and end, if possible, bin Laden's support of armed
guerrillas abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 bin Laden began to focus on the ancient and troubled
Arab country of Yemen, his father's birthplace. He began to channel
money, weapons and trained Afghan war veterans into North Yemen,
which was embroiled in a serious territorial dispute with Saudi
Arabia. The Saudi royal regime was supporting the secular-minded
South Yemenis in Aden against the North Yemenis in Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's Yemeni activities during this general period,
according to U.S. government reports, included financing a group of
insurgents who, in December 1992, attempted bombing attacks against
about 100 U.S. servicemen in Aden. The troops were billeted there
to support U.N. relief operations in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's followers began to work with other Saudi dissident
groups against the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia and the
gulf region, and against the Saudi royal family. His followers in
the kingdom would mingle and travel with pilgrims making the
``haj,'' or holy passage, to Mecca and Medina, especially those
returning to Egypt or Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden issued false passports and identity papers, as well as
work contacts, to facilitate travel of the ``Afghanis,'' as the
veterans came to be called. In 1993, for example, he paid for the
travel to Sudan of up to 400 loyal veterans, who were threatened
with a crackdown by Pakistan, now under pressure from Egypt,
Algeria and other countries they were targeting.
</P>
<P>
   A branch of Al Qaeda _ the organization of exiled radical
Islamic leaders bin Laden had founded in the early '80s _ grew up
in Sudan to shelter and accommodate the new immigrants. Bin Laden
continued to finance them and to extend the training many had
already begun in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian intelligence, which had been concentrating on keeping
the Afghanis out, by maintaining tight checks on the Sudanese and
Libyan borders, realized that actually the leaks were coming from
Saudi Arabia. In April 1993, President Mubarak of Egypt made a
special visit to Riyadh to complain about bin Laden's support for
Egyptian subversives.
</P>
<P>
   In the same year, the Peshawar-based Islamic terrorist groups in
Egypt increased their attacks on policemen, judges, Coptic
Christians, foreign tourists and other human targets. At the end of
May 1993, the Egyptian Interior Ministry, announcing the arrest of
more than 800 suspects and the dismantling of a major terrorist
network, added that bin Laden was financing a new group called
``Belonging to the Jihad.''
</P>
<P>
   In another investigation, conducted with the Saudi authorities,
the Egyptians disclosed that the bin Laden companies were
channeling money to Egyptian rebels to buy printing presses,
weapons and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Saudi royal family decided to yield to the urgent
strictures of President Mubarak and the Americans. On April 7,
1994, after a special visit by President Mubarak to complain about
bin Laden to King Fahd, and a reported request to Interpol, the
International Police Organization, by Yemen for assistance in
apprehending bin Laden, the Saudi royal family went public.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah clearly proclaimed that hard-core Islamic
elements, preaching violence and linked to Egypt's covert groups,
were no longer welcome. King Fahd announced that bin Laden was
being stripped of citizenship ``because of his irresponsible
behavior that contradicts the interests of Saudi Arabia and harms
sisterly countries, and his refusal to obey instructions issued to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 9, 1994, Youssef M. Ibrahim of The New York Times
reported that Saudi officials had also moved to freeze bin Laden's
assets inside the kingdom, though he was ``believed to control
millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts.'' The Times' report
added that the decision against bin Laden appeared to signal to
other less visible Saudi financial tycoons to cut their ties with
militants in Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Such support, Ibrahim wrote, frequently takes the guise of
Islamic charity works, the building of mosques or the starting of
businesses that are used as channels to pump money into the
militants' war chests.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these funds, already flowing into Pakistan and
Afghanistan since the decade of the jihad, were still being used as
late as 1997 to finance the terrorist and guerrilla training camps
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after King Fahd's action against bin Laden, some
newsmen covering the Middle East, including the author, received a
fax message originating in London. It announced that Mr. Osama bin
Laden had opened an office there. The fax bore his signature in
English and Arabic, and that of a man designated in London as his
office manager.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, bin Laden was linked to the ``Committee for Advice
and Reform,'' a London-based Saudi opposition network which, in the
later 1990s, issued more than 1,000 pamphlets and tracts attacking
the royal government and the House of Saud, often in violent terms.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden never publicly responded to the condemnation by his
eldest brother, Bakr bin Laden, who expressed in the Saudi media
his family's ``regret, denunciation and condemnation'' of his
younger brother's extremist activities.
</P>
<P>
   Until forced to depart from Sudan under American and Saudi
pressure in 1996, bin Laden expanded his wealth and global network
of political, banking and terrorist contacts.

</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, the U.S. State Department issued a
standard and rather tardy fact sheet on Osama bin Laden. It
provided many interesting details about his career as a master of
Islamic extremism and anti-American terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But it omitted the background facts that help to explain his
early and close connections to the United States, which had
enlisted his talents and fortune to aid the attack on Communist
invaders in the Afghan holy war.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, bin Laden met with at least four senior
radical Islamic leaders: Ayman el-Zawahri, chief of Egypt's
Al-Gihad; Abdul Salem Mohammed, chief of an extremist group in
Bangladesh; Fadi Errahmane Khalil, emir of the Pakistani Harakat
Ansar; and the Egyptian exile Abu Yassir Ahmed Taha, representing
Islamic groups in Arab North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   These men and some aides set up an ``International Islamic
Struggle Front'' dedicated to fighting ``the Jews'' _ i.e., Israel
and all its friends and allies. They issued a ``fatwa,'' or death
sentence, declaring it to be legitimate to kill any American,
civilian or military.
</P>
<P>
   That spring, a horrified Prince Turki bin Faisal al-Saud, a
close boyhood friend of bin Laden, flew to Afghanistan to see
Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban chief. He asked Omar to arrange a
meeting with bin Laden, who was installed near the village of
Khost, by the Pakistan border. There, Prince Turki reminded bin
Laden that although he had been deprived of Saudi citizenship, no
steps had been taken against his family in Saudi Arabia, and surely
it was time for a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   But the prince returned to Riyadh empty-handed, except for the
assurance from Omar that he would try to calm his guest. Indeed,
bin Laden offered to leave Afghanistan, if his presence was
bothering the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' Omar is said to have responded. ``You are one of us,
and you will stay with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the real assault on America would begin. On
the morning of Aug. 7, 1998, truck bombs devastated the area around
the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
The bombs killed 224 people and injured more than 4,500. As the
world watched, the injured lay traumatized by shock, in pools of
blood. Nairobi's hospitals were crammed beyond capacity with
emergency cases: men, women and children, blinded, and mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, which were perceived almost immediately to bear the
signature of Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda organization, founded
in Afghanistan in the early '80s, should not have been a surprise
to the U.S. intelligence establishment.
</P>
<P>
   A few insiders and some journalists had noted a warning that was
broadcast widely only about 24 hours before the attacks. It was not
signed by bin Laden, or Al Qaeda, or the ``International Islamic
Struggle Front,'' created months earlier for the purpose of an
anti-American jihad.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Egypt's Al-Gihad, the extremist organization
responsible for President Anwar al-Sadat's murder in 1981 and much
terrorism inside Egypt, cautioned that it was about to take
reprisals against the United States. The reason, it said, was that
the CIA had aided in the arrest in Albania of several Egyptian
Islamic militants, some of whom were already condemned to death.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, where President Clinton was under heavy fire for
his affair with a former White House intern and perjury accusations
against him by independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr, the U.S.
administration was suddenly galvanized.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 FBI agents and other intelligence teams and
military units, including medical rescue teams, and even Israeli
troops from Israel, were airborne for East Africa within hours.
Reports were coming in of threats to other U.S. embassies,
including those in Kampala and Tirana, Albania. Later, these and a
number of other U.S. diplomatic missions were temporarily
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few days, two suspects, a naturalized Kenyan of
Palestinian birth named Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohammed Rashed
Daoud al-Owhali, a Yemeni, were apprehended. Odeh was arrested in
Pakistan after flying out of Nairobi, and was returned quickly
after confessing a degree of guilt to Pakistani police. Al-Owhali
was seized in Kenya. Both were packed off in handcuffs on military
aircraft to New York, where they were charged with murder,
complicity in murder, use of munitions of massive power and
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Also soon arrested was Abdullah Mohammed Fadhul, from the
Comoros, a republic of islands off East Africa. He, as did the
others, admitted belonging to bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the Aug. 7 bombings, Clinton summoned his national
security advisor, Sandy Berger, and called back from Italy
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had been attending the
gala wedding of CNN's chief international correspondent, Christiane
Amanpour, and State Department spokesman James Rubin. Defense
Secretary William Cohen, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. Hugh
Shelton, and the latest of a long series of rapidly changing CIA
directors, George Tenet, were also called to join the crisis
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Clinton decided to strike back at two places
regarded as strongholds of bin Laden, implicated as the originator
of the embassy attacks by the suspect Odeh. The first strike would
be in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was in the protective custody of
the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   It was decided not to risk any American personnel or aircraft,
but to use the weapon already fired against Saddam Hussein in Iraq
during the Persian Gulf War: the remotely-guided Tomahawk cruise
missile.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 would be launched, from U.S. Navy ships in the Red Sea
and the Indian Ocean, at three of bin Laden's camps near Khost.
There was a base camp, a support camp and a terrorist training
camp, all named Zhawar Kili Al-Badr, arranged in a rough isosceles
triangle a few miles inside Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Eerily, these were some of the same facilities planned and
designed by the CIA and Pakistan's Interservices Intelligence
Directorate (ISI) to be used for training the holy warriors back in
the Afghan war.
</P>
<P>
   The second target for the missiles was the al-Shifa
pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, Sudan. Administration spokesmen
claimed they had firm evidence it was under bin Laden's influence,
if not financial control. They said it was cooperating with the
Iraqi chemical-weapons program and producing ethyl
methylphosphothionate, an important ingredient of VX nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   Codenamed ``Infinite Reach,'' the cruise-missile strike was
launched on Aug. 20, with varied reports back about the casualties
and damage. According to Taliban accounts, about 20 guerrilla
fighters were killed in the camps, not including bin Laden, who was
absent.
</P>
<P>
   Some Washington sources said the United States was aware of his
absence, through its overhead satellite surveillance and electronic
monitoring of his radio-telephone traffic. Many agreed that a dead
bin Laden would be far more dangerous, rising to the status of a
martyr and stirring supporters to more frenzied acts of vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   After the al-Shifa raid, Sudan's government and the factory
owners unanimously and vehemently denied that the plant was used to
manufacture anything other than prescription medicines, vitamins
and other pharmaceuticals badly needed in Sudan's impoverished
society. They also denied that bin Laden had a controlling
financial interest in the plant.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later The New York Times, The Washington Post and
some Washington officials who had fed them news leaks began to back
off the story. They acknowledged that a dreadful error might have
been made in the attack on Khartoum, although Washington staunchly
resisted Sudan's demand for an on-the-spot investigation by U.N.
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1999, Salih Idris, the Saudi businessman who
owned the al-Shifa plant, was suing the U.S. government in the
Federal Court of Claims for $30 million in compensation for
destruction of his property.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, by late July, 17 people had been charged with roles
in the embassy bombings. Five were being held in New York for
trial; three in Britain; nine, including bin Laden, were fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, was extradited from
Germany to the United States, and charged with murder, conspiracy
and use of a weapon of mass destruction. Salim's arrest added a
nuclear aspect to the pattern of international conspiracy being
woven around bin Laden. Salim, described as a founding member of Al
Qaeda, was arrested on Sept. 16 at a car dealership outside Munich
on a tip from Interpol in Washington. He was identified as a
financial advisor and weapons procurer for bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   According to New York court documents, a group including Salim
had tried to obtain components for nuclear weapons, including
enriched uranium, to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   It also emerged that the bin Laden organization apparently had
tentacles into the U.S. armed forces. A former Army sergeant, Ali
A. Mohamed, was secretly arrested in September and held in the
Manhattan Metropolitan Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ali left the U.S. Army after a three-year term in 1989. He had
earned a Parachute Badge and an expert M-16 rifleman's badge, and
taught soldiers in the U.S. Special Forces at Fort Bragg, N.C.,
about Muslim culture. Earlier, in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sudan,
he trained members of Al Qaeda in urban and guerilla fighting.
</P>
<P>
   On July 12, 1999, Ibrahim Hussein Eidarous, 42, and Adel
Mohammed Abdul Bary, 39 _ two of bin Laden's Egyptian followers _
were rounded up and appeared in court in London. A British
magistrate said originals of faxes to three news organizations,
which claimed responsibility for the embassy blasts and bore the
men's fingerprints, were found at the London offices of a Saudi
dissident group.
</P>
<P>
   Another suspect arrested in London, Khalid al-Fawwaz, a Saudi
national, allegedly agreed with bin Laden and others to kill
Americans anywhere in the world, especially diplomats and military
men.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Clinton administration officials have ordered special
alerts at U.S. installations around the world for Aug. 7, 1999, the
one-year anniversary of the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   On July 30, 1999, the Afghan Islamic News Agency announced that
bin Laden, who was said to fear a Pakistan-based raid by U.S.
commando troops to capture or kill him, would leave Afghanistan for
any friendly Muslim country that would receive him.
</P>
<P>
   The question facing the world was: What ruler or government
would be intrepid enough to offer protection or asylum to such a
dangerous guest?

</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 3, 1998, a month after the U.S. Embassy bombings in
East Africa, FBI director Louis J. Freeh gave, in congressional
testimony, both a retrospective and a preview of official U.S.
government views about the Afghan war veterans' terrorist assault
against America.
</P>
<P>
   As lead anti-terrorist agency since 1995, the FBI was now
actively working with its new Counterterrorism Center, and a number
of other U.S. military and civilian intelligence and security
agencies, in a new permanent consultative committee operating under
tight security wraps in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Freeh cited the trend in anti-American
terrorist attacks ``toward large-scale incidents designed for
maximum destruction, terror and impact.'' He recalled how the
threat of ``jihad'' in America had finally been made real by the
February 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that although there were no American victims in the
November '97 attack on foreign tourists at the Temple of Luxor, in
Egypt, still there were signs that the assault was meant to force
the release of the blind cleric, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, from
prison in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh recalled that Rahman and his associates, aside from a role
in plotting the World Trade Center bombing, had been convicted in
1995 for plotting to murder President Mubarak during a visit to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The same group was caught red-handed mixing fertilizer and fuel
oil _ one of the old reliable recipes from the CIA manuals for
training in Afghanistan _ to make a lethal, do-it-yourself,
home-grown bomb of great power. Their goal was to destroy United
Nations buildings, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels and police and
FBI headquarters, among other targets in New York. Freeh might have
added, but didn't, that they also had discussed assassinating some
leading pro-Israel congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh also failed to mention the Afghanistan connection, a
subject generally taboo. Indeed, during a 1993 television
broadcast, New York's regional FBI director, Robert Fox, had
mentioned the CIA's earlier training of several of the World Trade
Center bombers _ and, by coincidence, found himself transferred
several weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   As for missions inside the United States, Freeh dealt with
another category of terrorism _ by ``autonomous, generally
transnational'' organizations. These have their own personnel,
financing and training facilities and are able to plan and mount
operations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh noted that Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezbollah (the Party of
God), Egypt's al-Gania'a and the Palestinian Hamas all had
supporters within the United States. Hezbollah, he recalled, had
been behind the 1983 truck bombings of the U.S. Embassy and Marine
barracks in Lebanon and the bombing of a second U.S. Embassy in
East Beirut in 1984, as well as detention of U.S. hostages in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's next category of terrorism was ``locally affiliated,''
although global in scope. Such terrorists might pose, Freeh said,
the most urgent threat because they ``are often organized on an ad
hoc, temporary basis, making them difficult for law enforcement to
infiltrate or track. They can also exploit the mobility that
technology and the lack of a rigorous base structure offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, Freeh recalled, the FBI had investigated
leading ``extra-territorial'' cases of terrorism. These included
the June 25, 1996 truck-bombing of the U.S. servicemen's Khobar
Towers apartment complex in Saudi Arabia and, finally, the East
African bombings of August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Khobar Towers truck-bombing, which killed 19 American airmen
and wounded about 500 people, forced the relocation of Air Force
personnel still living there, in their capacity to service
overflights of Iraq and other air operations, from the Saudi
Dhahran Air Base to distant al-Kharj.
</P>
<P>
   That case remains unsolved. However, the Saudis executed four
men, who confessed to blowing up a Saudi-U.S. joint military office
facility in Riyadh on Nov. 13, 1995, killing three U.S. civilians
and two soldiers, and wounding about 60 other people including
civilian passers-by. Three of the four executed culprits, the
Saudis announced, had confessed their adherence to Osama bin
Laden's network.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh also referred to terrorist ``renditions,'' by which he
meant those captured abroad and returned to the United States for
trial. He cited the case of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, an Afghan war
veteran, who ordered the chemicals for the World Trade Center
Bombing. Yousef was seized in a bin Laden-owned hotel in Pakistan
by U.S. and Pakistani agents. On Feb. 7, 1995, he was extradited to
New York for trial and later sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh also cited the case of Mir Amal Kansi, 33, yet another
Afghan war veteran, who shot and killed two CIA employees outside
CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., a month before the World Trade
Center bombing. Tracked down by the FBI and probably other U.S.
services, Kansi was seized in Pakistan _ touching off reprisal
killings of several Americans in Karachi a short time later. He was
flown to the United States for trial on June 17, 1995 and sentenced
to death in Virginia, the scene of his crime. Kansi's case was
pending appeal in late July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, having finally recognized the threat
of the ``Afghanis'' _ or what some prefer to call the ``blowback''
of U.S. involvement in the Afghan war _ moved to appoint a new
anti-terrorism ``czar'' in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In early September 1998, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
swore in William Crowe, the former ambassador to Britain, as
chairman of two Accountability Review Boards, loaded with senior
specialists in anti-terrorism, to investigate the embassy bombings.
In a report he and Albright publicized on Jan. 8, 1999, Crowe found
no fault with U.S. security personnel, but said the United States
was correcting serious security deficiencies at U.S. embassies
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government of Pakistan, through whose airspace
the attacking U.S. Tomahawk missiles had passed on Aug. 20, fired
its intelligence chief. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government
had lost face by having to retract a false report that at least one
missile landed near a Pakistani nuclear site.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the blowback from Afghanistan was the
financing of the jihad, and its export, by the cultivation,
processing and traffic of drugs. By the late 1990s, a vast tide of
drugs flowing out of Afghanistan and Pakistan to Europe, the
Americas and the Far East _ opium, morphine base and even refined
heroin, to say nothing of marijuana in various forms _ had reached
truly epic proportions. Its impact was felt from the inner cities
of America and Europe to the once-rich ``Tiger'' economies of the
Far East, as well as in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the victorious Afghan leaders, who turned to
slaughtering one another after the Soviet withdrawal, had built a
huge international drug network in the 1980s. This turned the
opium-producing Golden Crescent countries _ Afghanistan, Iran and
Pakistan _ into an Aladdin's cave of riches.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the expanding wealth helped to finance guerrilla wars and
terrorist actions in Algeria, Bosnia, Egypt, Kashmir, the
Philippines and other places. Second, it assured a handful of the
post-1990 terrorist leaders _ the generals and tycoons of world
terrorism _ that they'd have fabulous incomes and luxurious
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the sale and resale of U.S.-made weapons, from
rifles to Stinger missiles, and other commodities of all
descriptions, initially sent free to the Afghan holy warriors via
their Pakistani sponsors, but often reaching private arms dealers.
</P>
<P>
   American weapons and munitions were diverted and abused on a
massive scale _ sold to raise funds for insurgents' field supplies,
or simply for personal profit. Even casual visitors to the bazaars
in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier province keep finding these
weapons, for sale to any buyer with the necessary cash.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, rather than creating gratitude, the American
support for the war in Afghanistan led to aroused hatred toward
U.S. policies and fueled the assault on America led by bin Laden
and his disciples. The holy alliance of the Americans and the
Islamic forces against the Soviets would precede a series of unholy
wars and epidemics of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-fated Soviet invasion of 1979 would be one final error
of a dying superpower. It gave America an opening for a crusade,
conducted by Muslim mercenaries who then turned on their
benefactors and employers. But tragically, the world will continue
to experience this blowback well into the 21st century. And there
will be devastating consequences for world peace.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps future governments, whether in the United States, Great
Britain, Russia or less powerful nations, will take to heart an
important lesson of late-20th-century history: When you decide to
go to war against your main enemy, take a good look at the allies,
friends or mercenary fighters behind you. Look well to see whether
they already have unsheathed their knives _ and are pointing them
at your back.

</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, after months of tortuous negotiations, an American
TV news team managed to establish contact and to interview Osama
bin Laden _ in a mountain hideaway in Afghanistan, guarded by the
Taliban. He was considered by the U.S. government and many allies
to be the most dangerous international terrorist at large.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, bin Laden called for the murder of
Americans and Jews, wherever they might be, castigating Americans
as ``the biggest thieves in the world and the (worst) terrorists.''
He praised, and sometimes implied personal responsibility for, the
World Trade Center bombing in New York in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed a desire to drive Western, especially American,
influence and interests from the Arab and Muslim worlds. He vowed
to drive the Saudi royal family from power and destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the name Osama bin Laden was unfamiliar to many in
the West. News reports sparsely recounted how he built his vast
fortune as a Saudi Arabian citizen and became a leader and
financier of a complex global terrorist network that grew out of
the bloody Afghan ``jihad,'' or holy war.
</P>
<P>
   The truth about how bin Laden achieved his wealth and what his
activities actually have been over the years is still largely
untold.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Laden, had a
rags-to-riches story: He founded a formidable construction dynasty
after emigrating in the mid-1940s to Saudi Arabia from Yemen as a
very young man. Poor but industrious, he got a job as a bricklayer
for Aramco, the Arabian-American Oil Co., and earned one Saudi
riyal _ the equivalent of about 20 U.S. cents _ per day.
</P>
<P>
   Like other immigrants from his region, the Yemeni coastal
province of Hadhramaut, east of the big seaport of Aden, bin Laden
deposited his riyals in a tin box and spent frugally on himself.
</P>
<P>
   In past centuries, the trading ships of the Hadrami Arabs had
voyaged out to Indonesia and China, bringing back spices, incense,
myrrh and frankincense from the Far East and the Indian
subcontinent. That was generations before the merchants of England
and Salem, Mass., made their fortunes in the China trade of the
19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Even before independence, when Britain gave up its colonial grip
on Aden and South Arabia in 1967, Hadrami merchants, clerks and
moneychangers had migrated north to seek their fortunes in Saudi
Arabia. These fortunes _ earned by dint of hard work and good luck
combined _ built or contributed to Saudi business and banking
dynasties. Today some of them also finance radical Islamic causes
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Once the elder bin Laden had saved enough to go into business
for himself, he founded a construction firm and started modestly
with small jobs. By the early 1950s he had moved into building
palaces for the House of Saud in Riyadh. Eventually, bin Laden won
the highly lucrative contract for a Medina-to-Jeddah highway in the
holy province of Hejaz, after a foreign contractor had withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the bin Laden name was legendary in Arab construction _
especially in the Saudi kingdom and in Jordan _ for every sort of
major road, airport and other infrastructure project. The firm
attracted engineering talent from all over the world and amassed a
huge fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Mohammed, as he came to be called, developed a reputation
for piety as well as wealth, jetting from one Arab construction
site to another. He once had the unique experience of saying, in
one day, morning prayers in East Jerusalem (before Israel's 1967
conquest of the holy city), noon prayers in Medina and evening
prayers in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, his reputation for piety rubbed off on the firm. By
1966, when his aircraft crashed and he was killed, bin Laden had
developed a conglomerate of companies and was the biggest private
contractor of this type in the world, owning 90 of the largest
Caterpillar excavators then in existence.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its religious credentials _ useful later when it would
become a financier of the Afghan jihad _ the firm was short on
management knowhow. For a time, Saudi King Faisal appointed the
owner of a smaller construction company to watch over the financial
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the Islamic tradition of polygamy, bin Laden
fathered no fewer than 52 children with various wives. One of his
sons, Osama, had already attracted the attention of the Saudi royal
family.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, at age 23, Osama bin Laden was finishing studies in
economics and marketing at Jeddah University. He already had a
close friendship with Prince Turki bin Faisal al-Saud, who shared
his fervent ideas about the decline and decadence of Islam and
Islamic political dynamism.
</P>
<P>
   Osama appreciated Prince Turki's honesty and antipathy to
corruption _ qualities he believed were not always found in the
Arab world's royalty or rulers. And, for his part, the prince seems
to have regarded Osama as an ernest young man who burned with a
pure, hard flame of devotion to religious principles.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, Osama bin Laden was running much of the elite
construction business that his father had built from scratch. Under
his guidance, the company expanded its reputation for professional
excellence and a ``can-do'' spirit in major projects. His
inheritance from the family fortune was soon augmented by the huge
business earnings.
</P>
<P>
   It was a politically tumultuous time. In neighboring
Afghanistan, a fierce 1978 revolution had resulted in a Marxist
government and brought a sizeable amount of Soviet aid. But
non-stop in-fighting among the parties and protest demonstrations
among the devout Muslim citizenry were followed by a Soviet
invasion. This was an outrage to bin Laden, who seized the
opportunity to join forces against the ``godless'' Red Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was enraged and went there at once,'' he said in a 1993
interview with Robert Fisk of the London Independent, one of the
first journalists to spot bin Laden as a key mover in the Afghan
holy war and, perhaps more significantly, in the larger jihad
against America that would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Turki sent bin Laden to Peshawar, Pakistan, to scout out
the possibilities of raising an Arab volunteer army. Soon bin Laden
set up a base for the Afghan warriors, within easy reach of
Pakistan's powerful intelligence and security service, the
Interservices Intelligence Directorate _ known as ISI _ but
apparently not supervised by them.
</P>
<P>
   As the war rolled on, bin Laden was organizer, financier,
fighter and Islamic role model. He eagerly imported bulldozers and
other heavy equipment to cut new roads and tunnels. Operating out
of Karachi, Pakistan and Afghanistan, he agreed to build bases and
training camps, as well as landing strips for the private jets of
warlords and Muslim and Arab dignitaries. He built deeply buried
bunkers and tunnels in the mountains for command posts and
telecommunications centers to secure the communications against the
radio traffic analysts and codebreakers of the Red Army.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, bin Laden quickly became acquainted with Abdullah
Azzam, a charismatic Palestinian leader, who had made a name for
himself with fiery sermons in Zarqa, Jordan, addressed to
Palestinians fleeing the Jordanian army's crackdown in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Azzam, later a founder of the Hamas Islamic resistance movement
in Gaza and the West Bank, had rejected the authority of Yassir
Arafat's mainstream Palestine Liberation Organization and other
smaller groups as too Marxist and not Islamic enough. He believed
they depended too much on the Soviet ``Great Satan,'' the usurper
of Muslim Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In liaison with the generals running Pakistan's ISI, Azzam
outlined his need for weapons, transportation and incomes. Bin
Laden promised to be generous with financing and began fundraising
and organizational journeys throughout the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the bin Laden financial and construction empire
strengthened its ties with the Saudi royal family, winning a $3
billion ``contract of the century'': the full restoration and
reconstruction of the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
</P>
<P>
   Also proving to be a brave foot soldier, bin Laden suffered a
shoulder wound in combat near Jalalabad. Under the approving eye of
Pakistan's ISI officers, he cultivated and guarded his good
relations with the two main ethnic Afghan warlords: Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar and Ahmad Shah Massoud.
</P>
<P>
   Even more crucial for his later global enterprise in private
terrorism, bin Laden used as a regional power base in Pakistan the
Binoori mosque in Karachi's Newton district. The prayer leader
there was a certain Mullah Mohammed Omar, then an unknown young
cleric, but by 1998 the leader of the Taliban and the most powerful
man in Afghanistan.

</P>
<P>
   It could be called a strange love affair that went disastrously
wrong: the alliance, during the Afghan war, between the United
States and some of the most fanatical followers of radical Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Four a quarter century after the onset of the Cold War in 1946,
the Soviet Union was perceived to be the principal threat to
American interests in the Middle East, as elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, decided by a tiny
coterie in the Leonid Brezhnev-era politburo, jolted President
Jimmy Carter in the White House and his foreign-policy team. They
perceived the foolhardy invasion not only as a major international
threat, but also as a rare opportunity to undermine the already
tottering Soviet empire lying north of Afghanistan, in Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In cooperation with Pakistan's Interservices Intelligence
Directorate (ISI), Saudi financing and Pakistani logistical
support, the CIA managed the program to send into battle a
mercenary army of Islamic volunteers. The tacit consensus was that
the Muslim religion, fundamentally anti-Communist, if translated
into politics, could be harnessed as a mighty force to oppose
Moscow in the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   This impetus to support the anti-Soviet ``jihad,'' or holy war,
was amplified by President Ronald Reagan's men _ especially his
director of Central Intelligence, William Casey. By 1981, when new
sources of secret financing were needed for the Afghan campaign,
the bin Laden enterprises were on a short list of possible donors.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Sultan bin Abdul Azziz, the powerful Saudi defense and
aviation minister, told a high-level American business and
investors' delegation that the bin Laden firms had done great
things for the kingdom. To both Saudi intelligence and the CIA,
Osama bin Laden, through his personal reputation as an astute
businessman and a pious Muslim, seemed an ideal figure to play a
leading role.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden would pay, with his own and company funds, for the
recruitment, transportation and training of the volunteers who
flocked in, first to Peshawar, Pakistan, and then to Afghanistan,
from the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, parts of Europe and
America. He collected enough millions from his family and corporate
holdings and from donations by rich Arab Persian Gulf merchant
families, to organize Al Qaeda, the Islamic Salvation Foundation,
to support the jihad.
</P>
<P>
   He established a network of Al Qaeda centers in Saudi Arabia,
Egypt and Pakistan, through which he recruited, enlisted and
sheltered thousands of Arab volunteers. It is this large fraternity
of Al Qaeda alumni which is still internationally active _ not as
freedom fighters, but as terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those bin Laden recruited turned out to be zealous
Muslims like himself, and brave soldiers. Some, however, were
criminals, who emerged from places such as Algerian or Tunisian
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Girardet, one of the most perceptive journalists covering
the war, estimated in summer 1983 that already there were between
80,000 and 150,000 full-time guerrilla fighters. Their pay had to
compete with what some had earned, or might earn, in more peaceful
civilian callings. The figures for ``regulars'' did not include
hundreds of thousands of Afghan and Pakistani civilians who
functioned as part-time fighters.
</P>
<P>
   After several long visits to different fronts, Girardet
determined that the resistance movement was operating, with varying
efficiency, in as many as 300 different regions throughout
Afghanistan's 28 provinces.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA, through an ISI-managed logistical framework, tried to
supply and pay the guerrillas; in practice, pay and equipment in
the field often had to come directly from outside donors such as
bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   During the peak period for foreign volunteers _ which spawned
bin Laden's Al Qaeda and various lesser foreign terrorist networks
_ up to 5,000 non-Afghan fighters streamed into the Peshawar area.
Easily 10 times that number would train or fight; others rested,
trafficked in drugs and arms or led the good life in Peshawar.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them, as an Egyptian newsman who visited his compatriots
remarked, were drawn by the adventure and religious prestige,
involving a kind of emotional ``high, attached to feeling part of
the jihad.'' Some were university undergraduates or, like the
Taliban who appeared in 1993, students of Islamic colleges, known
as ``madrassas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the young men, from poorer Arab countries such as Yemen
or Sudan, had been working in the wealthy Persian Gulf oil emirates
and were ripe for recruitment there. They had grown tired of being
reduced, with their non-Arab, Asian colleagues, to proletarian
status. Others were self-financed or backed _ a notable example was
Egypt's cleric, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman _ by tight-knit communities
of followers.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who took up arms, the ideological core group were
believers who were politically, as well as emotionally or
materially, engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike training, recruiting for the jihad in the United States
was not handled directly by the CIA, despite its overall management
role. Various local cover groups, often legitimate Muslim charities
and mosque communities in cities such as New York, Detroit, Los
Angeles and other large centers of Arab-American population,
shielded the agency.
</P>
<P>
   If directly run by the men from Langley, Va., such activities _
as well as the weapons training in America _ would have been a
flagrant violation of the CIA's charter.
</P>
<P>
   The sites for induction and initial indoctrination of the future
holy warriors were modest and humdrum. One was in New York's Arab
district, in Brooklyn, on Atlantic Avenue. Another was a private
rifle club in affluent Naugutuck, Conn. There were similar
locations within the large Arab immigrant and Arab-American
districts in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area, Detroit and
Dearborn, Mich.,
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, the Alkifah Refugee Center was also known to the
Arabs, Arab-Americans and Muslim travelers from abroad who met and
worked there as the ``Al-Jihad'' center. This was because both
recruiting and fund-raising for the Afghanistan jihad went on
there.
</P>
<P>
   The funding came from charitable donations for Afghan refugee
relief in the United States. Most probably, there were also
hard-to-trace monies from the World Muslim League and other
missionary and charitable organizations located in Pakistan, such
as the Tablighi Jamaat, a vast international Islamic missionary
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Among the key figures in the Brooklyn operation was bin Laden's
old friend, Abdullah Azzam, a fiery speaker and founder of Hamas.
In the early and mid-'80s, he toured the United States recruiting
for Afghanistan. But he was probably also raising funds for Hamas
and its post-1987 Palestinian revolt against Israel in the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
   Azzam was killed by a still-mysterious car bomb in Pakistan in
1987 _ it greatly upset bin Laden. Suspects included Israel's
Mossad intelligence agency; the Soviet KGB or its Afghan adjunct,
the Communist Afghan KHAD; the Pakistani ISI; and even the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   The blind Egyptian prayer leader, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, also
had been a recruiter, sending his sons to fight in Afghanistan.
Later, with other suspects, he was convicted in the 1993 World
Trade Center bombing and an aborted conspiracy to bomb the United
Nations headquarters, along New York's East River, as well as
traffic tunnels, bridges, FBI headquarters and government offices.
</P>
<P>
   Rahman and the others frequented the Atlantic Avenue
headquarters and often prayed in nearby mosques. An investigation
on ABC's July 12, 1993, ``Day One'' magazine program aired details
of Azzam's recruiting activities in no fewer than 26 American
states.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Brooklyn jihad workers, including El Sayyid Nosair _
he later was convicted of the 1990 murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the
Jewish Defense League leader _ trained as gunmen at a shooting
range in Naugutuck, just west of the highway from Bridgeport to
Waterbury.
</P>
<P>
   Recruits for Afghanistan, according to later New York court
documents, also trained in rifle shooting there. Nosair's course on
the AK-47 assault rifle _ the standard, Soviet-made weapon used by
the mujahedeen _ was held as late as the summer of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Afghan war was nearly over, but as Pakistan's
former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto remarked on the ``Day One''
broadcast, the dispersal of the fighters had begun toward new
target countries. ``They are all over the world,'' she said.

</P>
<P>
   As John Collins, senior American military analyst at the
Congressional Research Services, noted in 1987, it takes little
expertise to pour epoxy on movable machinery or sugar into gas
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Quite another matter, however, is strategic sabotage, which
requires activists and organizers who can mobilize people and
coordinate their actions in demonstrations, strikes, riots,
boycotts, production delays and in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   The zealous young men of the Afghan ``jihad'' would develop an
expertise in sabotage and various martial and murderous skills _
methods that were used successfully in Afghanistan, and also after
1989 in violent actions against their own Third World governments
and in anti-Western terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, as seen from CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., the
program to ``train the trainers'' of the holy warriors followed the
principle of elevating combat into an expression of religious
fervor.
</P>
<P>
   In a pyramidal training scheme, the CIA was the overall manager;
U.S. special-ops forces and a coalition of assorted allied
specialists were the main instructors. Pakistani officers were the
students who would experience tough courses in endurance, weapons
use, sabotage, killing techniques, battle communications and other
skills. Later, in the schools and camps of Pakistan and
Afghanistan, they would impart these skills to the scores of
thousands of fighters _ the mujahedeen _ and send them into battle.
Often, though not always, the same kind of process applied to the
use and distribution of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Selected officers of the Green Berets _ officially the U.S. Army
Special Forces _ many of them seasoned veterans of Vietnam, took
draconian secrecy oaths and then began the covert assignments for
the war in Afghanistan: training native, or indigenous, guerrillas
to fight the Communist foe.
</P>
<P>
   A few men of the Green Berets and the British Special Air
Service (SAS), elected to go beyond the role of trainers. They
volunteered for scouting and back-up roles with the warriors they,
or their colleagues, had trained.
</P>
<P>
   Many Green Berets were already familiar with one of their most
important training sites, Fort Bragg, N.C., the base of the U.S.
Army's 82nd Airborne Division and the site of the John F. Kennedy
Special Warfare Center, a school of guerrilla and counter-guerrilla
warfare which the author, as a newspaper correspondent covering the
Pentagon, visited shortly before the ill-fated 1980 Iranian hostage
rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   There Col. Charles (``Chargin' Charlie'') Beckwith began
training his elite Delta Force to free the Americans held captive
in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. At that point, much of the adventure
in Afghanistan was still in the planning stages. Soon, however,
Beckwith decided to move his training to a smaller and more secure
area.
</P>
<P>
   That area, which Beckwith called ``Camp Smokey,'' was actually
the CIA's Camp Peary. It too would soon play a central role in
training for the Afghan war. Camp Peary, nicknamed ``The Farm'' in
the American spy world, was and probably still is the CIA's main
place of training for spies, infiltrators and covert operators. Its
very existence was a classified secret until various visitors
discovered it and began to write about it in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Farm is a parcel of land about 25 square miles in area, just
northeast of Williamsburg, Va., running between U.S. Route 64 and
the James River. Some of the future Afghan warrior-trainers,
chiefly Pakistanis sent by their country's Interservices
Intelligence Directorate (ISI), were probably able to see Beckwith
and his men train for the Iranian mission on a model of the
occupied U.S. Embassy compound, rehearsing all their hypothetical
moves once they got over the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Peary was also where members of the CIA Career Training
Program, many of them officers seeking advancement and new
assignments in covert action in Afghanistan and elsewhere, studied
and worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Paramilitary training also went on at another CIA-used Army
Special Forces site, Harvey Point, N.C., and at another Virginia
site, Fort A.P. Hill, off the Washington-Richmond interstate
highway. Like Fort Lee, Va., it had an authorized area for
parachute jumping. There, pilots and other personnel were supposed
to practice CARP (Computerized Airborne Point Release Flying) _ a
skill that misfired in the operation on the Caribbean island of
Grenada in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But it was apparently used effectively for supply drops to the
Afghan fighters against the Red Army, as well as very effectively
in the 1991 Operation Desert Storm to free Kuwait from Saddam
Hussein's occupying Iraqi troops.
</P>
<P>
   At Fort A.P. Hill and also at Camp Pickett, Va., the Green
Berets and U.S. Navy Seals instructed key Pakistani officers and,
occasionally, visiting senior mujahedeen of Afghan or Pakistani
origin, in infiltration techniques and ways of extracting
``friendly wounded,'' enemy prisoners or captured weapons from
behind enemy lines.
</P>
<P>
   The more successful aspiring guerrillas being trained were
inculcated with the Cold War principle that ``brainpower replaces
firepower'' as the foremost fighting implement. They were also
taught the tenet of Sun Tzu, the classical Chinese theoretician of
the art of war: ``to subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme
of skill.'' In other words, use deception, ruse and evasion as much
as possible to defeat him, rather than conventional, frontal-style
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Along with courses in surveillance and counter-surveillance; how
to write reports according to CIA standards; how to shoot various
weapons; and the running of counterterrorism, counter-narcotics and
paramilitary operations, there was classroom instruction in the
all-important subject of recruiting new agents, couriers and
assorted helpers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the training given to the holy warriors in such
techniques as how to stab an enemy sentry from behind or strangle
him with a garrote, the fact was that murder and assassination _ of
senior enemy leaders, at least _ were forbidden to the CIA by law.
Indeed, on Dec. 4, 1981, President Reagan signed executive Order
No. 12333. ``No person,'' the order stated, ``employed by or acting
on behalf of the U.S. government shall engage in, or conspire to
engage in, assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   This confirmed and solidified a ban on political assassination
passed by Congress after a surge of CIA scandals in the 1970s,
involving such bizarre measures as trying to murder Fidel Castro
with poison or exploding cigars.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the wording contradicted the curricula for
the Afghan trainees, or at least limited the targets of the lethal
methods _ acts such as strangulation, murderous karate chops and
how to use a sniper's rifle with telescopic sights to eliminate a
designated enemy officer.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the holy warriors often brought traditional
techniques to the table. For example, the time-honored Afghan
method of throat-cutting needed no CIA or U.S. congressional
authorization. It terrified Russian personnel met on the
battlefield or captured as hostages, many of whom preferred an
instant conversion to Islam over death by a dagger drawn across the
throat. The technique was also later exported, notably to Algeria,
and used there to sinister effect against the military and some
foreigners as well.
</P>
<P>
   One subject learned from the foreign instructors was indirect
sabotage. In the context of the Afghan war, this meant destroying
crops belonging to a tribe or village committed to the Soviets or
otherwise reducing or degrading the production at facilities
controlled by the Communist regime in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '90s, however, it became a favorite export of some
of the holy warriors, who, for example, tried to apply it to
destroy industrial enterprises _ especially those connected with
oil and natural gas _ benefiting foreign investors or the military
regime in Algeria, albeit without notable success.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition and arson was probably the most prized craft acquired
during the training for Afghanistan. This required detailed
knowledge about explosives and incendiary devices _ what kind, how
much, where placed, how triggered. It encompassed the making and/or
use of sophisticated fuses, timers and explosives; the creation of
fuel-and-fertilizer and other unconventional bombs; and
remote-control devices for triggering bombs and mines. These
capabilities were later transferred to the volunteers' home
countries; evidence of their mastery would crop up repeatedly in
actions against the Israelis in occupied Arab territory such as
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, under the U.S. presidency of George Bush, the CIA drank
champagne to celebrate victory of the anti-Soviet jihad. Indeed,
the Red Army had been defeated and ultimately sent home humiliated
by a volunteer army of religious believers who were disciplined
into a powerful force.
</P>
<P>
   But in the light of the next decade, that ``victory'' would come
into harsh question. The experience of the jihad _ and allying with
one another _ left indelible marks not only on the spirit of the
dying Soviet superpower, but also on the destinies of several
thriving nations.

</P>
<P>
   In August 1990, when Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces invaded
Kuwait, Osama bin Laden was shocked by the decision of King Fahd to
invite Americans to defend the Saudi kingdom. To him, it qualified
as treason.
</P>
<P>
   During the Afghan holy war, bin Laden had worked with Americans
to expel the Soviet ``Great Satan.'' But already he and his
acolytes had begun to prepare for far larger jihads to come _
targeted against impious Arab governments overly beholden to the
corrupt and satanic West.
</P>
<P>
   After the Soviet defeat in 1989, bin Laden left the Afghan
scene, without being drawn into the bloody struggles between rival
clan warlords. He returned to Saudi Arabia to tend to the family
construction business at its Jeddah head office. Reportedly, Prince
Turki bin Faisal al-Saud urged him to keep bankrolling the
mercenary volunteers based in Pakistan _ this to ensure survival of
a mobile strike force that could be used to fight Islamic causes
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   By then, however, the scope of bin Laden's purposes likely very
much exceeded Turki's. Bin Laden was reorienting the training of
men in his Al Qaeda organization to specialize in urban guerrilla
warfare, aimed at destabilizing Western societies and governments.
And he was backing Islamic militants who had begun to challenge the
governments in Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, the Philippines and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Prince Turki reportedly reassured bin Laden that U.S.
troops would all withdraw from the kingdom as soon as Saddam
Hussein was defeated _ and they would not be stationed near the
Muslim holy places.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, when U.S. troops did not entirely leave, bin Laden
revolted against the royal family. Saudi security, already highly
uneasy about his activities, had held onto bin Laden's passport
during the 1989-91 period, hoping to prevent or at least discourage
his contacts with exiled Saudi dissidents, accusing the kingdom of
police corruption and abuse of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, along with a number of Afghan war veterans, bin Laden
moved to Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, and was welcomed by Hassan
al-Turabi, the leader of Sudan's National Islamic Front (NIF).
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1980s, bin Laden and his business associates had
been watching for investment opportunities in Sudan. Now, one of
his companies, Al-Hijrah for Construction and Development, Ltd.,
contracted to build a modern airport for Port Sudan, on the Red
Sea, and a highway link to Khartoum. His trading company, Wadi
al-Aqiq, Ltd., operating with his Taba Investment Co., obtained a
near monopoly over Sudan's main agricultural exports: gum arabica,
corn, and sunflower and sesame products.
</P>
<P>
   So too, his Al-Themar al-Mubarakah Agriculture Co., Ltd.
acquired large tracts of land near Khartoum and in eastern Sudan.
Together with affluent NIF members, bin Laden invested $50 million,
a controlling interest, in an Islamic bank.
</P>
<P>
   His work force included hundreds, perhaps thousands, of militant
veterans of the Afghan ``jihad,'' or holy war. By January 1994,
according to U.S. intelligence reports, bin Laden was financing at
least three guerrilla or terrorist training camps for Egyptian,
Algerian, Tunisian and Palestinian rebels, in cooperation with the
NIF.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his assets and construction projects, bin Laden
helped his hosts by facilitating purchases of Saudi oil for
cash-poor Sudanese at subsidized prices. He took a large house on
Al Mashal Street, in a suburban quarter of Khartoum, located near
the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Following his arrival, messages flowed regularly between
Washington, Riyadh and Khartoum, asking Sudan's opposition leaders
to scale down and end, if possible, bin Laden's support of armed
guerrillas abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 bin Laden began to focus on the ancient and troubled
Arab country of Yemen, his father's birthplace. He began to channel
money, weapons and trained Afghan war veterans into North Yemen,
which was embroiled in a serious territorial dispute with Saudi
Arabia. The Saudi royal regime was supporting the secular-minded
South Yemenis in Aden against the North Yemenis in Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's Yemeni activities during this general period,
according to U.S. government reports, included financing a group of
insurgents who, in December 1992, attempted bombing attacks against
about 100 U.S. servicemen in Aden. The troops were billeted there
to support U.N. relief operations in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's followers began to work with other Saudi dissident
groups against the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia and the
gulf region, and against the Saudi royal family. His followers in
the kingdom would mingle and travel with pilgrims making the
``haj,'' or holy passage, to Mecca and Medina, especially those
returning to Egypt or Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden issued false passports and identity papers, as well as
work contacts, to facilitate travel of the ``Afghanis,'' as the
veterans came to be called. In 1993, for example, he paid for the
travel to Sudan of up to 400 loyal veterans, who were threatened
with a crackdown by Pakistan, now under pressure from Egypt,
Algeria and other countries they were targeting.
</P>
<P>
   A branch of Al Qaeda _ the organization of exiled radical
Islamic leaders bin Laden had founded in the early '80s _ grew up
in Sudan to shelter and accommodate the new immigrants. Bin Laden
continued to finance them and to extend the training many had
already begun in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian intelligence, which had been concentrating on keeping
the Afghanis out, by maintaining tight checks on the Sudanese and
Libyan borders, realized that actually the leaks were coming from
Saudi Arabia. In April 1993, President Mubarak of Egypt made a
special visit to Riyadh to complain about bin Laden's support for
Egyptian subversives.
</P>
<P>
   In the same year, the Peshawar-based Islamic terrorist groups in
Egypt increased their attacks on policemen, judges, Coptic
Christians, foreign tourists and other human targets. At the end of
May 1993, the Egyptian Interior Ministry, announcing the arrest of
more than 800 suspects and the dismantling of a major terrorist
network, added that bin Laden was financing a new group called
``Belonging to the Jihad.''
</P>
<P>
   In another investigation, conducted with the Saudi authorities,
the Egyptians disclosed that the bin Laden companies were
channeling money to Egyptian rebels to buy printing presses,
weapons and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Saudi royal family decided to yield to the urgent
strictures of President Mubarak and the Americans. On April 7,
1994, after a special visit by President Mubarak to complain about
bin Laden to King Fahd, and a reported request to Interpol, the
International Police Organization, by Yemen for assistance in
apprehending bin Laden, the Saudi royal family went public.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah clearly proclaimed that hard-core Islamic
elements, preaching violence and linked to Egypt's covert groups,
were no longer welcome. King Fahd announced that bin Laden was
being stripped of citizenship ``because of his irresponsible
behavior that contradicts the interests of Saudi Arabia and harms
sisterly countries, and his refusal to obey instructions issued to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 9, 1994, Youssef M. Ibrahim of The New York Times
reported that Saudi officials had also moved to freeze bin Laden's
assets inside the kingdom, though he was ``believed to control
millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts.'' The Times' report
added that the decision against bin Laden appeared to signal to
other less visible Saudi financial tycoons to cut their ties with
militants in Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Such support, Ibrahim wrote, frequently takes the guise of
Islamic charity works, the building of mosques or the starting of
businesses that are used as channels to pump money into the
militants' war chests.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these funds, already flowing into Pakistan and
Afghanistan since the decade of the jihad, were still being used as
late as 1997 to finance the terrorist and guerrilla training camps
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after King Fahd's action against bin Laden, some
newsmen covering the Middle East, including the author, received a
fax message originating in London. It announced that Mr. Osama bin
Laden had opened an office there. The fax bore his signature in
English and Arabic, and that of a man designated in London as his
office manager.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, bin Laden was linked to the ``Committee for Advice
and Reform,'' a London-based Saudi opposition network which, in the
later 1990s, issued more than 1,000 pamphlets and tracts attacking
the royal government and the House of Saud, often in violent terms.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden never publicly responded to the condemnation by his
eldest brother, Bakr bin Laden, who expressed in the Saudi media
his family's ``regret, denunciation and condemnation'' of his
younger brother's extremist activities.
</P>
<P>
   Until forced to depart from Sudan under American and Saudi
pressure in 1996, bin Laden expanded his wealth and global network
of political, banking and terrorist contacts.

</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, the U.S. State Department issued a
standard and rather tardy fact sheet on Osama bin Laden. It
provided many interesting details about his career as a master of
Islamic extremism and anti-American terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But it omitted the background facts that help to explain his
early and close connections to the United States, which had
enlisted his talents and fortune to aid the attack on Communist
invaders in the Afghan holy war.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, bin Laden met with at least four senior
radical Islamic leaders: Ayman el-Zawahri, chief of Egypt's
Al-Gihad; Abdul Salem Mohammed, chief of an extremist group in
Bangladesh; Fadi Errahmane Khalil, emir of the Pakistani Harakat
Ansar; and the Egyptian exile Abu Yassir Ahmed Taha, representing
Islamic groups in Arab North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   These men and some aides set up an ``International Islamic
Struggle Front'' dedicated to fighting ``the Jews'' _ i.e., Israel
and all its friends and allies. They issued a ``fatwa,'' or death
sentence, declaring it to be legitimate to kill any American,
civilian or military.
</P>
<P>
   That spring, a horrified Prince Turki bin Faisal al-Saud, a
close boyhood friend of bin Laden, flew to Afghanistan to see
Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban chief. He asked Omar to arrange a
meeting with bin Laden, who was installed near the village of
Khost, by the Pakistan border. There, Prince Turki reminded bin
Laden that although he had been deprived of Saudi citizenship, no
steps had been taken against his family in Saudi Arabia, and surely
it was time for a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   But the prince returned to Riyadh empty-handed, except for the
assurance from Omar that he would try to calm his guest. Indeed,
bin Laden offered to leave Afghanistan, if his presence was
bothering the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' Omar is said to have responded. ``You are one of us,
and you will stay with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the real assault on America would begin. On
the morning of Aug. 7, 1998, truck bombs devastated the area around
the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
The bombs killed 224 people and injured more than 4,500. As the
world watched, the injured lay traumatized by shock, in pools of
blood. Nairobi's hospitals were crammed beyond capacity with
emergency cases: men, women and children, blinded, and mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, which were perceived almost immediately to bear the
signature of Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda organization, founded
in Afghanistan in the early '80s, should not have been a surprise
to the U.S. intelligence establishment.
</P>
<P>
   A few insiders and some journalists had noted a warning that was
broadcast widely only about 24 hours before the attacks. It was not
signed by bin Laden, or Al Qaeda, or the ``International Islamic
Struggle Front,'' created months earlier for the purpose of an
anti-American jihad.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Egypt's Al-Gihad, the extremist organization
responsible for President Anwar al-Sadat's murder in 1981 and much
terrorism inside Egypt, cautioned that it was about to take
reprisals against the United States. The reason, it said, was that
the CIA had aided in the arrest in Albania of several Egyptian
Islamic militants, some of whom were already condemned to death.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, where President Clinton was under heavy fire for
his affair with a former White House intern and perjury accusations
against him by independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr, the U.S.
administration was suddenly galvanized.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 FBI agents and other intelligence teams and
military units, including medical rescue teams, and even Israeli
troops from Israel, were airborne for East Africa within hours.
Reports were coming in of threats to other U.S. embassies,
including those in Kampala and Tirana, Albania. Later, these and a
number of other U.S. diplomatic missions were temporarily
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few days, two suspects, a naturalized Kenyan of
Palestinian birth named Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohammed Rashed
Daoud al-Owhali, a Yemeni, were apprehended. Odeh was arrested in
Pakistan after flying out of Nairobi, and was returned quickly
after confessing a degree of guilt to Pakistani police. Al-Owhali
was seized in Kenya. Both were packed off in handcuffs on military
aircraft to New York, where they were charged with murder,
complicity in murder, use of munitions of massive power and
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Also soon arrested was Abdullah Mohammed Fadhul, from the
Comoros, a republic of islands off East Africa. He, as did the
others, admitted belonging to bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the Aug. 7 bombings, Clinton summoned his national
security advisor, Sandy Berger, and called back from Italy
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had been attending the
gala wedding of CNN's chief international correspondent, Christiane
Amanpour, and State Department spokesman James Rubin. Defense
Secretary William Cohen, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. Hugh
Shelton, and the latest of a long series of rapidly changing CIA
directors, George Tenet, were also called to join the crisis
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Clinton decided to strike back at two places
regarded as strongholds of bin Laden, implicated as the originator
of the embassy attacks by the suspect Odeh. The first strike would
be in Afghanistan, where bin Laden was in the protective custody of
the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   It was decided not to risk any American personnel or aircraft,
but to use the weapon already fired against Saddam Hussein in Iraq
during the Persian Gulf War: the remotely-guided Tomahawk cruise
missile.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 would be launched, from U.S. Navy ships in the Red Sea
and the Indian Ocean, at three of bin Laden's camps near Khost.
There was a base camp, a support camp and a terrorist training
camp, all named Zhawar Kili Al-Badr, arranged in a rough isosceles
triangle a few miles inside Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Eerily, these were some of the same facilities planned and
designed by the CIA and Pakistan's Interservices Intelligence
Directorate (ISI) to be used for training the holy warriors back in
the Afghan war.
</P>
<P>
   The second target for the missiles was the al-Shifa
pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, Sudan. Administration spokesmen
claimed they had firm evidence it was under bin Laden's influence,
if not financial control. They said it was cooperating with the
Iraqi chemical-weapons program and producing ethyl
methylphosphothionate, an important ingredient of VX nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   Codenamed ``Infinite Reach,'' the cruise-missile strike was
launched on Aug. 20, with varied reports back about the casualties
and damage. According to Taliban accounts, about 20 guerrilla
fighters were killed in the camps, not including bin Laden, who was
absent.
</P>
<P>
   Some Washington sources said the United States was aware of his
absence, through its overhead satellite surveillance and electronic
monitoring of his radio-telephone traffic. Many agreed that a dead
bin Laden would be far more dangerous, rising to the status of a
martyr and stirring supporters to more frenzied acts of vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   After the al-Shifa raid, Sudan's government and the factory
owners unanimously and vehemently denied that the plant was used to
manufacture anything other than prescription medicines, vitamins
and other pharmaceuticals badly needed in Sudan's impoverished
society. They also denied that bin Laden had a controlling
financial interest in the plant.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later The New York Times, The Washington Post and
some Washington officials who had fed them news leaks began to back
off the story. They acknowledged that a dreadful error might have
been made in the attack on Khartoum, although Washington staunchly
resisted Sudan's demand for an on-the-spot investigation by U.N.
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1999, Salih Idris, the Saudi businessman who
owned the al-Shifa plant, was suing the U.S. government in the
Federal Court of Claims for $30 million in compensation for
destruction of his property.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, by late July, 17 people had been charged with roles
in the embassy bombings. Five were being held in New York for
trial; three in Britain; nine, including bin Laden, were fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, was extradited from
Germany to the United States, and charged with murder, conspiracy
and use of a weapon of mass destruction. Salim's arrest added a
nuclear aspect to the pattern of international conspiracy being
woven around bin Laden. Salim, described as a founding member of Al
Qaeda, was arrested on Sept. 16 at a car dealership outside Munich
on a tip from Interpol in Washington. He was identified as a
financial advisor and weapons procurer for bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   According to New York court documents, a group including Salim
had tried to obtain components for nuclear weapons, including
enriched uranium, to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   It also emerged that the bin Laden organization apparently had
tentacles into the U.S. armed forces. A former Army sergeant, Ali
A. Mohamed, was secretly arrested in September and held in the
Manhattan Metropolitan Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ali left the U.S. Army after a three-year term in 1989. He had
earned a Parachute Badge and an expert M-16 rifleman's badge, and
taught soldiers in the U.S. Special Forces at Fort Bragg, N.C.,

   On July 12, 1999, Ibrahim Hussein Eidarous, 42, and Adel
Mohammed Abdul Bary, 39 _ two of bin Laden's Egyptian followers _
were rounded up and appeared in court in London. A British
magistrate said originals of faxes to three news organizations,
which claimed responsibility for the embassy blasts and bore the
men's fingerprints, were found at the London offices of a Saudi
dissident group.

   Another suspect arrested in London, Khalid al-Fawwaz, a Saudi

   By now, Clinton administration officials have ordered special

   On July 30, 1999, the Afghan Islamic News Agency announced that
bin Laden, who was said to fear a Pakistan-based raid by U.S.
commando troops to capture or kill him, would leave Afghanistan for
any friendly Muslim country that would receive him.
</P>
<P>
   The question facing the world was: What ruler or government
would be intrepid enough to offer protection or asylum to such a
dangerous guest?

</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 3, 1998, a month after the U.S. Embassy bombings in
East Africa, FBI director Louis J. Freeh gave, in congressional
testimony, both a retrospective and a preview of official U.S.
government views about the Afghan war veterans' terrorist assault
against America.
</P>
<P>
   As lead anti-terrorist agency since 1995, the FBI was now
actively working with its new Counterterrorism Center, and a number
of other U.S. military and civilian intelligence and security
agencies, in a new permanent consultative committee operating under
tight security wraps in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Freeh cited the trend in anti-American
terrorist attacks ``toward large-scale incidents designed for
maximum destruction, terror and impact.'' He recalled how the
threat of ``jihad'' in America had finally been made real by the
February 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that although there were no American victims in the
November '97 attack on foreign tourists at the Temple of Luxor, in
Egypt, still there were signs that the assault was meant to force
the release of the blind cleric, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, from
prison in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh recalled that Rahman and his associates, aside from a role
in plotting the World Trade Center bombing, had been convicted in
1995 for plotting to murder President Mubarak during a visit to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The same group was caught red-handed mixing fertilizer and fuel
oil _ one of the old reliable recipes from the CIA manuals for
training in Afghanistan _ to make a lethal, do-it-yourself,
home-grown bomb of great power. Their goal was to destroy United
Nations buildings, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels and police and
FBI headquarters, among other targets in New York. Freeh might have
added, but didn't, that they also had discussed assassinating some
leading pro-Israel congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh also failed to mention the Afghanistan connection, a
subject generally taboo. Indeed, during a 1993 television
broadcast, New York's regional FBI director, Robert Fox, had
mentioned the CIA's earlier training of several of the World Trade
Center bombers _ and, by coincidence, found himself transferred
several weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   As for missions inside the United States, Freeh dealt with
another category of terrorism _ by ``autonomous, generally
transnational'' organizations. These have their own personnel,
financing and training facilities and are able to plan and mount
operations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh noted that Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezbollah (the Party of
God), Egypt's al-Gania'a and the Palestinian Hamas all had
supporters within the United States. Hezbollah, he recalled, had
been behind the 1983 truck bombings of the U.S. Embassy and Marine
barracks in Lebanon and the bombing of a second U.S. Embassy in
East Beirut in 1984, as well as detention of U.S. hostages in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's next category of terrorism was ``locally affiliated,''
although global in scope. Such terrorists might pose, Freeh said,
the most urgent threat because they ``are often organized on an ad
hoc, temporary basis, making them difficult for law enforcement to
infiltrate or track. They can also exploit the mobility that
technology and the lack of a rigorous base structure offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, Freeh recalled, the FBI had investigated
leading ``extra-territorial'' cases of terrorism. These included
the June 25, 1996 truck-bombing of the U.S. servicemen's Khobar
Towers apartment complex in Saudi Arabia and, finally, the East
African bombings of August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Khobar Towers truck-bombing, which killed 19 American airmen
and wounded about 500 people, forced the relocation of Air Force
personnel still living there, in their capacity to service
overflights of Iraq and other air operations, from the Saudi
Dhahran Air Base to distant al-Kharj.
</P>
<P>
   That case remains unsolved. However, the Saudis executed four
men, who confessed to blowing up a Saudi-U.S. joint military office
facility in Riyadh on Nov. 13, 1995, killing three U.S. civilians
and two soldiers, and wounding about 60 other people including
civilian passers-by. Three of the four executed culprits, the
Saudis announced, had confessed their adherence to Osama bin
Laden's network.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh also referred to terrorist ``renditions,'' by which he
meant those captured abroad and returned to the United States for
trial. He cited the case of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, an Afghan war
veteran, who ordered the chemicals for the World Trade Center
Bombing. Yousef was seized in a bin Laden-owned hotel in Pakistan
by U.S. and Pakistani agents. On Feb. 7, 1995, he was extradited to
New York for trial and later sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh also cited the case of Mir Amal Kansi, 33, yet another
Afghan war veteran, who shot and killed two CIA employees outside
CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., a month before the World Trade
Center bombing. Tracked down by the FBI and probably other U.S.
services, Kansi was seized in Pakistan _ touching off reprisal
killings of several Americans in Karachi a short time later. He was
flown to the United States for trial on June 17, 1995 and sentenced
to death in Virginia, the scene of his crime. Kansi's case was
pending appeal in late July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, having finally recognized the threat
of the ``Afghanis'' _ or what some prefer to call the ``blowback''
of U.S. involvement in the Afghan war _ moved to appoint a new
anti-terrorism ``czar'' in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In early September 1998, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
swore in William Crowe, the former ambassador to Britain, as
chairman of two Accountability Review Boards, loaded with senior
specialists in anti-terrorism, to investigate the embassy bombings.
In a report he and Albright publicized on Jan. 8, 1999, Crowe found
no fault with U.S. security personnel, but said the United States
was correcting serious security deficiencies at U.S. embassies
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government of Pakistan, through whose airspace
the attacking U.S. Tomahawk missiles had passed on Aug. 20, fired
its intelligence chief. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government
had lost face by having to retract a false report that at least one
missile landed near a Pakistani nuclear site.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the blowback from Afghanistan was the
financing of the jihad, and its export, by the cultivation,
processing and traffic of drugs. By the late 1990s, a vast tide of
drugs flowing out of Afghanistan and Pakistan to Europe, the
Americas and the Far East _ opium, morphine base and even refined
heroin, to say nothing of marijuana in various forms _ had reached
truly epic proportions. Its impact was felt from the inner cities
of America and Europe to the once-rich ``Tiger'' economies of the
Far East, as well as in the former Soviet republics of Central Asia
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the victorious Afghan leaders, who turned to
slaughtering one another after the Soviet withdrawal, had built a
huge international drug network in the 1980s. This turned the
opium-producing Golden Crescent countries _ Afghanistan, Iran and
Pakistan _ into an Aladdin's cave of riches.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the expanding wealth helped to finance guerrilla wars and
terrorist actions in Algeria, Bosnia, Egypt, Kashmir, the
Philippines and other places. Second, it assured a handful of the
post-1990 terrorist leaders _ the generals and tycoons of world
terrorism _ that they'd have fabulous incomes and luxurious
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the sale and resale of U.S.-made weapons, from
rifles to Stinger missiles, and other commodities of all
descriptions, initially sent free to the Afghan holy warriors via
their Pakistani sponsors, but often reaching private arms dealers.
</P>
<P>
   American weapons and munitions were diverted and abused on a
massive scale _ sold to raise funds for insurgents' field supplies,
or simply for personal profit. Even casual visitors to the bazaars
in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier province keep finding these
weapons, for sale to any buyer with the necessary cash.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, rather than creating gratitude, the American
support for the war in Afghanistan led to aroused hatred toward
U.S. policies and fueled the assault on America led by bin Laden
and his disciples. The holy alliance of the Americans and the
Islamic forces against the Soviets would precede a series of unholy
wars and epidemics of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-fated Soviet invasion of 1979 would be one final error
of a dying superpower. It gave America an opening for a crusade,
conducted by Muslim mercenaries who then turned on their
benefactors and employers. But tragically, the world will continue
to experience this blowback well into the 21st century. And there
will be devastating consequences for world peace.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps future governments, whether in the United States, Great
Britain, Russia or less powerful nations, will take to heart an
important lesson of late-20th-century history: When you decide to
go to war against your main enemy, take a good look at the allies,
friends or mercenary fighters behind you. Look well to see whether
they already have unsheathed their knives _ and are pointing them
at your back.

A KILLER'S DEMAND FOR ENTITLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While the current national obsession with
getting rich did not cause Mark Orrin Barton to murder his family
and nine Atlanta strangers, psychologist Michael Mantell says it
provided a perfect '90s backdrop for Barton's expression of an
increasingly common psychotic rage.
</P>
<P>
   In the scores of explosive violence cases that Mantell has
studied since 1984 _ when a man named James Huberty gunned down 21
people at a McDonald's in San Ysidro, Calif. _ there were always
three out-of-proportion perceptions held by the murderer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense,'' said the San Diego psychologist, ``that he
is entitled, that he deserves more, and that he should get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Huberty, who targeted Hispanics, blamed immigrants for his
inability to get a job. Barton, the latest self-inducted member of
the mass murderers hall of shame, appears to have viewed himself as
a victim of all manner of forces.
</P>
<P>
   A chemist-turned-day trader in stocks, he seems to have seen
himself as a man who was entitled only to make, not lose, money;
who deserved to have his mistreated wife in her place, not
estranged, and who had a right to avenge his ``victimization.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a letter he left in his family's suburban Atlanta
home, Barton shot the office workers in two investment trading
firms because he saw them as ``the people that greedily sought my
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   His second wife was killed because she ``was one of the main
reasons for my demise.'' (The children, as they so often end up in
domestic homicides, were the ultimate innocent bystanders, little
lives to be dispatched in a mad tidying-up mission: Barton didn't
want them to have to live without parents.) The author of ``Ticking
Bombs: Defusing Violence in the Workplace,'' Mantell said: ``I
think what's captured people's attention with this (Barton) story
is the day-trading aspect. Workplace violence has become a ho-hum
story; it doesn't make the front page anymore. What's sexy about
this is the day trading.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, that aspect may make Barton's rampage look
primarily like ``a story about greed'' and the growing societal
pressures to acquire great wealth as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go back 40 or 50 years, people reached the middle class
and they were thrilled,'' Mantell said. ``Today, you don't hear
anybody say, `Hey, I'm paying my bills, I'm happy.' To be in the
middle class is no longer an acceptable thing. This is the '90s,
now it's, `I should be getting richer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, part of Barton's perceived victimization, his sense of
disentitlement. But much darker forces prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a psychotic mind, not just a person saying, `I wish I
could drive a Mercedes.' He was a man who had a long break (with
reality) that was impacting itself for more than a year,'' Mantell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Barton's outward image may have been _ he went to
church, ran a Boy Scout troop _ ``those are just externals'' that
have little effect on deranged people's ultimate actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The powerful thing that is going on is this incredible
narcissism _ I'm entitled, I deserve, I should _ and this internal
despair. The mind just unravels, and nobody sees it.''
</P>
<P>
   That last part, in Mantell's opinion, is a direct sign of ``the
failure of the mental health system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more and more of these kinds of people walking
around,'' he said. ``But we don't see them until they do something
like he (Barton) did. It's like we are sending out rowboats instead
of ships or aircraft carriers to pick up what's floating around in
this ocean of madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time it's the stock market. Who knows what it will be for
the next one?''

WHEN A DIET OF BEEFSTEAK MEANT POLITICAL FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It was about this time of year, maybe a dozen
years ago. I was near New York's Capitol building when I bumped
into Dick Conners, then the state assemblyman representing most of
the city of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Conners was a jovial guy who loved to tell stories. He and
another old-timer were reminiscing about a beefsteak they'd once
attended in Saratoga Springs, during the racing season, many years
before.
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``You guys went to a beefsteak? I thought a beefsteak is
something you eat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a thing you went to, too,'' Conners explained.
``And you got plenty of beefsteak at a beefsteak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And plenty of beer,'' the other old-timer said wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beefsteak and beer,'' the assemblyman told me. ``That was the
point.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, I wasn't sure precisely what these guys were
talking about. Then, not long ago, I came across an old piece from
the New Yorker magazine. It was published in 1939 by Joseph
Mitchell, one of the magazine's most gifted writers in its glory
days.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was writing about the decline of the beefsteak, which
he described as ``a form of gluttony as stylized and regional as
the riverbank fish fry, the hot-rock clambake, or the Texas
barbecue.''
</P>
<P>
   The beefsteak, Mitchell explained, had its roots in late
19th-century Manhattan. It had begun its decline the moment women
got the vote and the process of democracy required female admission
to these uniquely male-oriented political fund-raising banquets.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mitchell, when Conners and his pal were young men,
you got your money's worth at any beefsteak thrown as a political
fund-raiser. For five bucks, the usual pre-war price of admission,
it was rare for any diner at a beefsteak to consume less than six
pounds of grilled, sliced steak and 30 glasses of beer.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't count the hamburgers and crabmeat salad that served
as appetizers, nor the slices of day-old bread on which the steaks
were served. Empty beer barrels groaned beneath the weight of glass
bowls of radishes and sliced Bermuda onions. Bands played raucously
as diners warmed up on olives and scallions.
</P>
<P>
   A butcher who prepared the meat for these affairs told Mitchell
that the primary fare at a classic beefsteak was always the ``short
loin without the filet.'' Specially trained chefs would douse it
with a sauce of meat drippings, butter and Worcestershire sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb chops and lamb kidneys wrapped in bacon were served on the
side. No potatoes. They were deemed too filling.
</P>
<P>
   At a classic beefsteak, Mitchell reported, you found no
silverware, either. Nor were tablecloths or napkins in evidence.
Tarps were placed on the floor beneath the dining tables while men
ate with their hands, wiping away the grease on butcher's aprons
they were issued upon coughing up their five bucks. Sometimes, at
the end of the dinner, waiters had to forcibly remove the aprons
from the rowdier drunks.
</P>
<P>
   Beefsteak Tom McGowan, Mitchell reported, was Tammany Hall's
organizer of these affairs. For his trouble, he had what apparently
was a no-show job at the city water board. When Beefsteak Tom died,
1,000 tearful mourners followed his hearse to a Brooklyn cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The beefsteak faded away totally when World War II broke out and
never returned as a fixture of New York political life. Today,
political fund-raisers tend to be cocktail parties, with pigs in a
blanket, or picnics or coffee klatches. Or, on special occasions,
catered dinners at hotels featuring wussy stuffed chicken breasts.
</P>
<P>
   They always involve silverware or, at least, plastic knives and
forks, and not a butcher's apron in sight. As the political process
has gotten messier, New York fund-raising affairs have gotten
neater.
</P>
<P>
   And, it would seem, a lot less fun.

THE REAL VICTIMS OF ABUSE: THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I'm having recovered memories of Barbara Bush.
She'd never do this to us. She'd never tell us that childhood abuse
led George to do ... well, whatever he did.
</P>
<P>
   Barf sashimi in the lap of the Japanese prime minister? Succumb
to right-wingers on the abortion issue? Use sentence fragments?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton wants to be a senator so bad she's going after
the Redbook magazine vote. She's inflicting smarmy pop-psychology
on the nation, portraying the president as weak because of bad
things that happened to him as a 4-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   She's blaming his infidelity on two dead women, Clinton's mother
and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Some feminist. Some sanctimony. Hillary Clinton even compares
herself to Christ.
</P>
<P>
   In her interview with Talk magazine, Hillary Clinton was asked
if a Biblical passage about ``love endures all'' applied to why she
stood by her man. ``I was thinking of when Peter betrayed Jesus
three times and Jesus knew it but loved him anyway,'' Hillary
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus, indeed. Hillary Clinton should stand by her man's request
for privacy in their marriage. It's bad enough that every media
outlet in the world has been peeping into their lives, but now
Hillary Clinton is telling us much more than we want to know about
the president.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to know about the president's traumas as a
4-year-old. I'm tired of his traumas as a teen-ager, a stage he
seems to have been stuck in for 35 years. I just want the Clintons
to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Want to talk abuse? Here's how Bill and Hillary Clinton,
co-presidents and co-dependents, have abused the nation for the
last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   They've particularly abused liberals. Real liberals were forced
to be ``classic enablers,'' to use pop-psych jargon, by fighting
the impeachment of this fake-liberal president who continually lied
to them and let them down.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons supported the 1996 welfare reform bill, which,
among other things, canceled financial support for disabled
children of poor parents. Don't talk to us about child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons have championed restrictions on freedom of speech,
such as the Communications Decency Act, which the courts slapped
down. The Clintons aren't big on civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, the so-called feminist liberal, has backed
restrictions on divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons failed to stand by their gay supporters on the
issue of gays in the military. Wouldn't it be nice if ``Don't ask,
don't tell'' applied to heterosexual sex in the White House, as
well as making psychobabble excuses? Or how about a policy of
``Shut up, shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   National health care flopped big-time under the leadership of
Hillary Clinton. Think about that every time your managed care
provider won't give you a referral.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons gave us a fake conversation on race that never
wandered into the dangerous topic of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest conversation we got was about the president and his
dalliances with Monica Lewinsky. That's largely the fault of the
media _ and Bill Clinton's mother and grandmother, we learn.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hillary Clinton has given us the president as victim. Not
just as a grown politician suffering a right-wing conspiracy, but
as 4-year-old Li'l Bubba.
</P>
<P>
   Aw. That Hillary. She does love those children, even though she
wouldn't mind seeing 14-year-olds tried as adults and juveniles
housed with adults in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the most notable things in the latest Senate crime
bill tacitly supported by the Clintons, but you may have missed
them because Bill and Hillary Clinton were crowing about minor
gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons support the death penalty. The president supported
it so much, or what it could do for him politically, that before
the 1992 election he made a point of leaving the campaign trail to
be in Arkansas for the execution of a brain-damaged cop killer.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Governor Clinton certainly wouldn't have granted clemency
to a murderer just for having been abused as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans, liberal and conservative, are plain tired of
hearing excuses based on childhood trauma. They're just another
version of the old 1950s interpretation of Freud, in which
everything could be blamed on mother _ or mother and grandmother,
in the Clintons' case.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to Hillary Clinton, she did say that her husband is
responsible for his own behavior, her pronouns shifting faster than
her husband's positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the confrontation with the person, and then it is
their responsibility,'' she said. ``Nobody can do it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as I wish we didn't know a thing about the Clintons'
private lives, I'd like to have been a fly on the wall, dodging
lamps, during that confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine Clinton trying to excuse his catting around by
something that happened to him when he was 4? It's lamer than ``I
had to stay late at work.''
</P>
<P>
   If New Yorkers buy it, we have a bridge to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   If you need a victim, forget Hillary or Bill Clinton. Al Gore is
the victim, ignored and abused because of the two of them.

CBS HEARS WAKE-UP CALL ON MORNING TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ You wouldn't know it by watching Charles
Gibson and Diane Sawyer on screen, but shooting ``Good Morning
America,'' especially on location, is controlled chaos.
</P>
<P>
   A monitor failed. Lighting and microphones had to be adjusted or
fixed on the fly. Technicians dashed around in the pre-dawn hours
last Wednesday at the Ritz Carlton Huntington Hotel &AMP; Spa,
repositioning cameras and sections of miles of cable. Yet it all
came together, glitches ironed out, sort of a ballet with duct
tape. From behind the scenes, at least at 4 a.m., it definitely
looked tricky.
</P>
<P>
   And morning television is about to get trickier, and maybe a
whole lot more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the morning sandbox belonged to NBC and its
dominant ``Today'' show. Then ABC successfully brought Gibson and
Sawyer back to morning television and the moribund ``GMA'' on a
temporary basis. That basis has shifted into the realm of
indefinitely interim; what is definite are plans to move the show
into a street-front Times Square studio on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Coming Nov. 1, CBS enters the game with a new morning offering,
``CBS News' The Early Show,'' which replaces ``CBS This Morning,''
starring an old-time host, Bryant Gumbel.
</P>
<P>
   Like its competitors, ``The Early Show'' will have a
street-front studio (at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street in New York) _
``the cost of admission,'' Gumbel calls it _ in its bid to be a
serious player in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrific time to be making a big investment, given that
the morning day part (non-prime time) is a hotly contested, lively
arena with plenty of room, certainly, for us to do better,'' CBS
news president Andrew Heyward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bizarre to me that the cycle has never turned in
CBS' favor. This time we're going to do it right, and this time
we're going to make a difference in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel, who spent 15 years the host of ``Today,'' came to CBS to
do the magazine ``Public Eye.'' After it failed miserably, he was
sort of a minister without portfolio, until CBS decided to get
serious about its train wreck of a morning show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of putting a credible team on the field of
play,'' Gumbel said. ``CBS has never made the mornings a priority.
They always kind of backed into it. If something didn't work for a
week, they changed it the next week.'' ``GMA'' executive producer
Shelley Ross said her show is not about ``real estate,'' but the
rush to replicate the concept of ``Today's'' streetfront studio,
and the millions in costs attached, is indicative that both ABC and
CBS will at least not cede morning dominance to the Peacock.
</P>
<P>
   But a concern for ABC is that if it's not careful in chasing
NBC, CBS will come up on its heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no secret, I guess, about he fact that `Good Morning
America' was misfiring, and I was worried about the strength of the
franchise,'' Gibson said of his decision to return to the show.
``So when questions come to Shelly (executive producer Shelley
Ross) about how is the arrival of Bryant going to change things, I
think it's terrific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think its an acknowledgment by all three of the major
commercial networks that morning television is important.''
</P>
<P>
   And there will be more shaking up. How long will Gibson and
Sawyer stay on before ABC finishes its indeterminate process of
grooming successors? Who will be Gumbel's co-host at the conclusion
of a search CBS has dubbed ``Operation Glass Slipper''?
</P>
<P>
   Tricky questions.

EX-STOCK ANALYST SOUGHT IN INSIDER TRADING DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A former Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.
analyst accused of engaging in a year-long insider-trading scheme
fled before securities regulators and FBI agents could arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   The fugitive, Brett S. Henderson, 25, of San Francisco, escaped
out the back of his girlfriend's house as the agents approached the
home Monday, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have arrested his friend, Richard F. Randall,
27, a high school teacher in Urbana, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco, the two men are accused of conspiracy to engage in
insider trading, said Leslie Caldwell, the U.S. attorney's chief of
economic crimes. If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of five
years in prison and fines of up to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   A civil complaint filed in the same court by the Securities and
Exchange Commission charges Henderson and Randall with illegal
insider trading. The complaint seeks the return of their trading
profits and penalties of up to three times their profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young men began their professional careers by taking
calculated advantage of access to highly confidential information
for their own financial benefit,'' said Helane Morrison, the SEC
enforcement chief in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson used pay telephones and disposable calling cards to
tip off Randall with confidential information on upcoming corporate
mergers involving technology companies that were clients of Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, according to the court filings.
</P>
<P>
   Trading stocks and options, they invested $310,000 and cleared
$54,000 in profits on mergers involving Abacus Direct Corp.,
Broadcom Corp., Egghead.com Inc., Sequent Computer Systems Inc.,
Xylan Corp. and other companies, the complaints allege.
</P>
<P>
   In November, for instance, Henderson overheard conversations
among Morgan Stanley co-workers that America Online Inc. was about
to buy Netscape Communications Corp., according to the court
documents. Henderson allegedly leaked the information to Randall,
who bought 350 shares of Netscape at $28 per share.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the news media reported that AOL and Netscape were
in merger talks. Netscape's stock jumped 34 percent, and Randall
sold his shares at $43.75 for a $5,512 profit, according to the
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged scheme fell apart after an employee in Morgan
Stanley's Menlo Park office, where Henderson worked, found an
on-line brokerage account statement in the name of Randall on a
photocopy machine, according to an affidavit signed by FBI agent
Clayton Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The employee grew suspicious because the transactions
highlighted on the brokerage statement all involved Morgan
Stanley's corporate clients or acquisition targets, the affidavit
states.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was fired last month. Morgan Stanley reported the
activities to the SEC.

TURNING DREAMS INTO REALITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some travelers prefer budget motels for overnight
accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Others splurge for Ritz-Carltons and Four Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those who luxuriate at Mick Jagger's vacation
retreat on the private Caribbean island of Mustique, at Jane
Seymour's castle in England or in an Acapulco mansion staffed by a
butler, chef and housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people design homes; I design experiences,'' says
Houstonian Gregory Patrick, whose Tours of Enchantment eschews
traditional lodging and instead pampers clients in any of 650
private residences around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick's mantra: The more elaborate a traveler's request, the
more exciting his challenge. ``Our service is limited only by your
imagination,'' he says. ``I'm not a travel agent. I've never sold
the same experience twice; I may use some of the same elements, but
I never just pull something off the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the client's whim _ and bankroll _ accommodations
are only part of the service.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: A gentleman determined that his mother would
celebrate her 75th birthday in grand style.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EXTRA-SPECIAL TOUCHES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arranging limousines, a police escort and private lodging in a
palatial Florida home was routine. ``Then, when she arrived, a
white gate opened and an 80-piece local high school band was lined
up in the walkway waiting to play for her,'' Patrick says. ``It
wasn't difficult to arrange; I just struck a deal to have their
uniforms cleaned.''
</P>
<P>
   But, wait. There's more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chartered a 60-foot yacht, and a vintage plane flew
overhead, carrying a banner that read, `Happy birthday, Mother,'
and dive-bombed hundreds of red roses onto the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we rented a little private island between the U.S. and
Cuba, transported the birthday party in on seaplanes and catered a
white-jacket dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so most of us can't afford to rent islands and dive bomb
roses onto yachts.
</P>
<P>
   But we can dream.
</P>
<P>
   And, Patrick says, ``We can custom-design an experience for as
little as $1,500 per person for three or four nights in Acapulco.''
</P>
<P>
   Most customers are corporate executives eager to impress their
clients or willing to reward employees through incentive programs.
But Patrick says more and more individuals invest in that one
special vacation experience we've always fantasized about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest trend we're seeing is a need to slow down and get
some enjoyment out of life,'' he says. ``There are more e-mails and
voice mails than we can handle. Even when we get away, airplanes
and hotels are crowded. People don't want that; they want to be
pampered.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DEMAND FOR LUXURY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The marketplace bears him out. Room occupancy at mainstream
luxury hotels is the highest in the industry. Upscale tour firms
such as Abercrombie &AMP; Kent do thriving business. St. Louis-based
Intrav fills private jets for around-the-world excursions several
times each year _ 24-day adventures utilizing a Concorde depart in
September and October and cost $59,500 per person.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth, Texas--based API Travel Consultants, a network of
222 independent luxury-oriented travel agents, reports annual sales
of more than $2 billion, with upscale and expedition cruises and
adventure travel the hottest trends among affluent travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Tours of Enchantment, a division of Houston-based Retention
Resources, aims to personalize luxury vacations. A ninth-grade
dropout, the 36-year-old Patrick says, ``I travel six to seven
months each year, meeting people and making arrangements to have
butlers and chefs available whenever we need them. With every
chateau we utilize in Europe, we work directly with the owners.''
</P>
<P>
   One bittersweet accomplishment: arranging for a group of clients
to stay at Princess Diana's family home, Althorp Castle, 11 days
before her death.
</P>
<P>
   The best bet for a traveler who craves just a rare taste of
luxury? ``Consider a private villa in Acapulco,'' Patrick says.
``You'd have a private staff of servants, and if you want to be
guaranteed three days of good weather, Acapulco is the place.''

COLUMNIST REASSIGNED OVER APPARENT STOCK CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The writer of a popular column on Silicon Valley
was reassigned by the San Jose Mercury News after a report that she
profited from a stock deal involving an Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Nolan, who wrote the ``Talk Is Cheap'' column, has been
moved to general reporting duties, according to sources within the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan, who has vowed to fight the reassignment, was suspended
two weeks ago after the Wall Street Journal revealed she had
privately invested in and profited from the initial public offering
of AutoWeb.Com, a Santa Clara-based company.
</P>
<P>
   David Yarnold, the executive editor of the Mercury News, wrote
Sunday that the deal could create a conflict of interest between a
news source, an executive at Auto Web, and Nolan that would be
``too cozy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Chris enjoyed a benefit not available to the
public at large _ one provided by a news source _ violated a
cardinal rule of journalism,'' Yarnold wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said she had informed her editors early on about the
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Nolan's supervisors also were disciplined. Burt Robinson,
Nolan's immediate supervisor at the time of the investment,
received a two-day suspension. Peter Hillan, the newspaper's
executive business editor, received a letter of reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said she ``obviously disagrees'' with Yarnold over the
conflict charges. She said she would consult with union
arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my column back,'' Nolan said.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement last Wednesday, Yarnold said Nolan had ``at a
minimum created the appearance of a conflict of interest for
herself and the Mercury News, and she failed to exercise a
reasonable level of professional responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported that Nolan earned $9,000 after
privately buying AutoWeb.com stock at a discount and later sold her
shares for a profit when the company went public. The chief
executive of AutoWeb.com is a close friend of Nolan's and offered
her the stock through a legal ``friends and family'' deal.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics policy of the Mercury News says staff members should
not make news decisions about companies in which they have a
financial interest, and advises business news reporters not to
invest in local companies.

SYDNEY GEARS UP FOR THE MASSES AND EXPOSURE OF THE OLYMPICS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ This city will bask in the international
spotlight when the 2000 Summer Olympics take place Sept. 15-Oct. 1
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these aren't just Sydney's Olympics; they're Australia's
Olympics,'' says John Morse, managing director of the Australian
Tourist Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The continent, which already attracts more than 4 million
international visitors annually, expects to welcome an additional
342,000 next year in direct relation to the Olympics. Most will
extend their trips beyond Sydney to other areas of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Games _ and the attention surrounding them _ are
projected to generate $6.1 billion in revenue over several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 3.5 billion people tuning into Sydney via television from
around the world, we regard this as the biggest single opportunity
our nation has ever had to build our tourism,'' says Morse.
</P>
<P>
   The time is now _ indeed, you may already be tardy _ to request
tickets and make travel arrangements. But you don't have to wait
until next year to soak up the Olympic spirit: Most Olympic venues
are already built, and the immense Homebush Bay suburban site _
where major events are scheduled _ has become Sydney's second most
popular tourist attraction behind only the Opera House, attracting
5 million visitors last year and likely to double or triple that
number by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   International travelers can tour the largest Olympic Stadium
ever built, inspect the Athletes Village _ albeit from a nearby
road _ and even swim in the Olympic pool.
</P>
<P>
   Half the fun is getting there, too, if you choose the
``RiverCat'' ferry from central Sydney, an inexpensive service
available to the public several times daily now but reserved for
Olympics officials during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Homebush Bay, about nine miles west of central Sydney,
represents a remarkable environmental success. Once a favored
fishing grounds for native Aborigines, its 1,900 acres have
subsequently been home to a race course, brickworks, saltworks,
armaments depot and abattoir and, more recently in the 1960s and
'70s, were the dumping grounds for 9 million tons of household and
industrial waste, a process that caused considerable contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Build a state-of-the-art Olympic complex in this wasteland? Most
Sydney residents laughed when the idea was proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are most facilities in place well ahead of schedule,
but ecologists are thrilled by the survival of remnant pockets of
original wetlands and woodlands; by the planting of almost 40,000
native trees and more than 2 million grass seedlings; and by the
increasing proliferation of wildlife _ 140 bird species, rare frog
colonies and eight lizard species included.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the area is destined to become the Millennium Parklands,
Sydney's largest metropolitan park _ bigger than New York's Central
Park _ and connected by a network of cycling routes and footpaths.
</P>
<P>
   The solar-powered Athletes Village eventually will anchor new
commercial housing complexes. ``It will be the largest
solar-powered suburb in the world,'' says Sandie Watson,
spokeswoman for the Olympic Coordinating Committee. ``And all
houses are being made with recycled materials. This is the first
project of its kind anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening and closing ceremonies, track and field competition and
soccer finals will take place in the 110,000-seat Olympic Stadium,
which opened earlier this year and has already been used for soccer
and rugby matches.
</P>
<P>
   A 20,000 seat SuperDome, scheduled for completion next month,
will be the setting for basketball and artistic gymnastics.
Separate new facilities with seating capacities of 10,000 or more
will host swimming and diving, baseball, tennis and field hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Homebush Bay will host 15 of 28 Olympic sports; other
venues range from Rushcutter Bay (sailing) to Bondi Beach (beach
volleyball), none more than 30 minutes apart and all serviced by
public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   For the traveler, Homebush Bay's main asset is its compact
design; you can walk, for instance, along Olympic Boulevard, from
the SuperDome to Olympic Stadium to the Aquatic Center in a matter
of moments. All venues are accessible to travelers with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   A new 318-room hotel complex is due to open early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Except for rabid sports fans, visiting in advance of the
Olympics is a wise idea. Those who arrive by boat from Circular
Quay wharf (a 35-minute ride) can access the main sites via
low-cost bus service. Or arrive by train in the heart of the
complex at Sydney's newest architectural icon, the Olympic Park
Station, whose exterior is designed to resemble a baseball cap.
Rail services can transport up to 50,000 passengers per hour to
Homebush Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few paces from the station, a visitor center (open 9
a.m.-5 p.m. daily) includes displays that illustrate the area's
heritage and development. Self-guided walking-tour maps are
available. Volunteers can answer questions or inform about free
guided walking tours scheduled several times daily.
</P>
<P>
   On an Olympic Explorer bus tour, patterned after the popular
Sydney Explorer, participants can hop on and off at their leisure
at any of 10 stops, with buses circling the area every 20 minutes
between 9:20 a.m. and 3 p.m. Cost is about $6.50.
</P>
<P>
   A highlight is the Aquatic Center, where visitors pay about $3
to swim between 5 a.m. and 10 p.m. Mondays-Fridays or 6 a.m.-7 p.m.
on weekends. ``We plan to keep it open as long as possible prior to
the Olympics,'' Watson says.
</P>
<P>
   Guided tours of the Olympic Stadium are conducted several times
daily and cost about $6.50.
</P>
<P>
   Self-service snack facilities are available at the Aquatic
Center, and the Heritage Cafe serves light meals beside a garden
near the visitor center.
</P>
<P>
   As for the period of the Games ... Sydneysiders, as locals are
known, continue to express concern about mass construction under
way at Sydney International Airport, on roadways throughout town
and at sites where 4,000 new hotel rooms are being built.
Organizers assure that all will be in order.
</P>
<P>
   Additional international flights will be added, but advance
planning and flexibility are essential. And don't expect airline
discounts during the Olympics period.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based Cartan Tours is the only U.S. distributor of
Olympic tickets, and the original U.S. allotment was recently
expanded. Ticket prices range from $8 for some preliminary events
to $1,054 for premium seats at the opening and closing ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Cartan also offers complete packages that last as long as three
weeks and include air transportation and lodging.
</P>
<P>
   The company publishes a free brochure that includes information
on how to submit ticket order forms; call 800-841-1994 or access
the company on the Internet at www.cartan.com.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites sponsored by Games organizers in Australia also are
useful: Access www.oca.nsw.gov.au and www.sydney.olympic.org.
</P>
<P>
   A valuable independent source is Stepping Stones to the Sydney
Games, a newsletter that covers ticket policies, housing and other
matters related to the Games. Cost is $44 for six issues. Call
330-995-4178 or write to Stepping Stones, P.O. Box 605, Aurora,
Ohio 44202.

EXCURSIONS GIVE CLUES TO THE MANY FACES OF AUSTRALIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The temptation is to never leave.
</P>
<P>
   But if time permits, two excursions from Sydney _ either on day
trips or with overnight stays _ introduce other aspects of
Australia's multifaceted personality.
</P>
<P>
   With the right guide, you can even say hello to dozens of
kangaroos in their native habitat.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE BLUE MOUNTAINS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only about a 90-minute drive west from Sydney, the Blue
Mountains _ actually a sandstone plateau 3,600 feet above sea level
at its peak _ won't be confused with the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the first time people went over the Blue Mountains, it
opened up the rest of Australia; it was a bit like `How the West
was won' in America,'' says Bob Charlesworth, who operates Wild
Escapes, a four-wheel-drive tour firm that caters to small groups.
</P>
<P>
   Early European settlers in Sydney, desperate to find land
suitable for growing food, tried unsuccessfully for 25 years to
conquer the rugged cliffs and other harsh terrain. Not until 1813
did explorers make their way across.
</P>
<P>
   Today, much of the land in and around Blue Mountains National
Park and neighboring parks remains accessible only to hikers;
indeed, the Australian tradition of ``bush-walking'' began here in
1914 and remains a passion for those who want to fully appreciate
the magnificent gorges, rock formations and waterfalls. (Park
rangers can recommend paths to suit various skill levels.)
</P>
<P>
   About the name: No, the ground isn't blue. Oil drops given off
by millions of eucalyptus trees on hillsides are refracted by
light, creating a blue haze that hovers above.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies operate half-day, full-day and multiday tours
from Sydney. A highlight of an abbreviated Charlesworth-led tour in
Blue Mountains National Park was a visit to a remote meadow _
accessed by a bumpy gravel road _ where scores of kangaroos
cavorted unbothered by human intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What many people don't realize is that kangaroos have no
predators, so they're not scared of us and won't bother us,''
Charlesworth explains.
</P>
<P>
   The center of activity _ and the geographical center _ is
Katoomba, a town of 17,000 about 65 miles from Sydney and easily
accessed by car or two-hour rail service.
</P>
<P>
   Three Sisters, three giant stone pillars that represent the Blue
Mountains' most renowned rock formation, is visible from Katoomba's
Echo Point. Here, too, visitors are tempted by the Scenic Skyway, a
cable car that crosses high above a gorge and yields spectacular
views (and tests nerves), and a Scenic Railway reputed to have the
steepest incline of any rail journey in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Katoomba is also known for its quaint shops, excellent
restaurants _ especially those serving Asian cuisine _ and
Lilianfels Blue Mountains, a five-star hotel situated in a country
house and only a five-minute walk from the Three Sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Venture farther north, and the mere names of enticements hint at
the intrigue: Govett's Leap, Bridal Veil Falls, Pulpit Rock, Blue
Gum Forest and the Zig Zag Railway.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Escapes, twice honored as Australia's best tour and
transport operator, offers preset or customized tours of the Blue
Mountains. Prices vary depending on arrangements; full-day trips
booked through the Austravel tour firm cost $121 per person and
include a guided tour of Sydney's Rocks District. Lunch is included
and features Australian wines from the Hunter Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to ...
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE HUNTER VALLEY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leading wine shops throughout North America now offer an
extensive selection of Australian vintages, and some of the best
are produced in this 7,000-acre valley about a two-hour drive north
from Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 wineries offer complimentary tastings. And take
heed: Appoint a designated driver; better yet, book a guided tour.
Unlike in Bordeaux, you're not encouraged to spit out tasted
samples. Neither are you always limited to three or four varieties
as is common closer to home. ``Which wines would you like to try?''
is usually the first greeting here.
</P>
<P>
   Many wineries are clustered so that it's possible to visit four
or five _ well, maybe eight or nine _ in one afternoon. About 50
are just north and west of Cessnock in what is known as the Lower
Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   One option, offered by several companies, is to tour wineries by
horse-and-carriage; information is available at a visitor center in
Cessnock, by e-mail at info(at)winecountry.com.au or on the
Internet at www.winecountry.com.au.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Blue Mountains, the Hunter Valley was ``discovered'' by
Sydney-based British settlers in the early 19th century. Vines were
first planted in the 1820s, with pioneers including Dr. Henry
Lindeman, whose vineyards now produce vintages familiar to many
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the 1960s did Lindemans and other Australian wineries
begin gaining prominence. Now the industry is developing so fast
that a new winery opens every 48 hours, increasing the continent's
total to more than 1,100. Some wine-focused tours, available for
booking in the United States, cover three or four Australian states
and last as long as two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers with limited time in the Hunter Valley are encouraged
to combine stops at some of the larger establishments _ perhaps
Lindemans, Wyndham Estate, Tyrrell's and Hungerford Hill _ with
visits to boutique wineries such as Petersons and Briar Ridge.
Often, the shiraz, semillon and chardonnay are accompanied by
sweeping views of the lush valley.
</P>
<P>
   Lures extend beyond wine. An ideal year-round climate makes this
a popular retreat for golfing, cycling and hot-air ballooning.
Enchanting towns and villages are scattered about the region;
family-owned crafts and antiques shops provide a welcome contrast
with bustling Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   One distinct choice for overnight lodging is the Convent,
originally built in 1909 for an order of nuns and now a centerpiece
of Pepper Tree Wines near Pokolbin in the lower valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunter Resort, also near Pokolbin, is another favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Escapes is among tour companies that offer trips to the
Hunter Valley. Write to P.O. Box 116, Asquith 2077, New South
Wales, Australia. Or access www.ozemail.com.au/wildescp on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A travel agent or tour packager can recommend alternatives and
make reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The www.winecountry.com.au Web site covers all aspects of Hunter
Valley tourism. Information about wine-growing throughout Australia
is available online at www.wineaustralia.com. Or request a free
brochure by calling 212-351-6585 or writing to the Australian Wine
Bureau, 150 E. 42nd, 34th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10017.
</P>
<P>
   Also worthy of exploration:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Southern Highlands, about a 90-minute drive south from
Sydney, are notable for beautiful spring and autumn gardens, lakes
and forests.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Snowy Mountains, 250 miles south of Sydney, represent
Australia's largest alpine region. The ski season usually runs from
about mid-June to early October.

INSTABILITY IMPERILS UGANDA TOURISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUHOMA, Uganda _ The hut is a vivid reminder of why Adrian
Tunnicliffe's wife refused to join him on the trek to see Uganda's
rare mountain gorillas. Set in the middle of this country's most
important tourism venue, it is still roofless and scarred from the
brutal rebel attack that killed eight Western visitors last March.
</P>
<P>
   If the perpetrators were aiming to inflict damage against
Uganda, they succeeded. Prior to the attack, the two parks
inhabited by the gorillas were fully booked well through 2002. Now,
scores of international safari operators have canceled bookings and
tourists are only trickling in. The fall-off in tourism threatens
conservation programs and rural development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is feeling the pinch,'' said Stephen Asuma, the
warden in charge of tourism at Bwindi. ``Staff has been laid off.
The community company'' _ which runs the visitor camp that was
attacked _ ``hasn't paid its employees since March. We're having
trouble running the park. When the money does not come in, it has a
drastic multiple effect on the park and surrounding communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ugandan government has deployed 180 soldiers to protect the
parks, but the British High Commission still advises Britons not to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Tunnicliffe is glad he did not heed his government's advice. A
property manager from Sheffield in Britain, he was recently part of
the first full group to visit Bwindi Impenetrable National Park
since it reopened in April. ``I was quite nervous about coming, but
I understood that there was new security to protect us,'' he said
after a morning hike into the forest. ``As it turned out, I felt
completely comfortable. The experience of seeing the gorillas was
stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   The mountain gorillas of Africa, brought to the world's
attention by the famous researcher Dian Fossey, inhabit the
densely-forested volcanic mountain range of Uganda and Rwanda. The
primates are the largest on earth and among the most endangered.
There are only 650 left. Of those, 292 live in Uganda's Bwindi
Impenetrable and adjacent Mgahinga parks.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda established the parks in 1991 not only to preserve the
gorillas but also to protect from human encroachment a water
catchment system created by what remains of one of Africa's richest
and oldest ecosystems. Subsistence cultivation runs right up to the
forest boundaries. Before 1991, villagers used to clear-cut the
forest to take advantage of its fertile soils, logging for fuel and
peat, and hunting bush pigs in the dense underbrush.
</P>
<P>
   Bwindi and Mgahinga together earn 40 percent of the Uganda
Wildlife Authority's annual revenues, which help finance all the
other wildlife preserves in the country. As demand to see the
gorillas has soared, the price for park permits rose from $80 to
$250 per person in just four years. Twenty percent of those
revenues also go into a profit-sharing program to help communities
bordering the parks to become less dependent on forest resources,
said Asuma.
</P>
<P>
   But the area also straddles several national borders made
dangerously unstable by the war in central Africa. Bwindi's main
visitor camp, just inside the park boundary off the village of
Buhoma, lies less than 2 miles from the border with the Democratic
Republic of Congo. The parks have three families of gorillas
accustomed to seeing humans, allowing a maximum of 18 tourists a
short encounter with the primates per day.
</P>
<P>
   Since the March attack, by rebel Hutu militias opposed to the
governments of Rwanda and its ally Uganda, barely 200 visitors have
returned _ less than normal tally for April, the slowest month of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The attack in Bwindi was only the latest in a series of setbacks
for tourism in Uganda and east Africa. Southern Africa, freed from
apartheid and its regional destabilizing effects, has become the
undisputed magnet for overseas travelers in Africa, despite a high
crime rate. Political instability and thievery have sullied
once-popular Kenya as a destination point for big-game watchers.
The bombings of the US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam last
year and the international war in central Africa, into which both
Rwanda and Uganda have been drawn, dealt further blows to tourism
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the raid happened in Bwindi we really feared that was the
last nail in the coffin for tourism in Uganda,'' said Steven
Kagoda, the permanent secretary in the Ugandan Ministry of Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Absolute Africa, the London-based tourism operator that
Tunnicliffe traveled with, returned to Bwindi only in the third
week of June. Nile Safaris, a Ugandan tour company with London
partners, lost 75 percent of its confirmed advance bookings to
Bwindi, laid off half of its drivers, and had to seek smaller
offices. Where it once had 20 to 30 clients a week, now it has two
or three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uganda has lost 90 percent of its incoming tourists from
overseas,'' said Mel Gormley, director of Mantana African Safaris
in Kampala and head of the Ugandan Tour Operators Association. ``My
company has lost about 95 percent of its business and laid off 60
percent of my staff, which as you can imagine is fatal. The image
of the country is tarnished.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism, according to the International Monetary Fund, accounts
for only about 1.9 percent of Uganda's gross domestic product. But
Gormley and others worry that the damage done to the country's
image as an attractive holiday destination will compound the
negative impact of the Congo war, embassy bombings, and internal
instability on foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Warden Asuma said if Bwindi kept all its revenues, it would
still only cover about 50 percent of its operating budget as a
result of the decline in tourism. The situation is worse since the
park shares its revenues broadly with other national reserves as
well as the local communities.
</P>
<P>
   Harder to ascertain is the impact on the villages near the park.
Locals depended on the informal market created by the inflow of
tourists, finding among the foreign visitors buyers for their
home-grown bananas and sugar cane. That business is now, at least
momentarily, gone. For the time being, however, development
programs that benefited under the park service profit-sharing plan
will probably continue. A range of local and international
nongovernmental organizations and trusts help fund those
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   But Benon Mugyerwa, Bwindi's warden of community affairs and law
enforcement, worries about the welfare of the forest. ``We educated
the people about the importance of the park at the time we
established it, and the people understood,'' he said. ``It produced
income to help build schools and clinics. If the tourists stay
away, people may return to the forest for materials to get money or
to hunt animals that destroy their crops.''
</P>
<P>
   The government and various international organizations,
meanwhile, have taken the security issue at Bwindi seriously. The
World Food Program provided food during special ranger training
programs after the attack. USAID gave radios for communication
between trekkers, Bwindi headquarters, and Kampala. Egypt trained
20 new rangers at its police academy, and a private British
security firm has provided additional training inside Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists climbing the steep forest slopes in search of the
gorillas are now accompanied by at least two Ugandan Army soldiers,
an armed park ranger, and two trackers with machetes. The
government is looking for the funds to double the number of its
rangers in parks around the country.
</P>
<P>
   While instability across the border in Congo continues,
officials hope the attack in March was an isolated, if unfortunate,
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am telling tourists is that I would definitely go up to
Bwindi,'' said Robbie Robinson, the former South African parks
board director hired in May to run the Ugandan Wildlife Authority.
``It is a terrific experience. My perception is that the rebels are
not too anxious to go into an area where the ranger force and
Uganda defense force are active. They would rather pick soft
targets.''

THE UNACCOMPLISHED AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is an old-fashioned idea, but once upon a more self-reliant
time, what you could do sometimes counted for almost as much as
what you had acquired.
</P>
<P>
   In an era where entertainment took effort, accomplishment was
social capital, and the acquisition of talent meant as much in the
assessment of a person's worth as, say, owning stock in the latest
Internet company or driving a Lexus does in the salons of the new
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it, of course, was that necessity made a social virtue
of individual skill. In the days before recordings, if a family
wanted melody, someone in the family had to be musical. Indeed, the
delight such a talent could bring was valuable enough that it might
well improve one's marriage prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Conversational ability was also valued and knowledge was
cultivated. Joining a conversation required more than having
watched the most recent Red Sox outing or ``Ally McBeal'' episode.
It might have meant reading a notable novel or essay, or being
conversant with the issues that enlivened the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had an enormous incentive for self-development and
activity because the passive, consuming media weren't there,'' says
John Silber, former head of the state Board of Education and the
chancellor of Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Now, admittedly, that's a distant notion.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the home-entertainment center has become the center of
the home. From TVs to PCs, from CDs to DVDs, an alphabet soup of
high-tech entertainment options beckons in the modern living room,
most of which require no more effort than reaching for the remote.
Still, there's a cost in that absence of effort, an opportunity
cost. Rather than entertain ourselves, we've grown accustomed to
being entertained. It's an invitation to passivity _ and America
has accepted.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, we are not nearly as interesting as we used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Consider a century ago. Those who have studied that era say that
same impulse made music central to domestic life and put a piano in
every parlor.
</P>
<P>
   ``From mid 1850 to 1910 or 1920, pianos were in every
middle-class living room,'' says Michael Lewin, chairman of the
piano department at the Boston Conservatory, and a professional
concert pianist. ``And every time there was a new symphony or
opera, it was immediately published in piano four-hand version, and
people sat and played through them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an aesthetic America's founders had revered as well.
Jefferson, who counted music ``the favorite passion of my soul,''
rose with the sun to practice his violin and dreamed of having an
orchestra at Monticello; Benjamin Franklin not only wrote and
published music, he invented the glass harmonica; Sam Adams,
meanwhile, organized singing groups in Boston, promoting both music
and patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   They might be surprised today to see how amusical America has
become. Although precise figures are difficult to find, a series of
Gallup polls done for the National Association of Music Merchants
gives some sense of the modern decline.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, more than half of households reported that someone over
5 played an instrument, but that percentage had slid to 38 percent
by 1997. Only about one quarter of people over 12 currently plays.
Remove high-school students, and that percentage falls to just 16
percent of adults. All told, only about 10 percent of Americans
seems to play an instrument with real frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ortner, president of the Boston Conservatory, says one
reason for the decline is that music has lost a place of primacy in
the public schools. Ortner, who graduated from high school in 1966,
says that during his school days, ``It was unthinkable to enter a
classroom that didn't have a piano or to encounter a teacher who
couldn't sit down to play ``Happy Birthday'' to someone. Music was
considered a natural, normal part of being alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today you would look in vain for that classroom or that
teacher,'' he concludes. ``We have lost two generations of people
to thinking of music as a normal pursuit.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Asian and European cultures seem far more eager to
pursue music than does America. Maryte Bizinkauskas, a professional
voice teacher in Massachusetts, says the United States now puts
sports on a pedestal reserved for music in many European cultures.
Bizinkauskas cites the example of Lithuania, where has gone
frequently to sing at the national opera house.
</P>
<P>
   There, ``music is more important than sports,'' she says.
``Taking music lessons is part of daily life that is considered
essential. Kids also do sports, but the sports are optional. Here,
it is the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just musical ability that's been lost in American life,
however. It's also the centrality of conversation and books in
domestic life.
</P>
<P>
   Silber remembers his parents reading to the family as
entertainment in the evenings. And he recalls the value the
raconteur had in social situations, entertaining with droll
observations about the issues and personalities of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father-in-law was . . . like a living Mark Twain,'' Silber
said. ``He would say things like, `You know, speaking of our
governor . . .. The Good Lord never stretched skin over a sorrier
piece of flesh.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Like musicality, the value of the spoken word hasn't undergone
quite the same deflation in other cultures. In Dublin, for example,
even in this day and age, one would scarcely venture out to a
middle-class social affair without his or her ``party piece,'' a
well-known poem or song or speech that can be recited on request
for the entertainment of the company.
</P>
<P>
   But we're not a nation of great or interesting talkers anymore.
One needn't listen long to today's college kids to realize that, in
the main, conversational skills have eroded to a ceaseless
repetition of careless terms.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that when Edwin J. Delattre, dean of Boston
University's School of Education, spoke to seniors the day before
commencement, he began by parodying the tired tropes that form a
sort of insipid spoken shorthand among the young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, like, you know, went to see (Associate Dean) Joan Dee and
asked what I should, like, you know, talk about,'' Delattre said.
``And she goes, `You mean, like, a topic?' And I said, `Whatever.'
So she goes, `Well, your talk should be, like, real, and, like, you
know, stylish.' So, I, like, chose reality and style. Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes for good conversation?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Samuel Johnson _ whose verbal agility made him the
conversational equal of anyone save Edmund Burke in an era when
one's value as a social companion was measured in no small part by
the sparkle of his talk _ defined it this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must, in the first place, be knowledge, there must be
materials; in the second place, there must be a command of words;
in the third place, there must be imagination, to place things in
such views as they are not commonly seen in; and in the fourth
place, there must be presence of mind, and a resolution that is not
to be overcome by failures.'' (All of which makes one fear that
poor Dean Delattre is swimming against a cultural springtide in his
battle for better spoken style.)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also thought that young people, for the knowledge and
rounding they need, should read five (!) hours a day, a
recommendation that seems hopelessly unrealistic today.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even by far more modest measures, the longer-term data
about reading among America's youth is discouraging.
</P>
<P>
   The National Assessment of Educational Progress's look at
long-term reading trends show that between 1984 and 1996, the
percentage of 17-year-olds who said they read each day for fun
dropped from an already low 31 percent to 23 percent, while the
percentage who said they never read for fun rose from 9 percent to
16 percent. In 1998, less than 8 percent of fourth, eighth and 12th
graders read well enough to be deemed advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Below them, only one third of fourth- and eighth-graders, and 40
percent of 12th-graders read well enough to qualify as proficient
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the most recent NAEP report shows the reason for
reading changes as students age. At grade four, 55 percent said
they read for the experience, while 45 percent cited the need for
information. But by grade 12, only 35 percent were reading mostly
for the experience, while 65 percent said their reading came from a
need to gain information or perform a task.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, those statistics mark a lamentable decline in
national curiosity and culture, a slide made all the sadder because
reading is one of life's most accessible pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   Reading, after all, is not just the portal to imagination and
understanding. It is also, says University of Massachusetts
President William M. Bulger, the way we move beyond workaday
concerns to establish an enduring life of the mind that makes us
something more than what we own or how we make our living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't doubt that there is less eagerness now for
non-job-related knowledge, but I see a great need for it,'' says
Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is part of our nature to need to know, to become more
conversant with ideas, with old times, with other people, and not
just those with whom we are positioned through an accident of
geography and time.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a richness you won't find in technology, no matter what's
playing on the History Channel

PUTTING WORDS IN GREENSPAN'S MOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; _ Let's begin by ceding an important point to our
friends on the right on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan is not opposed to income
tax cuts, including quite substantial income tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   That concession, however, is a completely inadequate basis for
the opposite assertion _ that Greenspan is a supporter of the
tax-cut legislation moving toward passage in Congress and a certain
veto by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to make Greenspan partisan on this matter ignores
both his position at the Fed and his views.Our friends on the
right, in fact, make the same kind of mistake that those on the
left make in wishing Greenspan into their corner.
</P>
<P>
   They do it in two steps. First, they argue that the choice
regarding tax cuts worth nearly $800 billion over the next decade,
is between ``spending'' a projected non-Social Security budget
surplus of $1 trillion and ``returning'' it whence it allegedly
came.
</P>
<P>
   Second, they seize on Greenspan's familiar refrain that, given a
choice between such an expenditure and tax cuts of similar size,
he's a solid tax-cut man. They take this to mean that he's clearly
in Congress's corner.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong on three important counts.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cuts Greenspan favors in theory are reductions in the
marginal income tax rates and the elimination of all taxation of
capital gains. Whether you focus on the House or Senate versions of
the legislation, at most half of what's involved concerns these
topics; the rest is an economy-distorting bunch of tax breaks
designed for their appeal to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it's not at all clear that Greenspan sees the
alternative for dealing with the possibly looming surplus as
``spending.'' His actual words are in opposition to any binge of
``major'' spending on new initiatives. In fact, opponents of
massive tax cuts see at least half the surplus going simply to keep
the existing government current with modest inflation, with room
only for compensating increases and decreases to fund initiatives
like more medical research.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, Greenspan doubts the reliability of the
surplus projections. On the one hand, he notes that every action
taken thus far by the Republican-led 106th Congress has belied its
rhetorical commitment to Draconian government-slashing, and that
this year it is already outside the existing appropriations caps by
a good $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And on the other, even his belief that the economy continues to
grow with remarkable persistence, fueled by productivity-enhancing
investment, has limits.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the tax legislation's foundation assumption of
uninterrupted growth with minimal inflation and low interest rates,
Greenspan notes that ``history says that when you have been
expanding for nine years, somewhere out there is a slowdown, an
adjustment, which can occur wholly independently of the question of
whether these structural, long-term productivities are
continuing.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the attempt to put Greenspan's stamp of approval on
this tax bill runs afoul of his clearly stated preference, and not
just a temperate interpretation of his views on the surplus and
federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Greenspan is for paying down the national debt as
rapidly and for as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the ideal time to do it,'' he told the Senate
Banking Committee last week, ``and I would certainly agree that if
you can't do it in a significant way now, I can't imagine
circumstances being more favorable to debt reduction at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   And to the extent that a huge, fiscal goof recreated an
operating budget deficit, that would diminish the extent to which
$2 trillion in Social Security surpluses could help prepare for a
responsible financing of the baby boom generation's retirement,
despite the existence of a so-called lock-box for those
debt-reducing surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   To Greenspan, the gradual return to fiscal sanity in the 1990s
has been central to the resulting prosperity. Capital was available
for private investment precisely because the government stopped
soaking up all private savings to finance ruinous deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have been saying since late last year as the surpluses
began to evolve,'' Greenspan said last week, ``these have been
exceptionally beneficial to the economy, to economic growth, price
stability; that the longer we can allow them to run and run down
the debt outstanding to the public, the better off we will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, however, that doesn't alter Greenspan's view that
``significant tax cuts will be in order.''
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom line, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York,
while acknowledging the difficulty, sought to package Greenspan's
views on tax cuts in a phrase:
</P>
<P>
   ``But you're basically saying: Yes, but not now. Is that
unfair?'' Replied the chairman: ``I would say that's a _ if you
force me to be non-opaque, I guess that's where I would come out.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, Greenspan chuckled, having proved that complexity and
clarity are not mutually exclusive.
</P>

FLEET, BANKBOSTON AT E-CROSSROADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Bank brands come and go, but Robert P. Shay Jr. keeps
trying to lure customers on line.
</P>
<P>
   At BayBanks Inc., Shay set up a dial-in service so depositors
could check their balances via computer. When his employer was
acquired by BankBoston Corp., Shay stayed to create a Web site
enabling electronic bill payments.
</P>
<P>
   Now BankBoston is being bought by Fleet Financial Group Inc.,
and Shay, BankBoston's director of electronic banking, hopes the
new entity will stick with several new technologies like souped-up
teller machine software and new investment features for
BankBoston's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of these efforts remains unclear while the two banks
hash out a joint electronic-commerce strategy. Fleet's own on-line
banking numbers have doubled this year, although it has been known
more for cost-cutting than for retail technology.
</P>
<P>
   But meanwhile, new Net-only players like Wingspanbank.com, a
unit of Bank One Corp. of Chicago, have been advertising to draw
depositors. As executives at both Fleet and BankBoston see it, such
competition will force traditional banks to make ever-more services
available via the computer, the telephone, and the teller machine _
or lose market share to those who do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more accessible you make your systems, the more customers
will gravitate toward you,'' Shay said.
</P>
<P>
   Most bank mergers create sticky computer issues, posing the risk
of irate consumers and millions of dollars in downtime costs if
programmers don't implement changes correctly.
</P>
<P>
   But the merger of New England's two largest lenders also comes
as the rise of the Internet is forcing banks to confront strategic
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the $16 billion combination was announced in March, much
attention so far has focused on just which branches the combined
bank might have to sell off. Yet how well the new bank structures
its back-office operations to support electronic commerce might
ultimately determine whether the merger succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   A basic worry, says Fleet chief executive Terrence Murray, is
how to earn profits on line from customers in their 20s and 30s,
while still supporting the infrastructure costs of branches and
tellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people still want to use branches, and children are
going totally electronic,'' said Murray in a recent interview.
``Generation X, they like both, and don't want to pay for either,''
Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet banking is on the upswing even though the total amount
of money on deposit in the United States has remained steady, at
around $4.2 trillion, in recent years. To match the mutual fund
industry, many banks have turned to technology in hopes of
delivering more services without paying more clerks.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is known as ``transaction migration,'' and it has
achieved a wide following. It was first seen in the growth of
teller machines _ there were 187,000 nationwide last year, up from
80,156 in 1990, according to the American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   This year banking via the Web has also taken off. Leader Wells,
Fargo &AMP; Co. in San Francisco has 980,000 on-line customers, up from
620,000 at the end of last year. Most of the increase is
attributable to the growth of its Wellsfargo.com Web site, which
has 900,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   Other banks are marketing themselves under new brand names on
the Web, making consumers better offers than are available in their
traditional branches. Perhaps the best-known is Wingspan, whose big
ad costs will lead parent Bank One Corp. of Chicago to take a
charge of up to $150 million in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, independent Internet-only banks like Net.Bank of
Atlanta and CompuBank of Houston have received their own charters
from federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Even Salem Five Cents Savings Bank in Salem, Mass., has drawn a
big following to the on-line service it began offering five years
ago. Now about 10 percent of Salem Five's 60,000 customers are
Web-only, logging in from all 50 states and 12 foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're positioned to get that time-starved customer who isn't
able to visit the regular branches when they're open during
business hours,'' said Michael Fitzgerald, Salem Five's senior vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston executives vow to beat back the upstarts,
though they haven't yet decided whether they will market services
of the merged bank under its own name, temporarily Fleet Boston
Corp., or invent a new brand.
</P>
<P>
   Some decisions must wait until the merger gets final regulatory
approvals, executives say. The firms also won't even begin to
combine some computer platforms until after Jan. 1, to reduce risks
of disruptions stemming from the software problem known as the Y2K
bug.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet has some on-line strengths too, chiefly the Web sites of
its Quick &AMP; Reilly brokerage and its SureTrade discount brokerage
service, which together have 460,000 clients.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet also has nearly 200,000 retail customers using its Web
site and dial-in services. BankBoston has about 350,000 such
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have developed big teller machine networks and
telephone call centers, but BankBoston has used these assets to
drive the percentage of customer visits requiring assistance from
bank employees to below 30 percent of all transactions, compared to
40 percent for most banks, including Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet has plans to improve its figures. To encourage ATM usage,
in September Fleet will begin issuing customers magnetic cards over
the counter as soon as they open new accounts. Also, in October,
Fleet plans to link its brokerage features to the bank's main Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, says Fleet spokesman James Mahoney, ``From a
technology standpoint there will be nothing that Wingspan does that
Fleet doesn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   That would mark a big improvement for Fleet, says Chris Musto, a
director at Internet consultants Gomez Advisors Inc. in Lincoln who
currently ranks Fleet 25th out of 58 on-line banks. He ranks
BankBoston ahead in 13th place, partly because its customer account
data goes back further on the Web. Once the the merger closes,
``Fleet would do well to adopt the BankBoston technology,'' Musto
said. (Fleet says Gomez uses a narrow set of criteria and notes its
Web site has received high ratings from others.)
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston's new teller machine software was also meant to fit
the developing electronic commerce arena; since May BankBoston has
installed the software on 130 of its 1,600 ATMs. Fancy teller
machines will play a key defensive role for established banks,
because few Internet-only banks have their own for customers to use
without surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's Mahoney said the bank hasn't decided whether it will
support BankBoston's latest upgrade, since Fleet had its own teller
machine improvements planned as well.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston's new software allows ATM customers to review
balances in several accounts at once and make on-screen loan
payments. For $2, customers can also print out account statements
on a full-sized printer concealed in the front of the machines.
Eventually the devices could be configured to allow customers to
browse the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The new screens have also provoked complaints from customers,
although some customers interviewed last week said they expected to
get used to the new menus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a routine, and it takes a while before you have to stop
looking'' at the new screens, said Debra Jones, a Boston resident
who withdrew some cash from one of BankBoston's reconfigured ATMs
in the lobby of its headquarters last week.
</P>
<P>
   Chelvi Rajadurai, from Reading, said she didn't mind the new
look but said she preferred to use BankBoston's Web site, where she
can view updated statements for free.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Shay, who says customers who contact the bank
electronically tend to conduct more transactions than in person.
Ultimately, more transactions means more business and make it
harder for consumers to switch away.

MAINE AIRMAN REFUSING ANTHRAX VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in China, Maine, where he grew up, Zack Johnson didn't have
much of a reputation for civil disobedience. He was so law-abiding
he never skipped school for fear of getting caught, and so
laid-back that his parents fondly called him ``Mr. Light 'n'
Easy.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a week, the 22-year-old naval airman will face a
court-martial for a decision he made on June 6, that nothing _ not
the threat of biological weapons, or the threat of a jail sentence,
or the loss of the GI Bill money he planned to put toward college _
could persuade him to take the Pentagon-ordered anthrax vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the USS John F. Kennedy in the Caribbean, while even the
most skeptical of his comrades went in for their shots, Johnson had
plenty of time to consider his choice: From the Department of
Defense came warnings that unvaccinated soldiers are terrifyingly
vulnerable to an airborne bacteria whose victims die in a rush of
internal bleeding. And from other sources came claims that the
Pentagon has rushed into use an untested vaccine that could cause a
cluster of lingering side-effects.
</P>
<P>
   When he goes to court on Aug. 16, Johnson will be the first
among Navy personnel to face court-martial for refusing to take the
vaccine. But on land he has company. Ten Marines were
court-martialed in California last month for the same reason. And
the ever-growing number of Air Force reserve and National Guard
pilots refusing to take the shots has aroused the interest of a
handful of US representatives who last week accused the Department
of Defense outright of lying to troops about the vaccine's safety.
</P>
<P>
   So far, while upwards of 300,000 military personnel have had at
least one anthrax vaccination shot, between 175 and 200 people have
refused, said Virginia Stephanakis, an Army medical spokeswoman.
Pentagon spokesman Jim Turner said the number of refusals was so
small that it would have no effect on battle-readiness.
</P>
<P>
   But others said the refusals are building toward crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got air national guard units that are losing a third of
their flight crew and are saying they cannot be deployed anymore,''
said Mark Zaid, a Washington attorney who represented 10 Marines
court-martialed in California and whose own estimates put the
number of refusals between 300 and 500.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, ``Congress is now starting to seriously
question the sanctity of this program. I think you're about to see
a battle between the legislative and executive branches.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives Ben Gilman, Republican of New York, and Walter
Jones, Republican of North Carolina, have both filed bills that
would make the vaccine voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   This standoff comes a little more than a year after the Pentagon
announced that it would issue soldiers a new kind of battle gear
against a new kind of weapon. Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen
ordered 2.4 million servicemen and women vaccinated against anthrax
_ one of 17 different vaccines soldiers are given, but the
first-ever against a biological weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Several nations have the capability to produce and deliver
anthrax, which is 100 percent deadly, said Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like an entitlement. We owe it to our service
members,'' Turner said. ``It's like a piece of equipment. You
wouldn't go into battle without your helmet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson, who had long believed that ``the military . . .
doesn't have a very good track record of taking care of its
people,'' drew different conclusions from his own research on the
Internet, which linked the anthrax vaccine with lingering
neurological side-effects and the cluster of symptoms known as Gulf
War Syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The way he remembers it, no one wanted to take the shots, which
``leaves a knot about the size of a grape in your arm for a couple
weeks.'' But most of his shipmates weren't in the position to
dismiss their military careers over a matter of principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people, who have 10 years invested in it and three kids,
it's not worth it to them,'' he said. ``For me, I'm at a point in
my life where I can afford to stand up for what I believe in. If
worse comes to worst, I'd lose my car.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many servicemen who refuse to take the shot, Johnson was
given a choice between a ``non-judicial punishment'' of docked pay
and restriction on board the USS John F. Kennedy, or going to trial
on land. If he's convicted of disobeying a lawful order on Aug. 16,
he could be sentenced to a jail term that his lawyer, Lieutenant
Todd Wynkoop, said could last as long as six months but would
likely fall between 25 and 45 days. He could also receive a
bad-conduct discharge, which would remain on his record as a
federal criminal conviction.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new about public skepticism over government
vaccine programs, said Robert Johnston, a Yale historian who has
studied early 20th-century antivaccination movements. The US
government's mandatory campaign to innoculate Americans against
smallpox prompted outcries from people who felt the policy was
authoritarian.
</P>
<P>
   But, Johnston added, antivaccination protesters in the past have
tended to be religious or racial minorities. Dissent from within a
power structure _ like the military and Congress _ is something he
hasn't seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of amazed and shocked,'' he said. ``I'm truly
surprised at what these Republican congressmen have done, because
the common view, certainly among the medical community, is that
vaccines are pure miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have fiercely defended their use of the
vaccine. Of the 318,056 personnel who have taken at least one shot,
14 have been hospitalized for serious side effects, and 95
additional troops reported side effects that did not merit
hospitalization, Stephanakis said. She also said for every refusal
by military personnel to take the shots, the Army gets ``far more
requests from civilians who are not authorized (to receive the
vaccine), and who are worried about biological attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been no move to offer the vaccine to the
civilian population, fear of anthrax is hardly confined to the
military. There have been no documented anthrax attacks in the
United States, but scares have been on the upswing _ in the first
five months of this year, the FBI had reportedly recorded 100
anthrax-related threats.

TAKING TRAINS IS THE SIMPLE WAY TO SEE FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGOULEME, France _ In my time, I have driven through the high
passes of the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, along rutted jungle
tracks in Central America, and over potholed and surf-splashed
coastal highways in Newfoundland and Labrador. Not to mention a few
tense excursions on the wrong side of the road down the
hedgerow-lined lanes of England, across the bogs of Ireland, and
into the outback of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. With age has come, if not wisdom, at least an
attitude that when there is a less stressful alternative to
white-knuckle or wearisome driving, then why not take it?
</P>
<P>
   So, during a recent visit to France, I went for the relaxed
option. Instead of renting a car in Paris and driving for most of
the day (much of it on toll roads) to get to my destination in the
southwest corner of the country, I used a French National Railways
Rail 'n Drive pass.
</P>
<P>
   This pass allowed me to cover most of the distance sitting
comfortably in the coach of one of France's splendid high-speed
(from 125 to 186 miles per hour) TGV trains, Europe's premier rail
service. And I did so with the assurance that when I arrived there
would be a car waiting so that I could explore the countryside of
the Charente region at my leisure.
</P>
<P>
   The trip from Gare Montparnasse in Paris to Angouleme took 2 1/2
hours, less than half what the driving time would have been. And
all I had to do was lean back in my reclinable seat and watch the
verdant French farmland roll by.
</P>
<P>
   In France, unlike in the United States, car rental agencies are
almost invariably found in or near railroad stations. In Angouleme
the rental office was in the station shopping concourse. The car
waiting for me in the parking lot outside was a Spanish-made SEAT,
a comfortable and roomy vehicle that held the road well on both
main highways and meandering country roads.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage to arriving by train is that tourist
information offices are also usually nearby. In this case, the
tourist bureau for the entire Charente region was in a building
across from the station and had a good selection of maps and
brochures, along with a helpful staff.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau is here because, as it has been since the Middle
Ages, Angouleme _ strategically situated on a high bluff at a bend
in the Charente River _ is the chief town of the region. Like many
other medieval French fortress towns, Angouleme is divided into two
parts: Lower and Upper (or Old and New) towns.
</P>
<P>
   The Lower Town, where the railway station is located, dates
largely from the 19th century and has most of Angouleme's industry
and population, about 50,000 people. It is pleasant enough but with
nothing much of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Far more attractive to visitors is the old Upper Town, a maze of
narrow streets circled by nearly 2 miles of medieval walls. There
is a wonderful view over the Charente from the Promenade des
Ramparts, rectangular bastions intended for cannon but now a great
viewing platform.
</P>
<P>
   The principal church, the Cathedral of St. Pierre, is at the
heart of the old town, as is the town hall. The cathedral dates
from the 13th century, but has been much restored and rebuilt. The
Romanesque facade is covered by an intricate sculpture of the Last
Judgment, with more than 70 figures depicting angels, saints,
warriors, and animals.
</P>
<P>
   The town hall, a 19th-century Renaissance Revival building,
stands on the site of the castle that was for centuries the family
seat of the counts of Angouleme. All that's left of the castle are
a couple of medieval towers (one polygon-shaped) that can be
climbed and offer the city's most sweeping views.
</P>
<P>
   Near the town hall is a small square called, for what reason I
never learned, Place New York. Although hardly a medieval version
of Manhattan, with its cobblestoned squares, narrow streets and
cheery little restaurants and cafes, Angouleme's Old Town, like the
Big Apple, invites and rewards exploring and lingering.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Dordogne region to the south, the Charente is still
relatively undiscovered. Aside from a few centers such as
Angouleme, Cognac (France's brandy capital), Limoges (famous for
its china) and LaRochelle (an old fortified port that's now a chic
yachting center and resort), the area is mostly a landscape of
fields and meadows, groves of chestnut trees, and sleepy little
villages. The Charente is essentially the sort of traditional and
character-full rural enclave that the French admiringly call
``profound France,'' and consider the spiritual soil in which the
national soul is rooted.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition, a stately pace, and concern about the soul were the
order of the day where I based myself: the guesthouse of the
Benedictine abbey of Sainte-Marie de Maumont in Juignac, a village
18 miles south of Angouleme. The abbey was founded at the beginning
of the 19th century in a quiet village that over the years evolved
into a busy industrial town. Seeking peace, quiet, and an
atmosphere more conducive to meditation, in 1959 the nuns of
Maumont bought a 13th-century chateau in Juignac, restoring and
expanding it to accommodate their community.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wise decision. Juignac, a village in the town of
Montmoreau, is, if anything, quieter now than it was 40 years ago.
And it is likely to become more tranquil because in the Charente,
like elsewhere in France, small farms continue to be absorbed into
more efficient larger ones, and the rural population shrinks.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 60 sisters at Maumont, and they are famous in
France for their liturgical singing. In the Benedictine tradition,
they sing in chorus at morning Mass and, in intervals around the
clock, stop work or rise from their beds to chant the prayers of
``the divine office'' in French and sonorous Latin.
</P>
<P>
   The abbey's chapel is a modern building, almost aerodynamic in
design. But, when the nuns file solemnly into Mass (led by their
abbess carrying a shepherd's crook as a badge of office), and the
scents of incense and candle wax rise from the altar while the
sounds of Gregorian chant soar toward heaven, the modern world
suddenly seems very far away.
</P>
<P>
   The abbey guesthouse and dining room occupy a former outbuilding
of the chateau. Rooms are simply furnished but clean and
comfortable. Baths are shared. The food is simple but good country
cooking with fresh baked bread and produce grown on the abbey farm.
Wine, made from local grapes, is served at most meals.
</P>
<P>
   Meals are served family style at long tables, and guests are
expected to help clean up afterward. The guests are mostly French,
some on retreats or visiting relatives in the abbey, but others are
just passing through and are usually an interesting and convivial
group. There is no fixed charge to stay in the guesthouse, but a
donation of about $25 a night is suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The scenic countryside around Juignac is ideal for long,
meditative walks or leisurely exploring by car. And there are also
interesting things to see farther afield in the Charente.
</P>
<P>
   Although world famous for the excellence of their products,
Cognac and Limoges are not themselves particularly interesting
unless you need a nip or are in the market for china. However,
LaRochelle _ about an hour or so drive from Juignac in the coastal
area known as Charente-Maritime _ is a gem of a town and makes an
ideal day trip.
</P>
<P>
   A Protestant stronghold in the 16th century, LaRochelle was
frequently besieged, and the snug harbor was massively fortified.
Towers and ramparts _ now illuminated at night to dramatic effect _
still guard the port, which is today much favored by French and
English yachts. The cobblestone quays around the inner basin are
lined with cafes and seafood restaurants, and on weekends through
the summer there is an outdoor crafts fair.
</P>
<P>
   The old town, which contains the main shopping area, is no
longer surrounded by walls but preserves several of the old gates.
The main streets, Rue du Palais and Grand Rue des Merciers, are
lined with 17th-century arcaded buildings housing fashionable
boutiques, art galleries, and cafes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the notable public buildings in the Old Town is the City
Hall, an ornate Gothic-style symbolic mini-fortress at the heart of
the great fortress that was LaRochelle. There are also several
distinctive small museums, the most interesting of which for
Americans is the Museum of the New World, devoted to La Rochelle's
flourishing 17th-century trade with Canada, Louisiana, and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   My return to Paris from the Charente was as hassle-free as my
coming. I returned the car at the Angouleme station, boarded a fast
train bound for Paris, leaned back in my seat _ and left the
driving to the French National Railways.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bored with small-town life and craving to be like the older
boys, Christopher Bolton took his first tentative tokes of
marijuana at age 12.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he says, that early dalliance turned into a
$100-a-day habit that kept the Massachusetts teenager shrouded in a
hazy stupor from morning until night.
</P>
<P>
   He found the drug's allure so powerful, he didn't feel any shame
when his struggling single mother confronted him about stealing
$700 she had painstakingly saved to buy a used car. She had stashed
the money inside a wall for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had tears running down her face,'' recalls Bolton, who
used the savings on a week's supply of marijuana. ``That meant
nothing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolton, who was caught with marijuana in his high school locker,
is on probation for four years and undergoing substance abuse
counseling. Now 17, he has been drug-free for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   In growing numbers, youngsters like Bolton have become ensnared
in the lingering perception of marijuana as a relatively benign
drug _ even though many of the plants grown today are several times
more potent and researchers have begun documenting damaging effects
from the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means if Johnny or Mary is smoking one joint a day now,''
says Jerry Manny, a substance abuse psychotherapist at the
Worcester (Mass.) Youth Guidance Center, ``that would be the
equivalent of smoking eight or ten joints a day when the teens'
parents were that age.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is thousands of children and adolescents in the
United States are smoking marijuana so compulsively they are being
forced by the courts, schools and their families into drug
treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the latest year for which data are available, more
youngsters received treatment for abusing marijuana than any other
substance, including alcohol, according to the federal Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 182,000 people under age 20 admitted to substance abuse
programs, 48 percent were treated primarily for marijuana use and
dependence. It's a phenomenom that crosses racial, ethnic and
gender lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is sort of an implicit acceptance, that it is no big
deal,'' says Jerry Duberstein, a psychologist and director of
outpatient services at Team Coordinating Agency in Haverhill, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the consequences are serious in terms of kids. It gets
them off track. They struggle in school. They are not able to hold
onto jobs. They get into trouble in their relationships with their
families and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, improved cultivation methods have yielded
marijuana plants with higher levels of the mind-altering ingredient
THC, tetrahydrocannabinol, say public health and law enforcement
officials who are on the front line of battling the drug and those
who treat the abusers, although they admit hard data are hard to
come by.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, while their parents' generation typically smoked
marijuana rolled into cigarette-sized ``joints,'' some youngsters
favor smoking the much larger ``blunts,'' which are hollowed out
cigars filled with marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Children and adolescents, as a result, are taking in bigger
doses of THC, which recent research has found lingers in body fat
cells for days. That means even after the initial euphoria and
stupor have worn off, the drug continues to impair awareness and
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   As the potency of marijuana has been rising, youngsters
perceptions of the drug's harmfulness has been eroding, resulting
in a tripling of marijuana use among adolescents between 1992 and
1995, according to state and federal reports.
</P>
<P>
   Teens and substance abuse specialists believe society's
vacillating views -- reflected in cycles of expanding and relaxing
penalties and decriminalization and recriminalization of marijuana
in some states -- have led to misconceptions and complacency about
the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Harris, director of the Chelsea (Mass.) Alcohol and
Substance Program, says her difficulty finding quality educational
materials about marijuana brought home the scant attention society
has been paying to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our messages around drinking are clear,'' she says. ``But
there's not much material to educate kids about the harmful effects
of marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the state public health agency spends $7
million a year on substance abuse prevention. It has had public
service campaigns to discourage the use of tobacco, alcohol and
inhalants, but no similar campaign targeting marijuana use.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the federal government launched an anti-marijuana
campaign, which included funding for research on the effects of the
drug and development of materials parents can use to educate their
children about its dangers.
</P>
<P>
   H. Westley Clark, director of the US Center of Substance Abuse
and Treatment, acknowledges that despite the federal effort
``clearly the message is not sinking in in the manner we would like
it to sink in. So we have to figure out a way to deliver it
better.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clark also sees another factor behind the large numbers of
youngsters being treated for marijuana use. Parents may be quick to
send their children into treatment, Clark says, because they
envision them traveling to dangerous neighborhoods to get drugs
from unsavory characters.
</P>
<P>
   Often, however, youngsters have to venture no further than their
own neighborhoods and schools to get the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ducharme, 18, of Boston recalls how casual his
introduction to marijuana was seven years ago while attending a
party with teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just there,'' he says. ``It wasn't planned. It was just
something people did and didn't have a problem with.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducharme eventually began dealing drugs to classmates to support
his marijuana habit, and he says at its worst, it amounted to $200
a day. The teen is now in court-ordered substance abuse counseling
program and has been off drugs for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ducharme and Bolton, who have been in trouble with the law
more than once due to substance abuse, believe their drug use might
have been averted had there been more to keep them occupied after
school.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark says many youngsters find plenty of activities to do
to keep away from drugs and those who abuse them may be
``self-medicating'' because of underlying emotional problems that
parents, teachers and others in the community need to pay attention
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was helping myself,'' Bolton acknowledges of his
marijuana use. ``All it did was put everything on pause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ridiculous,'' adds Bolton, who credits his fiancee with
inspiring him to turn around his life. ``I wasted time. I wasted
money. Trust is the biggest thing I lost, the trust of my family
and teachers. You can throw it away in a millisecond. But it can
take years to get back.''

MEDICAL JOURNAL TORN BY DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers

 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ The words ``Massachusetts Medical Society'' are
deeply chiseled into the granite of the organization's sprawling
new $50 million headquarters on a woodsy campus here. But maybe it
should be ``Massachusetts Medical Publishing Society.''
</P>
<P>
   To a degree few appreciate, the lifeblood and the fortunes of
the 218-year-old Medical Society depend on the renowned New England
Journal of Medicine and, to a much smaller extent, a dozen newer,
lesser-known periodicals. Publishing accounts for 95 percent of the
Medical Society's $73 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   The profits largely flow from the venerable New England Journal,
a weekly that manages to be the planet's most-cited medical journal
and a household word to lay readers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the New England Journal, the Massachusetts Medical
Society commands a total budget that works out to $4,200 for each
of its 17,400 members, only 2 percent of it from dues. By contrast,
the American Medical Association's annual per-capita expenditure is
a mere $843.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just prologue. Medical Society officials made it
clear in interviews last week that they intend to add new
publishing ventures and Internet tie-ins to the 13 periodicals the
organization now publishes. Consultants have told the society that
``branding'' the new ventures with the New England Journal's name
or logo would instantly give them a marketing edge worth many
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Virginia T. Latham, the society's president-elect, insisted
that new publishing and marketing ventures are ``not some
money-making scheme to increase our coffers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find new ways to move the truth,'' added Dr. Jack
T. Evjy, the current president. ``We're awash in medical
misinformation and disinformation. The Massachusetts Medical
Society can make sure the information we publish is the truth _ or
the best estimate of what the truth is.''
</P>
<P>
   But many in Boston's medical community and beyond are wondering
if the Medical Society's leaders are intent on strangling the goose
that lays their golden eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's firing of Dr. Jerome Kassirer as editor-in-chief of
the New England Journal of Medicine capped a fierce, long-running
internal dispute over the editor's prerogative to prevent the New
England Journal's name and prestige from being used to market less
scientifically rigorous journals, Internet bookstore merchandising,
co-sponsorship of drug company conferences and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The fracas that erupted over Kassirer's ouster appears to have
taken Medical Society officials by surprise. By trying to exploit
their enviable assets in a competitive, publish-or-perish world,
they have collided publicly with the old-fashioned
above-the-commercial-fray values that the New England Journal's
defenders say have made it the trusted organ it is.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting that brand name has become an obsession of New
England Journal editors for the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, not long ago Kassirer was incensed to learn that a
scientific conference was being planned in France under the
co-sponsorship of the New England Journal and Merck Liphe, a
pharmaceutical company _ a type of venture to which the journal has
never lent its name. Society officials said last week the
conference was the brainchild of the drug company and that society
lawyers asked the organizers to ``cease and desist'' in the use of
the journal's name. But insiders say a planning meeting had been
held at the Medical Society headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   (In a six-page letter to society members late last week, Evjy
and other officers said Kassirer was not fired but that the society
informed him that ``his contract would not be renewed.'' Kassirer
made no secret of his desire to stay on until 2003.)
</P>
<P>
   Kassirer's firing and its aftermath ``really is a tragedy and it
could be a disaster,'' said Dr. Jane Desforges, a 30-year veteran
of the New England Journal's advisory board, who said on Friday she
is resigning in protest from the nine-member Committee on
Publications, historically a buffer between the journal and Medical
Society politics and business interests.
</P>
<P>
   John Harrington, dean of the Tufts University School of
Medicine, also resigned from the publications committee after the
panel was bypassed on the Kassirer decision. And so did Dr. John
Bailar of the University of Chicago, one of the journal's
statistical consultants. Leading Boston physicians have also quit
as Medical Society members.
</P>
<P>
   Kassirer's firing is far from the end of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal's staff and far-flung constituency are
anxiously watching for smoke signals from the Medical Society
indicating the 187-year-old journal's future direction and how much
independence it will maintain. Chief among these issues:
</P>
<P>
   --Will executive editor Dr. Marcia Angell, who is closely
identified with the prickly Kassirer, be able to hammer out an
agreement to become interim editor with guarantees of
noninterference on matters of both content and journal policy?
</P>
<P>
   --Will the search committee for Kassirer's permanent replacement
be dominated by outsiders with concerns to safeguard the journal's
independence? Or will it be a quest for someone to satisfy the
Medical Society's yearning for ``more collegiality and a sense of
working together,'' as president-elect Latham put it?
</P>
<P>
   --What protections will the next permanent editor of the New
England Journal enjoy against interference on content or policy?
For instance, will the new editor be able to block the interleaving
of drug company ads with scientific studies instead of segregating
ads at the front and back as the publication now does? Will he or
she be able to keep an upper limit on ad pages to guarantee that
the journal, perhaps uniquely, could survive on subscription income
alone?
</P>
<P>
   --Will the Medical Society take advantage of the interregnum to
move the New England Journal's editorial offices from the Harvard
Medical Area to Waltham to be ``part of the same human family, the
same Massachusetts Medical Society culture of service,'' as Evjy
put it?
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling new building, still receiving its finishing
touches, was designed to accommodate the New England Journal and
future publishing ventures. Half its 200,000 square feet are
devoted to publishing, society officials said, compared to
one-third for Medical Society activities and 17 percent for
conference space.
</P>
<P>
   Already, about 200 of the Medical Society's 380 employees work
in the fast-growing publishing division.
</P>
<P>
   The answers to questions about the journal's independence could
begin to emerge this week as negotiations with Angell proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion and skepticism lurk within the journal's staff and
outside panel of editors. At a meeting with Evjy on Thursday, the
journal's six associate editors and four scientific consultants
objected to a recent report from the Committee on Publications that
seemed to suggest new oversight by the society over New England
Journal content, especially when controversies arise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We foresee that the management/business issues will grow in
urgency and complexity while issues of editorial control and
quality will similarly become more complicated,'' the publications
committee report said. ``Our role, as we see it, should be to focus
more on the latter and less on the former.''
</P>
<P>
   Evjy insisted that ``the editorial independence of the New
England Journal of Medicine is not in any way an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Angell says negotiations over her role are continuing. ``I can
assure you that if I become interim editor-in-chief, the New
England Journal of Medicine will continue to have full editorial
independence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is clear that the relationship between the
Medical Society and its prestigious journal are very much in flux.
Evjy said the search committee for the next editor will be charged
with ``clarifying the responsibilities, such as who reports to
whom.''
</P>
<P>
   Kassirer declines to comment publicly, although he reportedly
refused a sum approaching seven figures to say he was leaving
voluntarily and disown anyone who said otherwise. A clue to his
state of mind comes from a May 27, New England Journal commentary
on editorial independence, a matter which he said ``sorely needs
further defining.''
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that publishers should not fault editors ``for failing
to promote business interests that conflict with editorial
obligations,'' Kassirer closed by quoting journalism professor
Philip Meyer. ``As a general rule,'' Meyer said, ``it is neither
illegal nor immoral for a publisher to keep an editor on a short
leash. It's just dumb.''

PILOTS: FREE TO FLY, THE AMERICAN WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of the July 16 crash of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s
airplane near Martha's Vineyard, his judgment as the pilot _
specifically, his decision to fly on a hazy night with
less-than-ideal visibility _ has been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that flying over the water at night makes it even
harder for a pilot to see the horizon, something necessary to make
sure the plane is upright and its wings level.
</P>
<P>
   But if pilot error is determined to be the cause of the
accident, perhaps the fault is not entirely Kennedy's.
</P>
<P>
   In many other places around the world, Kennedy _ who was not
authorized to fly by instrument, only by sight _ would not have
been allowed to fly at night. In the United States, where flying is
considered a right rather than a privilege, there are no such
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand, for example, requires that pilots who are licensed
to fly only when the visibility is good must stay within 25 miles
of a lit airport if they are flying at night. In the Netherlands,
flying by sight is forbidden altogether unless the pilot is also
certified to fly by instruments.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, the rules are more lax. Pilots who fly
by sight can be grounded only if visibility is less than 3 miles
and the clouds are clinging to within 1,000 feet of the ground.
Under those conditions, Kennedy was within his rights to take off
and carry passengers with him.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that the United States will move toward
regulating private pilots who fly at night anytime soon. A major
impediment is the Aircraft Owner and Pilots Association, a powerful
lobbying group of some 340,000 pilots who want to make sure that
private pilots can fly when they want whereever they want.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes referred to as the National Rifle Association of the
sky, AOPA is considered to have more clout on Capitol Hill than the
Air Transport Association, the trade association and lobbying group
that represents the major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, we view the comparison (with the NRA) as a
compliment,'' said AOPA spokesman Warren Morningstar. ``It means
that we are out there effectively defending the interests of our
members and general aviation. But we think today's AOPA is perhaps
more flexible than the NRA may be. We are not unreasonable and when
we find changes need to be made for safety, AOPA is at the
forefront leading the charge.''
</P>
<P>
   AOPA does spend much of its time and resources promoting safety
and training pilots. But it also spends effort promoting its
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my, they are very powerful,'' says Darryl Jenkins, director
of the Aviation Institute at George Washington University. Why?
``Fifteen percent of Congress belongs to AOPA.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, AOPA officials are urging that there not be a rush to
judgment. AOPA president Phil Boyer appeared before Congress seven
days after the crash and urged restraint until the National
Transportation Safety Board determines the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, however, some are saying restricting pilots who fly
by visual flight rules would be a disaster, because most flights
are done in good weather. ``We would lose a huge amount of utility
if we restricted it to daytime,'' one AOPA official said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a call for change, it will likely come from the
NTSB, which has no regulatory power and can only make
recommendations to improve safety. It has never before recommended
that nighttime flying be restricted to pilots who are certified to
fly by instruments only. But the chairman of NTSB does not usually
go to the crash scene of a private plane, either. And chairman
James T. Hall left Washington to oversee his agency's initial
investigation of the crash and was in Massachusetts for several
days.
</P>
<P>
   One effect of crashes like Kennedy's is that they tend to strip
the glamorous veneer off ``general aviation,'' the phrase used in
aviation circles to refer to private planes. One of the great
enticements of being a private pilot or owning an airplane is that
it gives one freedom, not only from the bonds of earth, but also to
travel whereever one wants whenever one wants. But with that
freedom comes risk.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, commercial airline pilots often derisively refer to a
powerful twin-engine private airplane as a ``doctor killer''
because so many doctors _ as well as lawyers, businessmen, and
celebrities _ have died at the controls.
</P>
<P>
   Typical among them was Thurman Munson, the great New York
Yankees catcher. He bought a Cessna Citation jet to get him home to
his wife and children in Ohio after every ballgame. The jet was the
``ultimate convenience,'' said the man who hangered Munson's planes
at the Akron airport. But on Aug. 2, 1979, while practicing
landings, Munson's jet crashed. His flight instructor escaped, but
Munson died in the fiery wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was flying to Hyannis Port for his cousin's wedding, and
had agreed to drop his sister-in-law off at Martha's Vineyard. A
private plane was the perfect mode of transportation for a New York
City couple constantly in the public eye and frequently traveling
on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this really gives the whole idea of general aviation
being the ultimate transportation for wealthy, educated people a
black eye,'' said Norman Komich, a commercial airline pilot who
works for Damos Research, a Los Angeles-based aviation consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   While rules may never be able to take the place of sound
judgment on the part of a pilot, commercial airline pilot Paul
McCarthy and others believe that regulations are needed to protect
passengers from flying with inexperienced private pilots.
Currently, someone with 40 hours of flying time can get a pilot's
license and can take passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilots should have much better training before they are
permitted to carry passengers,'' McCarthy said. ``If you want to go
and kill yourself, go ahead, but I object when you bring someone
along who might not have the skills to make a judgment if it is
safe to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop of uneven regulation, expect to see a
growing number of private planes in the skies.
</P>
<P>
   While the number of pilots and of private plane accidents have
decreased steadily over the last 20 years, the Federal Aviation
Administration's long-range forecasts shows the number of pilots,
the number of private planes, and the hours those planes are flown
will increase steadily through 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Barring regulations to the contrary, at least some of those
pilots will undoubtedly be flying at night, as Kennedy was. And
flying at night in bad weather is unquestionably more dangerous.
According to 1997 figures, the fatal accident rate for general
aviation flights in daytime in good visibility was 0.88 per 100,000
hours of flight. At night, in good visibility, the rate was
slightly lower at 0.78, but at night in bad weather, the rate
jumped to 2.41 fatal accidents per 100,000 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In Kennedy's case, the weather the night he crashed was far from
ideal. Said commercial airline pilot Robert Coopman, ``At night,
over water, and in haze is a bad place for anybody to be.''

`BLAIR WITCH' ACTRESS CAN'T ESCAPE PANIC 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm going INSANE!'' Heather Donahue screams into the phone at
the top of her voice.
</P>
<P>
   But her voice has a different panic than she employs in ``The
Blair Witch Project.'' This is happy panic.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Heather Donahue, actress, plays Heather Donahue,
filmmaker. The same person? No, but close enough to achieve the
filmmakers' intention of making this movie as real as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue is shouting now because the phenomenal success of ``The
Blair Witch Project`` has _ almost overnight _ turned her from a
struggling 24-year-old stage actress, known only in Philadelphia,
to a nonstop interview subject.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in only 27 theaters nationally its first two weeks (two
of those days in only two theaters), ``Blair Witch`` enjoyed a
phenomenal $63,812 per theater average. That's more than five times
what the top film, ``The Haunting,'' did per screen (on 2,808
screens).
</P>
<P>
   The film has done so well that Artisan rushed more prints and
released the film in hundreds more theaters last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knew?'' Donahue says. ``You are joyfully laboring in
obscurity for years, and then somebody flips a switch, and there
you are, going on TV and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from theater, Donahue's only other  &UR;  &LR; acting experience was
a Psychic Hotline commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's painfully true,'' she  &UR;  &LR; says, a bit embarrassed. ``I
was in desperate need of some quick cash.''
</P>
<P>
   The traditional question for anyone in Donahue's position: ``Did
you have any idea?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she says emphatically, starting to laugh. ``I think this
is beyond everyone's wildest expectations for this movie. By
far.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``The Blair Witch Project`` is a low-budget, independent fake
documentary about three filmmakers who go into the woods to shoot a
movie about witch lore. Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua
Leonard not only played the roles, but they shot the footage and
made up their lines, with guidance from absentee directors, writers
and producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave us the outline bit by bit,'' Donahue said. ``We had
a Global Positioning System they would program points into. We
would use GPS to find those points.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got to the points, there would be a milk crate. Inside
would be extra food or water and our notes in little plastic 35 mm
film containers. There were three, each with our initials. We were
not allowed to show them to (each other). So we would have no idea
what the others would be doing during the next several hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the basic instructions and knowing what their characters
were supposed to be like, the actors simply filmed and created the
parts as they went along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all improvised. Everything was one take. Everything. The
key bit of information I needed to create this character is, `she
has to keep shooting no matter what happens.' Everything else is
superfluous to that through-line of the character.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue felt comfortable in the grueling and unusual experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wouldn't,'' she says. ``A lot of people are
saying that's a horrible way to treat actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, nobody held a gun to our heads. We were all very excited
by the way this film was going to be done _ the freedom that gives
you as an actor. You never get to improvise an entire feature.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the actors were in character more often than not, their
real and fictional relationships got confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put three strangers together, sparks are going to
fly,'' Donahue says.
</P>
<P>
   But they also looked after each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had code words to break the scenario. If we said `taco,'
that meant the camera's off, we're taking care of each other and
seeing how we're doing. We pretty much established that from the
beginning. You can't stay in it 24-7 (24 hours a day, seven days a
week).''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is presented to the audience as if it were true, and
the filmmakers have intentionally confused the issue, even on their
Web site (www.artisanent.com/blairwitch). Donahue thinks that's all
part of the fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people want to believe it,'' she says. ``People want
to be scared silly. You go to horror movies because you want that
visceral thrill.''

LAWYERS SAY BIG AWARDS CAN DISRUPT THE FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Some lawyers break their backs all their professional
lives in the hope that one day they'll win a huge jury award. Some
have risked everything on what they thought was the big case,
working day and night, sacrificing personal lives, piling on debt
to pay the enormous expense of taking a lawsuit to trial.
</P>
<P>
   But for some that gambled and won big, the pot of gold at the
end of the rainbow turned into a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that much money comes in, it can be a bloodbath,'' says
Thomas J. Lynch, a Boston personal injury lawyer and former
chairman of the Boston Bar Association's tort committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic. All the time you're struggling, everybody gets
along. It's easy not to have any money. But when the big award
finally comes in, that's when things can get ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch and other Boston lawyers say the industry is rife with
tales of riven friendships and lifelong partnerships dissolved in
bitter disputes over the division of a big award.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent _ and by far the biggest settlement in recent
Massachusetts history _ is the $8.3 billion award from the state's
successful lawsuit against tobacco companies. Brown Rudnick Freed
and Gesmer of Boston, the lead local attorneys, will get a 23
percent cut of the fee, or about $178 million.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is not talking about how that money will be divided
among partners and associates except to say that it has considered
donating a portion to charity and that the money will likely come
in over a period of years because of an agreement with the tobacco
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But observers say that when big awards come in, inevitably some
egos are hurt when individuals receive less than they expected or
when differences arise over whether money should be simply pocketed
by partners or plowed back into the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, small differences between people become
horrendous disputes because there are potentially millions at
stake,'' said Glen DeValerio, a partner in the Boston firm Berman
DeValerio &AMP; Pease. ``A lot of firms have split up over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Few believe such a fate awaits Brown Rudnick, which by Boston
standards is a large enough and stable enough firm to withstand the
pressures of sudden riches, legal industry observers said. At most
large firms, a compensation committee composed of high-ranking
partners decides how to divvy up the spoils, observers said. Often,
such committees meet in secret, and their members can become highly
sought at cocktail parties as outsiders try both to discover the
committees' leanings and influence their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics can become wicked,'' said one former Brown
Rudnick attorney who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Because law firms are partnerships, the partners are always
compensated, whether or not they worked on the case that brought in
the award, observers said. But conflicts often arise when partners
who worked on a case feel like they deserve the lion's share and
other partners feel entitled to a larger share because their work
supported unproductive partners for years preceding the case,
lawyers said. Meanwhile, associates who may have slaved on a case
are at the mercy of the partners for bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Betting on a big settlement and losing, of course, takes its own
toll. Possibly the best known example is Boston lawyer Jan
Schlichtmann, whose firm dived into deep debt to finance his toxic
dumping case against Beatrice Foods and W.R. Grace on behalf of
seven Woburn families. By the time the 78-day trial was over in
July 1986, he had little more than the suit he wore to court,
according to Jonathan Harr's best-selling account, ``A Civil
Action.''
</P>
<P>
   The case against Beatrice was dismissed, and Grace settled for
$8 million, a fraction of what Schlichtmann had hoped to recover.
Financially and emotionally drained, he declared bankruptcy and
moved to Hawaii to try to rebuild his life.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the nature of contingency cases, observers say. ``For
a lot of lawyers, a case like that is a once-in-a-lifetime deal,''
DeValerio said. ``It's like the lottery.''

WHAT'S YOUR SIGN? 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Top of the sixth inning. A Red Sox starting pitcher is
struggling with location. Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan has seen
enough. He steps out of the dugout and is met at the mound by
catcher Jason Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   The gods of baseball want you there, too. There's a Jumbotron
television screen on a wall high above the playing field, showing
images shot by TV cameras that can zoom in so close on the mound
that you can see lips moving.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan knows you're watching. He knows the opposition is
watching _ with a more-than-passing interest in what he's saying.
So the coach raises his hand to his mouth, conveying the message
he's carried to the mound for you:
</P>
<P>
   None of your business.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be offended. It's just the way they play the game within
the game: the attempt to gain and conceal competitive edges. It's
baseball's version of Spy vs. Spy.
</P>
<P>
   From covering one's mouth while relaying a message, to
delivering misleading signs, to color-coding, each team has ways to
ensure security. And at the same time a team is trying to keep an
opponent from decoding its signs, it is doing all it can to figure
out the opposition's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The more you know, the greater your ability to exploit your
adversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more espionage than there was when I came in the
game, because of cameras,'' said Kerrigan. ``You have guys just
trying to get the edge.'' Asked if he ever knew of a team that
employed lip-readers, he said former Boston outfielder Curtis
Pride, who was deaf, could read lips but the Red Sox never asked
him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Though most teams and players are scouted so well that opponents
know what pitch they're liable to throw and when they're apt to
hit-and-run, bunt, steal, or pitch out, there's something to be
said for the added advantage of knowing for certain. Stealing signs
can increase a team's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go back 30 years, to the 1950s or early 1960s, and there
were basically simple signs _ steal, bunt, hit-and-run _ and that
was it,'' said Dick Berardino, the former Lowell Spinners manager
and Red Sox third-base coach. ``Back then, there weren't any signs
to the outfield. Now we have four basic signs to outfielders:
There's one where you're telling him to make sure a ball doesn't go
over his head; another is to move in, so you can have a chance to
throw the runner out at the plate; another is to hit the cutoff
man; another is to get the ball to second base and don't worry
about the runner trying to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increased complexity of nonverbal communication,
Berardino said most signs work best when they're kept simple.
Players become aware of signs early in their careers, but often
signs change as the players move up in the ranks. During spring
training, said Berardino, players _ particularly rookies _ are
encouraged to bring notepads and study the signs each day. But he
added, ``We don't pass out anything, because we don't want it to
get misplaced.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is the bottom of the fifth at Fenway, and Red Sox third base
coach Wendell Kim appears to have misplaced his keys. The man keeps
patting himself down. Then he stands motionless, and the Sox
successfully execute a sacrifice, bunting a runner to second base.
Kim had made the play possible by relaying the proper sign, and
apparently the opposition didn't pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to change rhythm when you're giving signs,''
said Kim. ``And you always have to leave yourself a way out, where
you have an `off' sign; you can put on a sign and then take it
right off.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, if (opponents) see the same thing over and over, see a
touch given or a sign given at a certain place, they say, `OK,
nothing's happening.' All of a sudden, there's a hit-and-run.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all so secretive but, said Kim, not all that complicated.
``Everything is very easy,'' he said. ``When I was a first base
coach, I used to be far away and when some of the rookies didn't
get the signs as well, I would have a color system. Red meant
nothing's on. Green: steal. Blue: hit-and-run. Bunt: maybe black,
the letter `b' _ black, bunt. I don't like to go up and talk to
someone because (the opposition) thinks something's on.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to all this, said Kim, is the indicator, the sign a
coach uses amid meaningless movements to tell a player that an
actual play sign is forthcoming. He said the signs he gets from
manager Jimy Williams are different from those he flashes to
players. The Red Sox indicator, he said, often is a fist raised
forward and above the head. Following that sign, he will begin
patting areas of his jersey that have been designated to signal
plays in certain situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say the bunt is the right side of the chest, the hit-and-run
is the right thigh, the steal is the left side of the chest, and
the squeeze is the left thigh _ now, I'm going to give you a
sign,'' said Kim, raising his fist, then patting each of the
above-mentioned body parts except the right thigh. ``The area that
I don't touch is the sign. I touch all of them, nothing's on. How
simple can you get?''
</P>
<P>
   Another way of organizing signs, said Berardino, is for the sign
to be the first area of the jersey touched after the indicator.
There is also a certain area to touch to indicate you're changing
the indicator.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I coached (with the Sox), the ear was the indicator,'' he
said. ``Then we would have a meeting during a game and change it _
say, the cheek is the indicator. So, I may touch the ear and motion
for the steal, and (opponents) might think the steal is on, but
it's not, because the cheek is now the indicator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you also had a thing where you can take off the sign. It
could be to rub across the chest. So you could give the indicator,
give the bunt, then rub across the chest, so that means I've taken
it off. If you rubbed across the chest first, it meant nothing's
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs most likely used during a game are those flashed by a
catcher to his pitcher to indicate which pitch should be thrown.
They're almost always designated by numbers of fingers (such as one
for fastball, two for curve), but even they can be switched.
</P>
<P>
   Elrod Hendricks, former catcher with the Baltimore Orioles and
New York Yankees and now the Orioles' bullpen coach, said that when
he played for Baltimore every pitcher had his own number system.
``(Jim) Palmer was an easy read, because he basically threw two
pitches, a fastball or curveball,'' said Hendricks. ``He'd come in
and take the first sign that we used. If we wanted to switch signs,
I would give him an indicator _ I'd touch my mask, my chest
protector, or my shin guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, said Berardino, more pitches are being called from the
dugout. ``I had a sitiuation when if a pitcher was pitching and I
wanted to call a pitch, I went across my shoulders and that told
the catcher I was going to call the pitch,'' he said. ``Basically,
the nose was a fastball, the chin was a breaking ball, the bill of
the cap was an off-speed pitch. The one we wanted thrown was always
the last sign you gave.''
</P>
<P>
   The catcher would relay the sign to the pitcher, who had to
throw that pitch regardless of whether he agreed with the choice.
``Now, if the pitcher shook him off, the catcher gave the sign
again,'' said Berardino, ``and that told the pitcher it was coming
from the bench and he had to throw that pitch in that situation. If
he didn't throw it, that's when I went out to the mound and I said,
`Hey, we want that pitch in this situation. We have a reason for
that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There are also signs for throws other than pitches. Upon giving
the no-pitch indicator, said Berardino, ``the ear was a pitchout,
the chin was a slide step _ which was a quick delivery to the plate
_ the nose to step off and throw to first base. Basically, it was
to control the running game.''

STEVENS TO CIRCLE BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On May 29, Gary Stevens rode Real Quiet to a third-place finish
in the Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs, then zipped to
Logan Airport to catch a plane to England, where he was to begin a
new career as stable rider for trainer Sir Michael Stoute. Well,
Stevens's ``new career'' will last three months, as he now plans to
return to the United States at the end of August to ride first call
for The Thoroughbred Corp., the powerful stable owned by Prince
Ahmed Salman, a member of the ruling family of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only for somebody like Prince Ahmed that I would
consider leaving England so soon,'' said Stevens. ``Prince Ahmed
has set up a highly successful operation. He is a very
knowledgeable horseman, and is one of the emerging major players in
world racing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is going, and it is very disappointing,'' said Stoute, who
may hire Kieran Fallon as his contract rider. ``I understand the
situation, and it has been a pleasure to be associated with Gary.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, 36, began riding for Stoute June 1, and has won 33
races overseas. His biggest victory came Saturday aboard 5-1 shot
Zahrat Dubai, a 3-year-old filly, in the Group I Nassau Stakes at
Goodwood. His most noted ride came when he finished third with
promising Beat All in the English Derby in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very exciting news that Gary has agreed to join us,''
said Prince Ahmed. ``I am sure the experience he has gained from
riding in Britain through the summer will add an extra ingredient
to his overall ability.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thoroughbred Corp., which owns an 18-acre facility at
Bradbury Estates, Calif., used to break yearlings, has 45 horses in
training in the United States, and a like number of broodmares, the
majority stationed at Hopewell Farm in Kentucky. The outfit has
horses with trainers Alex Hassinger and Richard Mandella in
California, where Stevens will be based, and with John Kimmel and
D. Wayne Lukas in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have him flying back and forth every day from New
York, but we'll have him ride the major races,'' said Richard
Mulhall, racing manager for The Thoroughbred Corp.
</P>
<P>
   When Stevens left, he gave up the mounts on some top horses
trained by Bob Baffert, including Silverbulletday, last year's
2-year-old filly champion, as well as Real Quiet, who won the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens had a three-month agreement with Stoute, which expires
Aug. 31, but his British wife was said to be homesick and Stevens
planned to stay longer if things went well. Those who talked to him
when he beat his hasty retreat from Suffolk know that Stevens
thought it might be a long time before he rode in the United States
again. As it turns out, we'll see him in September.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He won't fight to the finish
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, beaten a nose by Victory Gallop in Saturday's $600,000
Whitney Stakes at Saratoga, earned 12 points for second to maintain
his lead in the NTRA champions series with 46 points. But trainer
Jim Bond said Behrens will not run in the $1 million Pacific
Classic at Del Mar Aug. 29, the final race in the series and the
one that will determine bonus money.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Behrens's connections will forfeit a shot at some serious
coin. Participation in the Pacific Classic is the key to
eligibility in the NTRA's convoluted bonus system. Bonus points are
worth $5,000 each, but in order to collect anything, a horse must
finish in the top five of the finale of the 11-race series. This
was the NTRA's way of trying to make the Pacific Classic into the
Breeders' Cup Classic of the summer. Apparantly, it's not going to
work.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Classic offers points of 20-12-6, as did the
Whitney, and it looks as if Victory Gallop, second on the list with
28 points, will go. Real Quiet, third with 22 points, has the
Pacific Classic as a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens has had seven races this year, and Bond, who is stabled
at Saratoga, prefers to wait for the $1 million Jockey Club Gold
Cup at Belmont Park Oct. 10 rather that ship cross-country. Victory
Gallop has run only four times in 1999, and Elliot Walden is
willing to take the big bay colt to California.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he runs in the next four to six weeks, it'll be in the
Pacific Classic,'' said Walden.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Baffert had planned to start Real Quiet in the
$250,000 San Diego Handicap at Del Mar Saturday, but changed his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to get beat at the mile-and-one-16th distance, and
I don't want him to get beat,'' said Baffert. ``I'm not going to
run him. There's too many negatives. I don't feel right about it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Class on grass
</P>
<P>
   Yagli is one serious racehorse. The 6-year-old turf standout
captured the $250,000 United Nations Handicap at Monmouth Saturday,
winning with ease under Jerry Bailey at odds of 1-10 ($2.20 to win)
in the time of 2:16 for 1 3/8 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Jade Hunter has run three times this year and has
taken three Grade I races, previously winning the Gulfstream Park
Breeders' Cup Feb. 6 and the Manhattan Handicap at Belmont June 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is a race two weeks from now (the $400,000 Sword
Dancer at Saratoga Aug. 14) that they are looking at, so I didn't
want to make it too hard on him,'' said Bailey, who never drew his
whip in the United Nations.

THE VENICE OF ENGLAND (SORT OF) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, England _ If I'm looking for a doge's palace, the
Bridge of Sighs, or Marco Polo's favorite pizza joint, forget it. I
guess I'm in the wrong Venice.
</P>
<P>
   Venice? Well, a Limey named Simon Kelner, one of London's great
newspaper boys, has told me, ``Birmingham is the Venice of our
north-of-London. The Midlands actually. You'll love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Really? Do they speak Italian? Did Shakespeare's Venetian
loanshark, Shylock, ever refer to his hometown as the Birmingham of
Italy?
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mann wrote a pretty good book called ``Death in Venice,''
and an erratic Italian, Luchino Visconti, did the movie version,
which has its moments. But as far as I know, neither one is working
on ``Death in Birmingham.'' Too bad, said another Londoner, Ann
Burgess, ``because Birmingham is the deadest city in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there are signs of life. Distinctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making a comeback,'' proudly says a Brummy, as the
locals like to call themselves. This particular Brummy, a young
waiter named Peter at the excellent Hyatt hotel, is making a
comeback himself as a refugee from Kosovo, and he likes the
untroubled spirit of his new home. He also likes the 18th-century
canals that penetrate the city, and sometimes takes his girlfriend
for a pleasure barge ride thereon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Venice,'' says he. ``I never been there, but they say
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Aha, the Venice allusion and connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We out-canal Venice, you might say, by a wet nose,'' says a
resident, Diana Best. ``We have 33 miles of canals, and they have
32. Not,'' she smiles, ``that Venice is jealous. Their gondoliers
aren't rushing to work here.''
</P>
<P>
   Many thousands did rush to find jobs, though, when Birmingham
established its worldwide name as a center of the industrial
revolution that ran roughly for a century from 1750. Becoming a
hive of invention and factories, the medieval village expanded
big-time to become England's second-largest city at about 1.5
million souls. But it also became synonymous with tall belching
chimneys, manufacturing grime, and punishing conditions for the
laboring class.
</P>
<P>
   Driving into town you are beset by an array of gray and gloomy
high-rises that would fit nicely into Moscow. Not very encouraging.
But the heart of the city is beating briskly as urban rehab has
delivered marvelous public spaces and buildings radiating from
Centenary Square.
</P>
<P>
   The vast square itself, floored in attractively patterned
brickwork, is bulwarked by the new and sparkling Symphony Hall,
Repertory Theatre, International Convention Centre, and the Hyatt.
Imaginative sculpture, fountains, and floral displays further
brighten the walker's way.
</P>
<P>
   In one direction lie the canals, the waterways connecting the
mills with suppliers of coal and other raw materials. Spanned by
cast-iron foot bridges, the lock-controlled streams wander through
a fresh quarter of boutiques, restaurants, and pubs. Three-story
brick houses and apartments remind you of those alongside
Amsterdam's canals. Nearby is the National Indoor Arena, Britain's
finest sporting haven, and a stunning aquarium called Sea-Life.
</P>
<P>
   In another are historic, traditional structures such as the
pillared-and-domed city hall, guarded by six ferocious bronze
lions, and a clock tower known as Big Brum. Fronting city hall, a
magnificent fountain called ``The Rivers and Youth,'' by Dhruva
Mistry, overflows its round pool. Splish-splash _ it turns into a
waterfall descending a broad stairway into another pool at New
Street where autos are forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   The area is pedestrian paradise, and, of course, ``The Steamer''
_ local boy who made good combustion _ is represented. That would
be James Watt, one of the main men firing the industrial surge, he
with his new-and-better steam engine. Watt shares a townie trio
pedestal in Centenary Square with scientist Matthew Boulton, and
gas-lighting pioneer William Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   But the most affecting sculpture is Tom Lomax's recent ``Spirit
of Enterprise,'' a sort of mob scene depicting the nameless men,
women, and children who did the hard and dirty work in the steel
and textile mills, the potteries and foundries. They reach out for
recognition, their backs to the smokestacks whose billowing clouds
were the toxic flags of Birmingham that the rest of the world
saluted, and tried to duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read all about it here,'' suggests a clerk at Dillon's in New
Street, an ex-bank transformed into a grandiose bookstore with
marble pillars and a high, coffered ceiling. ``We'll industrial
revolutionize you to death,'' he says, pointing to shelves and rows
of volumes. ``Have you visited the Cadbury Chocolate factory?
That's an original here, and will put a very sweet taste on the
town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Best cookies in the world,'' I used to tell my daughter when I
brought them home from England, before they were marketed abroad
and became commonplace everywhere. But I've sworn off that sensual
sin.
</P>
<P>
   Friend Aurelio says, ``Forget sugar. Let's go for salt, as in
saltwater, at Sea-Life _ a fish watcher's dream world.'' And who
doesn't love fish _ on a platter with fries, or in this
free-swimming condition that keeps them out of a chef's reach?
</P>
<P>
   But, like a fast-food emporium, Sea-Life is a franchised
business with a score of aquariums across Britain and the
Continent. They do it very well, at least at this one, where purple
catfish make with cartoonish-faced smirks and sharks gaze at you as
though they wouldn't mind a helping of flesh-and-chips.
</P>
<P>
   However, I find the cleverly-engineered creep-through-the-deep
both exciting and a little unsettling. Stepping off an elevator to
the basement of the Atlantic, you arrive in April 15, 1912. Here in
the recreated radio room of the sunken Titanic you stand on the
ocean bottom, wondering if you should hold your breath, and how
long your personal oxygen will hold out.
</P>
<P>
   All about you maneuver amazing creatures of the depths, some of
them huge, toothy and menacing, while the ghostly voice of the
doomed radio operator pleads for help that will not come in time to
the tragic steamship. Still . . . you are breathing . . . pretty
normally. Thankfully. Definitely, despite a clammy feeling. You
probably won't drown, even though enclosed by myriad marine life so
intimately that it seems you can't avoid scaley contact.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how it's done _ but . . . suddenly a giant stingray
flaps over, flinching me.
</P>
<P>
   ``That damned thing just parted my hair!'' I squeak.
</P>
<P>
   Aurelio shrugs, ``You don't have any hair to part. Why didn't
you put salt on its tail and catch it?''
</P>
<P>
   Much as I adore oceans, I am glad to get out of this magically
chambered one, escape the ``Titanic,'' and surface on the dry,
variegated bricks of Birmingham. I feel like a martini and a plate
of tagliatelle at Papa Hemingway's Venetian haunt, Harry's Bar.
That would shake out my sea legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got your Venice's crossed,'' says Aurelio. ``I think
some balti and a beer will fix you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Balti?
</P>
<P>
   ``A very big cuisine here,'' she says, having explored.
``Pakistani cooking brought in by an influx of immigrants.
Specifically Kashmeri. As hot as one of Watt's steam engines,''
salivates she of the asbestos taste buds. ``Kind of Indian, but
with different spices, marinades, and lots of chopped coriander
leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   We have a chicken-and-spinach meal at King Balti on Lady Pool
Road. Very good. But a considerably less torrid portion for me
because I don't know how to call the fire department in Pakistan,
Venice, or even Birmingham.''

MARKET FRETS OVER SPECTER OF RISING INFLATION, RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We may have a new economy, but at the moment, the stock market
is worried about a very old problem: the possibility that rising
inflation and rising interest rates will spoil the party.
</P>
<P>
   History suggests there is reason to be concerned. Over the past
50 years, that same combination has proved lethal to the stock
market time and time again. The question for investors is: Will
history repeat itself?
</P>
<P>
   Since 1950, there have been twelve years when the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Index has declined, according to Mark Zandi, chief
economist at Regional Financial Associates. In 11 of those 12
years, Zandi reports, inflation was accelerating and interest rates
were rising.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception to the rule was 1982, when a miserable
recession was responsible for the market's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to be a graybeard to remember most of these
periods. Anyone old enough to have been at Woodstock (the original,
not this summer's poor imitation) can recall the inflation buildup
in the late 1960s, the result of an overheated economy. Prices
rose, interest rates rose, and in 1970 the stock market tumbled in
response.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974 the market fell sharply. Once again the culprits were
inflation and interest rates, this time triggered by a big run-up
in oil prices. In 1987, a steady rise in rates, exacerbated by
weakness in the dollar, contributed to the crash in October. The
market swooned again in 1990 when a spike in oil prices associated
with the Persian Gulf War caused _ you guessed it _ an increase in
inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interest rates, stupid,'' says Allen Sinai, offering the
simplest explanation possible for market corrections. And in most
cases, says Sinai, chief economist at Primark Decision Economics,
rates rise because inflation is climbing or because investors think
it will climb.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market's response to the deadly duo is not hard to
fathom. Rising inflation all but guarantees the Federal Reserve
will boost interest rates, which heightens the possibility that the
economy will slow sharply. ``Soft landings are risky business,''
says Nicholas Perna, chief economist at Fleet Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
   Rising rates boost the cost of borrowing and make fixed-income
investments more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   So where do we stand at the moment?
</P>
<P>
   Zandi estimates that inflation is currently running at 2 percent
a year, up from 1.5 percent last year. That is hardly an alarming
jump, but the numbers are moving in the wrong direction from the
stock market's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond Monday was 6.11 percent,
up roughly a full percentage point since the beginning of the year.
``Normally you would expect a 15 percent drop in the stock market
just from the rise in rates alone,'' says David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, a Lexington forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The market instead has held its ground, in part because there is
still a lively debate under way about what comes next. The
pessimists fear the prospect of rising inflation and a too-strong
economy will force the Federal Reserve to keep boosting rates,
which could lead to a correction. The optimists say the economy
will slow on its own and inflation will stay under control.
</P>
<P>
   The economic news of the past few days has provided support to
both camps. The worriers point to last Thursday's employment cost
index, which showed wages and benefits rising at their fastest pace
since 1991. They also note that new home sales and income data
suggest an economy that is still barreling along.
</P>
<P>
   But the optimists have their own numbers _ last week's gross
domestic product report that put second-quarter growth at a
nonthreatening 2.3 percent and Monday's National Association of
Purchasing Management report that indicated the manufacturing
sector is growingly moderately.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years the optimists have carried the day. Each
time it looked as if rising rates and inflation were about to
become a big problem the threat has melted away. Is that because
we've been lucky or because the new economy is able to overcome old
problems the way Superman can leap tall buildings in a single
bound?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? The lessons of history are clear enough. What's
trickier is figuring out when to apply them.

`BLAIR WITCH' ACTOR FINDS FAME IN WOODS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an actor, Joshua Leonard isn't lost in the woods anymore.
</P>
<P>
   He not only has a hit film, ``The Blair Witch Project,'' but he
also is the first member of its cast to crack the big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite a thrill to be able to call my parents last week
with the news that I'll be in a film with Robert De Niro and Cuba
Gooding Jr.,'' Leonard, calling from San Francisco, said.
</P>
<P>
   He was there to make ``City of Bars,'' another independent film
like ``The Blair Witch Project.'' The De Niro movie will be a
big-budget action picture, ``Navy Diver.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's parents are Bob and Joanne Leonard, who live in State
College, Pa. Bob Leonard teaches at Penn State University, while
Joanne Leonard runs a theater school for children.
</P>
<P>
   They were living in Houston when Leonard was born June 17, 1975,
at Methodist Hospital. Leonard was in Houston for three years while
his father directed at the Alley Theater, and his memories are
vague. But he did return to visit his grandmother and go to summer
camp.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he's worked in obscure independent films in New
York, both as an actor and as a photographer. Both skills helped
him land the ``Blair Witch`` role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair Witch`` was another indie project with a low budget and
virtually no expectation of commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't made as a career move or a vanity project, but as
a challenging exercise with the resources we had,'' Leonard said.
``It's surprising that it's paid off, but it feels good.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents were also amazed. But since both work in the
theater, they've always encouraged their son's acting pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents have been very supportive,'' Leonard said. ``But
they've also been very realistic, since few people get the chance
to make their living as an actor. They tried to prepare me for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard absorbed much of his acting training informally, while
growing up around theater and actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trained in Method acting,'' he said, ``but `Blair
Witch' was about as Method as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   To play student filmmakers who become lost while probing a
witchy legend, Leonard, Heather Donahue and Michael Williams spent
six days in the woods, shooting 18 hours of footage while
improvising scenes based on instructions from their
writer-directors, Ed Sanchez and Dan Myrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 10 hours of footage wasn't usable, because it was just
Heather and me arguing,'' Leonard said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stress did get a little real. We were stuck together, we
couldn't break character, we couldn't call home or order out, and
personality clashes came into play. You're cold, tired, hungry and

REAL DEAL FOR ANELKA _ FINALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bidding for Nicolas Anelka has ended where it began last
May. Anelka, 20, will leave Arsenal to join Real Madrid in a $36.6
million transfer that was marked by an incredible amount of
international intrigue, accusations, bluffing, deception,
posturing, threats, and lawyering.
</P>
<P>
   There must be more than coincidence in that Anelka was born in
Versailles, 70 years after the signing of a treaty that would play
a large part in shaping modern history. This negotiation was far
less significant, but it probably attracted nearly as much
attention and became nearly as complicated as the Treaty of
Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   Real Madrid began the bidding last season, and on May 25 Anelka
reached an agreement worth nearly $3 million annually in salary
through 2005 with a buyout clause of about $50 million, but
apparently no transfer fee to be paid to Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenal rightfully protested to FIFA about the methods and
timing of Santos Marquez, the agent who negotiated the deal for
Real Madrid, and all bets were called off.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio soon entered the scene, offering about $35 million to
Arsenal plus a five-year salary worth $3.5 million annually. Lazio
had just sold Cristian Vieri to Inter for $50 million, though, and
Arsenal decided to raise the asking price. Eventually, Lazio raised
the offer and added Croat striker Alen Boksic as a sweetener.
</P>
<P>
   But things became complicated along the way. Anelka went on
vacation, leaving affairs to his brothers, Claude and Didier,
agents Francois Larios and Marc Roger, and attorney Marguerite
Fauconnet. Juventus appeared, offering French striker Thierry
Henry, who was coveted by Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger.
</P>
<P>
   Anelka declared a dislike for Turin, said he would not play for
a team that was not in the Champions League, would not return to
London. His brothers said he would sit out the season in Paris.
Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti finally said, ``Basta.'' Arsenal
withdrew its accusations of Real Madrid. And Real Madrid president
Lorenzo Sanz announced the acquisition of Anelka during the
weekend, with the contract to be finalized Tuesday (Aug. 3).
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing was a power struggle,'' Wenger said, ``an
affair among personalities interested more than anything in money
than in the career of a young player.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, all of this time and trouble was devoted to a player
who was not even chosen by coach Aimee Jacquet for the national
team when France won the World Cup last year. Certainly, Anelka was
worthy of being on a team that included strikers such as Cristophe
Dugarry and Stephane Guivarc'h. But one can only wonder what
Anelka's price would be had he contributed to France's
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Anelka was considered the final piece of the Lazio puzzle after
Cragnotti acquired Kennet Andersson, Simone Inzaghi, and Argentines
Roberto Sensini, Diego Simeone, and Juan Sebastian Veron.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio seems capable of succeeding, anyway, especially if
Roberto Mancini returns for a final season. Lazio took a 3-2
victory over Ajax to win a preseason tournament in Amsterdam Sunday
with a strike duo of Boksic and Inzaghi.
</P>
<P>
   And Arsenal does not yet seem to miss Anelka. The Gunners
defeated Manchester United, 2-1, in the Charity Shield at Wembley,
the final major warmup to the English League season. Both goals
involved Nwankwo Kanu, the Nigerian who will replace Anelka. Kanu
converted a penalty, then freed Ray Parlour for the second goal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Best-kept secret
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elias Montes is among the best Boston-based athletes who has not
yet performed for his team in the area. Montes, a 25-year-old
striker, scored both goals in his Boston Bulldogs debut, a 2-0
victory over the Rochester Rhinos before a crowd of 13,183 at
Frontier Field in Rochester, N.Y., Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Montes is playing for the A League team on loan from his club in
El Salvador, and is likely headed for the MLS or Europe next. His
goals _ a sliding conversion of a Tom Poltl cross in the 56th
minute and a finish of a long clearance from goalkeeper Anthony
Latronica in the 86th minute _ kept the Bulldogs in playoff
contention and also led to the Rhinos' first home loss of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Montes, who played for El Salvador in a 4-2 loss to the US in a
World Cup qualifier at Foxboro Stadium Nov. 16, 1997, will make his
Bulldogs home debut against Connecticut Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Losses mounting
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things have not gone well for Ajax since it defeated the
Revolution, 2-1, in an exhibition July 21. Ajax went from
Foxborough to Giants Stadium, where it finished last in the Gotham
Cup, tying Aston Villa and losing to Panathinaikos. And last
weekend, it finished last in its own tournament in Amsterdam,
losing to Santos (4-1) and Lazio.

CBS'S RESHUFFLED FOOTBALL TEAM HUDDLES UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first NFL regular-season game is not until Sept. 12, but the
CBS announcers are back in New York reacquainting themselves with
each other and getting news from the field.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has its own news. Its pregame show, ``The NFL Today,'' has
been revamped. George Seifert is gone, off to coach the Carolina
Panthers. Jerry Glanville, the good ol' boy from Fox, replaces
Seifert, so the loudness quotient just went up exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   Glanville said his Southern accent plays well in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a love affair,'' Glanville said jokingly. ``They don't
know what I'm saying and when they are cussing me out, I don't know
what they are saying.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, only in America can a guy make more money talking about
football then actually coaching,'' Glanville said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Allen is still with CBS, but instead of sitting in the
studio, he is scheduled to do feature stories each week.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Jones was also in the studio last year, but he will be
teamed with Gus Johnson to call games.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Cross and Craig James are the other new additions to CBS's
pregame show, joining Jim Nantz. Their liveliness is sure to jolt
what was considered a disappointing show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be boring,'' Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   Sean McManus, president of CBS Sports, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business, you live and die by public perception, and
if you are not willing to change, then you are doomed to failure,''
McManus said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's schedule starts with a great matchup between the Patriots
and New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the AFC East will be the toughest division in
football, and some of the CBS analysts predict that whoever comes
out on top there has a good chance of winning the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Simms, CBS's lead analyst, hates making predictions but
conceded that the Jets, Denver Broncos, and Jacksonville Jaguars
are clearly the preseason favorites to dominate the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the one thing I know,'' Simms said. ``There will be a
big game every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms is right about that.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are not out of the running, but a lot depends on
Drew Bledsoe having a good year and whether coach Pete Carroll can
motivate his team.
</P>
<P>
   Glanville, who will work three Patriots exhibition games with
Don Criqui, said, ``As long as you have a good quarterback, you
always have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Dierdorf is back with CBS after a 13-year stint on ABC's
``Monday Night Football.'' Dierdorf, one of the greatest on the
field and in the booth, will join Vern Lundquist and is excited
about working in a two-man booth as opposed to a three-man setup on
ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to getting back to the X's and O's of the
game,'' Dierdorf said. `` `Monday Night Football' is a specialized
presentation of the game. It's heavily directed and heavily
produced. They have 20-plus cameras and want to use all of the
artistic shows they can get.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fox not quick enough
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fox brought nine cameras to Saturday's Yankee-Red Sox game at
Fenway. The network caught everything that moved on the field for
three hours, earning a sensational 10 rating with a 30 share. But
it missed the key hit of the game _ a John Valentin smash down the
left-field line that Fox officials claimed was blocked from the
network's first base camera because a fan suddenly stood up.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   What about the eight other cameras?
</P>
<P>
   Network spokesman Dan Bell said that by the time Fox realized
the camera was blocked, it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to go to the runner crossing the plate,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   That was too bad. For all the good work the network has done
with baseball, a missed shot of such importance is almost
inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   20/20 hindsight
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``20/20'' show that featured tennis player Alexandra
Stevenson and her mother pulled high numbers Friday night. Overall,
the show earned a 9.4 rating and 17 share. The segment in which
Barbara Walters interviewed the Stevensons pulled a 10.5 rating and
19 share.

ALL ABOARD FOR A LUXURY TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, there is still glamour in transportation. You won't find it
on airplanes, where passengers wear jeans and glum expressions. Nor
will you find it on buses or most trains. Note that we said
``most'' trains.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Great South Pacific Express offers an excursion with
the kind of glamour that makes the journey as important as the
destination _ even when the destination is a great city such as
Cairns, Brisbane, or Sydney. Passengers are enveloped in luxury,
scenery, and service. They dine regally, too.
</P>
<P>
   What impresses people as they step aboard is how this
maroon-and-gold train looks old yet new. And no wonder: the
20-carriage Great South Pacific was recently built in Queensland by
120 craftspeople who re-created the style of another century, with
interior walls of solid red cedarwood with myrtle burl panels.
Overhead are stained-glass clerestory roofs. Underfoot, even in the
narrow corridors, are rich carpets. Throughout, there is the
monogram of the Great South Pacific, on everything from towels to
tablecloths, as well as nice touches such as fringed lamps. Even
something as pedestrian as a hair dryer comes ensconced in a velvet
bag.
</P>
<P>
   Regular service began this year. The train currently can
accommodate 92 passengers in 12 sleeping cars. Talking with some of
those passengers, you hear high praise for the luxury, the look,
the steward service, and the meals _ breakfast and afternoon tea in
the sleeping cars, and five-course gourmet dinners in the two
dining cars. Not everyone finds the clacks and clanks of the train
in the night conducive to sound sleep; yet some find the sounds
restful. In any event, the train's suspension is being changed to
ensure a smoother ride, and Australia has a long-term program of
track improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers on the Brisbane-Cairns (and vice versa) trip ride
past the rain forest and get a close-up view of a waterfall. But
they also see fields, farms, and forests, and many easily spot
cattle, emu, and, of course, kangaroos. Along the way there is a
stop, with an excursion by air for a daylong trip to the Great
Barrier Reef. In all, the trip takes about 45 hours. The other
route is Brisbane-Sydney, which takes about 18 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Great South Pacific Express, in partnership with Queensland
Rail, is the latest member of the Venice-Simplon Orient Express
family. For more information, call 800-524-2420 or visit
www.orient-expresstrains.com/. The two-night Brisbane-Cairns trips
begin at $1,430 US, with breakfast, afternoon tea, dinner, and the
Great Barrier Reef excursion included. The Brisbane-Sydney journeys
begin at $1,000 US. And the cost of the combined route begins at
$2,190 with an additional $70 for Brisbane hotel accommodations.
But what price glamour? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: Which country leads the world in emerald production?
(Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: Montana is nicknamed the Treasure State. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``No other land could so longingly and so beseechingly
haunt me, sleeping and waking . . . as that one has done.'' _ Mark
Twain, on Hawaii. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Today's loopy law: Carmel, N.Y., has the good taste to forbid a man
from going outside in a jacket and pants that do not match. &QL; 
 &QL; 
One singular sensation: Nothing irritates a solo travelers more
than the so-called single supplement _ a sometimes hefty surcharge
imposed on a person occupying a room alone. But at Overseas
Adventure Travel, which specializes in trips to exotic destinations
for mature travelers, you can ask to be matched with a roommate of
the same gender. If no person is found, you'll have a room to
yourself at no extra charge. Seven of the Cambridge-based company's
16 trips cost under $200 a day. And next year, prices of 11 trips
will drop even further. Overseas Adventure Travel trips, limited to
16 per group, include African safaris, Nile River cruises,
explorations of the Galapagos, and several other destinations. For
information or a catalog, call 800-955-1925. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tea time: Up to the 19th century, blocks of tea were used for money
in Siberia. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? Colombia.

SENIORS ARE ON THE GO AND TOUR OPERATORS KNOW IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All I wanted was a cup of coffee; what I also received was a
dose of senior power.
</P>
<P>
   The Burger King just off Route 2 in Greenfield, Mass., was my
last chance for coffee before hitting Interstate 91, heading to
Bennington, Vt. I said ``coffee,'' and the cashier replied ``senior
special.'' I don't think of myself as a senior, but after expecting
to pay at least $1 and being charged just 30 cents, I guess I might
accept that status.
</P>
<P>
   In the travel world, ``senior,'' or ``mature'' as some tour
companies like to say, begins as early as age 50. The best deals,
though, begin at 60, 62, or 65. So do as I did: Accept your senior
status and realize you have travel power. After all, more and more
tour firms and destinations are courting the mature audience with
deals. And don't think that just because you've reached senior
status you're over the hill. Active or adventure travel is the
fastest-growing senior travel market.
</P>
<P>
   Tour operators are redefining their programs to cater to this
group. According to the National Tour Association, the next wave of
senior citizens is quite different from the present 64-and-over
market. The new senior is seen as more independent, leaning toward
cruising, liking the upscale, having special interests, and being
fitness-conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Circle Travel, a Boston-based firm that has catered to
senior travel for more than 40 years, also owns Overseas Adventure
Travel, a 20-year veteran in adventure tours, and Vermont Bicycle
Touring, a 27-year-old pioneer in bike tours in New England and
elsewhere. Those recent purchases reflect the changing interests of
the mature market.
</P>
<P>
   Travel has become a passion for many people over 50. One senior
wrote to Grand Circle saying, ``Never mind that I have spent my
children's inheritance. I have seen the Great Wall, viewed the Taj
Mahal, and rode a camel to the pyramids.''
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't have to break the bank or mortgage the future,
either. Many seniors are finding their disposable income is up and
the cost of travel is down. Elderhostel, which specializes in
learning tours around the world, uses college dorms in many
programs to cut costs. Interhostel, another international
study/travel program (this one sponsored by the University of New
Hampshire), also utilizes colleges around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers, even those just 50, will find discounts on
accommodations, dining, entrance fees, rental cars, and more if
they ask. Seniors, and others, should also take advantage of
savings offered by organizations such as AAA or the American
Association of Retired Persons. There are publications keyed to
this group: The Mature Traveler: Travel Bonanzas for 49ers-Plus is
a newsletter that has been around for some time, and is filled with
deals and information. Travel 50 &AMP; Beyond is a quarterly magazine
with information ranging from deals to health matters. Arthur
Frommer's Budget Travel, a monthly magazine, has good deals for all
ages.
</P>
<P>
   Most American airlines offer discounts of 10 percent to those 62
and older on many flights. American, Delta, Continental, TWA, and
United offer seniors discount coupons. Amtrak offers those 62 and
older 15 percent discounts on most trains; Rail Europe offers
seniors 60 and older various discounts.
</P>
<P>
   To keep costs low, Durgan Travel Service in Stoneham
(800-234-9959) schedules many of its trips to Italy and elsewhere
for the spring, fall, or late winter to take advantage of the
lowest air and land rates, as well as comfortable temperatures. For
independent travelers, vacationing in the ``off-season'' makes good
sense _ prices are lower and the weather is still good.
</P>
<P>
   Another way seniors save is to stay in one place. Untours, a
Pennsylvania company, has been specializing in two-week stays in
private homes or apartments in Europe and elsewhere for years. The
company makes all the arrangements, and even has a local
representative to help in touring and with any problems. Collette
Tours, a Pawtucket, R.I., firm that has been in business 80 years,
now features ``hub and spoke'' programs, focusing on a smaller area
and longer stays at one or two places in the region rather than
covering a lot of ground and moving each day.
</P>
<P>
   Cruises are a growing area for seniors, and are definitely no
longer just for the sedentary crowd. Saga Holidays, another
Boston-based firm that specializes in travel for those 50 and
older, has its own cruise ship, the Saga Rose. The ship is the
former Cunard Sagafjord and carries up to 583 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting new concept is offered by the World Cruise Co.,
which specializes in world cruises at low cost. For example, a
Voyage through History cruise March 25-July 19, 2000, visits 35
ports in 29 countries and costs under $10,000 a person, including
air travel, meals, wine, lectures, and the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   World Cruise is associated with Marine Expeditions, a
Toronto-based company that offers affordable expedition cruises to
places such as the Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea for senior travel is to volunteer for service
projects. Elderhostel features service programs where hostelers
``learn by doing'' with organizations such as Global Volunteers,
which has programs just about everywhere. For information, write to
Elderhostel, Dept. M1, PO Box 1959, Wakefield, MA 01880; or
telephone 877-426-8056.
</P>
<P>
   Many programs offered by the following companies are
all-inclusive (meals, transportation, hotels, etc.). The best bet
is to request catalogs from each, then choose the tour that best
fits your needs:
</P>
<P>
   Grand Circle Travel, 347 Congress St., Boston, MA 02210,
telephone 800-248-3737; Saga Holidays, 222 Berkeley St., Boston, MA
02116, 800-343-0273. Vantage Travel, 111 Cypress St., Brookline, MA
02146, 800-322-6677.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies also offer handy guides for seniors. For
example, Vantage offers a free ``99 Travel Tips for Mature
Travelers'' as well as a health guide.
</P>
<P>
   A new firm specializing in small group tours (12-24 guests) of
13 to 21 days with appeal to seniors is Odysseys Unlimited of
Watertown. For information, call 800-239-0329. While the company is
new, it has been serving nonprofit groups for 10 years. Its catalog
is worth the call.
</P>
<P>
   For information on World Cruise Co. trips, call 888-558-0887.
</P>
<P>
   For information on Marine Expeditions, telephone 800-263-9147.
</P>
<P>
   Interhostel, an international study/travel program service
sponsored by the University of New Hampshire, offers 75 programs
annually for those 50 and older. For a catalog, call 800-733-9753
or write to University of New Hampshire, 6 Garrison Ave., Durham,
NH 03824.
</P>
<P>
   For information on Untours, write to Idyll Ltd., PO Box 405,
Media, PA 19063, or call 610-565-5242.

<P>
   For information on Collette Tours, call 800-340-5158.

<P>
   For information on Global Volunteers, call 800-487-1074 or write

   BRITAIN-FOOD (London) _ In a country synonymous with
eccentricity, nothing could be more eccentric than Britain's food
culture. Notoriously indifferent to good food, the English
nevertheless feast on some of the best television cooking shows
anywhere in the world. Traditionally resistant to eating out, they
lavish love and attention on their favorite chefs. When Delia Smith
made omelets on her television show a few months ago, egg sales in
Britain rose by the millions. Perhaps most surprising is the fact
that London is now one of the world's most exciting restaurant
cities. And it is largely on the strength of home-grown chefs, many
of them dedicated to reworking and reinventing a native culinary
vocabulary that many people had given up for dead. It's all very
odd. Some of the best French food in London is not being cooked by
French chefs. And some of the best food, period, is English. By

a chord with diners: ``confit.'' It is so effective, in fact, that

 TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... running game.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But even as coaches and managers work to keep signs as simple as
possible, Berardino said some veterans still miss signs and often
there are still communication woes concerning them. His most
memorable sign-related blunder came during the ninth inning of a
Red Sox-Minnesota Twins game a few years ago, after Ellis Burks led
off with a double and Steve Lyons stepped to the plate. Sox manager
Joe Morgan gave Berardino the bunt sign to give to Lyons, but the
manager forgot to give the indicator.
</P>
<P>
   ``(When Twins manager) Tom Kelly went to the mound, Lyons came
to me and said, `You didn't give me the bunt,' and I told him Joe
never gave me the indicator,'' said Berardino. ``I wanted to make
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Berardino said he had a sign with which he could ask Morgan to
repeat a previous sign, but Berardino couldn't get the manager's
attention. ``Joe would sometimes walk up in the dugout and pick up
a bat and swing it,'' he said, ``because that was Joe Morgan.''
Berardino waved and even whistled a few times, but no one in the
dugout paid any attention to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Lyons to pull the ball until you get two strikes so we
can move Burks to third,'' he said. But Lyons jumped on the first
pitch he saw, popping up to third. The Red Sox failed to score in
the inning and eventually lost the game in extras. Morgan was
livid.
</P>
<P>
   Between the ninth and 10th innings, recalled Berardino, Morgan
asked why he didn't give the bunt sign, ``and I told him, `You
didn't give the indicator.' He thought about it and realized he
didn't, and uttered something that I'm not going to repeat. I told
him the press was going to get all over him for it, but he took the
heat and said it was a breakdown in communication.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which team has been the best over the years at stealing signs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Milwaukee, at one point, was,'' said Hendricks, standing in
the Baltimore clubhouse one day recently. ``(Paul) Molitor and
(Robin) Yount and those guys were really good. I don't know why.
They had that center-field camera in their clubhouse, and within
two batters they could come down and tell those guys what was
coming on.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Hendricks turned to fellow coach Eddie Murray, getting
dressed in the locker beside him. ``Wouldn't you say Milwaukee was
pretty good at one time picking up signs?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mmm, yeah, they did it, and probably Cleveland,'' said Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just guessing there,'' said Murray. ``They hit good all the
time, and you start seeing people do stuff and you start to think
that that was what it is, they're trying to give that away.''
</P>
<P>
   The art of relaying signs is simple. The art of decoding is much
trickier _ and much more controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most controversial way of stealing signs involves
advancing a runner to second base, who then relays to the batter
the catcher's signs or indicates where the catcher is setting up
for the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a righthanded hitter and he gives you an inside
location, that means it's usually going to be a fastball,'' said
Kim. ``Only thing is if he gives outside location, it can either be
a fastball or curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give pitches, then it's a different story. A curveball
is usually going to be over the plate or away if you're a
righthanded hitter. A fastball could be anywhere _ in, out, high,
up and in, down and away. But curveballs usually don't break at you
and break in at the inside corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving signs to the batter from second base is a violation of
baseball etiquette, as it is when a batter turns around to spy on
the catcher's signs. But there are no rules prohibiting these
practices. And some say it always has been a part of baseball.
Others say it is becoming more and more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's viewed both ways, I think,'' said Varitek. ``When I first
got into pro ball out of college, it was really instilled into you
that you do (give signs from second base) and you're going to get
somebody plunked.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are teams that do it. Toronto does a real good job
of doing it. The Marlins did it. The Yankees do it. Some of those
teams relay signals when they can, so you have to be constantly
aware of it, to change your sequence and try to do the best you can
to set up late.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks said this also was common back when he played. ``There
are ballclubs _ Yankees, Toronto, Minnesota, at one time
Milwaukee,'' he said. ``Boston did it. Anaheim did it. Kansas City
couldn't wait to get to second base to get location.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was your job as a catcher to cross them up. All that needs
to be done is one time'' _ such as when the batter leans toward the
plate expecting an outside pitch and instead gets a high-inside
fastball. ``Then the hitter says, `Wait a minute, whoa, I almost
got hit in the head here, looking for something else outside.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Television has fueled teams' attempts to steal signs. ``Certain
teams use monitors in their dugout to try to steal signs. You have
to continue to switch,'' said Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, playing for Billy Martin, he was one of the best at
it, trying to get the signs any way he could. He had a camera right
in his dugout, and he would use it to his team's advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan said there is currently a team _ he declined to name it
_ that uses a camera posted behind the center-field fence. ``I know
there are a lot of suspicions about that team and about that camera
man.''
</P>
<P>
   How do you counter such tactics?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we remedy that with our own solution,'' said Kerrigan.
``I won't tell you how we do it, but we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan added that some teams try to detect motions to exploit
``when a guy is warming up, before he gets into the ballgame.''
Teams pick up habits in a pitcher's motion on certain pitches. For
instance, Berardino said that at one time the Red Sox were able to
hit Kevin Appier well because someone detected that the Kansas City
pitcher positioned the glove over his head for fastball deliveries
and put it level with his face for breaking balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They finally figured out why we were hitting him,'' said
Berardino, ``so he just went over his head all the time. Everybody
has idiosyncrasies. There are pitchers who stick their tongue out
when they throw a breaking ball and not on a fastball. You see that
tongue come out, and then you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Some pitchers give away their pitches by how they hold the ball
in the glove before winding up. Or by how long they hold the ball
in the glove. How far from their chest they hold the glove. Whether
they turn the ball in the glove to find the seams. Whether they
tilt the glove. How they take the ball out of the glove.
``Sometimes they wiggle it on a fastball and not on a curveball,''
said Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   Difficult to say how all of this figures in wins and losses,
whether teams that are best at signs _ keeping theirs hidden or
detecting others' _ see more success than the rest. But you never
know when it might come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of a lip-reader comes up again. Did Berardino ever
know of a team that used a lip-reader to detect what was being said
on the mound? ``No,'' he said with a sly smile, ``but that's a
possibility.''

TV'S FORCED ENLIGHTENMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forgive me if I refuse to bend my knee and genuflect at the
unholy altar of suddenly enlightened television executives and
producers who've just realized there are talented actors of color
in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because people watch nonsense such as ``When Animals
Attack,'' ``Providence,'' and ``Nash Bridges,'' TV execs smugly
assume we must be stupid enough to believe that two months of
high-profile complaint and protest by several black and Latino
organizations have absolutely nothing to do with the recent
additions of minority characters to several shows. See, out of more
than two dozen new programs due to debut next month on the four
major networks _ ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox _ not one features a lead
actor or actress of color. And most hadn't had any black, Asian, or
Latino characters at all.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the schedules were unveiled last spring, oodles of
air and ink have been spent discussing this lack of minority
characters. Several groups, including the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, and the National Council of La
Raza, have been outraged by what NAACP president Kweisi Mfume
rightfully called the ``virtual whitewash in programming.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, some producers claimed they simply couldn't find
minority actors suitable for their shows. But as the heat
increased, the networks flipped the script. In the past week,
there's been a flurry of casting additions on a number of new and
returning programs, and wouldn't you know it, most are actors of
color. Even NBC _ which should stand for Nothing But Caucasians as
far as its comedies are concerned _ is considering adding minority
characters to ``Suddenly Susan'' and ``Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   Some show creators claim these additions were in the works long
before all those angry people started dropping the R-word, and it's
nothing more that coincidence that they are being announced now.
</P>
<P>
   On the addition of black actress Rachel True to his new ABC
drama, ``Once and Again,'' cocreator Ed Zwick said, her role ``was
written about three months ago. The NAACP announced its boycott
about three weeks ago. This is something we had planned.'' He
added: ``We don't cast according to any kind of perceived pressure
or agenda. We cast according to what is appropriate to the part.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Williamson, who created WB's ``Dawson Creek,'' and will
add yet another drama about young pretty white people,
``Wasteland,'' to ABC's lineup, said that it was more enlightenment
than pressure that persuaded him to include a black character, to
be played by Jeffrey D. Sams. Said Williamson, who is gay, ``I feel
like my eyes have been opened a little bit wider. It's not
pressure, it's `Kevin, wake up.' I'm a minority, I get it.''
</P>
<P>
   To borrow a line Spike Lee once borrowed from former Georgetown
University men's basketball coach John Thompson, I'm not drinking
the Kool-Aid.
</P>
<P>
   Do not believe for a moment that those who create television
shows and control the major networks _ and they are still
overwhelmingly white males _ have undergone some great epiphany, or
have at last heeded the better angels of their natures. This is
about the endless questions they've had to bob-and-weave during the
Television Critics Association's press tour in Pasadena last month.
This is about the creeping suspicion that, despite ``Julia,'' ``The
Huxtables,'' and ``Oprah,'' television may still adhere to the same
archaic attitudes that made ``Amos 'n' Andy,'' with its shiftless,
stereotypical Negroes (as we were called in those days), the first
dramatic TV show with a black cast nearly a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, this is about the B-word, as in boycott, which would
hit them where they live _ in their imported Italian leather
wallets. With viewership in a downward spiral, the networks can ill
afford to alienate anyone these days. As Scott Sassa, NBC's West
Coast president, said, ``It makes good business sense to try to
reach these minorities groups in order to get bigger audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is true. Of course, it would have made even better
business sense if the networks had done this to begin with.
Instead, through their shortsightedness, ignorance, and, yes,
perhapsunintended racism, they sowed the bitter seeds for this
contentious debate _ a discussion that will sadly resonate long
after most of these programs are gone.
</P>
<P>
   And that, regardless of the network executives' dubious change
of heart, should not be easily forgotten nor forgiven.

WHITE OLEANDER 
By Janet Fitch. Little, Brown. 390 pp. $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the fruits of the female ascendancy in contemporary
American fiction has been the emergence of the whacked-out
mother-daughter novel. If the pop culture of the '60s gave us
``Psycho'' and ``Portnoy's Complaint,'' where mom could wreak havoc
on an unsuspecting son, women writers in later decades have
recognized that scary familial territory as possessing their own
mother lode of possibility. The wars of these writers were fought
on exquisitely internal landscapes, where engulfment _ death by
milk _ was the ultimate danger. Amy Tan and Mona Simpson both
elevated the genre to new dimensions of literary turmoil, for they
understood that the cord between mother and daughter was
invincible, just as easily a fatal weapon as a source of food.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Fitch's ``White Oleander'' draws its first and last breath
from this idea, creating a purplish fictional universe that turns
out to be as creepily persuasive as it is emotionally gripping.
Describing herself as a third-generation Angeleno, she has also
written an equivocal ode to Southern California: a place of
poisonous flowers and equally dangerous relationships, where Santa
Ana winds and tarot cards are the coordinates on the map. Fecund
but out of control, this is the California of Joan Didion and
Raymond Chandler, where passions misfire and glamorous women murder
their lovers, where young girls wind up on the streets to pay for
somebody else's sins.
</P>
<P>
   All of which happens in ``White Oleander,'' to the strains of
too much Didion and Chandler. You can feel influence all over the
place in this novel _ Didion and the tough guys and Robert Stone
and a bit of Simpson, as well as a vast appreciation for the visual
arts. Some of this works in Fitch's favor; at least she's read the
right California scribes. But it also lends an arch quality to her
descriptive prose (``We could not sleep in the hot dry nights, my
mother and I'') and casts a derivative light on the more
melodramatic events of the novel (of which there are plenty). Even
after one murder and a couple of attempted others, you half-expect
to find somebody floating face-down in a backyard pool, with Sam
Spade pulling into the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   What Fitch does beautifully is construct an eerily seductive
folie a deux between Ingrid Magnussen, the monstrous mom, and her
daughter, Astrid, who is 12 when the novel opens. A poet whose
narcissism is wrapped in fine language and a persona of steel,
Ingrid has a penchant for dreamy young beach boys with sand in
their hair; she sleeps with them, then casts them into the night,
all while Astrid tosses in bed on the other side of the room. But
Ingrid's lifestyle _ selfishness posing as eccentricity _ begins to
unravel when she meets another writer who seduces and then dumps
her. The poet becomes the obsessive: Ingrid stalks the ex-lover,
breaks into his house, finally poisons him. Astrid, with the
loyalty of the young, watches in horror and silence _ first as her
mother plots the crime, then as she's sentenced to 35-to-life.
</P>
<P>
   And all this in the first 40 pages of the novel! Taken into
protective custody, Astrid becomes a ward of the state _ and thus
begins a blur of mostly horrid odysseys in foster care that will
last throughout her adolescence. If Ingrid gave her daughter beauty
wrapped in lethally suffocating love, the women whose charge she
now becomes are threatening in other ways. The first such surrogate
is Starr, a born-again former cokehead who likes Astrid until she
realizes the girl has been coming of age with Starr's boyfriend,
Ray; the foster mom's answer to this house of incest is to fire a
.38 at them both. Even worse is Amelia Ramos, who takes girls into
her exquisite home, then starves them to death while she makes them
work. Eventually Astrid finds her way to Claire, a brutally
depressed but kind woman who cares for the girl as best she can,
giving her the kind of no-fault love Astrid had longed for from
Ingrid but never received. This sweet respite starts to crumble
when Claire insists on visiting the now-infamous poet-mom in
prison. Having spotted Claire's weaknesses the way a predator
sniffs out fear, Ingrid goes after her competition with
pathological cruelty: in California speak, killing her softly.
</P>
<P>
   These are the most memorable of Astrid's custodians, but by no
means all of them; accustomed to the drill, she can move her scant
possessions on a moment's notice. And throughout her picaresque
tales of terror hovers the vulture-goddess Ingrid, who may have
made her daughter a survivor but has also left her with worse scars
than those inflicted by Starr's .38. Ingrid's formidable, haunting
personality reveals itself slowly through Astrid's growing
understanding of her; consequently their characters, and the dark
braid of love and hate between them, are the most restrained and
successful parts of the novel. For all of Astrid's travails, the
real journey she has to take is the one away from Ingrid, who, even
in the California Institution for Women, retains a hold on her
daughter fiercer than night and just as endless.
</P>
<P>
   The larger problem with ``White Oleander,'' though, is inherent
to its structure. In setting up a cascading series of awful
foster-care situations, Fitch has ensured their transience. This
means that the reader is flagged early on that none of these
predicaments will last: The characters surrounding Astrid won't
hang around to matter much; the specific circumstances, no matter
how bad, will dissolve and make way for yet another mini-nightmare.
Faced with a necessarily episodic plot architecture, we are left
with Astrid herself _ who proves to be no small consolation prize.
As a narrator, she is resonant and engaging; as a girl-child trying
to outlive nature as well as nurture, she's positively valiant. Art
will save Astrid Magnussen, and if any hard-luck protagonist ever
deserved a happy ending, it is this tough, sad teenager _ armed
with enough talent and strength to fight the mother who couldn't
raise her, fleeing the golden lands of someone else's dreams.

GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD FIGHT GROWING UNPALATABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYNG, England _ It was a battle scene right out of an old King
Arthur movie, or maybe ``Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' _
fighting amid the bucolic English countryside that seemed almost
comical because, in the end, no one got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Just before dawn one day last week, Greenpeace activists wearing
white decontamination suits invaded Walnut Tree Farm, where the
Brigham brothers are growing genetically modified maize. One of the
farmers, Ed Brigham, jumped on his tractor and used its bucket to
smash a mechanical mower that Greenpeace was using to chop down
stalks. Then he drove at the environmentalists, scattering them in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, a good chunk of the Brighams' experimental
field of maize had been destroyed, and 28 protesters from
Greenpeace had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   That confrontation and another Saturday in which 45 protesters
were arrested after destroying maize at another experimental farm
in Lincolnshire were the latest in an increasingly bitter debate
over genetically modified foods that are being tested here and in
other parts of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   While there is opposition to ``GM'' foods in much of Europe,
nowhere is the debate more heated and vitriolic than in Britain.
Saturday's assault was the fourth time in the last month that
environmental groups have taken what they call ``direct action''
against one of the seven government-approved testing sites in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Activists vow to trash the other three testing sites and there
are some who believe the demonstrations against genetically
modified food in Britain will grow into a movement that will rival
the antinuclear demonstrations of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair's government has pleaded for reason,
saying that the government will not allow unsafe food onto the
market but insisting that testing is needed. While it has been
anxious to keep the testing process open, the government is
considering shifting the testing sites to undisclosed locations if
the vandalism continues.
</P>
<P>
   Producers see a better food
</P>
<P>
   The biotechnology companies that are pushing GM foods, such as
Monsanto, say they will produce cheaper, more plentiful food that
tastes better, stays fresh longer and will not trigger allergies.
Eventually, they say, these foods will offer greater nutritional
value.
</P>
<P>
   Poppycock, say opponents. They say GM foods are unsafe and will
harm the environment by altering nature. There is scant scientific
evidence to back their claims, but there is a visceral fear of the
new technology throughout the population, fears that are fanned by
the news media and validated by high-profile opponents of GM
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genetic modification takes mankind into realms that belong to
God and God alone,'' Prince Charles declared last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tabloid newspapers in Britain have dubbed GM products
``Frankenfood,'' while more serious newspapers, such as The
Independent, have forsaken any attempt to be objective, running
robust campaigns against GM testing. Newspaper polls regularly show
the British public is against the testing.
</P>
<P>
   History of food scares
</P>
<P>
   While there is a body of scientific evidence suggesting that GM
foods are safe, Europeans in general and Britons in particular have
far less confidence in what their governments tell them about food
safety. Europe has been buffeted by a series of food contamination
scandals in recent years. On Sunday, a three-year ban on the export
of British beef because of ``mad cow'' disease will end. More
recently, contaminated Coca-Cola was pulled from the shelves in
four European countries, and Belgium has been rocked by
contamination of poultry, pork and beef with cancer-causing
dioxins.
</P>
<P>
   The new European Commission president, Romano Prodi, cited the
dispute over genetically modified food as a reason why Europe needs
to create an independent agency modeled after the US Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   As Prodi's chief aide, David O'Sullivan, put it, ``There is
widespread skepticism and cynicism about food safety throughout
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   William Brigham, whose Walnut Tree Farm was attacked by
protesters, said he considers those who destroyed his crop
criminals. He said they are fundamentalists who oppose the GM foods
on principle, not science.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spray I use on my conventional crops is less
(environmentally) friendly than what I put on the (GM) crops,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lord Peter Melchett, a hereditary peer who is the executive
director of Greenpeace, and who led the assault on the Brigham
farm, said ripping up the crops is justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British public have made it very clear they do not want
these GM farm-scale plans to go ahead,'' he said. ``It is vital
that the crop is removed before it flowers, speading GM
pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Melchett's vow to continue attacks on the other test sites led a
magistrate to initially order him held without bail. But after two
days in jail, he was released to fly off to a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   At 51, Melchett has become the first high-profile
environmentalist willing to risk incarceration to halt GM testing
here. Like many in the burgeoning anti-GM movement, he traces his
activism to the antinuclear movement of the 1980s. He was a
minister in the Labor government of the late 1970s, but resigned
from politics in 1979, disillusioned by what he called ``the lying
game'' at Westminster.
</P>
<P>
   Melchett said it was up to him and other environmentalists to
protect the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The authorities are not taking the correct action and
unfortunately it has fallen to Greenpeace to protect everyone's
interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Des D'Souza, a spokesman for AgrEvo, a company that paid for the
planting at Walnut Tree Farm, said the attacks had elevated the
debate over GM foods to one about democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has to decide,'' he said, ``whether it or
Greenpeace and other pressure groups run this country.''

PHYSICIANS REVEL IN CANCER SURVIVOR'S CYCLING VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Lance Armstrong made cycling history when he won
the Tour de France last month. As a survivor of testicular cancer,
he accomplished something equally challenging: turning his illness
into headline news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had four to five men come into my office as a result,''
said Dr. James Barada, a urologist in Albany. ``It really comes
down to media awareness to remind young men to perform testicular
self-examination.''
</P>
<P>
   With a study in this month's journal of Urology showing an
increased incidence of testicular cancer (up from 8.6 cases per
100,000 service men in 1988 to 15.4 cases in 1996), health
specialists couldn't be more pleased that Armstrong is adopting a
spokesman's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't know it's the most common cancer in men
under age 34,'' said Dr. Robert Dachs, a resident in Clifton Park,
N.Y., who was diagnosed with the disease himself in December 1996.
``The key is catching it early.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than 7,200 cases of testicular cancer will be
diagnosed. For unknown reasons, the disease is about four times
more common in white men than in black men.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors aren't sure what causes testicular cancer, although some
research has linked it to environmental factors, including
pesticides. Cycling isn't considered to be a risk for this disease,
Barada said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as women should perform a monthly breast exam, men should
also examine their testicles for any lumps, tenderness or swelling.
It's a message that helped Dachs discover his illness before it
spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes 30 seconds,'' Barada said. ``I recommend men do it in
the shower.''
</P>
<P>
   When detected early, the overall cure rate is more than 90
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Dachs, 40, knows that he's probably more vigilant than most
young men and not only because he is the assistant director of
emergency medicine at Albany Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, while in medical school, his roommate was
diagnosed with testicular cancer. That experience prompted him to
do further research on the disease while a resident at Bay State
Medical Center in Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   His findings, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health
Care, revealed that only 39 percent of 633 college students had
ever heard of a testicular self-exam. Of those, only 4.7 percent
actually performed the monthly exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're under 30, you're immortal,'' said Barada,
explaining the reluctance. ``There's a concept that nothing can
happen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides lumps or changes in the feel of their testicles, men
should also be aware of other possible symptoms of testicular
cancer, including a heavy feeling in the scrotum or an ache in the
lower abdomen or groin area.
</P>
<P>
   More rarely, there is a tenderness in the breast area, because
of high levels of a hormone called human chronic gonadotropin.
</P>
<P>
   While Armstrong has already done a great deal to increase
awareness of the disease, doctors say his story also goes a long
way to illustrate the advances in treating testicular cancer with
improved chemotherapy, surgical techniques and radiation.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1980, most everyone died from the disease, said
Dr. Ronald Kaufman, a urologist and an assistant professor of
surgery at Albany Medical College. ``Now most everyone lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, the key is catching it early. Yet many young men, besides
not performing a self-exam, don't go to the doctor on a regular
basis for checkups.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Barada believes a man's sexual partner can help.
``I've had men come in with testicular masses found by their
partner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment for testicular cancer varies but almost always
involves the surgical removal of the affected testes.
</P>
<P>
   If chemotherapy and radiation are needed, those men who want to
have a family may decide to bank their sperm for later use since
those treatments can cause infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Barada says most men can expect business as usual
after their recovery, with no erection problems. ``You can fly on
one engine,'' he said.

US, BRITISH TASTES FOR ALTERED FOODS ARE AN OCEAN APART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compared with British activists storming the corn fields to show
their anger, the US debate over genetically modified foods is a
remarkably low-key affair in which most Americans are still
learning that familiar foods have changed at all _ and they aren't
sure what to make of it.
</P>
<P>
   The British and other Western Europeans have had a heated debate
for years over the prospect of eating corn, soybeans, and other
products containing genes from organisms intended to improve their
pest resistance and other qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even though US farmers are by far the leading growers of
the new crops, the American public and the media showed limited
interest until a recent study showed that pollen from some
genetically modified corn may kill monarch butterflies. Even then,
many food scientists cautioned against over-reacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning to have a broader public dialogue on these
subjects, and I see that as positive,'' said Jay Byrne, spokesman
for St. Louis-based Monsanto, the world's leading producer of
genetically altered seeds. ``So far, the reaction has generally
been people are interested, but receptive.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference in public attitudes translates into a growing
trade dispute as European governments stall approval of new
genetically modified seeds, while the US government presses for
international acceptance of the fast-growing industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans have an absolute fear, unfounded by any
scientific basis, of accepting these products,'' Stuart Eizenstat,
Clinton's nominee for assistant treasury secretary, said last
month. ``It is, to my mind, the single greatest trade threat that
we face systemically with the European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the attitude gulf can be explained in part by
recent food scandals in Europe, such as the mad cow disease scare,
that makes Europeans more wary of food safety. Adding to the
climate of fear, the influential tabloid press prints sensational
stories about the horrors of genetically modified foods, compared
to a more restrained US press.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of genetically engineered foods say Americans
would be outraged too if they understood what is happening to their
food. Activists have collected 300,000 signatures and filed a
lawsuit to force the Food and Drug Administration to require
labeling of genetically altered foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people found out more about it, we found that customers
didn't want scientists playing with their food in that way,'' said
Bill Wadsworth of Iceland Frozen Foods, which led British efforts
to inform the public about the new foods.

PROFS DISCOVER HOW TO DIVIDE WITHOUT CONQUERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ A mathematician seldom gets a chance to
apply his knowledge to the real world. So it was a rare treat for
Alan Taylor when his son and three cousins returned from a Fourth
of July parade in 1992 and spilled four bags of candy onto the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' said the Union College professor. ``I said,
`Not only do I know how to divide this fairly, but I'm now one of
two people in the world who knows how to do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   The other was Steven Brams, a political scientist at New York
University. Together, they claim the mantle of King Solomon with a
formula for fairness _ one where two parties leave feeling not only
like they got more than half, but also without envying the spoils
of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the notion of ``envy-free division'' was known
only to academics. But last month, Brams and Taylor won a patent on
their process _ a rarity in math _ and released a book for popular
audiences. ``The Win-Win Solution: Guaranteeing Fair Shares to
Everybody'' was published by W.W. Norton &AMP; Company.
</P>
<P>
   The book's bold conclusion is that math will succeed where
lawyers and diplomats have failed: solving disputes ranging from
divorces to conflicts in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But before brushing up on your math, it may help to start with
pie _ as in ``easy as ...''
</P>
<P>
   Something about their geometry has made cake and pie part and
parcel of the language of fairness. Someone with overarching
ambition is guilty of wanting to ``have his cake and eat it too.''
</P>
<P>
   And who could forget Marie Antoinette's reputed advice to the
French peasants: ``Let them eat cake''? It is perhaps not
surprising, then, that Brams and Taylor's first foray into fairness
began with cake.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a columnist for the journal The Sciences revived a
50-year-old mathematical challenge. At the end of World War II,
Polish mathematician Hugo Steinhaus sought an equitable solution to
cutting a cake. Two people were easy: One cuts; the other chooses.
From there, Steinhaus found, division became more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The Sciences Steinhaus' idea and asked if it could be extended
to an unlimited number of envy-free pieces. The two friends, who
met at a conference in 1986, had an answer within a month. Taylor
credits the solution, which essentially boils down to cutting an
extra piece, to an inspiration that came to him during final exams
at Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' said the columnist, who hadn't expected an
answer to the epic problem so soon.
</P>
<P>
   Their outside-the-box thinking landed the scholars in the
Encyclopedia Britannica. In the end, however, they were left with
theory and lots of messy cake.
</P>
<P>
   Enter ``adjusted winner,'' the process that forms the backdrop
of the new book.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor supports the theory with a nine-page analysis laced with
equations only a mathematician could understand. Luckily, applying
it requires nothing more than a brief and relatively painless
reacquaintance with high school algebra.
</P>
<P>
   In an example from the book, Ann and Ben are a wealthy couple
getting divorced. They must split a retirement account, a home, a
summer cottage, investments and a host of miscellaneous property.
They are given 100 points each and asked to assign values to the
five items.
</P>
<P>
   One of the appeals of the process is that it takes advantage of
human differences. Ann, for example, wants the retirement account
and the summer cottage. Ben wants the main home and the
miscellaneous property.
</P>
<P>
   If Ben gets the item they're tied on _ the investments _ they
both have at least half of their own points: Ben with 50 and Ann
with 65. At this point, the division should be envy-free. But it's
not fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he envies is her happiness,'' Taylor said. ``That's very
subtle.''
</P>
<P>
   In the emotional turmoil of divorce, however, that perception
can throw negotiations into tumult. Thus, ``adjusted winner'' also
will involve some trading of items and the splitting of just one _
in this case the retirement account. With the use of a simple
algebraic equation, both sides leave with the same number of
points: 56.67.
</P>
<P>
   If both sides have been honest, Brams and Taylor guarantee the
fairest result possible.
</P>
<P>
   But can it work? One veteran divorce lawyer calls the process
``seductive'' but impractical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reads like two ivory tower folks trying to deal with the
real world,'' said Diane Serafin Blank, a lawyer in New York City.
``It assumes three things: that people know what they want, that
they can assign numeric values to things that can be very
touchy-feely, and that people will be truthful about what their
values are.''
</P>
<P>
   Brams and Taylor agree the adjusted-winner approach requires a
certain hardheadedness at the outset. It may go without saying, but
both sides have to agree to play. If one side in the divorce feels
a judge will grant him everything or a power has emerged clearly
victorious in battle, they are more likely to use the hammer than
the olive branch.
</P>
<P>
   The Brams and Taylor method allows for spite, but only at the
expense of self-interest. Ann, for example, might put more points
on the main home, knowing that Ben wants it. But she can only do so
by cutting her own points from the cottage or the retirement
account.
</P>
<P>
   Blank blanched at the authors' extension of the calculation to
child custody _ meaning that, in addition to the other pangs of
growing up, a child could be faced with the knowledge that she got
fewer points than the vintage Corvette or the 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the authors say that is better than the way most
current divorce settlements are handled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of posturing,'' Brams said. ``A husband might
say he wants the kids, but he's really doing that as leverage
because he wants to lower the alimony. When you have to ascribe
hard points, that changes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The success of the process may depend on the degree to which
other measures have failed. German economist Matthias Raith said he
first became acquainted with the adjusted-winner approach after
meeting Brams two years ago at a conference on game theory in
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Raith began using the technique in seminars he conducts on
alternative conflict resolution. First, he'd ask various managers
to solve hypothetical conflicts the way they'd been taught,
inevitably leading to drawn-out shouting matches. Then he'd ask the
group if they were interested in improving the quality of their
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they learn how difficult things are, they're very open to
this technique,'' Raith said. ``It de-emotionalizes the whole
thing. It allows you to go to the balcony and look down on a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Brams and Taylor continue to work on expanding the process to
three or more parties. They also hope to sell the rights to the
adjusted-winner strategy to a consulting firm and perhaps create
software that would appeal to the math-phobic.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Bosnia? Northern Ireland? Piece of cake.

KOSOVO JUSTICE _ ON THE GERMAN MODEL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH NEUFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Here, in the shadow of the Holocaust, a group of
Kosovar Albanians and Serbs recently met for the first time since
the war to discuss a question now central to the Balkans: What role
should acknowledging atrocities of the past play in the region's
future?
</P>
<P>
   The choice of venue was apt. Since the end of World War II, the
Germans have wrestled with questions of their country's
responsibility for the deaths of millions of Europe's Jewry at the
hands of the Nazis. Now, the legacy of the Allied and German war
crimes, better teaching of the Holocaust, and the continuing
revelation of misdeeds against the Jews has led Germany to accept
that its future is _ and must be _ shaped by its past.
</P>
<P>
   But that path ahead is far less clear for Kosovo, where memories
are still raw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice in the Balkans?'' asked Nenad Canak, a Serbian
opposition leader from Novi Sad, one of the many Serbs and Kosovars
attending a two-day conference sponsored by the German government
on the future of Kosovo. ``You're talking about writing some kind
of fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Germany _ and like Bosnia _ Kosovo has emerged from this
current conflict with volumes of unspeakable war crimes one would
have hoped were not possible in this century. As Allied troops
stumbled on the horrors of Dachau and other camps, so Allied troops
50 years later in Kosovo find every village they enter has yet
another new, undiscovered, mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   Like Germany, and like Bosnia, a war crimes tribunal is given
the task of bringing those guilty to justice. An indictment against
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and his top henchmen for the
horrors of Kosovo has already been unveiled. Teams of war crimes
investigators are fanning across Kosovo, collecting evidence.
Justice has begun to be done.
</P>
<P>
   But can justice be realized? That's where the comparisons to
Germany end. Unlike Germany, where a decisive military victory led
to the humiliation of the Nazis, Kosovo's and indeed the Balkans'
political situation is far less clear. Milosevic remains in power,
and the Serbian people still largely in the grip of the
nationalists. State-held media continue to churn out propaganda
about what occurred in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While opposition leaders hope to topple Milosevic through a
summer-long series of demonstrations, it's unclear whether they
will succeed. If anything, they expect the Balkan strongman to
launch another conflict: ``The story with the Balkans is not yet
finished,'' said Vesna Pesic, the head of the Belgrade-based Center
for Democracy. ``Now, its Kosovo, maybe next it's Macedonia. There
is no real result of this war.''
</P>
<P>
   With Milosevic in power, The Hague, its indictments, and its
trials have no legitimacy in Serbia. His regime has never
recognized the court. What evidence is uneveiled will arrive in
Belgrade through the warped filter of state-held media, ensuring
the truth is not heard. Nor are Milosevic and his cohorts likely to
go on trial: Western leaders have made it clear that troops in
Kosovo will not launch arrest raids in Serbia. Like Bosnia _ where
former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his top general,
Ratko Mladic, remain at large despite their indictment for genocide
_ it is unlikely Yugoslavia's big fish will ever be ``caught.''
</P>
<P>
   So Kosovo resembles Bosnia far more than it does postwar
Germany: a conflict in which there is no clear victor, a march
toward justice without a hope that the chief defendants will go on
trial. As is the case in Bosnia, people have realized that Western
leaders are only half-hearted about the cause of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are no arrests,'' predicted Gazmend Pula, of the
Kosovo branch of the Helsinki Commission, ``there will be a lot of
dissatisfaction. You must begin (making arrests) at the top, for
passions to calm and for people to believe justice is being done.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, then, don't count on war crimes trials to
help bridge the gap between Kosovar Albanians and Serbs. What both
Serbs and Kosovar Albanians gathered here wondered was how best to
have Serbia confront its guilt so that reconciliation, in at least
some small measure, could begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``After World War II, the Germans confronted the questions of
collective guilt, collective responsibility,'' said Baton Hoxhiu,
of Koha Ditore, the Kosovar Albanian newspaper. ``But what about
Serbia?''
</P>
<P>
   Hoxhiu and the other Kosovars in attendance here look to Germany
as their model, believing that in time the Serbian people must come
to accept full responsibility for having harbored a genocidal
regime. They believe Milosevic's tyranny to be as much a creation
of Serbian culture, as much as Serbia's disastrous state today is a
creation of Milosevic's policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a culture of racism,'' said Hoxhiu. ``Living together
is a beautiful illusion. We can only do it if the Serbs, the
church, the leaders do what (former German chancellor) Willie
Brandt did _ kneel down and apologize.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the German model fit the Balkans? The Nazi plan to
exterminate the Jews was not only well-documented, it was
one-sided; it's not like the Jews ever tried to attack the Nazis.
By contrast, there are cycles of violence that have historically
rippled through Kosovo _ Kosovar Albanian violence against the
Serbs, then Serbs against the Kosovars. Not all are so sure that
collective guilt is appropriate. For that matter, not all are
convinced that it make sense for a country to face its sins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is so obsessed with the German case, but there are
many other countries who live with their past and are not facing
it,'' mused Pesic, of the Center for Democracy in Belgrade,
wondering whether Serbia could ever follow Germany's example.
</P>
<P>
   For now, this conference was one of the many small steps toward
healing the hurts and bridging the gap between two cultures, Serb
and Kosovar Albanian, which though very different have nonetheless
lived side by side. No conclusions were reached but dialogue was
begun. Can Milosevic be toppled? How best to de-brainwash the
Serbs? The past must be recognized, must be apologized for, must be
forgiven, but when? ``It took Germany 45 years,'' said Pesic. ``The
Serbs are going to need time.''
</P>
<P>
   But even more so than Germany, the war crimes visited upon the
Kosovar Albanians were among the most intimate, as was the case in
Bosnia: neighbor betraying neighbor. But if the betrayal was quick
and intimate, so can be the reconciliation _ as at least one
encounter at the conference proved, albeit on a small scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nenad!'' yelled Hoxhiu, catching sight of Serb opposition
leader Canak for the first time since the war began, and sweeping
him into an embrace on a stage of the conference hall.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever gap there had been between these two vanished in a hug.

SAN FRANCISCO MAKES IT MARK IN LONDON 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Moved in ``f'' category sted ``l''.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When a new extension of the Jubilee Underground
line opens in London in the coming weeks, it will carry a ``Made in
San Francisco'' label.
</P>
<P>
   The project manager for the $4.75 billion line, which links the
Docklands business center with the banks and other businesses of
central London, is the San Francisco engineering giant Bechtel
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The subway line is but one link in a chain of connectivity that
joins San Francisco and London, according to Lord Peter Levene, the
lord mayor of the City of London, who visited San Francisco early
this week.
</P>
<P>
   There are, he pointed out, many more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. is opening a new customer service center
north of London that will employ 1,200 people,'' Lord Peter said,
referring to the San Francisco-based discount broker.
</P>
<P>
   That's another link, as well as a sign, Lord Peter said, that
London is maintaining its longtime status as Europe's largest and
hottest financial services hub.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of investment banking for Europe at Deutsche Bank,
Lord Peter, 57, represents London's historic square-mile core,
which Londoners call ``the City.'' He is the 671st lord mayor of
the City.
</P>
<P>
   As lord mayor, Lord Peter explained, his job is ``to serve as an
ambassador for London's financial community _ not only the City,
which is my patch, but the financial community of all London and
the United Kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord Peter stopped in the San Francisco area to talk with
executives at Schwab and Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, among others. He also
met with Mayor Willie Brown and officials from the Federal Reserve
Board, and gave a speech at the World Affairs Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the high-tech center of the world,'' Lord Peter
said.``We need to have a good relationship between the high-tech
center of the world and the leading international financial center
of the world. It's mutually beneficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Britain has not joined 11 other European Union
nations in adopting the euro as a single currency, Lord Peter
pointed out that London nevertheless ``trades more euros than all
of continental Europe together.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord Peter said it could be difficult to maintain status as a
physical nerve center in an increasingly virtual age. But, he
maintained, there is still an advantage ``in having a critical mass
of expertise. People like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, there is substantial risk, especially for
institutional investors, ``to be hitting a keyboard without anyone
on the other end to say, `Are you sure you want to do that?'''
</P>
<P>
   As for the looming possibility of 24-hour trading, he said,
``It's a big issue for us. Those who work with the Far East already
have to come in very early in the morning. Those working with North
America stay very late in the evening. But any center not
responsive to market forces will lose out. We don't intend to lose
out.''

JOCKEYING FOR LANGUAGE EQUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Bob Kittredge, who calls himself ``a sensitive soul of
somewhat advanced years,'# learning tn use jock in mixed company
was a struggle. ``I can now casually call a male athlete (i.e. a
man who wears a jockstrap) a jock with scarcely a blush,'' he
writes. ``But the increasing use of jock to mean athlete of
whatever gender gives me pause. Surely these admirable women who
won the World Cup don't wear such an article of clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the blush. you may be asking. Well, it's because Kittredge _
supported by many usage authorities _ believes that jockstrap
``derives from an English slang word for penis.'' Possible, but not
proven, says the etymology jury. A soccer star is one kind of jock,
the computer whiz another. And there's an alternative theory on the
coinage of jockstrap.
</P>
<P>
   Jock, it is true, has been slang for the male genitals _ and the
female, too. The first print definition, in the 1795 New Dictionary
of Cant and Flash, says jock means the ``private parts of a man or
woman,'' though it was rarely used of women after 1880, according
to Eric Partridge. And it may indeed derive from jockum, an older
slang word for penis, says the Oxford English Dictionary, though
the lineage isn't certain.
</P>
<P>
   But we have another jock, this one descended from jockey, a
Scottish diminutive for John. A jockey could be a commoner, a
fellow, a lad, a vagabond. In 17th-century England _ and into this
century, in parts of America _ a jockey could be a dealer in
horseflesh as well as a rider. The jockey as race-horse rider
became the dominant meaning, though, and by the early 1800s it was
being clipped to jock.
</P>
<P>
   Twentieth-century innovation has spawned other variations: We've
had car jockeys, typewriter jockeys, even elevator jockeys, back
when human beings ran the contraptions. One scholar found this
usage going back to the 20s, when players heckling the opposing
team from the dugout were first called bench jockeys. Disc jockeys,
from the 1940s, are often shortened to jocks; take away the music
and add some attitude, and you've got a shock jock.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, we've got the ubiquitous computer jocks, a
coinage that outwitted word wrangler Richard Lederer. He calls
computer jock an oxymoron, presumably because a computer nerd is
the opposite of a jock, but I think he's on the wrong track: The
stars of software are descendants of jockey, not of jock as in
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   None of these new jockeys needed athletic supporters, but
perhaps the earlier ones did. That's the story told by Bike
Athletic Co., the granddaddy of jockstrap manufacturers; it got its
start in 1897, a spokesman says, when Charles Bennett invented the
jockstrap, believing that ``bicycle riders and jockeys should wear
a supporter.'' And indeed, Bennett's patent of a ``Combined
jock-strap and suspensory,'' filed in Chicago in 1897, is the OED's
first citation of the word.
</P>
<P>
   There are other clues that early jockstraps were meant for
jockeys, not for jocks. For instance, the OED also quotes an 1896
advertisement _ in Brooklyn _ for ``Suspensories, Jockey Straps.''
And a 1909 ad offers a ``Bike Jockey Strap Suspensory.''
</P>
<P>
   And if jock had been off-color slang in 1897 _ rather than a
short form of jockey _ would Bennett have used it in a patent
application? It seems more likely that the jockstrap _ an American
invention, after all _ was named for the riders who used it, not
for what it held. And if that's true, it's the OED editors, not Bob
Kittredge, who ought to be blushing.
</P>
<P>
   The etymological argument is just for fun, though. It doesn't
matter what jock meant in 1790; if women call themselves jocks, and
the English-speaking world agrees, then jocks they are. The word
has evolved even since the '50s, when it could imply big, dumb
lunk; the tinge of contempt has faded with the fitness craze and
the great leaps forward in women's sports. Consensus, not
etymology, determines what words mean.
</P>
<P>
   There's a historical reason, too, for women to embrace jockdom:
The very first sports bra was fashioned, in 1977, from two
jockstraps. Unlike the myth of bra-burning _ the invention of a
lazily alliterative press corps _ this story has hard evidence: The
original is in the Smithsonian Institution. So let's all give two
cheers for the jockbra _ shouldn't someone have trademarked that
name? _ and hold the blushes, please.

WOMEN BOOST POLITICAL GIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. ``Pushy broad'' is not a phrase normally
associated with the ever-polite and proper Elizabeth Dole. In fact,
the GOP presidential candidate was taken aback when her top
fund-raiser stood up and told the well-groomed ladies at a posh
Piedmont Club luncheon that is exactly the kind of woman the Dole
campaign wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting right to the chase,'' said Bonnie McElveen-Hunter, an
ebullient North Carolina business owner, self-described ``pushy
broad,'' and the head of Dole's national finance committee, ``we
want your help and your money.''
</P>
<P>
   After a dismal fund-raising start, Dole led every GOP candidate
but Texas Governor George W. Bush in the money sweepstakes for the
second quarter of 1999, pulling in $2.6 million. The secret to her
success, most agree, is that McElveen-Hunter came on board and
began aggressively getting women _ traditionally a minor source of
money in national politics _ to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonnie has been a tremendous asset,'' Dole said after last
week's $500-a-ticket Piedmont Club lunch, which raised $100,000.
``We are attracting a lot of people who have not been involved in
presidential politics before.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit
group that tracks fund-raising, contributions from women are the
highest ever at this point in a presidential race, a trend that is
definitely benefitting Dole. Between April 1 and June 30, she got
$1.1 million, or 43.3 percent of her total donations of more than
$200, from women. Recent studies show that women made just 25
percent of the donations to congressional races in 1996, and that
those funds were disproportionately directed at Democratic women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are writing history here, we are pushing the envelope,''
Kathleen Harrington, Dole's deputy campaign manager, said of
creating a network of women donors. ``Necessity is the mother of
invention, and Mrs. Dole is a powerful attraction to women.''
</P>
<P>
   Women are more likely than men to vote; they have been stalwart
volunteers in political races; and as candidates themselves their
numbers are rising rapidly. But giving money to politicians has
been the last frontier for women, and it is taking candidates such
as Dole and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who are very popular with women
and elevated by them as cultural pioneers, to open up the territory
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Executive women look at Mrs. Dole and see a reflection of
themselves,'' said Marie Wilson, president of the White House
Project, a nonprofit group whose goal is to elect a woman president
by 2008. ``It is very significant that women are beginning to put
their money where their trust is _ in women leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who lives in New York, said she is ``startled'' at the
confidence among Democratic Party activists that Clinton can raise
a record-breaking $25 million for a US Senate race. ``The
Democratic parties nationally, and in New York, are looking to a
woman as the only one who can raise that kind of money,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fund-raising, which began when she launched a Senate
exploratory committee last month, ``is going well,'' said Howard
Wolfson, her spokesman. He declined to be specific, noting Clinton
was not required to make an official report until the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton is casting a wide net for money _ she recently
sent out a direct-mail appeal to 2 million potential donors _ she
is also capitalizing on an almost cult-like following of women
admirers in New York to support both her big fund-raising parties
and host more intimate affairs, like a brunch planned by bridal
designer Vera Wang.
</P>
<P>
   McElveen-Hunter has been a prodigious fund-raiser for such
charities as the United Way and Habitat for Humanity, but she had
``never raised one penny in my life for a politician.'' It wasn't
until April when she was read a Wall Street Journal article about
Dole being last in first-quarter fund-raising that she first got
mad and then got mobilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It said that somebody named Gary Bauer _ I don't even know who
that was _ was ahead of her,'' said McElveen-Hunter, who owns Pace
Communications, a speciality publisher of airline and other
corporate magazines. ``It made me angry that a woman who has
dedicated her life to public service, who has worked diligently and
with integrity, wasn't raising any money. And I wondered if she
would be having the same problem if she was a guy from Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   So McElveen-Hunter opened her Rolodex and started enlisting her
female friends from North Carolina to New York and California. She
quickly organized a Dole lunch in Greensboro that raised $115,000.
She has signed on 30 finance committee co-chairwomen who each have
pledged to raise $10,000 and plan $100,000 events. In two days last
week, the campaign got $200,000 at four fund-raisers organized by
North Carolina women who were inexperienced at politics but not
reluctant to ask neighbors, business colleagues, and bridge
partners for $1,000 checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity for women who have not been involved in
politics but have their own companies, money, and opinions to
finally step up and step out,'' said Betty Wade, the former owner
of a temporary-services agency and one of the organizers of the
Piedmont Club lunch held on Dole's 63d birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Wilcox, a political scientist at Georgetown University,
said if Dole can build a network of women raising money from women,
it not only will be unprecedented, but it could break an historical
gender divide in giving. Men make political contributions through
business networks and for access, he said. Women are more inclined
to answer direct-mail appeals on ideological issues. Traditionally,
men write $1,000 checks, while women send in $100 contributions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative activist Bauer says he has the largest percentage
of female contributors of all the GOP contenders (45 percent, or
$771,000 in the second quarter) because women like his pro-family,
antiabortion stands. Bauer said he may be making a mistake by not
forming a female-donor network, like Dole's. ``I guess I should go
hunting where the ducks are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is what some 25 women activists did in 1985 when they
founded Emily's List as the first political action committee to
raise money specifically for Democratic women candidates who
support abortion rights. Today it has a direct-mail donor network
of 50,000, raised $7.5 million for candidates in 1998 mostly
through contributions of $100 or less, and takes credit for helping
to elect seven senators, 29 House members, and three governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old-boy network never believed women could win, so they
never gave them contributions, which guaranteed they wouldn't
win,'' said Ellen Malcolm, president and a founder of Emily's List.
``Because voters now see women can win, the credibility gap for
candidates like Elizabeth Dole and Hillary Clinton is greatly
reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's big advantage in the polls and the purse, many
women are moved by Dole. They jostle to get close to her or hug
her, beg to be in a picture with her, bring their daughters to
witness what they call a moment in history, the first serious run
for president by a woman. ``It stirs my heart to be here,'' Kay
Johnson, owner of a Winston-Salem strategic planning firm, said
after shaking Dole's hand at the Piedmont Club.
</P>
<P>
   During her trademark ``Dole Stroll'' _ getting close to the
audience as she makes her prepared remarks _ the candidate
emphasizes issues pollsters say are important to women: gun
control, safer schools, smut filters on the Internet, a better
work-family balance. Oddly though, when she is pressed to discuss
her female trailblazing, Dole seems personally disconnected from
the go-girl enthusiasm she generates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women will say to me, `I drove my daughter halfway across
the state to shake the hand of a woman we care to believe in
again,' '' Dole says in a dispassionate tone. ``It's humbling, and
it's very inspiring, and I appreciate it.''

ROSS COBB, RETIRED INVESTMENT EXECUTIVE, DIES AT 65 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SARAH YANG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ross L. Cobb, a retired chairman and chief
executive of Sutro &AMP; Co. Inc., died at his home in San Rafael
Saturday after a 13-year battle with cancer. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   He was a native of Vermont and attended the University of
Vermont. He served in the Air Force during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to learn more about the stock market, he moved to San
Francisco in 1959, where he was hired as a mail clerk at the Sutro
&AMP; Co. brokerage house.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb's career at Sutro &AMP; Co. epitomized the classic tale of an
entry-level employee climbing to the top. He became president in
1973, and he was elected chairman and chief executive 10 years
later.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cobb was a founding member of Metro Commerce Bank
in San Rafael, served on the board of Wedbush Morgan Securities in
Los Angeles, was vice chairman of the Securities Industry
Association in Washington, D.C., and was a director and member of
the executive committee of the Securities Industry Automation
Corp., a subsidiary of the New York and American stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, he served as chairman, vice chairman and governor
of the Pacific Stock Exchange, and as a director of the New York
Stock Exchange from 1983 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb retired from Sutro &AMP; Co. in 1986, shortly after it was
acquired by Boston-based John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
That same year, he was diagnosed with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb is survived by his wife of 37 years, Jane; daughters
Suzanne Christie of Mountain View and Julie Martel of San Anselmo;
a brother, Carl, and a sister, Sarah Philbrook, both of Vermont,
and five grandchildren.

   ATLANTA-MURDERS _ ATLANTA _ The mass killings that have marred
July in this city obviously have prompted the homicide rate to
climb by nine, for the year to date. APD Chief Harvard says there
is nothing anyone can do to prevent someone from going off and
killing nine people. However last year, APD recieved a $76,000
federal grant to study homicides in Atlanta and how police could
prevent them by finding out more about where they occurred, who the
victim/suspects were, motives, etc. Barton's spree and where it
erupted does not fit the typical profile of homicide in Atlanta,
and Barton does not fit the profile of the typical killer. (Longa,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.

largest cities, Dayton has the whitest force with 88 percent. For
years, the Dayton Police Department has struggled with its facade,
attempting to make it more closely represent the 40 percent black
people who live in the Gem City. But in the past decade, the
department's racial makeup has changed little. All this is splashed

Native American man and 10 white males to the force. (Vasconez,

chipping away at the aura of invincibility that once surrounded
Gore's campaign for the Democratic nomination. The former NBA star
has exceeded all expectations. He's attracting millions in
financial support, plenty of big name endorsements and national

a reputation for frugality, Bradley has erased doubts that his

   BUSH-RICHARDS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Former Gov. Ann Richards, the
first Democrat to lose to him, says the best way to go after George
W. Bush is not to. ``I wouldn't pay any attention to the
opponent,'' Richards said when he asked for her advice on how to
run against Bush. As Bush looks more and more like the inevitable
GOP nominee, the Democrats are scrambling for the most effective
way of running against him. So far, the Gore camp has adopted a
relatively low- key, subtle approach. But the Democratic National
Committee, ignoring Richards advice and perhaps foreshadowing
what's to come, is mounting a full-frontal assault. A look at the
Democratic strategy for beating Bush, an early front-runner in this
earliest of election campaigns. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman)

   BRITAIN-FOOD (London) _ In a country synonymous with
eccentricity, nothing could be more eccentric than Britain's food
culture. Notoriously indifferent to good food, the English
nevertheless feast on some of the best television cooking shows
anywhere in the world. Traditionally resistant to eating out, they
lavish love and attention on their favorite chefs. When Delia Smith
made omelets on her television show a few months ago, egg sales in
Britain rose by the millions. Perhaps most surprising is the fact
that London is now one of the world's most exciting restaurant
cities. And it is largely on the strength of home-grown chefs, many
of them dedicated to reworking and reinventing a native culinary
vocabulary that many people had given up for dead. It's all very
odd. Some of the best French food in London is not being cooked by
French chefs. And some of the best food, period, is English. By
william Grimes.

a chord with diners: ``confit.'' It is so effective, in fact, that
many chefs seem determined to apply it to just about anything on

DESPITE SCANDAL, SPORTS VIDEO HAS A PLACE ON INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Video presentation on the Internet as it relates to sports has
been mostly quick-hitting video highlights or Web-cam views of
venues.
</P>
<P>
   By simply using a remote camera controlled through a Web page,
you can pretend to be courtside pest Spike Lee without leaving
home. Or you can watch incremental, still-image updates of grass
growing at your favorite stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And it all had been without scandal, until last week.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in Chicago on July 26, athletes at eight
universities claimed that they were secretly videotaped in locker
rooms and that the tapes were sold through Internet sites
advertising ``hot younger dudes.'' One of the attorneys
representing the athletes said that he has eight tapes and believes
the practice of secretly taping athletes in locker rooms is
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   It goes to show that it doesn't take long for the dark side of
the 'Net to taint a legitimate application. It has happened with
e-mail, chat and other useful tools of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Net video in all formats (streaming, frame capture, etc.) is
choppy and unreliable, even with the most high-octane computers.
But the use of Net video _ however ugly its potential _ continues
to have a place with sports Web applications.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at who does it best.
</P>
<P>
   Of the league sites, NBA.com has utilized video best. The NBA's
official site posts hundreds of clips at its Team Theatre section.
The site's NBA.cam feature allowed users to access remote cameras
for selected views during the playoffs. It also created a feature
called Samantha, a behind-the-scenes video reporter's look at the
NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   NFL.com uses quick-hitting highlights created by the league's
classic NFL Films department. NHL.com offered daily video updates.
Major League Baseball's official site offers daily, weekly and
historical video. PGATour.com also has weekly highlights.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR is followed best on CBS SportsLine, which has an
innovation application called Race Live. Users can combine
streaming video with animated data (Shockwave) for a unique NASCAR
experience. In-car cameras can be selected to scroll left to right
or zoom in on drivers. Tachometer, speedometer, current gear and
braking-force readings as well as a real-time leader board are
displayed with the video.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based Broadcast.com (www.broadcast.com/sports/video) has
the best portal for video, from live horse racing to archives of
cricket and roller hockey events.
</P>
<P>
   Of team sites, the Stanley Cup Finals champion Stars do video as
well as any team. Some of the Stars' best plays of the season are
posted in a movie gallery at the team's official site
(www.dallasstars.com).
</P>
<P>
   Of the media sites, CNNSI.com has the best integration of the
'Net and television with its Live Box, which presents live video
from news conferences or breaking news that CNN is covering.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN.com, FOXSports.com and MSNBCSports.com post video clips to
complement content from their broadcast brethren _ a good idea
after a recent Jupiter Communications survey found that large-scale
events are better left to TV, cable and radio.
</P>
<P>
   GET AN EYEFUL: A few sites that offer well-done sports-related
Web camera updates:
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's Bleachers Cam (chicago.sidewalk.com/murphycam): On game
days, viewers can see live shots of fans heading to sports bar
Murphy's Bleachers or Wrigley Field on the corner of Sheffield and
Waveland avenues in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Browns Stadium (www.clevelandstadium.com): Cowboys
fans who can't wait for Monday's exhibition against the Browns can
see minute-by-minute views of the team's new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Clearcrest Pines Golf and Banquet Centre
(www.evansville.net/(tilde)ccpines): Hourly shots of golfers on the
No. 9 green as they make the turn at this course in Evansville,
Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame StadiumCam (www.nd.edu/(tilde)jeremy/stadium): A fan
offers viewers a shot of Notre Dame Stadium that is updated every
five minutes during the day, every 30 minutes at night.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway Club Cam(www.gocarolinas.com/sports/racing/cms/cam):
Updated images of Charlotte (N.C.) Motor Speedway.

REPORT SITES SHORTCOMINGS OF EFFORTS TO COMBAT DRUG TRAFFIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ A program to train Mexican federal agents to spy
on narcotics traffickers along the U.S.-Mexico border and pass the
intelligence to the Drug Enforcement Administration has yet to
yield any major prosecutions or drug seizures, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   A ranking official of the General Accounting Office, which
studied the 3-year-old program operated by the DEA, blamed mistrust
and corruption for the limited success.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report said that among the Mexican team's missions was
the use of wiretaps and other electronic surveillance to infiltrate
the ``command and control'' centers of large-scale drug-traffickers
and money-launderers throughout the country. The GAO, the
investigative arm of Congress, released the report last month.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Officials involved in anti-drug efforts defended the
program as a good start in a country that poses the most immediate
threat to the United States because of the billions of dollars in
drugs that cross the border each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is there is an awful lot of potential, and we are
continuing to work to bring it up to potential,'' said Brad Hittle,
a senior analyst with the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Hittle said it was vital to work with Mexico since the majority
of the cocaine and marijuana, and an increasing amount of heroin,
is smuggled across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply cannot in a realistic way in a democratic society
stop the flow of drugs across the border,'' Hittle said from
Washington. ``That is not a good place to set up your first line of
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report examined DEA's efforts to recruit and
train law enforcement officers from Bolivia, Colombia, Mexico and
Peru _ all of which are significant drug producers or
transportation routes _ to help gather intelligence on and
investigate drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA also hopes to enhance professionalism within the police
forces of those nations and to increase trust.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mexico has more specially trained agents than the
others, its teams have yielded only minor results, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ The arrest of two brothers known as ``Kings of
Methamphetamine.'' But the charges against them have been dropped,
and they are fighting extradition to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ The seizure of four hotels and other large properties in
Cancun allegedly belonging to drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which cost about $22 million for fiscal 1997 and
1998, trains officers at DEA facilities near Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Trainees are hand-picked by the various governments, and they
undergo psychological examinations, background investigations and
lie-detector tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a procedure that tries to weed out anyone with
questionable character in dealing with sensitive information,''
said Terry Parham, spokesman for the DEA headquarters in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better than nothing. It is a step,'' Parham said of the
investigative and intelligence teams. He declined to discuss
specifics on how the teams operate.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. agents are still hesitant to share sensitive information
with their Mexican counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   They point to 1997 when Brig. Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, then
head of Mexico's anti-narcotics agency, was arrested after it was
discovered he was living in an apartment owned by the late Amado
Carrillo Fuentes, once the country's top drug baron.
</P>
<P>
   And the 45 DEA agents in Mexico are quick to recall the torture
and murder of fellow agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena Salazar. He
was snatched off the streets of Guadalajara in 1985 and
interrogated at the home of a drug trafficker with multiple ties to
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said corruption is a problem on both sides of
the border and the program's growth reflects the confidence of both
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We depart from the view drug money corrupts everybody,'' said
Jose Antonio Zabalgoitia, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy. ``It
is wrong to portray only Mexicans as falling to the temptation of
corruption by drug money.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Lindheim, head of investigations for the Customs Service
in South Texas, agreed with Zabalgoitia: ``We know corruption is an
issue on both sides of the border; we have our share at state,
local and federal levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure Mexico is as concerned about us as we are about
them,'' said Lindheim, a former DEA agent. ``There is a question of
how much information can be shared.''

   WASHINGTON _ Most American couples age 45 and older are having
sex at least once a week and enjoy it, according to a survey
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey, conducted on behalf of the seniors group AARP
for its magazine Modern Maturity, found sharp differences in sexual
attitudes among men and women, and those with and without life
partners.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found differences by age, with middle-aged
respondents having sex more often and enjoying it more.
</P>
<P>
   The mail survey of 1,384 adults was conducted in March with the
assistance of John McKinlay of New England Research Institutes and
NFO Research Inc. of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This survey is unique because it looks at the attitudes,
behaviors and life circumstances starting at age 45, as compared to
studies that start at ages 59 or 60,'' said Constance Swank, AARP
research director.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are some generational differences, we found that a
majority of mid-life and older adults feel good about their lives
right now, and 67 percent of men and 57 percent of women say a
satisfying sexual relationship is important to that quality of
life,'' Swank said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that middle-aged and older couples have a
regular sex life, with more than 60 percent of men and women aged
45 to 59 reporting they engaged in sexual intercourse at least once
a week.
</P>
<P>
   For men and women over 75, the frequency declined to about 25
percent having intercourse once a week.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the respondents of all ages with partners _ 52
percent of men and 55 percent of women _ said they had intercourse
at least once a week.
</P>
<P>
   However, the frequency dropped sharply for those without life
partners. While more than half of all men and women with partners
reported intercourse at least once a week, only 6 percent of men
and one-half of 1 percent of women without partners had intercourse
that often.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 80 percent of the men and 96 percent of
the women without partners had not had sexual intercourse in the
past six months.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, 43 percent of men and 35 percent of women over 45
reported having intercourse at least once a week.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between couples and single adults were reflected
in other forms of sexual activity, including kissing and hugging,
caressing and oral sex. The survey found that men _ with and
without partners _ engaged in self-stimulation about eight times
more frequently than women.
</P>
<P>
   Men of all ages were more likely to think about sex than women,
with 28 percent of males and 5 percent of females age 45 to 59
having sexual thoughts more than once a day. For those over 75, 18
percent of men and 57 percent of women reported not having any
sexual thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Men were more likely to think sex was important in their lives
and was a critical part of a relationship. Women were more likely
to say they did not particularly enjoy sex or that they would be
happy never having sex again, although less than 20 percent of the
women gave such answers.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings of the survey were:
</P>
<P>
   _ About 10 percent of men and 7 percent of women have ever used
medicines, hormones or other treatments to improve sexual function
or activity. Slightly more than half of those who have tried such
treatments are currently using them.
</P>
<P>
   Among men taking treatment, sexual activity increased from 25
percent to 33 percent having sex at least once a week. But because
of the small number of people taking treatment, the survey found
the increase was not enough to be significant.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of men and women taking such treatment said it
increased their enjoyment of sex and had a positive effect on their
partner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Older people found their partners both more physically
attractive and romantic than young people, but at least half of all
age groups gave their partners the highest rating for being
physically attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Six of 10 men and half of the women in their 40s and 50s gave
their partners top rating as physically attractive, while 64
percent of men and 57 percent of women aged 75 and older said the
same of their partners.
</P>
<P>
   _ Older and younger women have sharply different attitudes
toward sex.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of women aged 45 to 59 said ``people should not
have a sexual relationship if they are not married,'' compared to
two-thirds of women 75 and older. Among men, 28 percent of those
aged 45 to 59 and half of those over 75 said sex should only be for
married couples.
</P>
<P>
   _ Over all, a third of the men said they were ``somewhat
satisfied'' with their sex life, while nearly a third of the women
said they were ``extremely satisfied'' with their sex life.

RULINGS KEEP CAMERAS OUT OF NEW YORK COURTROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MELISSA GRACE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In an age when round-the-clock coverage of news
events like the O.J. Simpson trial has become the norm, recent
court rulings have kept cameras out of courtrooms in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling in the spring on lawsuits brought by three television
stations, judges found the 47-year-old state law keeping all
recording devices out of courtrooms does not violate the freedom of
speech and equal rights protections.
</P>
<P>
   New York allowed cameras in the courtroom for eight years
between 1987 and 1997, but two years ago the Legislature let lapse
the authorization that allowed that exception to a 1952 law banning
taped court coverage. The law allows taped coverage only in appeals
courts, where there is no live testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Without a public clamoring for the heightened access, even
sympathy among some lawmakers has not persuaded political leaders
to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a dead issue,'' said Jerome L. Wilson, a lawyer
representing the New York Newspaper Publishers Association, a
lobbying group that supports cameras in the courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Mark Weprin, a Queens Democrat, has introduced a
bill that would make permanent the exception that was allowed until
1997. But without the support of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver,
Weprin's bill isn't moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an embarrassment that New York is one of only a
few states in the entire United States that does not have cameras
in the courtroom,'' Weprin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become highly politicized,'' said Joseph Reilly,
president of the New York State Broadcasters Association. ``The
problem rests with Shelly Silver. Speaker Silver won't even put it
(the bill) out on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, and Senate Majority
Leader Joseph Bruno, a Republican from Brunswick, have said they
support cameras in the courtroom and have condemned Silver for
blocking the measure, but neither has pushed the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers say that without the state's powerful legislative
leaders pushing, the courts will remain closed to cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of cameras in the courtroom argue that the heightened
news coverage strips defendants of their right to a fair trial
because witnesses may be intimidated and prosecutors, defense
attorneys and judges will worry more about their image on the news
than doing justice. Even jurors may behave differently if they are
being televised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental question is if a defendant is going to get a
fair trial,'' said Jonathan Gradess, executive director of the New
York State Defenders Association, which actively opposes the use of
cameras in the courts. He said that the news media favor
high-profile cases and often offer only snippets of those cases _
doing more to exploit the grief of victims than to educate the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of courtroom access say the detractors won their case
in 1997, in part because of the perception left after the O.J.
Simpson trial that justice became a ``media circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of courtroom cameras, though, say that because
Simpson was a famous person charged with murder, the intensity of
the coverage of the case was unusual and started on the Los Angeles
freeways, long before the trial.

 &HT;    SENATORS MOUNT NEW PUSH FOR HIGH-TECH VISAS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) Financial categories.
 &HT;    By Andrew J. Glass
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If key Senate Republicans have their way, the
number of temporary work visas for skilled foreigners would rise by
nearly 75 percent in each of the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Despite strong backing from the high-tech industry, whose clout
with Congress is on the rise, the effort to once more expand the
visa program faces an uncertain fate on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The firms in my state are desperate for highly skilled
workers,'' Phil Gramm, R-Texas, told reporters Tuesday at a news
conference held by 11 Republican senators to review their high-tech
agenda. According to the American Electronics Association, Texas
gained 102,000 high-tech jobs from 1990 to 1997, the most of any
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program,'' Gramm added, ``is aimed at keeping the best
graduate students and undergraduates in the country. Our graduate
programs in America are now about 50 percent foreign-born. What we
are doing _ given the acute labor shortage we now have among
high-tech workers _ is to allow these people to stay in the country
when they get out of graduate school to help us create jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not taking jobs away from Americans,'' Gramm argued.
``They are, in fact, with their technological know-how, creating
more jobs, more growth and more opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm has been joined in the push to increase the number of the
so-called H1-B visas by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi and Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Under their legislation, the annual H1-B quota would be raised
to 200,000 from the current level of 115,000, which was exhausted
on June 15, more than three months before the end of the federal
fiscal year. To attain passage, the Republican leaders will
probably seek to attach the visa increase as a rider to a pending
appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   But their strategy may not work. Despite historically low
jobless rates, Big Labor is likely to campaign for a presidential
veto. And not all Republicans are happy with the visa expansion
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that many H-1B visa numbers are being obtained
on the basis of fraudulent applications, thereby disadvantaging
employers who use these visas legitimately,'' Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas, wrote on May 26 to Doris Meissner, head of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who chairs a House Immigration Subcommittee, intends to
hold a hearing on the H1-B issue Thursday. The witness list is not
yet formulated, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, there was a bruising fight, and there's a question
whether Congress will want to face the issue again,'' said David
Byer, vice president of government affairs at the Software and
Information Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's appropriate that others take the lead on this
issue this year,'' said Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., who chairs
the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham served as the chief sponsor of last year's measure,
which increased the number of visas available this year and next
from 65,000 to 115,000. He faces a tough re-election battle next
year in Michigan, which has a strong labor constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The program permits foreigners with specialized skills to work
three years in the United States for a sponsoring firm. That period
may be extended for an additional three years.
</P>
<P>
   Employers must show that they could not find American workers to
do the same job and prove that the foreign workers have a
bachelor's degree or equivalent experience. The employer is
required to pay a $500 fee for each new worker. The fee, which
yields about $75 million a year, is designated to fund training and
educational programs for U.S. workers.

   Freestone cabernet sauvignon 1996, Napa Valley, Calif. About
$18.
</P>
<P>
   Freestone is a second label of von Strasser Winery, a small,
much-praised producer of fine cabernet sauvignon on the slopes of
Diamond Mountain south of Calistoga. This cabernet may not show the
intensity of the von Strasser wines but it is rich and beautifully
textured.
</P>
<P>
   The grapes come from several Napa Valley sources. The wine is 90
percent cabernet, 5 percent merlot and 5 percent cabernet franc. It
has obviously spent some time in oak, but the wood component is
nicely restrained. It is well balanced, with a long, attractive
finish.

SWEET AND GENTLE `GIANT' STANDS TALL 
OUR RATING: 4 STARS

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In Warner Bros.' animated film ``The Iron Giant,''
it's 1957, and overhead, the Soviet satellite Sputnik is orbiting
in silent triumph and menace over an America both more paranoid and
more innocent than now.
</P>
<P>
   Down East in the Maine fishing village of Rockwell (yes, Norman
could have painted it), young Hogarth Hughes (voiced by Eli
Marienthal) doesn't have a father, but he does have a vivid
imagination and a soft spot for stray animals. While classmates
watch films about ``duck-and-cover'' during an atomic bomb attack,
he doodles visions of other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   In the storm-savaged sea nearby, a fisherman (M. Emmet Walsh)
fights the waves, only to have his boat collide with what he swears
is a giant metal man. Guess what stray creature Hogarth will be
bringing home next?
</P>
<P>
   The film's makers use traditional two-dimensional cel animation
and a conscious '50s art design to evoke the world that Hogarth _ a
puny, bright outsider _ lives in with his spunky, hard-working
waitress of a single mom (Jennifer Aniston).
</P>
<P>
   The giant (Vin Diesel, his voice spookily distorted) that
eventually follows Hogarth home comes from some other part of the
universe, and the film never bothers to explain where or why. Even
the amnesiac giant doesn't know.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize his alien nature, the filmmakers cannily used 3-D
computer-generated animation to differentiate his hard metal lines
from the bucolic woods and fields surrounding him. It's an
effective visual trick and helps give the film a distinctive look.
</P>
<P>
   The giant has an appetite for metal, which he feeds by chomping
cars, power plants, railroads and the like. Hogarth must figure out
how to hide his latest pet, eventually persuading the hepcat
artist/junkyard operator who lives on the edge of town
(delightfully voiced by Harry Connick Jr.) to help out. Between the
giant's budding artistic instincts and the junkyard's wealth of
what are for him table scraps, the graveyard for all things
metallic proves a perfect place for the giant to stay. Everything
appears to be going well.
</P>
<P>
   But conflict quickly arrives in the form of Kent Mansley
(Christopher McDonald), a frustrated federal agent from the Bureau
of Unexplained Phenomena looking to make a name for himself, who's
sent to investigate the fisherman's reports of a giant.
</P>
<P>
   A cross between ``The X-Files''' single-minded Agent Mulder and
some sort of square-jawed Dudley Do-Wrong, he eventually calls in
the Army to eradicate a menace that he says could have been built,
for who knows what purpose, by the Soviets, the Red Chinese, the
Martians, even the Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   The film shows a gentle bias against guns, hunting and violence
that is ultimately played out in the film's resolution. More
generally, the film plays effectively and funnily with the
missile-fed fear and paranoia of the early Cold War and is briskly
and brightly written. ``The Iron Giant's'' design is a knockout,
particularly the knowing visual references to classic pulp
science-fiction styles of the mid-century.
</P>
<P>
   And its tale of a gentle giant learning ideas such as the life
of the soul, sacrifice for those you love, and the ability to
choose good over evil is sweetly touching.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers wisely resist excessive cuteness and dopey
sidekicks of Disney formula. ``The Iron Giant'' looks great,
generates a ton of real laughs and will appeal hugely both to
children, who know nothing of the 1950s, and to adults,
particularly those old enough to remember what the Cold War was
like and how oddly long ago and far away it now seems. &UR;  &QL;

By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's about time someone put the Watergate scandal
in proper historical perspective. Writer-director Andrew Fleming
and his co-scripter Sheryl Longin have come as close as anybody
with their scathingly silly satirical film ``Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to Richard Nixon, so get those snickering
thoughts about more recent Oval Office shenanigans out of your
head. And keep them out while the basic premise is explained.
</P>
<P>
   Two exuberantly airheaded teen-age girls, bubbly Betsy Jobs
(Kirsten Dunst, last seen in ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'') and intense,
congenitally bewildered Arlene Lorenzo (Michelle Williams of TV's
``Dawson's Creek''), become official presidential dog walkers just
as the cover-up of the Watergate break-in is getting under way in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   From observing G. Gordon Liddy's (Harry Shearer) hapless raid on
Democratic National Committee headquarters (they were returning to
Arlene's Watergate apartment after mailing a
``Win-a-date-with-Bobby-Sherman'' contest entry before the midnight
deadline) to offering a bickering, competitive Woodward and
Bernstein (played with hilarious pettiness by Will Ferrell and
Bruce McCulloch) more inside dope than they'll ever have the guts
to admit, the girls change history while rarely contemplating much
more than changing their nail polish.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, who character actor Dan Hedaya portrays with astounding
veracity and surprising empathy, meets the girls while they're on a
school tour of the White House. Aides think they're there to
blackmail _ as if these ditzes have a clue _ but Nixon, with
magnificent misplaced confidence, opts to spin them with his
magical ``way I have with young people.''
</P>
<P>
   It works, for a while. Betsy and Arlene are thrilled by their
new access to the corridors of power. To show their appreciation,
they bake batches of rich, Hello Dolly cookies (made even richer by
the pot Betsy's brother secretly stashed with the walnuts). Beloved
by one and all at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., the confections explain a
lot about the president's men's crisis-management strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Arlene even gets a moony crush on the chief executive. Down
comes her bedroom shrine to Bobby Sherman, up goes one to Dick
(and, yes, there are several entendre-laden conversations along
those lines). While her passion is, mercifully, never reciprocated,
it leads to the best Watergate gag in the movie. Who knew Olivia
Newton-John had so much to do with those missing 18{ minutes of
tape recordings?
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know what I'm referring to there, you're going to
miss a lot of the humor in ``Dick.'' Fleming wants to ``explain''
every crazy twist and turn of the scandal, and unless you lived
through it (and were paying attention), much of the film's
cleverness will escape you.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the comic portrayals of Kissinger (Saul
Rubinek), Haldeman (Dave Foley), Dean (Jim Breuer) and other
historical figures are funny enough to stand on their own, free of
historical references.
</P>
<P>
   And really, the girls carry the film. Doing the best oblivious
teen work since ``Clueless,'' the sprightly, spontaneous Dunst and
Williams never fail to win smiles. Even better, they register
growth _ incrementally, all but impossibly _ as Betsy and Arlene
discover their hero's foibles.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Nixon is an easy target for cheap laughs. So are
adolescent girls. But, unlikely as it may seem, the combination of
the two in ``Dick'' often makes for inspired comedy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``Dick'' (PG-13; language, drug use). &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Kirsten Dunst, Michelle Williams, Dan Hedaya, Will
Ferrell, Bruce McCulloch, Dave Foley. &UR;  &QL; 
Behind the scenes: &LR;  Directed by Andrew Fleming. Written by Fleming
and Sheryl Longin. Produced by Gale Anne Hurd. Released by Columbia
Pictures. &UR;  &QL; 
Running time: &LR;  One hour, 30 minutes. &QL;

<P>
   When I began devising the menu for Beacon, I wasn't sure what
potato side dish to serve. I wanted to offer just one that everyone
would love and that would work well with every entree. I considered
french fries, home fries, mashed potatoes and baked potatoes. Then
I thought of scalloped potatoes and knew I'd hit on something just
right. After all, there's a reason almost all Western cuisines have
a baked cheese and potato dish laced with butter or cream.
</P>
<P>
   To come up with the recipe, I thought of all the marvelous
potato gratins I've eaten in my life. There's a gratin dauphinois,
which is predominantly heavy cream and cheese, and pommes a la
boulangere, scalloped potatoes with onion and stock. Everyone's
mother made some sort of scalloped potatoes; I even loved them with
Velveeta.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to develop a signature version, based on a combination
of the classic recipes. As much as I love the dish, it seemed that
it could be refined a bit: I wanted one that was a little lighter,
and tasted more like potato than cream and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   First, I halved the normal amount of heavy cream, and
substituted chicken stock; this added a subtle flavor and
definitely elevated the texture. Then, I began experimenting with
the cheese. Aged Parmesan has a terrific pungency. Gruyere has a
nice nutty flavor and is also a great melting cheese. I also use
dry aged goat cheese, which can be hard to find. Aged cheddar,
Asiago or more Parmesan will work in its place.
</P>
<P>
   As for the star of the dish, I use Idaho potatoes, on the large
side. It may be more sexy to use yellow-fin this or heirloom that,
but all you really need is a dry starchy spud. Waxy varieties like
red skin or fingerlings don't absorb flavors or break down as well,
and they make a runny, slippery gratin. Be sure to cut the potatoes
an eighth-inch thick. Thicker slices won't give you the integrated
layers; with thinner slices, the gratin nearly turns into mashed
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, my gratin is a cross between scalloped potatoes and
macaroni and cheese _ probably the two ultimate comfort foods. Just
what I wanted it to be.

A CHATEAU THAT SEEMED A KINGDOM IS SOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I hadn't been to Prieure-Lichine very often in recent years.
Alexis Lichine, who had owned the Bordeaux chateau since 1951 and
gave it his name, died in 1989. His son, Sacha, who took his place,
had moved to Switzerland, leaving the running of the place to a
manager. Only occasionally could we get together in the chateau
garden to share some Champagne and talk about the old days.
</P>
<P>
   I knew the chateau was up for sale. My friend Alexis had put out
feelers years ago. But he sought an owner who would let him stay on
during his lifetime, an arrangement that anyone familiar with his
imperious mien and volatile temper would never accept. Still, it
came as a shock when, at a dinner in Bordeaux in June, I learned
that the Prieure had finally been sold.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer was the Societe Ballande, and the price was reportedly
$28.8 million. The Ballande company owns Chateau Vieux-Manoir in
Bordeaux and a wine estate in Australia, and it has interests in
Marie Brizard, the spirits company, and in Sovex, a Bordeaux
shipping concern. Separately, the Ballande family owns another
Bordeaux property, Chateau Baret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company needed a flagship name to enhance our reputation,
and Prieure-Lichine is at the top of the ladder,'' Louis Ballande,
the company's president, told the magazine Wine Spectator.
</P>
<P>
   So an era comes to an end, in spite of the air of permanence
about Bordeaux. The ancient wine villages seem never to change; the
stately chateaus set back among the vines look, many of them, as
they must have 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways this aura of timelessness is misleading. Making
and selling wine is a volatile business. A few bad harvests can
wipe out a fortune; so can France's notorious death duties,
equivalent to American inheritance taxes. And when the money is
gone, chateaus are sold. Alexis had hoped to sell Prieure during
his lifetime. The task was left to his son.
</P>
<P>
   Prieure is in Cantenac, a small commune near the larger village
of Margaux and about 20 miles north of the city of Bordeaux. Parts
of the chateau, once a Benedictine priory, date from the late
Middle Ages. Reports that the new owners would change the chateau's
name back to Prieure-Cantenac, as it was before Alexis Lichine
bought the place, were quickly denied by Ballande.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a good thing. In the 10 years since Alexis died there,
his name and his stature in the wine world have already begun to
fade. His two books, ``The Wines and Vineyards of France'' and the
New Encyclopedia of Wines and Spirits, are out of print, and his
wine business, once so influential, is now owned by another
company.
</P>
<P>
   Prieure is a classified growth, which means it was one of the 60
chateaus singled out as the region's best a century and a half ago.
It is a small property compared with many classified chateaus, but
under Alexis Lichine, its influence was out of all proportion to
its size, 170 acres. It was the base from which he set out on a
formidable task: bringing the Bordeaux wine trade into the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, chateau owners lived and conducted business much
as they had 100 years earlier: often suspicious of one another and
shut off from the rest of the world. Visitors were discouraged.
Alexis shocked his neighbors when he erected billboards along the
route from town inviting everyone to Prieure for tastings. He added
a small shop where he sold his wines, his books and wine artifacts.
He was accused of bad taste and worse by the other chateau owners,
many of whom now appear to spend as much on tourist amenities as on
winemaking equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Few Bordeaux chateaus are occupied by their owners. On all but a
few days each year, they are shuttered and dark, and the winemaking
is left to a manager. But Chateau Prieure-Lichine was more than a
winemaking center; it was a comfortable country home, often filled
with guests for lunch, dinner or a week's stay. Cooks fought in the
kitchen, dogs got underfoot and in the middle of it all, Alexis
barked orders in English and French, adding to the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists, generally relegated to the cellars and the gift shop,
occasionally wandered into the chateau itself. If they encountered
Alexis they might well be offered a glass of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Even without guests, the Prieure was lively. A couple were
always in residence, a houseman-chauffeur and his wife, who usually
served as the cook. Often, too, a young American recently out of
college would join the staff for a year or two, either to learn the
wine trade or to help update the two Lichine books. Each summer as
many as six young women, usually English, would come to handle
tours and work in the shop.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis divided his time between the Prieure and a rather gloomy
14-room apartment at Fifth Avenue and 81st Street in New York. He
enjoyed New York but counted the days until he could return to the
Medoc. Born in Moscow in 1913, he fled from Russia with his family
on the eve of the revolution, first to the United States and then
to France. He returned to America in the mid-1930's to join the
wine trade, and for the rest of his life he divided his time
between this country and France. He was, he often said, Russian by
birth, American by preference and French in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Though his chateau has been sold, Alexis will forever be a part
of it. Thanks to a government dispensation, he was buried on a
little knoll in the center of the vineyards. It used to be pleasant
to take a bottle of Champagne there to toast his memory. But it was
just as well that he wasn't around. He hated Champagne.

NOT THE SAME OLD RIBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next to pork ribs, lamb ribs are the best down-and-dirty grill
item I know. They're also the cheapest: where I live, it's hard to
pay more than a dollar a pound for them.
</P>
<P>
   But if you don't see lamb ribs in your supermarket, the chances
are that they're being tossed into the rendering bin; both demand
and profit are evidently so slim that they are not worth processing
and putting out in the case. So to make this dish, you may have to
ask your butcher for them in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb ribs are the bones of the breast, separated into individual
pieces. The butcher may give you the entire breast, or he may
separate the ribs for you. If he does not, make sure to ask him at
least to remove or cut through the breastbone, which will make
cutting in between the ribs the work of a moment.
</P>
<P>
   Like pork spareribs, lamb ribs require special treatment while
grilling because they are loaded with fat. (This is one of the
reasons they taste so good, of course.)
</P>
<P>
   From a flavor standpoint, it is best to grill them over indirect
heat very, very slowly, so that the fat does not drip off and catch
fire. But this is a long, labor-intensive process, not at all
minimalist in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The short cut is to parboil the ribs for 10 minutes or so to
render enough of the fat so that it doesn't catch fire the instant
you put the ribs on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   You will still need to be careful _ don't leave the fire
untended for more than a minute or two _ but you ought to be able
to brown the ribs beautifully and even crisp them up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Any sauce or spice rub you like is suitable here, and variations
are numerous. (See the list below.)
</P>
<P>
   My favorite is a sweet but highly pungent amalgam of raw onion,
strong mustard and either honey, marmalade or maple syrup, combined
in the blender in about a minute. This offsets the rich, meaty
flavor of the lamb perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   GRILLED OR BROILED LAMB RIBS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: About 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   4 to 5 pounds lamb breast, cut into ribs
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   \ cup honey, orange marmalade or maple syrup
</P>
<P>
   \ cup Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, peeled.
</P>
<P>
   1. Start a charcoal or wood fire or preheat a gas grill or
broiler; the fire should be only moderately hot, and the rack
should be at least 4 inches from the heat source. Bring a large pot
of water to a boil; salt it. Add the lamb, and simmer for 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Drain ribs. Grill or broil them for about 10 minutes, turning
once or twice and sprinkling them with a little salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, mix the honey, mustard and onion in a blender until
smooth.
</P>
<P>
   3. When ribs begin to brown, brush them with sauce, and continue
to cook, watching so they do not catch fire. When they are brown
and crisp all over _ in about 10 to15 minutes _ remove from grill,
and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   For flavoring lamb ribs, it's best to keep sauces, dips, rubs
and relishes on the light, low-fat side, since the ribs themselves
are rich. Here are some ideas:
</P>
<P>
   Make a light pesto of basil, cilantro or parsley, blending 2
tablespoons of oil to 1 cup of leaves, along with salt, a clove of
garlic and enough water to make the mixture creamy. Don't brush the
ribs with this mixture, but pass it at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Rub the parboiled ribs with chili or curry powder before
grilling.
</P>
<P>
   Combine about { cup chopped onion or scallion with 2 large
tomatoes, chopped, and a little minced garlic, some cayenne or
paprika, a tablespoon of vinegar, salt, pepper and lemon or lime
juice to taste. Pass at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the ribs with a light drizzle of { cup lemon juice, hot
sauce and salt to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Make a cucumber salsa by peeling and seeding two cucumbers, then
coarsely chopping them in a blender or food processor, along with
mint and salt to taste. Pass at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Make a relish by combining the chopped flesh of two mangoes or
peaches with { cup minced onion, the juice of 2 limes, salt, pepper
and chopped cilantro to taste. Pass at the table.

 &HT;    GROUP CALLS FOR LABELS TO LIST SUGARS ADDED TO FOODS
 &HT;    By JONATHAN HALL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans are ``drowning in sugar,'' but most
people are unaware how much is added to the food they eat, a
consumer advocacy group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a non-profit
consumer advocacy organization that focuses on food safety, has
urged the Food and Drug Administration to require food labels to
display the amount of ``added sugars'' as well as a daily
recommended amount.
</P>
<P>
   The group's petition, signed by dozens of leading health experts
and organizations, warned that added sugars cause obesity and
claimed that improved food nutrition labels would let consumers
live healthier lives.
</P>
<P>
   The center asked the FDA to adopt the Agriculture Department's
recommendation of 10 teaspoons (40 grams) as the daily value for
added sugars.
</P>
<P>
   ``While current labels list 'total sugars,' there's no way to
know how much of that sugar comes from refined sugars and how much
from the fruit or milk ingredients in foods like fruit roll-ups,
ice cream, breakfast bars, or yogurt,'' said Michael Jacobson, the
center's executive director. ``Even the most careful consumer can
scrutinize labels but still not have any idea how much added sugars
they contain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One might naively think that the sugar listing on the label
reflects the fruit but, in fact, the amount of sugar from fruit may
be microscopic, with almost all the sugar being added,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar consumption has risen by 28 percent since 1983, and this
has increased obesity and other health problems, the center said.
The average American consumes 64 pounds of sugar per year, but the
average teen-age boy, who drinks twice as much soda today than
milk, is consuming an astonishing 109 pounds of sugar a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it is impossible to prove that sugar causes weight
gain, those calories have to go someplace,'' said Marion Nestle,
chair of the Department of Nutrition and Food Studies at New York
University. ``It surely must be more than a coincidence that the
rise in added sugars parallels the rise in rates of obesity among
American adults and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Some food products ``brag about low fat'' but are almost
entirely made up of sugar, Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are living longer because of the public's health
awareness, said Mohammad Akhter, executive director of the American
Public Health Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important to have the labeling done, so the American
consumer can have the information to tell how many grams of fat,
calories and sugars there are. And once they know that, then people
will start to modify their behavior,'' Akhter said.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Food Processors Association and the Grocery
Manufacturers of America argued that requiring labels to identify
added sugars would confuse consumers more than educate them. They
suggested the best way to overcome obesity is to exercise.

A CUTTING BOARD WAITS FOR DISCOVERY

<P>
   With the rapid flow of professional cooking equipment into the
home kitchen over the last few years, it is hard to believe that
anything could have been overlooked. Especially something that has
been unchanged for a quarter-century and can be found in almost
every restaurant kitchen, whether Chinese, French or American.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Sani-tuff rubber cutting board is still waiting to be
discovered. Appealingly rudimentary _ simply a slab of hard rubber
_ it is available in shapes both plain, like a 12-by-18-inch
rectangle, and odd. A round Sani-tuff board 2 inches thick and 16
inches in diameter looks like a wheel of cheese; it is used in
Chinese restaurants for chopping in a circular motion with a
cleaver.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what size you buy, you will be surprised by how heavy
it is. Made of a dense rubber compound, these cutting boards do not
slide around on the counter as flimsy plastic and thin wood boards
do. You definitely do not want to drop one on your foot.
</P>
<P>
   As you cut on it, the surface gives, making it easier on your
arms as well as your knife blade. But it is hard and rough enough
to grab hold of the blade so that food does not slide around, as it
does on plastic cutting boards. And because it is rubber, most cut
marks and dents from knife points reseal themselves over time.
</P>
<P>
   The density of the Sani-tuff is one reason it has become a
standard in restaurant kitchens. Because the surface is nonporous,
it will not trap water, juices, mold or mildew.
</P>
<P>
   The cutting board has been certified by the National Sanitation
Foundation, which tests a product's resistance to bacteria growth
as well as its durability. If you do manage to mark the board up,
however, you can simply use sandpaper to rub its surface until it
is smooth again. To clean, scrub with soap and water; putting it in
a dishwasher is not recommended, as the rubber could warp.
</P>
<P>
   The Sani-tuff is sold only at restaurant supply stores.
Williams-Sonoma offered it briefly in its catalog, but no major
retail housewares store carries it. It is so new to this fussier
side of the cookware business, in fact, that it is still available
in only one color. Its manufacturer, Teknor Apex of Pawtucket,
R.I., calls the color buff, but dull yellow is more like it.
``Basically, you're just concerned with the functionality of it;
you're not concerned with the esthetics,'' said Peter Larkin, the
company's national sales manager.
</P>
<P>
   So if your kitchen is filled with a matching green professional
mixer, toaster and coffeepot, the Sani-tuff, until further notice,
may have to be the one smudge.
</P>
<P>
   The Sani-tuff rubber cutting board is sold only at restaurant
supply stores. Here are some suppliers in New York:
</P>
<P>
   Hung Chong Import, 14 Bowery (Pell Street), (212) 349-1463; a
board 16 inches in diameter is $36.95; 12-by-18-inch, $28.95.

 HILLARY SPEAKS OUT   (For use by New York Times News Service
clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First Lady Hillary Clinton obviously subscribes to
former Sen. Alan Simpson's golden rule of politics, practical
wisdom he is passing on these days to his Harvard students: if
you're damned if you do and damned if you don't, it's best to do.
</P>
<P>
   She went and did this week, with an extraordinary interview in
the new magazine Talk that unsealed her lips at last on the state
of her turbulent marriage. For the first time, she provided some
insight into the tortured thinking that has enabled her to continue
loving a husband she could never fully trust.
</P>
<P>
   And in case we wondered, her staff chief Melanne Verveer adds
that their love still involves ``physical passion.''
</P>
<P>
   In her interview, the first lady took a studiously detached
approach to the plain fact the world knows her husband has
repeatedly been unfaithful to her. She admitted she knew of the
problem and had tried to get him to change. But she did not condemn
him.
</P>
<P>
   By deciding to discuss the subject at all in a high-visibility
publication, however, Hillary Clinton stirred up questions about
her political motives that were as intriguing as her pained
rationale for sticking with him.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, a GOP presidential candidate embarrassed by her
own husband's public promotion of Viagra, the male potency pill,
was predictably asked for her reaction to Hillary's confessional.
``What's going on in their marriage, that's their business,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   A tactful answer, but not very realistic. Actually, what's been
going on in the Clinton marriage hasn't been private business for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of his reckless infidelities flooded Arkansas during his
gubernatorial years and were widespread in the national press corps
during his 1992 presidential campaign long before Gennifer Flowers
surfaced with tapes of intimate conversations between them.
</P>
<P>
   Years of forceful, official denial kept the stories in the
marginal realm of gossip, but they were a persistent below-ground
rumble. Since Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky finally made
deniability impossible, the Clintons' personal interaction and the
future of their marriage have been hot topics in households across
America.
</P>
<P>
   Media speculation has produced a weary sense of Clinton
overload, but that hasn't stopped the prying. It's too much fun to
poke into the imperfect lives of supercelebrities. The Clintons are
forever in our faces, and so is the garbage they bring.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us wish the whole tawdry subject would go away, and no
doubt Hillary Clinton does too. But wishing doesn't make it so.
</P>
<P>
   As she traveled recently through New York state on the verge of
formally entering the race for the U.S. Senate, she was repeatedly
asked about her personal life and whether a Senate race there meant
that she and Bill would be living separately. Her polite smile and
curt nod did not deter the shouted questions. Remaining mum was not
working.
</P>
<P>
   A single interview that is nearly as opaque as her prolonged
silence may not do the trick. She may still have to say more. But
given the circumstances, it was politically astute to begin baring
her soul more than a year before the election. Maybe, just maybe,
the subject will be exhausted long before election day.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of time to rehash her comments and debate
whether she said too much or too little and whether what she said
made any sense at all. It is better to get on with the inevitable
now than to wait until her image congeals as cold and unresponsive
-- and public opinion turned against her. She currently trails her
likely Republican opponent, New York Mayor Rudy Guiliani, by as
many as 10 points in one poll.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary's thinking, however, is not straightforward; perhaps it
is the way she remains sane. It is convoluted, peering around murky
corners rather than seeing what is right under her nose. She
resorts to psychobabble, theology and philosophy to explain away
her acceptance of her husband's betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   She claims, for instance, that the president's ``weakness'' for
other women was due to the fact he was a victim of emotional
``abuse'' as a child when he witnessed quarrels between his mother
and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   This was a bit much, plainly a stretch worthy of the world's
largest rubber band.
</P>
<P>
   To the rest of us, no childhood distress can justify Bill
Clinton's pursuit of women not his wife. Like many men, he wanted
sexual variety. But unlike most men, he indulged his carnal desires
without regard for the consequences. He was glib enough to get away
with it much of the time. He was selfish. He was also stupid.
</P>
<P>
   But his wife cannot say that. It is too brutal. Perhaps she has
said all she can say and retain political credibility. At least she
has tried to put it to rest. She has dropped the pretense that
nothing wrong happened. It may be the best she can do.

FOR SOY, THE TIME MAY FINALLY HAVE COME 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARIAN BURROS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has taken 30 years for soy to lose its hippie image. There
has been no mainstream movement to replace hamburgers with soy
burgers or pork with tofu. But thanks to a number of studies
suggesting that foods made from soybeans may have impressive health
benefits, soy is finally getting some respect.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has proposed adding soy to its
list of foods whose labels can make health claims, in this case
that soy can reduce the risk of heart disease. The agency says it
takes 25 grams of soy protein a day to lower cholesterol, as long
as the soy is part of a diet low in cholesterol and saturated fat.
</P>
<P>
   Consuming that amount is getting easier. At a health-food
supermarket in suburban Washington last week, I found 40 varieties
of soy substitutes for cow's milk, nine soy substitutes for yogurt
and 22 for hamburger. I found a soy margarine, three soy ice
creams, three soy versions of mayonnaise; textured soy protein to
replace ground beef, soy flour and, of course, tofu. The varieties
of tofu or bean curd alone numbered 26: flavored tofu, soft tofu,
firm tofu, very firm tofu, low-fat tofu.
</P>
<P>
   Someone must be eating this stuff, and don't be surprised if
it's one of your closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have suggested that soy products also offer protection
against breast and prostate cancer and may ease menopausal
symptoms. Soy contains phytoestrogens called isoflavones that do
have a weak estrogenic effect. But as with green tea, oat bran and
ever so many other silver bullets, evidence about soy's benefits is
still not proven except for the cholesterol-lowering effect. No
long-term human clinical trials have been conducted. Studies have
found a lower incidence of breast cancer in Chinese and Japanese
women who eat a lot of soy, but the lower rate could be due to
other cultural differences.
</P>
<P>
   Studies in monkeys and a few small studies in women have shown a
decrease in LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) and a reduced
risk of clogged arteries from eating soy. Rat studies indicate that
one isoflavone found in soy can block the growth-stimulating
effects of estrogen in the breast. Data on bone loss are
conflicting. And one study has shown that eight ounces of a soy
beverage daily reduced the number and severity of hot flashes and
night sweats.
</P>
<P>
   Taking phytoestrogen supplements is not a good idea: no one
knows the effects of concentrated phytoestrogens. But adding actual
soy to the diet may be beneficial. It's a good low-fat source of
protein.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans, like other beans, may produce gas, so introduce them
slowly. If that fails, Beano usually works.
</P>
<P>
   If you are using tofu as a source of soy, check the label to get
the maximum grams of soy protein, which can vary from 5 to 13 grams
per four ounces. The average I found was about 12.
</P>
<P>
   Do not buy the loose tofu that is sold in stores in containers
of water. In a survey The New York Times conducted four years ago,
extremely high levels of bacteria and coliform were found in the
eight containers that were analyzed. Coliform is indicative of
unsanitary handling. Four of the containers also contained E. coli.
Not all E. coli is deadly, but it is indicative of fecal
contamination. So stick with packaged tofu.
</P>
<P>
   About 55 percent of the soybeans grown in this country are
genetically engineered. If you are concerned about the impact of
bioengineered foods on the environment, or about the lack of
long-term studies on their impact on health, buy organic soy.
Health-food stores carry a considerable amount of it.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two recipes using tofu. The chocolate mousse does not
taste like one made with eggs, sugar and cream, but when I served
it without revealing what it was beforehand, it was lapped up. The
main dish uses the tofu as a substitute for ground pork and is good
hot or cold.

 &HT;    Athens couple has a thing for the small-scale wonders of penjing
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, August 5.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ It's a forest within a forest, this space
overlooking the Oconee River. The big trees and shrubs cover the
slope down to the stream, while little ones in trays and pots cover
the decks at the home of Karin Albert and her husband, Sander
Heilig.
</P>
<P>
   They are the forest keepers, and on this superheated summer day,
they are showing off their little plants and talking about the art
of creating them. The ways of miniaturizing and displaying trees
and shrubs seem as limitless as the number of plants around the
world, but the methods start with a common principle: At the
beginning, trim the top and the roots and do that periodically to
keep the plants small.
</P>
<P>
   Ahhh, here's an example. What a beauty. Chinese elm. Must be
only 2 feet tall, but look at that trunk; it's the trunk of a
venerable tree. And those roots, roaming all over the place, in a
casually contained manner.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsai?
</P>
<P>
   No. Penjing.
</P>
<P>
   Just as its steady rise in popularity was beginning to make
familiar the Japanese word bonsai (pronounced bone-sigh, meaning
tree in a pot), enter the Chinese counterpart, penjing (pronounced
pun-jing). It is new to many people, but, begun more than 1,000
years ago, predates bonsai. Both combine art and horticulture to
evoke scenes real and imagined, illuminating culture as they grow.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's the difference?
</P>
<P>
   Karin and Sander are good people to ask. They have studied and
practiced penjing since the 1980s, sharing their knowledge through
talks, articles and books, including the 1997 volumn, ``Penjing:
Worlds of Wonderment'' (Venus Communications, $39.95). (The book
was a family project, as the couple owns Venus Communications.
Sander was the book's art director, and Karin, who lived five years
in China, taught English and learned about penjing there. She also
translated the book, by Qingquan Zhao, from Chinese.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In general,'' says Karin, ``the Chinese like to incorporate
more of a whole landscape.'' Penjing translates to ``landscape in a
pot.''
</P>
<P>
   Karin says, ``In terms of styling, Chinese like to do more of a
relaxed kind of style.'' On the other hand, says the German native,
``The Japanese are more like the Germans; Japanese styling is much
more strict. They really do go more with the rules; it suits their
temperament.''
</P>
<P>
   A former bonsai-penjing importer, Karin, who moved to Athens
from Shanghai in 1988, says she has seen penjing grow in popularity
among Americans in the past decade: ``Many people trained in the
Japanese tradition have come to me and said, `This is like a
coming-out-of-the-closet experience. I always wanted to do
something less rigid.'''
</P>
<P>
   So that Chinese elm, which is about 40 years old, is penjing
instead of bonsai because of what Sander calls its ``wild roots''
and because wire was not spiraled around its branches to bend them
_ as would have been done in the strict bonsai style. Instead, a
branch was pulled down with a strand of wire attached to a root.
(Penjing artists do twist strands of wire around some trees, such
as conifers, just as bonsai artists do, because not all trees can
be styled to look aged and weatherbeaten simply through the ``clip
and grow'' method.)
</P>
<P>
   Like the Chinese elm, a Fujian tea, about 25 years old, does not
have its branches trained by the spiraled wire; also, its pruning
is more casual than that of a bonsai. ``The Japanese would
definitely like to do more of a layered look,'' Karin says.
</P>
<P>
   The elm and Fujian tea are tree penjing, which to many may be
difficult to distinguish from the better-known bonsai. However, the
other forms of penjing _ rock penjing and water-and-land penjing _
often show more loosely depicted scenes than bonsai, leaving much
to the imagination, in the same way a few brushstrokes of ink on
paper can evoke a detailed landscape of the mind.
</P>
<P>
   In showing their penjing (they have several dozen), Sander and
Karin fret, just as gardeners of large plants do, that the pieces
are not at their best. I expected them to say at any moment what so
many garden hosts say: ``You should have seen them last month'' or
``You should see them in October.'' And, like bigger gardens, this
garden of miniatures never will be finished.
</P>
<P>
   One rock penjing in progress on this day is a grouping cemented
together to represent a mountain scene, ``an indealized
landscape,'' says Sander. The rocks dominate and stand alone in
many rock penjing, although some artists add tiny trees to create
the illusion of distance.
</P>
<P>
   The couple also is creating a water-and-land penjing, using five
Chinese elms and rock on a white marble slab, with a portion of the
slab left open to suggest a lake. As the elms leaf out and lose
foliage, this scene can mirror the seasons, heralding spring's
rebirth, weathering winter's harsh cold and lovely snow.
</P>
<P>
   Such pieces do not come easily, of course; whether a stylized
bonsai or a more free-form penjing, the time and effort involved
can be immense _ raising the question: Is this really a natural
form of gardening _ going to such lengths to make a scene look
natural?
</P>
<P>
   Chuckling, Sander recalls, ``A friend of mine at a bamboo
nursery once said, `This is barbaric; you're torturing these little
trees.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sander naturally rejects such a charge, as does Karin, who
notes: ``In all gardening you have some pruning. That's what you do
with hedges. You prune trees. Trees prune themselves in storms.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the barbaric could hardly evoke the sweet passion that
rises in Karin when she talks about what penjing means to her:
</P>
<P>
   ``Any kind of gardening can be very satisfying, rewarding, give
you peace of mind, but with penjing, you're so involved in the
shaping and styling, relating to it on a stronger level. You're
looking at every new year, every new season as a way to make it
more beautiful, mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Penjing brought everything that I admired about China into
focus _ the calligraphy, the painting; I saw it all in these little
trees. It became an anchor for me that I could cling to and say,
`This is the China that I want to know about.'''

 &HT;    Get involved in new romance
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, August 5.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though we live in a fast-paced, get-it-done-now world, many
people prefer a relaxed, casual, old-style feel in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The passion for nostalgia has led to a rise in what's called
``romantic'' decorating themes. This decorating style is great for
people who are not afraid to trust their instincts and do the
decorating themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving away from home decorators. Everyone wants to do
it themselves,'' says Cathy Yarnovich, executive managing editor of
the Orange County, Calif.-based Romantic Homes magazine.
</P>
<P>
   One characteristic of romantic decorating is the art of
combining lots of elements and styles. For example, contemporary
furniture can be accented with old lace, throws and pillows.
Striped wallpaper can serve as a backdrop for floral curtains. And
old kitchen chairs can be stylishly adorned with sheer fabric
secured with a bow.
</P>
<P>
   Romantic themes are a perfect look for people with collectibles,
because the attitude is: More is better. Pull out all the old
pictures from the attic and find a place for them on the walls.
Instead of throwing away old hats, assemble groups of them in every
room. Even Grandma's old luggage and Grandpa's war medals have a
place in romantic home settings.
</P>
<P>
   The use of family heirlooms (pictures, photo albums, vases and
dishes) is at the core of romantic theme decorating, but in case
you need a few more ideas, other elements to consider are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Large floral prints, whether it's for wallpaper, pillows,
tablecloths or seat cushions. Don't worry about them clashing with
the fresh or dried floral arrangements that decorate tables and
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Chintz or lace fabric. Remember those doilies your
great-grandmother used to collect? And the lace curtains,
tablecloths and bedspreads that are yellow with age? All are
perfect.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mismatched patterns, such as prints with florals and stripes.
Don't let coordination restrict your imagination. If you like it,
use it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pillows, throws and slipcovers. There's no such thing as too
much of a good thing when it comes to these accessories.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Candles, candles everywhere. Even if you never light them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Anything old, from antiques to family hand-me-downs. Nostalgia
is a central theme in romantic rooms.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Creating vignettes or scenes for a room. Use your imagination
to make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Collectibles _ lots of them. Bring them all out or change them
according to season. But don't worry about overkill.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving the look needn't cost a fortune. One of the reasons
for the popularity of romantic decor is because many items can be
found at flea markets, garage sales and secondhand stores. The
restoration process is easy and often requires a coat of paint or
slip of new fabric. But old and rustic works, too.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an old baker's shelf can be turned into a rack to
hold collectibles, or used wicker furniture can be painted,
accented with homemade seat covers and paired with a wooden or
formica table. Old lampshades and hats can become a conversation
piece if properly displayed on a baker's shelf, a plate rail or
even a fireplace mantel.
</P>
<P>
   Although 94 percent of Romantic Homes readers are women (median
age, 43), Yarnovich says men like the romantic style, too.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when it comes to the use of heirlooms such as
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love it because their baby pictures are framed,''
Yarnovich said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I have a liking for England's meat pies. A good steak and kidney
pie is heaven to me. I will walk a country mile to get my hands on
a well-made chicken and mushroom pie, and I consume with pleasure
pork pies heavy enough to throw through a double-glazed window.
</P>
<P>
   What could be more enticing, then, than a week in Cornwall,
surrounded by one of the most famous meat pies of all, the Cornish
pasty?
</P>
<P>
   I came, I saw, I tasted. I became deeply depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Wandering up and down Cornwall, from St. Ives to Land's End,
from Padstow to St. Mawe, I sampled pie after pie. With each
purchase, hope flickered briefly, only to be extinguished by the
leaden, potato-stuffed football in my hand.
</P>
<P>
   The crust, with its distinctive crimping along the edge, was
either soggy or tough. The diced beef, perhaps a tablespoon's
worth, had a grayish tinge. The sliced potato and onion filling had
weight, and lots of it, but very little taste.
</P>
<P>
   A popular souvenir in Cornwall is a shiny ceramic pasty, meant
to be a paperwight or a doorstop. It struck me that it probably
wasn't much different than the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   I shared these thoughts in a light-hearted article.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the Cornish took offense.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, my comments were broadcast across Britain in
newspapers, on radio stations and on television. The population was
roused, and the Cornish, although slow to anger, were beginning to
howl for blood.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Muller, the owner of the Lizard Pasty Shop in Heldon, on the
Lizard Peninsula, expressed the region's mood when she applied a
blowtorch to an American flag and called for a boycott of American
goods.
</P>
<P>
   The flag, which was nylon, melted a little but did not actually
catch fire. I suggested to a newspaper reporter that here was the
problem in a nutshell: Too many of Cornwall's pasty makers seem to
go for the cheapest ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   The Times of London devoted a feature to the subject and
denounced me in an editorial as an ``impudent American food
critic,'' incapable of appreciating the simple, wholesome pleasures
of a food the Cornish have loved for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grimes and his bumptious comments may be dismissed,'' The
Times wrote. ``He is merely overpaid, overfed and over here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Plymouth Evening Herald ran a shock-horror front-page
headline in a type size not seen since Neville Chamberlain came
back from Munich. ``Hands Off Our Pasty!'' it shrieked. A giant
pasty was depicted on the front page, and although pasties do not
exactly have body language, this one looked as if its feelings were
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, a few words of explanation may be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The baked good in question is as simple as can be. It is a
short-crust pastry rolled out in a circle, filled with chopped
beef, sliced potatoes and onions, seasoned with salt and paper, and
then folded over and crimped along the edge. Brushed with milk or
egg and baked in the oven, it becomes a meal in a pouch.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, Cornishmen stuffed a pasty into their overall
pockets on their way to the mines. The crimped edge made a
convenient handle, and the pasty could be eaten without a plate or
utensils. Fishermen avoided them, believing that it was bad luck to
bring one on a boat.
</P>
<P>
   As a national symbol, the pasty is to Cornwall what the shamrock
is to Ireland, or the thistle is to Scotland. It is sold in every
bakery. It features on countless postcards.
</P>
<P>
   A recent one, timed to the eclipse on Aug. 11 that is expected
to draw hundreds of thousands of tourists to Cornwall, shows a
giant Cornish pasty crossing the sky and darkening the sun. Another
card, ``The Full Pasty,'' shows a chorus line of overweight,
drunken Cornishmen wearing fisherman's caps and nothing else, each
one holding a strategic pasty.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Cornwall was going up in flames. Regional radio and
television stations called. Then the national channels: Radio 4,
Radio 5, Sky News. The BBC World Service. After two days I began to
lose track.
</P>
<P>
   I was given many opportunities to take it all back. I stood
firm. I repeated the simple truth, that the average Cornish pasty
is hopelessly bland, and that the only way most of them make any
impression at all is by loading up on black pepper. The situation
turned ugly: some callers began threatening to send me pasties.
</P>
<P>
   Gristers, the country's largest commercial maker of pasties,
unveiled a national advertising campaign on Monday, with posters
showing a large pasty with the slogans ``Bland's End'' and
``Perfectly Peppered to the Last Bite.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, I still nourish hope. Several Cornishmen have
called me, agreeing that the typical pasty sold at most bakeries
was nothing much, but that if I were to drop by their houses, they
would make me a pasty to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Muller's pasties have won praise in a number of
publications, and I'm told that a butcher in Hayle makes a bang-up
pasty. Somewhere out there, waiting for me, is a noble baked pie,
savory and steaming with tender chunks of British beef, gorgeous
slices of good Cornish potato and honest onion, and perhaps a
turnip or two for good measure. It will be salted. And yes, it will
be peppered to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it may be that I am beyond hope. As one
outraged Cornish pasty lover put it, ``The man is obviously a
complete imbecile.''
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   New York is not exactly pasty country. As far as I know, there
is only one local source for Cornwall's pride and joy, Myers of
Keswick at 634 Hudson Street in Manhattan. The pasty sold at Myers
is an elongated rectangle rather than a half-moon shape, the beef
is ground rather than diced, and the boiled potato is a paste
rather than slices, but the pie is quite good and very traditional
in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The basic filling of meat, potato, onion and carrot is wrapped
in a cold-water crust made with lard, and there's a proper Cornish
crimp running along the top. Unlike most Cornish pasties, the Myers
pasty is about two-thirds meat. Baked on the premises, it costs
$2.75.

 &HT;    `Dick's' giggly fun often right on but for wrong crowd
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to figure what demographic ``Dick'' is trying to nail.
Drawing equally from ``Clueless,'' ``Forrest Gump'' and ``Romy and
Michele's High School Reunion,'' the movie's notion of two teen
girls being the secret cause of Richard Nixon's downfall is a
clever one. But teen audiences won't get most of the Watergate-era
references. And boomers old enough to be in on the joke probably
won't be tempted to check out the flick. The movie, which opens
today, hangs in that special section of purgatory where good ideas
never quite become great.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams play best pals Betsy and
Arlene, two excitable 15-year-olds in 1972 Washington, whose
biggest goal in life is to win a Tiger Beat-sponsored date with
Bobby Sherman. They're so infatuated, they hardly think twice about
the mustached creep they encounter late one night skulking around
Arlene's building . . . the Watergate Apartments.
</P>
<P>
   On a school tour of the White House, they see the goon again,
and still don't realize what we do: That this is the infamous G.
Gordon Liddy (Harry Shearer). Like excitable blond Gumpettes, Betsy
and Arlene accidentally stumble into the heart of the Watergate
scandal, overseen by sweaty Richard Nixon (Dan Hedaya). They get
their hands on incriminating papers, cause the famous 18-minute gap
on that Oval Office tape, and gigglingly choose the name ``Deep
Throat'' when they make a prank call to journalists Bob Woodward
(Will Ferrell) and Carl Bernstein (Bruce McCulloch).
</P>
<P>
   As Bob Haldeman (Dave Foley) puts it, ``I have met yams with
more going on upstairs than those two.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-written and directed by Andrew Fleming (``The Craft''),
``Dick'' misses its comic marks as often as it hits. While Arlene's
crush on Nixon results in a hilarious beach fantasy, and a terrific
explanation for that blank tape, it also throws in lame
marijuana-cookie jokes or obvious double entendres on the
president's first name. A bigger problem is Fleming's pacing. The
film's first half hour is full of pauses for laughs that don't
come, and there's some crummy camera work (including patently fake
shots of the White House.) And terrific comedian Teri Garr, as
Arlene's mom, has nothing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Everton's costumes fill the movie with visual punch
lines, as Betsy and Arlene graduate from gawky schoolgirls to
flower-power avengers. Dunst and Williams are the best thing about
``Dick,'' infectiously funny as they burst into shrieks of
excitement or surprise at the slightest provocation. They make you
believe that the Nixon White House fell not because he lied or
broke the law, but because they could not abide the idea that he
was mean to his dog, Checkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C +
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst, Michelle Williams, Dan Hedaya. Rated
PG-13 for sex-related humor, drug content and language. One hour,
30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A smart idea undone by some limp direction.

`THE CHILEAN KITCHEN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chile sends the United States an ever-increasing list of
ingredients _ fish, oysters, sweet onions, fruit and wine. But it's
hard for an American to visualize how these components are forged
into a cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   That's why ``The Chilean Kitchen,'' by Ruth Van
Waerebeek-Gonzalez (HP Books, $16.95 paperback), is an eye-opener.
The author, a Belgian native, is married to a Chilean. A wealth of
her recipes calls for fresh ingredients, especially tomatoes and
corn showered with herbs, making Chilean food a summertime
pleasure. Otherwise fairly ordinary dishes, like a tomato and onion
salad, are prepared with little touches that make them taste new.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Van Waerebeek-Gonzales first introduces the culinary
influences, basically Spanish but seasoned with the traditions of
the Araucana Indians, with accents from Italy, Germany and
Yugoslavia. Some form of corn, along with flashes of chili, is the
abiding Indian reference, as are potatoes and pumpkin. Hot peppers,
paprika, cumin, cilantro, onion and lemon strike bold chords.
</P>
<P>
   The author and her husband, Sergio Gonzalez, opened a
restaurant, Mediteranneo, near Santiago, but she emphasizes that
Chilean cuisine is based in the home. The recipes are home style
and simple.
</P>
<P>
   Chileans are determined snackers who set out epic arrays of
bocadillos (little mouthfuls) to accompany cocktails. You don't
need a recipe for a plate of olives, cheese, sausage and cold
seafood, but the book gives the proper garnishes and tangy salsas,
along with recipes for delicious shrimp sizzled in garlic, many
empanadas and assorted ceviches, including a verdant one made with
clams, onions and herbs.
</P>
<P>
   The onions in that bright tomato salad are tamed by salting and
soaking. A velvety cold avocado soup is rich enough that a recipe
for four serves six, though it needs a splash of lime to punch it
up. A pork stew thick with fresh corn and tomatoes can be made
early in the day and reheated.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popularity of Chilean sea bass, there are only a
couple of recipes for this meaty white fish, but perhaps that's
good, because the sudden rush to serve what is actually Patagonian
toothfish is rapidly depleting stocks of the fish in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   And for relaxing moments away from the stove, there are passages
that cover culture and history, including a poem, ``Ode to Conger
Chowder,'' by the Nobel laureate and food lover Pablo Neruda.
</P>

`THE THINGS WE USED TO SAY': TELLING THE BIGGER STORY WITH THE
SMALL DETAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took a long time for Natalia Ginzburg, who died in 1991, to
be recognized internationally as an important Italian writer and
moreover a writer whose life's experience combined the century's
most terrible personal and national tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the delay is Ginzburg's concentration on what
seem to be the small elements of family life and her treatment of
the great events of history as almost incidental. Another is her
habit of self-effacement, the pose of emotional invisibility that
she maintains in her own stories.
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly the case in ``The Things We Used to Say,'' her
family reminiscence, originally published in English in 1986 under
the title ``Family Sayings'' but reissued now in a new translation
by Judith Woolf.
</P>
<P>
   Ginzburg was the youngest daughter in a well-connected,
half-Jewish middle-class family in Turin, growing up in the 1920s
and '30s surrounded by some of Italy's most prominent scientists,
industrialists and writers. Her book portrays the family living
through the years of Italian Fascism and the Nazi occupation, even
though those events are never central to her narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``The Things We Used Too Say'' is so emotionally lean
that at first it seems undernourished, optional. Ginzburg is not a
writer for every taste. But in the end, this reminiscence is an
affecting and serenely powerful work, an intelligent and lapidary
addition to more searing portrayals by the likes of Primo Levi,
Alberto Moravia and other Italian chroniclers of the experience of
Fascism and the war.
</P>
<P>
   One moment in Ginzburg's book illustrates its unobtrusive
effect. It is 1943; Mussolini has been killed, and the Germans have
occupied Italy and begun to round up Jews. One night Ginzburg's
Russian-born husband, Leone Ginzburg, a leading anti-Fascist
journalist, does not return home and she suspects that he has been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning one of Ginzburg's family friends, the
typewriter magnate Adriano Olivetti, comes to tell her that Leone
has indeed been taken away by the occupying Germans. He urges her
to flee with her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall always remember, as long as I live, the great comfort
it was to me that morning to see his familiar figure, which I had
known since my childhood,'' Ginzburg writes. ``And I shall always
remember his bent back as he stooped to collect our scattered
clothing and pick up the children's shoes in a humble, kindly
attitude of patient compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely by directing the reader's attention to that
seemingly irrelevant detail, the wealthy friend bending over to
collect the children's shoes, that Ginzburg grounds an
inconceivable moment in the inescapable and irremediable grip of
reality.
</P>
<P>
   The passage in which she relates her husband's arrest comes not
in a chapter about him but in one about the man she always knew as
Adriano and how the occupation had turned him into a kind of
vagrant, walking ``with the dragging, solitary gait of a tramp.''
</P>
<P>
   A few pages earlier Ginzburg describes the atmosphere at the
eccentric publishing company where several of her best friends
worked. The publisher himself (she does not identify him by name,
but it was Giulio Einaudi, who was later to publish all her books)
had hung a picture of Leone on the wall. Then, almost as an
afterthought: ``Leone had died in prison, in the German wing of
Regina Coeli prison in Rome, one icy February during the German
occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief preface to ``The Things We Used to Say,'' Ginzburg
avows that she has ``invented nothing'' and has changed no names
and altered none of the events she describes. Still, she says, the
narrative is ``full of gaps'' and there ``are also many things
which I remember but have omitted to write about, including many
which concern me personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Ginzburg leaves some things out and puts other things in is
a secret that went with her to the grave. But her overall intention
is not difficult to fathom: she wanted to reproduce her
observations in the pristine form they had when she made them as a
young woman, without adding any of the knowledge or perspective
that came later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Things We Used to Say'' is a Proustian evocation of
memory, one focused on words, the everyday expressions of family
members, rather than tastes or smells. But it is an evocation of
memory without alteration: no subsidies, no commentary, no
adulteration.
</P>
<P>
   Ginzburg presents her family with an almost ruthless lack of
sentimentality. Her father, Giuseppe Levi, was a prominent
professor of anatomy and an anti-Fascist, entirely assimilated Jew.
Ginzburg depicts him in his private domain as an anxiety-ridden,
crusty, demanding man full of odd prejudices and opinions,
intolerant of his children's interests and yearnings.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother was a cheerful, slightly daft, self-indulgent woman,
not Jewish, who said things like: ``I'm bored. There's nothing
worse than being bored. If only I could have a nice illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginzburg portrays the family's ordinary life _ the father
accusing his children of being donkeys and calling most others
yahoos or half-wits; two of her brothers always fighting; her
sister and mother reading but misunderstanding Proust. Then there
are the devastating events of Mussolini's rise to power and the
German invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Finally a kind of normal life returns during which the family's
old habits reappear. But as Ginzburg makes clear, after the initial
joy everything came to be shadowed by the inescapable recent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time that followed was like the aftermath of
intoxication,'' she writes of the period after the end-of-the-war
euphoria, ``a time of nausea and languor and weariness, and
everyone felt themselves in one way or another deceived and
betrayed, both those who lived in the real world and those who had
found, or at any rate imagined that they had found, the means to
describe it. So, alone and dissatisfied, everyone set off down
their own road once more.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginzburg is describing the world outside herself, but she is
also describing her own sense of bereavement and solitude as a
woman whose determination to remember the petty details is an
obstinate refusal to allow herself to be swept away by politics or
war or someone else's idea of meaning.

   LONDON _ In a country synonymous with eccentricity, nothing
could be more eccentric than Britain's food culture. Notoriously
indifferent to good food, the English nevertheless feast on some of
the best television cooking shows anywhere in the world.
Traditionally resistant to eating out, they lavish love and
attention on their favorite chefs, who rise to a prominence that
Emeril can only envy. When Delia Smith made omelets on her
television show a few months ago, egg sales in Britain rose by the
millions. It did not seem preposterous when the chef Antony Worrall
Thompson announced last month that he was considering a run for
Parliament.

   Perhaps most surprising is the fact that London is now one of
the world's most exciting restaurant cities. And it is largely on
the strength of home-grown chefs, many of them dedicated to
reworking and reinventing a native culinary vocabulary that many
people had given up for dead, or worse, treated as a joke. It's all
very odd. Some of the best French food in London is not being
cooked by French chefs. And some of the best food, period, is
English.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to take the measure of London on a flying visit,
but in five days of diligent eating, I was able to check on some
new restaurants and follow the trail of younger chefs who are
carrying forward the ``new British cooking,''a movement that is now
spinning off its second generation of chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Londoners have been following Gordon Ramsay since he earned two
Michelin stars at Aubergine, the high point in a short career that
began in London under the tutelage of Marco Pierre White and Albert
Roux, and continued in France with Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon.
About a year ago, he opened Gordon Ramsay on the site of the former
Tante Claire, and the tables have been full ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The British like their chefs spicy, and Ramsay fills the bill. A
former football player for the Glasgow Rangers, he presides over
his small Chelsea restaurant and has thrilled the press with his
habit of turning away celebrities who show up demanding a table.
Getting in takes some doing. By calling several weeks in advance, I
was able to get a table for two at 6:45 p.m., on the condition that
I give it up by 9, that I call three days before to reconfirm, and
that I leave my credit card number. Even after I reconfirmed, the
restaurant called the day of the reservation for a second
reconfirmation, and in being seated, I was reminded, pointedly,
that at precisely 9 o'clock my presence would no longer be
required.
</P>
<P>
   It was worth the trouble. Ramsay looks as if he could run
through a brick wall, but he cooks with subtlety, refinement and
clarity, qualities evident in the simple gazpacho he presented as
an amuse bouche, a soup whose flavors had the hard-etched
definition of a crystal.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant is as French as a one-day nuisance strike. The
servers are French, the reservations hostess is French, and the
food is very French, although there's a touch of new British in
Ramsay's love for the lesser meats and for homey vegetables like
leeks, potatoes and cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm evening, I flinched at the challenge of starting with
foie gras three ways (sauteed with a mango compote, semi-cooked
with Earl Grey consomme and as a confit with truffles). The poached
Scottish lobster seemed a better bet, fresh and summery on seasonal
vegetables, touched up with a blob of osetra caviar and swimming in
a shallow pool of chilled tomato and basil consommee. A salad of
crispy pig's trotters sounded like the last word in nonelegance,
but it arrived in triumph, precise discs of wine-braised pork meat
bound in a chicken and foie gras mousse, with a little white lump
of sweetbread embedded in the center of each meaty circle. A fried
quail egg made the dish seem like a futuristic breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   As a main course, roasted wild salmon, another Scottish entry,
came with braised baby gem, a lettuce that shows up everywhere in
Britain. Here, it made a suave counterpoint to cucumber, olives,
basil and a creamy tomato butter. Darkly flavored pigeon, poached
in a bouillon of cepes, doubled its richness with a slice of
sauteed foie gras, served in a truffle consomme.
</P>
<P>
   Service at the restaurant seems more New York than London,
efficient without hauteur. Ramsay can be tough on pushy
celebrities, but he has let some of the air out of the two-star
experience.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ramsay was apparently not enough, so four months ago he
installed a protege, Marcus Wareing, at Petrus in Mayfair. It, too,
is fully booked, every day. Wareing, who earned his own Michelin
star at L'Oranger down the street, carried the Ramsay spirit, and
some of the personnel as well, over to new quarters, which share
with the Chelsea restaurant a peculiar sense of design, a kind of
tastefully rich poor taste. At Gordon Ramsay, you see it in the
funny-looking oversize glass sculptures set into the wall, and the
tutelary deity of the place, a glass bust that looks a little like
Ernie Kovacs in a maitre d'hotel's outfit. At Petrus, a sterile
room that looks as if it might once have been an airline ticket
office, it's the art, enormous oil-on-panel paintings modeled after
Dutch still lifes of food.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The cooking is a lot better than the decor, although a cut below
Gordon Ramsay, based on one lunch. A cauliflower soup with sauteed
girolles was, as the French say, ``correct.'' Likewise a big, fat
ravioli stuffed with salmon and langoustine in a lobster bisque.
The poached guinea fowl, over a Ramsay-esque blanket of braised
romaine, was something else again, simple, moist and flavorful,
with an earthy mushroom veloute.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from Mayfair to Chez Bruce, across the Thames in
a modest strip of stores overlooking Wandsworth Common. There are
spiritual links, however. It was at Handley's, now occupied by Chez
Bruce, that Ramsay got his start, working with Marco Pierre White,
and the restaurant retains the old table where White once played
cards. Chez Bruce has been around for five years now, but this year
it was named London's best New British restaurant at the Carlton
London Restaurant Awards, Britain's culinary equivalent of the
Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Chez Bruce should be required study for any restaurateur
thinking of opening a bistro. It's almost the platonic form of the
idea, a modest neighborhood place where the waiters look happy, the
customers look happy. And why shouldn't they be? Bruce Poole, the
chef and owner, puts a $40 three-course meal on every table that
manages to feel familiar and fresh at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the New British chefs, Poole started out working at
a country hotel, an experience that seems to inspire a reverence
for traditional ingredients and dishes. His appetizers include
crispy wafers of calf's tongue served with a green salad and a
sharp ravigote sauce, a ballotine of guinea fowl and foie gras set
off with a green tomato chutney, and a truly astounding imam
bayildi, a Turkish timbale of warm eggplant, tomato, currants and a
rack of spices.
</P>
<P>
   Once past the rabbit, it's difficult to find what's British in
the pot roast of rabbit with creamed barlotti beans, pancetta,
tomato and basil, but the flavors mesh in a way that makes
criticism pointless. And the dessert menu aims straight for the
heart of traditional British cooking, with some snappy updating.
Greengage plum and fromage frais mousses are organized into a
cool-looking green-and-white-striped cube, with a big, fat ball of
lemon-curd ice cream giving the dish the look of a piece of public
sculpture. Better yet is a plum, almond and raspberry pudding
topped with Jersey cream.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Rhodes, another New British chef, is a familiar face to
British television viewers, the punkish-looking free spirit who
whizzes around on series like ``Rhodes Around Britain,'' rummaging
through the country's culinary heritage and offering up twisty
reinterpretations. After earning a Michelin star at the Castle
Hotel in Taunton, and another at the Greenhouse in London, he
opened City Rhodes, near Fleet Street, which Michelin awarded a
star last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes' newest London restaurant, Rhodes in the Square, opened
in May 1998 in a 1930s luxury apartment complex on Dolphin Square
in Pimlico. The room looks like a cross between a planetarium and
the best dining room on a cruise ship. The banquettes are midnight
blue, tiny ceiling lights twinkle overhead and chrome railings add
a swooshy moderne touch. Rhodes in the Square is a lounge without a
lounge singer.
</P>
<P>
   A typical Rhodes starter is a chunky terrine of ham, tongue and
carrot, held together with a thin wrapper of sliced carrot and
freshened up with an assertive caper and avocado salsa. It has an
honest, solid English quality, without the heaviness. Rhodes is
ingenious at Anglicizing his dishes in unexpected ways, dropping
black-pudding ravioli into an onion and lemon-thyme soup, for
example, or glazing a haddock fillet with welsh rarebit. One main
course stopped me in my tracks, a snowy-white filet of plaice,
roasted in a butter sauce and sprinkled with tiny Scottish shrimp
still in the shell. Like little cracklings, they added a burst of
rich shrimp flavor with each bite.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes loves old-fashioned English desserts, especially puddings
and sponge cakes. His signature bread and butter pudding is
outstanding, proof that stale bread ranks as one of the world's
great ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Corrigan, the chef at Lindsay House in Soho, could be
Rhodes' wild Irish cousin. Like Rhodes, he first made his way
cooking at country hotels. He then gained a reputation working in
London for Stephen Bull, one of the prime movers of New British
cooking. In late 1997, he opened his own restaurant, in an
mid-18th-century townhouse on Romilly Street, which Michelin
awarded a star this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay House is a tiny island of repose in the nonstop New
Year's Eve party that Soho has become. The downstairs and upstairs
dining rooms, tiny and quaint, do not seem to have been redecorated
since 1830 or so, although odd daubs of gilt here and there on the
walls suggest the presence of an interior designer in the recent
past. The painting of a mild-mannered cow that hung over my table
was perfectly in keeping with the low-key atmosphere of the place,
disturbed only by a very loud fellow American who thought it was
absolutely fascinating that the chef should have the same last name
as Wrong-Way Corrigan, the aviator who set out for Europe and
landed in California in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan practices an exciting, earthy, at times undisciplined
brand of nativist cooking. His appetizer of smoked eel makes smoked
salmon look like a cheap upstart, but the fennel, apple and chorizo
salad that goes with it has one ingredient too many, namely the
chorizo.
</P>
<P>
   The all-out approach worked wonders, however, with tender filets
of pork, presented in neat cylinders and surrounded by slices of
black pudding and a pig's trotter sausage called crudeen wrapped in
home-cured ham and braised in veal stock. A fresh-tasting pea puree
provides a smooth, soothing counterpoint to the meat activity.
Desserts seem almost chaste by comparison. A simple offering of
plump blackberries with lemon curd and shortbread biscuits rounded
out the meal perfectly. Even simpler were the cheeses from Neal's
Yard Dairy nearby
</P>
<P>
   Leith's Soho, which opened in May, is the offshoot of the
long-established Leith's in Notting Hill. Alex Floyd, after a
decade at the original Leith's, grew restless, and the new Leith's,
on Beak Street, is allowing him to turn out more informal food for
a younger, hipper crowd. It has the feel of downtown Manhattan,
with its cool, blond-wood floor, mirrored bar and funny light
fixtures that look like big translucent Life Savers. There's a
world-beat impulse behind the menu, especially in appetizers like
the arugula and ``wok-fried squid'` salad, accented with chorizo,
and the scallop wontons, swimming in a sweet chili and coconut
vinaigette. The wine list is tilted toward the New World, with lots
of California and South American wines, and the service, too has
its own mid-Atlantic flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Leith's turns more traditional in its entrees. Roast rump of
Blairmore beef comes with sauteed potatoes, bearnaise sauce and a
beautifully concentrated cabernet reduction. The lamb shank, an
impressive, darkly glistening hunk of meat, makes a straightforward
enough statement with fried potatoes, provencal vegetables and
black olives. The main-course menu continues in this basic
modern-bistro mode _ meat and two veg for the modern Londoner. The
raspberry trifle is unreconstructed English, and superb. Leith's
offers a style of eating that seems to suit London at the moment.
Not too fancy, international, and reassuringly English when you
start digging deep.
</P>

PROTESTS IN ASIAN GEORGIA DERAIL ART SHOW HEADED FOR U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Politics in the Republic of Georgia, which faces parliamentary
elections in October and a presidential vote in April, have
scuttled a landmark traveling exhibition of Georgian gold and
silver objects, illustrated manuscripts, religious icons and other
art that had been due in the United States this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Land of Myth and Fire: Art of Ancient and Medieval Georgia,''
a 160-object show covering 8,000 years of the country's culture,
was to be the centerpiece exhibition at the Walters Art Gallery in
Baltimore beginning Oct. 26. Planned for more than two years, it
was to move on to the Mingei International Museum in San Diego next
March and to the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston in August 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze had
strongly backed the exhibition despite opposition from some
Georgians and from political opponents collectively called
Zviadists, after former President Zviad Gamsakhurdia. He was ousted
in 1992 and died in mysterious circumstances in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters said that the objects, which include a gold lion
made between 2300 and 2000 B.C., a gold pectoral cross from the
10th century, an 11th-century Old Testament manuscript never
publicly displayed and a holy shroud from the 15th century, were
part of the national patrimony and held too much religious
importance to be sent overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters asserting that that the works are too fragile to
travel and that security precautions are inadequate have picketed
the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi several times since May. Student groups
have gone on hunger strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Walters nor the Foundation for International Arts
and Education, which jointly organized the show, had received
official word voiding the exhibition contract Tuesday. But the
Walters said that press accounts in Georgia and informal talks with
Georgian officials had forced it to cancel the show.
</P>
<P>
   David Dondua, the deputy chief of mission at the Georgian
Embassy in Washington, confirmed that the exhibition had been
``postponed indefinitely,'' although Shevardnadze remained a
supporter who lamented that ``Georgia has treasures the world has
no idea about.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Vikan, the director of the Walters, said that a decision
had to be made now because time would be required for the
restoration of many objects by Walters conservators before the
show. Shipment of the objects had to begin this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two things bother me about this,'' said Vikan, an expert on
Byzantine art. ``That wonderful art that I became very attached to
and had the notion that I could bring to the United States now
won't be coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, second, Georgia is a wonderful place and this was an
opportunity for them to become part of the Western world _ that's
what's lost against all their concerns about conservation and
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Death by politics is rare but not unprecedented for museum
exhibitions. In 1993, New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art called
off ``The Art of Medieval Spain'' when a newly elected Spanish
government threw up bureaucratic hurdles two weeks before the
show's opening that would have delayed the arrival of many works in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   More frequently, politics affects what is lent. In 1996,
demonstrators in Taipei citing concern about the national patrimony
derailed the shipment of 23 important objects from Taiwan for the
Met's ``Splendors of Imperial China'' show. And the Met had
difficulty borrowing works from Georgia for its 1997 ``Glory of
Byzantium'' exhibition, though it eventually got five items.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Shevardnadze and Culture Minister Valeri Asataini
invited the Foundation for International Arts and Education to
organize a big Georgian show. Aside from introducing Americans to
Georgian art, it was intended to raise the republic's profile in
the West and to encourage foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were assured there would be no problems,'' said Gregory
Guroff, a former U.S. diplomat and president of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   On April 24, Shevardnadze proudly announced the show while he
was in Washington attending a NATO summit meeting. But a day later,
political opponents denounced him in Parliament for lending
Georgia's treasures. The protests soon sprouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious battle between political factions in the
country with the show as a symbol,'' said Guroff, who served at the
U.S. Embassy in Moscow in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to avert disaster, Guroff and Vikan traveled to Tbilisi,
met several times with the prime minister and minister of foreign
affairs, gave interviews to Georgia's press, debated the
exhibition's opponents on television, and appeared on talk shows,
taking questions from television viewers. The U.S. Embassy in
Tbilisi also threw its weight behind the exhibition, meeting with
Georgian officials and holding a press briefing in June.
</P>
<P>
   But dissenters won out by raising the issue with the patriarch
of the Georgian Orthodox Church, Ilia II. He sided with them,
saying that the items would lose their holiness if they left
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   A last-ditch salvage effort by the Georgian ambassador to the
United States, Tedo Japaridze, who flew to Tbilisi last Friday,
also failed.
</P>
<P>
   Guroff said he believed that Shevardnadze had decided he could
not risk the seats of parliamentary allies who had nothing to do
with the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has also touched an unrelated exhibition, ``Eastern
Christian Art Since Constantinople,'' in Trieste, Italy. A few
dozen Georgian objects, all packed and ready for shipment, were
held at the airport in Georgia last weekend, even though the
protesters had not opposed that loan, Guroff said.
</P>
<P>
   The Walters, meanwhile, has been scrambling to fill the hole in
its exhibition calendar. It is organizing ``Vive la France:
Masterpieces of French Art in the Walters Collection,'' a survey of
1,500 years of works including medieval metalwork, Lalique jewelry
and paintings by Ingres and Manet.
</P>
<P>
   Guroff said he was ``hopeful that some resolution will be
found,'' perhaps a rescheduling of the Georgian exhibition after
elections. The museums in San Diego and Houston, he said, could
probably still mount the show. But at the moment just one element
is complete: the catalog is at the printer in London.

`THE GAMBLER': HIGH ROLLER HOOKED ON RUSSIAN ROULETTE, LITERARY
STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Casino gambling obviously isn't as glamorous a pastime today as
it was in the late 19th century, when magnificently dressed,
jeweled aristocrats surged through Europe's grand hotels
squandering untold fortunes at roulette. At least that's the way
the Hungarian director Karoly Makk's entertaining film ``The
Gambler'' imagines those glitzy old days. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; As the elegant players succumb to the rush of gambling fever as
to a drug, their eyes glaze over, and they are consumed by lust for
just one more chance to win or lose a gleaming mountain of gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gambler,'' which opens Wedneday in New York, adds a
literary gloss to this dangerous fun by focusing on the gambling
compulsion of 45-year-old Fyodor Dostoyevksy (Michael Gambon).
Based on events in the Russian novelist's life, it portrays the
author as a bearish, flaming creature whose addiction leaves him
periodically bankrupt and desperate for funds.
</P>
<P>
   Rescued by his greedy publisher, Stellovsky (Tom Jansen), who
has paid off his debts before, the author has signed an agreement
to deliver a new novel in 27 days. Should he fail to meet that
deadline, Stellovsky will gain the rights to publish all his future
work without further payment.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Anna Snitkina (Jodhi May), a pale, owl-eyed 20-year-old
stenographer whom Dostoyevsky, in a desperate last-ditch effort to
meet the deadline, has hired to take dictation. Anna, who is being
courted by a straitlaced government bureaucrat, is herself
desperate for money to pay for the funeral of her dying father.
</P>
<P>
   After some testy skirmishes, the author and stenographer set to
work, with Dostoyevsky dictating ``The Gambler,'' the
semiautobiographical novel about his gambling addiction and
tumultuous love life. Their race against time is interrupted by
several crises, the most serious being an epileptic seizure that
leaves Dostoyevsky bedridden and drained of energy.
</P>
<P>
   As Dostoyevksy dictates the novel, the movie cross-cuts between
fictional scenes from the work in progress and episodes from
Dostoyevsky's and Anna's real lives. The author's fictional alter
ego, Aleksei (Dominic West), is the handsome young tutor to the
children of a weak-willed general who, goaded by Mme. Blanche
(Angeline Ball), a treacherous French courtesan, has squandered his
fortune at the gaming tables and indebted himself to her scheming
partner, De Grieux (Johan Leysen), a bogus French aristocrat.
</P>
<P>
   De Grieux in turn has seduced the general's beautiful
stepdaughter, Polina (Polly Walker), who also owes him a small
fortune in gambling debts.
</P>
<P>
   When Polina begs Aleksei, who is madly in love with her, to try
to win back her losses, he too becomes an instant roulette addict.
The drama intensifies with the arrival of the wealthy family
matriarch (Luise Rainer), who herself becomes a slave to the
gambling tables in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Making her first screen appearance in 55 years, Ms. Rainer (who
won two successive Academy Awards in the 1930s, for ``The Great
Ziegfeld'' and ``The Good Earth'') has the magnetic presence of an
ancient grande dame with an elfin sense of mischief.
</P>
<P>
   This story within a story is too compressed and played too
exaggeratedly (in almost a parody of ``Masterpiece Theater''
historical romances) to evoke a complex social web. The movie dips
into psychobiography just long enough to suggest that Dostoyevsky's
addiction is a self-flagellating spur to his own creativity. It
takes an intriguing turn when the real Polina appears and demands
that Dostoyevsky forget his responsibilities and run off with her
to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, ``The Gambler'' reminds us of the sheer power of
storytelling. Anna quickly becomes so enthralled by her employer's
characters that they begin to invade her dreams, and she finds
herself falling in love with the man who has enflamed her
imagination. Yet ``The Gambler'' never follows through on its
promise to wind fiction and truth into a sophisticated literary
game. The movie is best appreciated as a traditional romantic yarn
lavishly embellished with period finery. &QL;

ISLAND OF FORBIDDEN FRUIT

   HAVANA _ In an airport lounge in the Bahamas, waiting for my
flight to Havana, I got my first glimpse of what it means to travel
to Cuba today. His name was Buddy, he looked to be about 60, and he
sported a belly that was decades in the making and an expectant
gleam in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, he felt certain, he would find not only savory cigars
but also sexy, cash-strapped young women eager to make his
acquaintance. That was what had drawn his father from South Florida
to the island in the 1940s and 1950s, when it was a permissive
playground for sybaritic Americans, and that was what friends of
Buddy's who had traveled to Cuba in the last year or two had
discovered, too.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy laughed. ``I was just thinking,'' he said, ``I could end
up with the granddaughter of one of the women my father knew.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, ambling through Havana's Museo de la Revolucion, I
got another, different view.
</P>
<P>
   The brash exhibits inside the grand building, which had served
as a gilded presidential lair before Fidel Castro put an end to
such ostentation in 1959, touted Cuba's liberation from European
and American imperialism, from the callous dictates of capitalism
and from a meek history of pliant servitude to outsiders' dreams.
</P>
<P>
   I stood before life-sized caricatures of George Bush and Ronald
Reagan in a hallway dubbed El Rincon de los Cretinos, or Cretins'
Corner. The painted wooden effigy of Reagan depicted him in a
Western sheriff's outfit, and the slogan beneath it mocked the
manner in which he, like other American presidents, had cast
Castro's Cuba as a mortal enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, cretin,'' it said in both Spanish and English,
``for helping us to strengthen the Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   I read it with an amalgam of amusement, guilt and dismay, then
walked out onto streets that seemed at once to beckon and provoke
me, that unveiled stately pleasure domes from a bygone era and bold
billboards of propaganda from the uprising that erased it, that did
battle with _ and denounced _ the country's pre-revolutionary past
even as Cuba's leaders sought, with luxury hotels and an expanding
infrastructure for tourism, to resurrect it in some fashion.
</P>
<P>
   To the rising number of American travelers who flock to what is
still largely a forbidden destination, Cuba presents itself as a
tropical storm of such contradictions, and it reminds Americans, at
every turn, of their country's tortured relationship to this
island, so near and yet so far.
</P>
<P>
   It held me in a kind of thrall that no other foreign country
has. I was elated by the beauty of the 18th- and 19th-century
architecture in Havana, where the Gran Teatro and other neo-baroque
buildings around Parque Central are more evocative of Barcelona
than any Caribbean outpost, but aghast at their peeling paint and
crumbling edges, a decrepitude due in part to America's
longstanding economic embargo of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   I was startled by the rapid, ongoing development of Varadero, a
lovely strand of beach just two hours by car east of Havana, and by
the Acapulco-like phalanx of gargantuan luxury hotels along
Varadero's shore. But I was troubled by the degree to which this
resort was off-limits to Cubans, who are held back by checkpoints
on the road, lest they be tempted to hustle wealthy Europeans and
North Americans and be corrupted by these outsiders' materially
profligate ways.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's leaders, it turns out, are deeply conflicted about their
embrace of tourism, which is both an economic necessity and a
social danger. Tourism brings Cuba money that is desperately
needed, especially in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union
and its formidable economic assistance, but it has other, less
desired effects.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, an immediately evident black market of
enterprising Cubans who offer to arrange for foreign tourists to
stay in private houses where they can entertain Cuban guests, an
option unavailable at most hotels, which post sentries at the
elevators to make sure such interactions do not take place. There
is also a network of paladares, or makeshift restaurants in private
apartments, and the smallest and most authentic of these are run
illegally, without any notice to the Cuban government or
advertisements on their doors. They are found only with the
assistance of the self-styled ``tour guides'' who roam Havana's
sun-baked sidewalks, whispering cautiously to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   When I was in Havana, in early July, the Cuban authorities were
trying to crack down on all of this, and the Cubans whom I met on
the street and allowed to bring me to paladares and out-of-the-way
nightclubs were repeatedly stopped and grilled by the vigilant
police officers who seemed to be stationed on just about every
corner. Although my new Cuban friends were allowed to continue on
their way after assuring the officers that they were not conducting
any kind of shady business with me, these experiences deepened the
occasionally unsettling and always adventurous feeling of being
somewhere that American tourists are expressly discouraged from
going by their own government.
</P>
<P>
   Americans can get dispensation to visit Cuba for educational,
religious or humanitarian purposes, and can thereby board charters
to Cuba from the United States. But it is otherwise illegal for
Americans to spend dollars on travel to or within Cuba, a stricture
that effectively bans such tourism and renders direct flights from
the United States off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   That does not stop tens of thousands of Americans every year
from reaching Cuba through layovers in the Bahamas or Mexico, where
they pay for their trips in cash so that there is no record of
their whereabouts. The Cuban authorities, eager for the dollars
that Americans bring, facilitate this strategy by not stamping
American passports.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy, nervous nonetheless, had hatched an additional ploy.
</P>
<P>
   In his suitcase were boxes of adhesive bandages and tubes of
antibacterial cream, which he planned to take to a Red Cross office
in Havana. He would have someone there snap a picture of him making
this donation, so that if American authorities ever learned of his
trip, he could claim that he had gone to Cuba to do good medical
deeds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In truth, only a tiny fraction of Americans who travel illegally
to Cuba are ever caught, or punished, by the government. Even so,
going to Cuba feels like taking a dare, and I was convinced by my
conversations with American tourists there that no matter what they
said had attracted them _ sex or sun or simply an up-close
encounter with one of the dwindling bastions of Communism in the
world _ they had really come because it felt naughty and bold.
</P>
<P>
   As for Cuba's Communism, it imbued the process of making flight,
hotel and rental-car arrangements with an occasionally maddening
vagueness and inefficiency. I quickly learned that workers
guaranteed of their jobs and bereft of financial incentives tend
not to be exemplars of customer service.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuba's Communism also means that Cubans are, at a basic
level, better cared for than the residents of many other Caribbean
islands; there is little outright begging on the streets, and when
Cubans smile, they usually do so with all of their teeth. They are
well educated, and delighted to engage Americans in candid
political discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Some Cubans, resentful of the luxuries available only to
tourists, told me bluntly that they could not wait for Castro to
die. Others praised him as a brave leader who had created a
triumphantly humane system. All were kind and warm.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana, I spent two nights at the Ambos Mundos, which was
once a favorite haunt of Ernest Hemingway's, and one night in the
famous Hotel Nacional, a former haven for gangsters and movie
stars, built in the 1920s, that towers over the Malecon, Havana's
scruffy oceanfront promenade. Although the Nacional has elaborate
grounds and infinite amenities, it feels relatively isolated, and
my room there was a cramped, dingy cell. I much preferred the
cozier ambiance of the Ambos Mundos, where the lobby has a series
of tall French doors that open to the lively streets of Old Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The entire city is terrific for walking. The high price of cars
and paucity of gasoline mean that traffic is light, and the city
contains a profusion of different architectural styles _ Spanish
colonial, baroque, neo-baroque, modern _ from the 18th, 19th and
20th centuries. Old Havana, with its narrow streets and artists'
galleries and salsa bands in small cafes, has the aura of a less
kitschy New Orleans French Quarter, and is a living museum to the
city's colonial origins. It also has several lively squares, like
the Plaza de la Catedral, in front of the 18th-century Catedral de
La Habana, and the Plaza de Armas, teeming with street vendors.
</P>
<P>
   For a wholly different take on the city, there is the Plaza de
la Revolucion, in central Havana, where a slim monolith similar to
the Washington Monument serves as a memorial to Jose Marti and a
black metal stencil of Che Guevara's face dominates the facade of a
grim contemporary building containing the offices of the Minister
of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
   I found Havana's restaurants unremarkable, although the view
from one that I visited, la Divina Pastora, was gorgeous. So I took
the chance of letting Jorge, a young man I met on the street, take
me to an illegal paladar in a poor residential neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   We walked up a narrow, unlighted flight of stone steps and
around the edge of an air shaft strung with laundry to enter a
Spartan apartment where, for $15 apiece, the two of us sat alone
and ate generous, delicious helpings of pork, rice, beans and fried
plantains, washed down by beer and followed by some of the
sweetest, ripest mangoes I have ever tasted. (I paid for Jorge's
meal, a gesture that seemed unavoidable and illustrated the hidden
cost of paladares.)
</P>
<P>
   The cook, who had surrendered a meager salary of pesos at a
seaside resort in order to court the mightier American dollar (the
unofficial tourist currency in Cuba), prepared much of the food
over an open flame on a crumbling terrace; Santeria icons festooned
the walls around the dining room table.
</P>
<P>
   There are many cabarets and discotheques in Havana's hotels, but
I naively asked Jorge to take me to some place he and his friends
would really go. We ended up in an unnamed club in Havana's
Chinatown where three black Cubans performed a deafening
Spanish-language rap with a chorus that sampled the melody of
``London Bridge Is Falling Down.''
</P>
<P>
   On another night, Jorge and his friend Juan insisted I accompany
them to Johnny's, also known as Club Rio, a raucous dance spot in
the suburb of Miramar that was, for young Cubans, the place of the
moment. Provocatively dressed women gyrated ecstatically to songs
from the Backstreet Boys and Ricky Martin, taking breaks to thrust
themselves against me in an aggressive manner that had nothing to
do with my body and everything to do with my billfold.
</P>
<P>
   Varadero, my next stop, was less exciting than the drive there,
which I ventured tremulously in an old, sputtering Subaru _ no
bigger than a golf cart, with similar acceleration and shock
absorption _ that a rental agent insisted was the best he could
offer me for $40 a day. My beachfront hotel, the Melia Varadero,
had everything from a pool the size of a reservoir to a karaoke
bar. But I could have been anywhere in the Caribbean, and I wanted
to be in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   So I returned to it, heading west, back through Havana, and down
the highway for another two hours until I reached the turnoff to
the picturesque town of Vinales. All around it rise astonishing
geographical formations, called mogotes, that jut suddenly, steeply
and briefly from a lush valley floor, like the humps on the back of
a camel. They are best seen from the Hotel Los Jazmines, where a
comfortable room with a spacious balcony cost me less than $40 for
the night.
</P>
<P>
   I took a jaunt, on foot and in a small motorboat, through La
Cueva del Indio, an eerie limestone cavern inside one of the
mogotes. Then, with two new Cuban friends whom I had asked for
directions and ended up accepting into my car (although I don't
recommend giving rides to strangers), I visited nearby Puerto
Esperanza, a sleepy coastal village, and treated each of us to a $9
lobster dinner at a legal paladar, the Villa Sol.
</P>
<P>
   In the backyard stood two noisy pigs, the larger one scheduled
for consumption by the proprietor and his family this Christmas,
the smaller one in line for the next. The proprietor, his brother
and his son-in-law alternately sat down beside me to riddle me
politely with questions: about my life in America, my reactions to
Cuba and, above all, the reasons our two countries regarded each
other so warily, when they were so inextricably entwined.
</P>
<P>
   I had just as much that I wanted to ask them, and as the sun set
and an evening breeze tickled the palms and the pigs squealed, I
realized that despite our countries' turbulent past, tense present
and uncertain future, there was really no keeping us apart.

`THE IRON GIANT': ATTACK OF THE HUMAN PARANOIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adults, more than children, are likely to find stimulation,
provocation and controversy in ``The Iron Giant,'' the polished new
animated film from Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Based loosely on a children's fable written in 1968 by Ted
Hughes (1930-1998), the British poet laureate, ``The Iron Giant''
looks at the fearful years of the Cold War through the politically
correct lens of the 1990s, while turning upside down all those
metaphorical sci-fi movies of the '50s in which some little town
became the locus of a menace from outer space, and a few soldiers
and government agents combined smarts, science and good-old
American guts to save democracy and humanity.
</P>
<P>
   What ``The Iron Giant'' discerns so boldly and disapprovingly,
now that the Soviet Union is no longer the mammoth red menace of
the 1950s, are the era's disinclination to countenance
nonconformity, its itchy military trigger fingers, its terrifying
dependence on military hardware (particularly nuclear weaponry),
and its government agents, whose combination of personal ambition,
evil and extreme paranoia could subject Americans to mass
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, all of this, to various degrees, was discernible in
the 1950s. What this film possesses, to an extent that may prompt
applause from those eager to draw attention to the current
cultivation of their politics, is a willingness to run counter to
the perceived wisdom of more than 40 years ago. The truly
courageous took their stand then and there and often took the
ruinous consequences.
</P>
<P>
   All this re-examination of the atmosphere of the post-Sputnik
era is wrapped up in the story of a bright (and therefore
unpopular) little boy who befriends a 50-foot-tall iron robot from
who knows where that plunges into the sea one stormy night in 1957
and comes ashore in the woods outside Rockwell, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Hogarth Hughes, the adventurous child of a hard-working single
mom (Dad's absence is never explained), saves the giant when it
becomes entangled in high-tension wires while dining on an
electrical tower, and the big lug becomes his secret playmate.
</P>
<P>
   But the townspeople are already in a dither about odd goings-on
in the environs _ especially cars and tractors with huge chunks
bitten out of them _ and it is not long before a government agent
arrives to find out what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Clues lead him to Hogarth's home, and the investigation prompts
the boy, with the voice of 12-year-old Elie Marienthal, to hide the
metal-munching Iron Giant in the junkyard of the cool local beatnik
and artist, Dean (Harry Connick Jr.). Meanwhile, the nasty
government agent, Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald), is closing
in on his quarry, leading to a showdown that brings an Army convoy,
tanks and jets rumbling and roaring into Rockwell and causes the
nuclear submarine Nautilus to launch its primary weapon in an
effort to demolish the peacefully inclined but alien Iron Giant.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Hogarth, whose school shows its pupils films
showing them how to cover and duck if atomic bombs drop, has taught
his hulking pal that its role model should be Superman and that
killing is bad. The boy has also discovered that when faced with
weapons, even a child's toy gun, the Iron Giant turns out to be an
enormously destructive defensive system that can fly.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Brad Bird, ``The Iron Giant'' is a smooth, skilled
example of animated filmmaking. Its historical background is
unlikely to resonate with youngsters, but boys in particular seem
likely to respond to its story of a hulking robot willing to take
instruction from a child. Many adults, including parents eager to
have their children absorb lessons about the perils of guns and the
merits of peace and tolerance, will doubtless approve of the film's
messages while they ponder how the passing years have smoothed the
jagged edges of history.
</P>
<P>

count how many viewers the material gets. (Kaneel, Atlanta

<HEADLINE>
MARTINEZ ADDS HEALTHY DOSE OF CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He was converted in five seconds. One moment, Pedro
Martinez was being interviewed about his return to the rotation. A
few seconds later, he was grabbing a microphone and conducting the
interview himself. As this unusual reversal occurred, it was clear
that the Red Sox missed a lot more than Martinez's pitching in the
last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And you missed him, too. Trust me. It is hard enough for teams
to find pitchers who know how to challenge you with their pitches
(see Rapp, Pat and Guthrie, Mark _ Aug. 2, 1999). But Martinez
takes it further. He even challenges you with the way he talks
about pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the Indians a tough team to come back against?'' an
interviewer asked Martinez before the Tribe's 7-5 win over the Sox
Monday night at Fenway Park. The pitcher who had been bothered with
a sore right shoulder paused. He looked at the mike in his face and
suddenly took it. He was smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You answer that question yourself,'' Martinez said to the
journalist. ``Answer it. Come on. What do you think about the
Indians against me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got an awesome attack,'' the questioner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome attack?'' Martinez said. ``From whom?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramirez, Alomar, Kenny Lofton . . .''
</P>
<P>
   By this point, Martinez was amused. He was not about to say what
everyone else says about the Indians; he was not here to rave about
their power and scoring potential. Maybe Rapp, who would eventually
give up five runs in the first inning, would speak cautiously about
the Indians. Maybe Guthrie would, too. The lefthanded reliever
referred to his work against David Justice as ``(expletive)
horrible'' after giving up a 409-foot, two-run homer in the ninth.
Guthrie invited everyone to check thesauruses for adjectives to
describe him. If not, he said, ``You'll see it all night long on
`SportsCenter' and all that other crap, and read all about how
(expletive) horrible I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about those words for a while. Now, tell me, don't you
miss Martinez? He doesn't have to talk like that because he usually
doesn't pitch like that. Guthrie's locker is close to Martinez's.
Instead of cussing himself out so much, Guthrie needs to sit a bit
closer to his confident neighbor and get all the pitching advice he
can.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``Were they there the last two games I pitched against
them?''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was talking about the Indians again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were they? Were the same guys you just mentioned on that team
then?'' he asked. ``What happened?''
</P>
<P>
   He was told the Indians didn't do much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa-ho,'' he said, excitedly dancing around the clubhouse.
``Great answer. You got it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of animation the Sox missed for a while with
Martinez disabled. He said he was in a bad mood most of the time
when he was injured. Not anymore. The King is back against the
Indians' Jaret Wright. He didn't predict a win, but he didn't claim
to be worried about anything, either. The Sox need this. Pitching
is hard, but Martinez makes it sound easy. Making the playoffs is
hard, but Martinez makes you believe that the Sox are in if they
stay healthy. Not only do the Sox need to see him, they need to
hear him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only bad thing that can happen to me (on a mound) is that
I die,'' he said. ``And if I die, I'm supposed to die that day,
because it's meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   There also could be a game like the one July 18, when the
comical Florida Marlins pounded Martinez in the worst start of his
career. He gave up seven earned runs in 3 2/3 innings. He looked so
bad that the Sox figured something had to be wrong with his arm. It
turned out to be nothing more than inflammation in his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was in the mood to talk about anything asked of him,
the Indians included. He said whenever he got grouchy, he decided
to run rather than taking it out on somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to run on some nice paths,'' he said. ``But I had to
stop doing that because people stop you and ask for autographs. It
gets crazy like that sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   He also talked about pitching inside and how hard it is for
pitchers to shake the label of ``headhunter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to win a Cy Young and have a 1.90 ERA'' before people
stopped referring to him as a hunter, Martinez said. He added:
``And I still hear people whining about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same has been said of the Indians' Wright, whose wild pitch
at Darren Lewis's head led to a brawl between the teams April 24.
Hargrove said he is sure the pitch was not intentional (``It was a
breaking pitch'') and that young Wright has not developed as
quickly as the Indians would have liked. Combine power, the desire
to pitch inside, and a lack of mastery, and you will get high
pitches that anger batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my last start, I hit (Florida's) Danny Bautista in the
head,'' Martinez said, ``and I was trying to throw an inside
fastball. For a strike. I didn't want the pitch to be high.'' His
point: Good pitchers can lose control when they try to throw
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Rapp went five innings and never had control.
Guthrie went two-thirds of an inning and, as his robust ERA (6.57)
attests, he had more problems controlling the ball he was throwing.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez cautioned that he might not have his best stuff Tuesday
night. It doesn't matter. Even on the July night he pitched the
worst game of his life, Martinez's team still won.

FAA SAYS IT WILL LIMIT AIRLINE PILOT WORK DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal Aviation Administration officials told
Congress Tuesday they are moving to cut the working hours that
commercial airline pilots will be allowed to work.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Gilligan, FAA's deputy associate administrator for
regulation and certification, told the House Transportation
Committee's aviation panel that the FAA wants to limit pilots to
14-hour work days while continuing to limit actual flight time to
eight hours within that 14-hour day.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA also wants to require 10-hour rest periods between work
days, compared to the current requirement of eight hours of rest
between work days.
</P>
<P>
   Current rules don't put a ceiling on the number of work hours.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of pilot fatigue was put in the spotlight in June when
an American Airlines plane crashed in Little Rock, Ark., killing 12
people. The plane's pilots had been on duty for slightly more than
13 hours and had flown slightly less than eight hours on the day of
the accident, according to Vernon Ellingstad, director of research
and engineering for the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB is investigating whether fatigue and other factors like
bad weather caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Days like the ones experienced by the American Airlines pilots
are common and within existing FAA rules, said Duane Woerth,
president of the Air Line Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
   He said in one case a pilot was scheduled to report to work at
7:10 a.m. and end work at 9:15 p.m. _ a 14 hour day. However, the
pilot's actual work day stretched to 16 hours because of weather
and other delays. During the day he made 12 landings at various
airports.
</P>
<P>
   After working 16 hours, the pilot had only an eight-hour
interval until he was due to report back to the airport at 7:10
a.m. In that time the pilot had to travel to a hotel from the
airport, eat and sleep and come back to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter the pilot's sleep opportunity was six
hours,'' Woerth said.
</P>
<P>
   Woerth said he supports the FAA's 10-hour rest rule but thinks
the work day should be limited to 12 hours, which could be extended
to 14 hours for circumstances beyond the airlines' control such as
weather delays.
</P>
<P>
   He said the 12-hour limit is based on a recent NASA study
showing that pilot fatigue ``significantly increased'' after 12
hours on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's major airlines oppose the proposed FAA regulations
and point out that fatigue has never been found to have caused a
commercial airline accident.
</P>
<P>
   John Meenan, senior vice president of industry policy for the
Air Transport Association of America _ which represents major
airlines _ said the proposed rules would force airlines to hire
additional pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could all too easily disrupt the very effective system we
have in place and by forcing the too rapid hiring of thousands of
new pilots, produce an unseasoned workforce and the unintended
consequences that could go with such a development,'' Meenan said.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers did not buy the airline industry's arguments
against the FAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fatigue doesn't show up in an autopsy,'' said Rep. James
Oberstar, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the NTSB agreed that fatigue has not been listed
as a cause of a commercial airline crash, Ellingstad said it has
likely been a factor in some crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Ellingstad urged the FAA to quickly adopt the new rules and
noted that they have languished since first being proposed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this hearing will be the spring board for getting the
new rules in place,'' said Rep. William Lipinski, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Because virtually no one supported the rules when they were
first proposed, Gilligan said the FAA convened a working group of
airline industry and pilots representatives to see if a consensus
could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the first to agree that this effort has taken too long,''
Gilligan said.
</P>
<P>
   She explained that the major airlines were upset with the
14-hour work day limit and that the pilots opposed a proposal that
would have extended actual flying time from eight hours to 10 hours
daily.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the breakdown in negotiations earlier this year,
Gilligan said the FAA is moving forward with rules requiring a
longer rest period between work days as well as limiting the work
day itself.

`DICK': THAT GAP IN THE NIXON TAPES? MAYBE A TEEN-AGE CRY OF LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN

<P>
   Not to get too solemn about it, but ``Dick,'' an uproariously
dizzy satire that reduces the Watergate scandal into a goofy Nancy
Drew caper for starry-eyed teeny-boppers, would probably not have
been made had Monica Lewinsky never slunk into the Oval Office. Who
was it who observed that history repeats itself as farce?
</P>
<P>
   In this frothy ``Saturday Night Live''-style fantasy of Richard
Nixon's downfall, the agents of his destruction are revealed to
have been two giggly 15-year-old girls _ baby Monicas, if you will
_ who have a knack for being in the right place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to ``Dick,'' at last we know the identity of Deep Throat,
the confidential source who gave Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein
the inside scoop on Nixon's knowledge of the Watergate break-in and
involvement in the cover-up. Far from being a high-level government
official, the whistler-blowers who met the intrepid Washington Post
reporters in an underground parking garage turn out to have been
those fearless Monicas, Betsy Jobs (Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene
Lorenzo (Michelle Williams). As Maurice Chevalier so eloquently put
it, ``Thank heaven for little girls.''
</P>
<P>
   When we first encounter these squealing bundles of mischief in
Arlene's bedroom in the Watergate apartment complex, they are
breathlessly composing a love letter to Arlene's dream date, pop
star Bobby Sherman, on a fateful June night in 1972. Rushing to
meet the mail deadline for a ``Win a Date With Bobby Sherman''
contest in Tiger Beat magazine, the pair literally stumble into G.
Gordon Liddy (Harry Shearer) lurking in a stairwell. On a
subsequent school field trip to the White House, Arlene recognizes
Liddy in a corridor. He happens to have a piece of paper stuck to
his shoe, which she retrieves as a souvenir. It turns out to be a
secret list of donors for the Committee to Re-elect the President.
</P>
<P>
   During the same visit a chance encounter with the president's
dog, Checkers, results in an introduction to Nixon, who unctuously
appoints the girls his official dog walkers. Screwing up her
courage, Arlene presumes to lecture the president, announcing that
war isn't healthy for children and other living things. He seems to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly it's goodbye Bobby Sherman, hello Richard Nixon. Wildly
smitten with the president, Arlene begins keeping a diary in which
she confides her passion and plasters her bedroom walls with his
picture. One day while wandering around the White House, she and
Betsy stumble into an office where paper is being frantically
shredded and stacks of money counted. The president, on being
informed of their discovery, shrewdly bestows a lofty new title on
the girls: secret youth adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The movie goes so far as to suggest that the tasty Hello Dolly
cookies Arlene brings to the White House may actually have altered
the course of world history. Made with walnuts plucked from a jar
in which her brother secretes an unidentified green herb, they have
an instant effect on anyone who takes even a single bite. One
afternoon, during a summit meeting with Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev, Nixon passes around a fresh batch of Hello Dollys, and in
seconds everyone, even Brezhnev, is laughing and singing the show
tune that gives these munchies their name. The very next day, an
accord is announced.
</P>
<P>
   But all too soon, Arlene's dream of love is shattered. One day
she leaves a declaration of passion on the president's tape
recorder. Rewinding the machine and playing it back, she hears the
president spewing some nasty epithets and worse, being cruel to
Checkers. So much for true love. As the Watergate scandal breaks on
television, Arlene and Betsy begin putting the pieces together and
making phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick,'' directed by Andrew Fleming and featuring alumni from
``Saturday Night Live'' and ``Kids in the Hall,'' has the jovial
tone of an extended television sketch. As it rollicks along on a
soundtrack of early-1970s hits, it comes up with just enough funny
business to keep the movie from losing its fizz.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Dan Hedaya's hilariously twitchy Nixon, the physical
and vocal resemblances between the actors and famous people they
play are, at most, superficial. Woodward (Will Ferrell) and
Bernstein (Bruce McCulloch), in particular, are portrayed as a
ludicrous journalistic dog-and-pony show; one is puffed up and
stuffy, the other a pudgy, competitive little creep who tries to
steal his colleague's information.
</P>
<P>
   Pity poor Richard Nixon. Although he's not here to be kicked
around by the press anymore, he is still an irresistible lightning
rod for gleeful ridicule. In exaggerating Nixon's mannerisms,
Hedaya has created the year's funniest film caricature. With his
hunched shoulders, darting paranoid gaze and crocodile grimace,
Hedaya's Nixon is the quivering, skulking embodiment of a single
word: guilty.

<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ The musical seeds for the latest American
opera to bid for a place in the repertory are kept in a plastic tub
here, in the home of composer William Bolcom. It's a file cabinet
of sorts, a catch-basket for ideas that emerged over nearly four
years of writing.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Bolcom fished in the tub among myriad
scraps of paper and extracted one. On it were a few bars of notes
and the scribbled title ``Eddie's Pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie is the stevedore from Red Hook, Brooklyn, who is Arthur
Miller's anguished Everyman in the 1955 play ``A View From the
Bridge.'' Eddie Carbone's illicit passion for his niece moves him
to a cruel act of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Bolcom and his librettist, Arnold Weinstein, have just finished
adapting Miller's play, which had a successful Broadway revival a
year ago, for Lyric Opera of Chicago. A major work for 13 soloists,
a 48-member chorus and an orchestra of 75, the opera is directed by
Frank Galati and features Kim Josephson, Catherine Malfitano and
Timothy Nolen. It is to have its world premiere Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's Pride'' is the galvanizing element of Bolcom's score,
which is itself the central element of a a collaboration that also
brings together such high-profile artists as set and costume
designer Santo Loquasto, projection artist Wendall K. Harrington,
conductor Dennis Russell Davies and Miller himself, who contributed
an aria to the libretto. The $1.4 million production will have just
nine performances in four weeks to prove that the play has been
transmuted into an opera of equal stature.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that goal lies the more formidable aim of producing
the first American opera in decades with enough lift to win a place
in the canon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm showing my underwear,'' said Bolcom, settling
at the piano and playing the original scrawled idea for ``Eddie's
Pride,'' then the second, slightly altered version that found its
way to the final score. In both was a repeated chord figure,
bitonal and grating, rising and falling with a harsh beat; the
difference was a suggestion of a pop ballad's sentimental melody
beneath the chords of the second version.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a picture of Eddie's intransigence,'' Bolcom said.
``That's his sound, that clomping; he's sort of a stupid man. But
the right hand has almost a pop feeling, which I was interested in
because these are modern characters, guys off the street. It has a
tune, which gives you something to hang onto, but the harmony tells
you how screwed up he is.''
</P>
<P>
   As the production integrates Bolcom's ideas, time is growing
short. Before the premiere, the sets must be completed, the
technical and performance elements choreographed, the principals,
orchestra and chorus familiarized with a new score and some 4,000
more tickets sold.
</P>
<P>
   The activity comes at an important if paradoxical moment for the
opera world, a time when audiences are growing nationwide but new
American operas, even with lavish productions at the most
prestigious opera houses, continue to die on the vine. And Lyric,
the nation's third largest opera company (behind the Metropolitan
Opera in New York and the San Francisco Opera, which are also
involved in new American operas), provides the starkest
illustration. ``A View From the Bridge'' is the third and final
commission from the company's 10-year commitment to producing new
American work.
</P>
<P>
   Yet neither of the other two works _ Bolcom's ``McTeague,''
which opened in 1994, and ``Amistad'' by Anthony Davis, from 1997 _
has had a second production. Still, said Lyric general director
William Mason, ``the reason we do this, the objective, is that we
hope it will enter the repertory.''
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of the performing arts, opera may be the toughest
repertory to crack. Of the 10 most frequently produced operas last
season, none were composed after 1920 and none were American. It is
a state of affairs that threatens to turn opera companies into
museums of a sort, with more need for curators than composers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How relevant can an art form be to society if, in the 21st
century, it is living off 19th-century work?'' said Marc Scorca,
the executive director of Opera America, an administrative and
advocacy group for North American companies.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a recognizable American operatic repertory beyond,
say, Gershwin's ``Porgy and Bess'' and Virgil Thomson's ``Four
Saints in Three Acts'' is not for want of effort; in the last
decade there has been a free-flowing stream of world premieres.
</P>
<P>
   Among other new projects, Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown,
N.Y., just held a successful premiere of ``Central Park,'' a
triptych of new works; Houston Grand Opera is to stage Carlisle
Floyd's adaptation of the Olive Ann Burns novel ``Cold Sassy Tree''
next spring; the San Francisco Opera is developing ``Dead Man
Walking'' from Helen Prejean's book about her work as a spiritual
adviser to a death-row inmate, and the Met will hold a world
premiere of John Harbison's adaptation of ``The Great Gatsby.'' in
December.
</P>
<P>
   But that only accentuates the difficulties facing a work like
``A View From the Bridge.'' Unless it receives exuberant
admiration, it is unlikely to have a significant life beyond its
run in Chicago. Even if it does, longevity is unlikely. Of the 125
works that had their world premieres in the United States in the
1990s, only about a dozen have been produced again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A View From the Bridge'' follows Andre Previn's ``Streetcar
Named Desire'' in San Francisco last year and precedes ``Gatsby''
at the Met. Taken together, the works amount almost to a marketing
experiment. All are new works by American composers, all make use
of American musical influences, and perhaps most important, all are
adapted from important and familiar works of American literature.
It is a hopeful sign that San Diego Opera has already announced its
plan to stage ``Streetcar'' next spring, and there is talk between
the Met and Lyric that they will trade productions of ``View'' and
``Gatsby'' in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Arthur Miller said that unlike ``Death of a
Salesman,'' with its nuanced portrayal of a man's psychological
dissolution, ``View'' ``was always a very operatic play, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Opera needs very direct, fundamental passions, and the play
always had that by design,'' Miller said. ``I wrote it as a
modern-day replication of the Greek tragedies.'' Nonetheless, he
added, he does not assume that his story will draw people to the
opera. ``For me, it's been kind of a lark,'' he said. ``After all,
we go to the opera to hear the music.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bolcom, 61, who wrote music for an onstage cellist in Miller's
play ``Broken Glass,'' would seem particularly suited to creating a
popular American opera. A Pulitzer Prize winner for a solo piano
composition in 1988 and chairman of the composition department at
the University of Michigan, he is known for his versatility, having
composed in forms ranging from symphonies to piano rags. He has
written musical revues and cabaret songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This opera, it's Puccini, but it's also Harry Warren,'' Bolcom
said, referring to the composer of Italian-American melodies like
``That's Amore.'' ``It's the Americanization-of-the-Italian thing.
That's the basic neighborhood, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolcom also has a demonstrated sensitivity to the connection
between words and music, having interpreted the poems of Whitman,
Roethke and others; it was his treatment of Blake's ``Songs of
Innocence and Experience'' that prompted Lyric's previous general
director, Ardis Krainik, to commission ``McTeague.''
</P>
<P>
   Round and amiable, Bolcom is a talker with a tendency to
digress, often entertainingly. At the piano, playing ``Eddie's
Pride'' and the Harry Warren-esque duet between Catherine, Eddie's
niece, and Rodolpho, the immigrant who wins her heart to Eddie's
tragic dismay, Bolcom delighted himself with a free-associative
trip through the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``See? There are bits of 50's doo-wop in there,'' he said. ``I
can't sing it, I have to play it, because I can't remember how it
sounds. I don't work at the piano. Some people don't, some do. It's
about half and half. Stravinsky used to work at the keyboard but he
would mute it so it didn't sound like a piano. Ravel, I think,
always worked at the piano. I think Mozart never did; Haydn did,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the subject at hand, Bolcom said it made no
sense to make entering the repertory an objective. ``That's
probably the one way to assure it doesn't happen,'' he said, though
he added that he was going to reorchestrate the piece for fewer
musicians so that modest-size companies could present it.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of the play as the subject for the commission came
about somewhat serendipitously, after Bruno Bartoletti, Lyric's
former artistic director, and Weinstein, with whom Bolcom has
worked on many projects over nearly 40 years, both suggested it at
the same time. On a visit to Italy, Bartoletti had run across a
previous adaptation in Italian; Weinstein had run across an old
acquaintance, Miller, who encouraged a new adaptation.
</P>
<P>
   The words, the text, came first, Weinstein and Bolcom explained.
The music, they said, provided subtext: that is, in Bolcom's
explanation, that emotion and integrity of character that doesn't
need definition so much as reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opera is blood, guts, sinew; if that isn't in the material
somewhere, there's no point in making it into an opera,'' Bolcom
said. And in ``View,'' he added, each character speaks in a way
that suggested music.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine each character's voice, the way the voice
would move when he or she talked,'' he said. ``There's a musical
line that comes out of such a picture.'' Hence ``Eddie's Pride,''
for example.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Weinstein spoke about preparing the play for what
the music can add to it. ``I like to think of an opera libretto as
a way of finding out what should be pointed up, accented, driven,
hidden,'' he said, speaking from New York. (The two men sent their
work back and forth via fax; a downstairs neighbor of Weinstein,
who doesn't play the piano, would come up occasionally and render
the composer's work for the librettist.)
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, he cut drastically, created a chorus where
there had been none (Alfieri, the neighborhood lawyer who serves as
a narrator in the play, leads the chorus) and rewrote dialogue to
complement the musical poetics. After the first draft, he and
Bolcom continually traded ideas, editing and accommodating each
other. Even Miller's aria was tinkered with for musical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not just rendering it,'' Weinstein said. ``If that's
all you do, the playwright loses. He loses his nuances of language
and he doesn't have the fun of discovering anything new about the
piece. That was the fun of working with Miller. He didn't see the
point of doing the play set to music, like a long song cycle. I
said to him, `This play is strong enough to take a lot of kicking
around, and I think it wants the exercise.' I ran through the thing
like a mad dog, biting it up and then sticking in the mouthfuls
where they would make an aria.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' he continued, ``is redistribution, winnowing some
scenes, filling out others, so that one scene in the opera contains
the elements of many scenes in the play.''
</P>
<P>
   The most striking change from the play is in the character of
Marco, the Italian immigrant who finally causes Eddie's demise. In
the play he is mostly a quiet presence; in the opera he has a major
aria, a lament for the immigrant's powerlessness and frustration.
Bolcom initiated the aria and Miller wrote it: ``To America I
sailed on a ship called Hunger,'' it begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we needed to hear from Marco, an explanation about
how he got into this whole thing,'' Bolcom said. ``Plus, if you're
going to have a good singer do Marco, you better have something for
him to do other than eventually knife the guy at the end.'' (Marco
will be sung in Chicago by the bass baritone Mark McCrory.)
</P>
<P>
   Bolcom played a few bars, enough to show off a heart-rending
melodic line. ``Can you imagine that Arthur wrote this whole aria
for this character for me?'' he said. ``After 40 years of this play
being on the boards, he was flexible enough to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Good karma, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``What always manages to astound me is that all this work goes
into something, and they're going to play it half a dozen or a
dozen times and that's it,'' Miller said. It's an astounding
devotion these people have for it. I just hope it goes to a 13th
performance.''

 &HT;    ENVIRONMENTALISTS SUE OVER BLACK BEAR PROTECTION
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three environmental organizations and five Florida
residents filed suit in federal court here Tuesday to force the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to protect the Florida black bear
under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   The suit asks that the agency be required to return the bear,
now thought to number fewer than 2,000, to the endangered species
``candidate list,'' from which it was removed last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientists and wildlife officials have repeatedly provided
overwhelming evidence of the need to protect the Florida black
bear,'' said Roger Schlickeisen, president of Defenders of
Wildlife, one of the plaintiffs in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Other plaintiffs are the Fund for Animals, the Sierra Club and
five Floridians: Laurie MacDonald of St. Petersburg, Christine
Small of Sorrento, Martha Clutter of Inverness, Ingeborg Hutchison
of Lake Geneva and Randy Cullom of Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service found in a 1991 report that the
bear's protection was ``warranted but precluded'' by other, more
pressing wildlife protection needs.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the agency removed the bear from the list of
``candidate species,'' declaring that sufficient space existed on
federal lands to provide it with habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is yet another example of the Fish and Wildlife Service's
policy of avoiding controversial listings under the act,''
Schlickeisen said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Glitzenstein, the Washington lawyer who represents
plaintiffs in the suit, said a formal listing would force the
agency to review private land development plans that could impinge
on the animal's welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all kinds of private habitat plans that can allow
development to go forward in spite of the presence of endangered or
threatened species,'' Glitzenstein said. ``I don't see that that
couldn't happen for the bear. They are under severe pressures not
to list species where there is a perception this would involve some
kind of use restriction on private property.''
</P>
<P>
   Glitzenstein earlier this year represented a group of biologists
and environmentalists in a suit that temporarily brought a halt to
Corps of Engineers beach nourishing operations in St. Lucie County.
That suit, filed over allegations that the dredges might threaten
an obscure, sponge-like sea creature called ``bryozoan,'' was
settled after a few days.

LOOKING FOR AMERICA, BUT NOT EMULATING IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday, Aug. 10.)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two young South Africans came here in search of America but not
to become Americanized. Dimpho Siphoro and her brother Teboho
didn't make it to Disneyland or a baseball game this summer, but
they did spend time with death row inmates and talked to an
environmentalist camped in a tree.
</P>
<P>
   The two, visiting the Bay Area from Soweto Township, didn't need
to come here for a month to learn about Americana. They say they
get enough about Nike shoes, rap music and ``Days of Our Lives'' on
South African television. In fact, that's a big complaint of
theirs, that their society makes out America _ at least the media
version of America _ to be the standard for their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``As if our own things are inferior because they are not
American,'' a frustrated Dimpho says.
</P>
<P>
   The brother and sister, ages 20 and 21, came to observe how
America tries to fix some of its problems, and the Northern
California activists who were their hosts gave them a rare and
intense learning vacation, scheduling meetings with experts on
everything from at-risk teens to homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   At San Quentin Prison they made an unlikely connection that
shows how two seemingly different worlds, 11,000 miles apart, can
learn from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Charla Green, a prison reform activist from Rohnert Park,
Calif., made arrangements for the two to meet Dennis Brewer, a
Pasadena man on death row. An African-American, he'd long wanted to
visit Africa and Charla thought that second best was to have Africa
visit him. Through Brewer the two South Africans met Stanley
``Tookie'' Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Also on death row, Williams is the co-founder of the Crips gang.
He went to prison for killing two people and wrote a book ``Life in
Prison,'' aimed at deterring young people from following his
example. He says there's a misconception among gang members that
prison is a proving ground for manhood, a kind of gladiator
workshop. His contrary and grim account of life at San Quentin
tells about loss of privacy, strip searches and homesickness.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, in turn, introduced Dimpho and Teboho to his
co-author, Barbara Becnel of Richmond, Calif., a youth advocate who
is starting up an Internet project linking troubled young people in
the Bay Area with their counterparts in South Africa, to discuss
things like juvenile justice and the temptation to join gangs.
Barbara knows of a South African gang whose members call themselves
``the Americans.'' Dimpho and Teboho go back home as her Soweto
outreach workers.
</P>
<P>
   The South Africans chatted, by cell phone, with Julia Butterfly,
the famous redwood tree sitter in Humboldt County. They said they
recognized the giant California trees from their grandmother's
National Geographic magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Teboho was impressed that 23-year-old Julia, who's chosen her
unique way to protest the clear-cutting of the ancient redwoods in
the Headwaters Forest, ``is sacrificing for something that cannot
speak for itself. Most people her age would rather be doing music
or going to discos.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an interesting time to be studying America.
Coincidentally, only days after the two were interviewed on
Berkeley public radio KPFA, the station's owner put a lock on the
door and angry listeners began a protest that turned into a
nationally reported free speech cause.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy Jr. died. Trying to be as respectful as possible,
Dimpho said, ``We understand that his father passed away also in a
sad way, but why make so much of one person's death? People are
dying every day. Nobody's death is sadder than another's.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a lot to take in, but Dimpho said their intention was
``not to come here and go back and try to be like America.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, they worry that much of their society thinks that to
advance it is necessary to copycat America. They believe it is up
to their generation to make sure their African way prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we need to embrace our own culture and what we are,''
Dimpho said. ``Then we can wear NIKE and DKNY if we want.''

QUAYLE SAYS HE'S IN THE 2000 RACE TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Polls and pundits notwithstanding, former Vice
President Dan Quayle said Tuesday he is in the 2000 presidential
race to win.
</P>
<P>
   At a lightly attended luncheon speech at the National Press
Club, Quayle promised he would wage a ``positive ...
issues-oriented campaign'' based on the philosophy that ``character
matters.'' A Quayle presidency, he suggested, would be a perfect
antidote to what he characterized as ``Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Quayle told reporters his political fortunes
ultimately may depend on the extent to which the media _ and the
public _ turns its focus away from ``polls, gaffes, flip-flops,
attacks and sex.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Quayle wish the focus would be?
</P>
<P>
   ``Issues,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   And if the media focused on issues, would that boost Quayle's
low status in the polls, currently well behind Republican
front-runner Texas Gov. George W. Bush?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Quayle said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's speech was laden with issues. His campaign theme, he
said, is ``raising a nation'' through, among other things, a 30
percent across-the-board tax cut that he argued would enable
parents to spend less time at work and more time at home with
children.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, 52, also touted his foreign policy experience not only
as vice president, but in eight years as a Republican senator from
Indiana and four years in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think foreign policy is very important,'' he said in taking
a swipe at Bush, who has not held national office. ``I don't
believe we need another president who has inexperience when it
comes to foreign policy ... I'll be ready on day one.''
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Quayle debunked suggestions that he is in the
race to redeem his reputation for miscues, among them suggesting to
a school child that ``potato'' is spelled p-o-t-a-t-o-e.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running to win,'' he said. ``If I didn't think I could
win, I wouldn't be doing it.'' Still, he added, ``I can understand
(questions about his motivation). It's a fair question.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle also sought to diminish expectations for the Aug. 14 Iowa
straw poll, an event put on by the state's Republican Party in
which GOP leaders from virtually every precinct in the state pick
their presidential favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come to Iowa and you'll see a lot of straw out there,'' Quayle
said. ``It blows in the wind ... It's a warm up.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's pollster, Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, distributed a survey
of 400 Iowa Republicans showing that a majority _ 53 percent _ of
likely GOP caucus-goers said that if Bush won the straw poll on
Aug. 14, it would make ``no difference'' when they decided how to
vote in the February 2000 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Languishing in single digits in most polls of Republican
contenders for the GOP nomination, Quayle is fighting an uphill
battle for campaign contributions. He has $3 million in his
campaign coffers this year compared to Bush's whopping $36.2
million.

 &HT;    HOUSE MEMBERS URGE PAUSE IN ANTHRAX SHOTS FOR MILITARY
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A handful of House members urged the Defense
Department on Tuesday to suspend its mandatory anthrax vaccination
program amid growing fears that the shots may lead to serious
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military personnel across the country are struggling with
their options: take the vaccine or leave the service.
Unfortunately, too many are choosing the latter,'' Rep. Walter B.
Jones, R-N.C., said at a Capitol Hill news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that several hundred active-duty personnel have
refused vaccination against anthrax, a potential biological warfare
weapon, and are awaiting disciplinary action, according to Defense
Department reports.
</P>
<P>
   He cited several examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ Thirty-two pilots in the 301st Airlift Squadron at Travis Air
Force Base in California have resigned or are planning to do so
because of the anthrax vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than one-third of the F-16 pilots in the Wisconsin
National Guard's 115th Fighter Wing are expected to refuse the
vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another Air National Guard unit in Connecticut reportedly lost
one-third of its pilots for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fourteen marines in Hawaii and more than a dozen in California
have refused the vaccine and are awaiting likely courts-martial and
dishonorable discharges.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to Defense Secretary William Cohen last month,
Jones referred to a report that suggested a correlation between
veterans who received the inoculation from 1990 to 1991 and later
contracted serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Jones urged Cohen to suspend the vaccinations
until more tests are done to examine the possible health effects of
the shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``That request was denied in a letter, which failed to address
my concerns,'' Jones said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the growing problem, Jones introduced legislation
last month that would make the immunization program voluntary until
the FDA has approved a new anthrax vaccine or an abbreviated set of
inoculations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., has also introduced legislation to
stop the vaccination program. His legislation would halt the
anthrax vaccinations until the National Institutes of Health have
completed additional studies.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300,000 military personnel have received the shot
since 1998 under the mandatory program.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has said repeatedly that the vaccine is
safe and necessary to protect military personnel from airborne
anthrax, which is lethal to those unprotected. Anthrax is among the
biological agents thought most likely to be used by international
terrorists or potential U.S. military adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   On its Internet site, the department says the vaccine has
produced no long-term side effects and that it ``has been safely
and routinely administered to wool mill workers, veterinarians,
laboratory workers, and livestock handlers in the United States''
since it was approved by the FDA in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the site says several national scientific groups,
including the National Academy of Sciences, have found no evidence
to link the anthrax vaccine with illnesses among Persian Gulf war
veterans who were inoculated.
</P>
<P>
   Jones dismissed military claims that the vaccine is just as safe
as others routinely given to the general population.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were indeed as safe as a tetanus shot, would members of
the best military in the world ... really give up their career,
their livelihood because of a shot?'' he asked.

STUDS CAN LEAD A LUCRATIVE LIFE IN SATISFYING RACING NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Want to know what the good life is?
</P>
<P>
   How does this sound: Retire at the ripe old age of 5, already a
multimillionaire, and spend the rest of your days as a pampered
stud, getting big bucks to take the lead role in the equine version
of the birds and the bees.
</P>
<P>
   Spectacular Bid, widely regarded as one of the Top 10 racehorses
of the 20th century, may be heading into the stretch run of his
life. But what a way to go. The magnificent thoroughbred, who
retired in 1980 at age 5 with a then-record $2 million in winnings,
whiles away his days at Milfer Farms in rural Unadilla, N.Y., about
90 miles southwest of Saratoga Race Course.
</P>
<P>
   During this year's breeding season (March 15 to July 15) he will
have, shall we say, serviced more than 50 mares. By Wilt
Chamberlain standards, that's nothing to crow about, but it's good
work if you can get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bid,'' as he's affectionately known, is the most famous
racehorse based in New York, although he's no longer the most
sought-after or the most highly valued.
</P>
<P>
   That distinction goes to a couple of lesser-known studs standing
at different farms in the Hudson Valley, Tomorrow's Cat at Quest
Royal in Hudson and Distinctive Pro at Sugar Maple Farm in
Poughquag. They both have 1999 stud fees set at $10,000 for a live,
healthy foal, almost triple the $3,500 fee for Spectacular Bid's
services.
</P>
<P>
   Stud fees are based on the horse's pedigree and his race record,
explained Michael Flynn, executive director of the New York
Thoroughbred Breeders Association, based in Saratoga Springs. The
next most important factor is the thoroughbred's production record,
presuming he has foals that are racing. Stud fees adjust depending
on the success of the offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky, of course, is the top breeding state. Top breeding
land in the world, actually. The U.S. rankings fluctuate by year,
but California and Florida usually vie for runner-up honors, while
Maryland and New York round out the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Not one New York-bred horse has ever won the Kentucky Derby, the
Preakness or the Belmont Stakes. The most successful New York-breds
to race at Saratoga have been Thunder Rumble, who came from High
Cliff Farm in Schenectady County to win the Jim Dandy and Travers
in 1992, and Fio Rito, who shipped in from the Finger Lakes and won
the Whitney in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But upstate New York is proving to be a successful home for a
number of top racehorses, who are living the good life at the 30 or
so primary breeding farms that stand one or more stallions.
</P>
<P>
   There are 12 stakes-winning stud horses at Highcliff, in
Delanson, including Thunder Rumble's sire, Thunder Puddles. During
one three-week stretch this winter, from Feb. 14 to March 7, High
Cliff-sired foals claimed 30 percent of all of the purse winnings
at Aqueduct Race Course, more than the rest of the farms in New
York combined, according to High Cliff manager Suzie O'Cain.
</P>
<P>
   The farm's most prized stud is Scarlet Ibis, ranked second in
the state behind Distinctive Pro. Yet his services were available
this year for a mere $2,500, or one-fourth the stud fee for
``Pro.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have raised his stud fees this year,'' O'Cain said.
``We made a mistake, I think it's safe to say.''
</P>
<P>
   While some breeders believe that their business is mostly a
science, with well-known gene pools mixing, O'Cain prefers to view
the business as a crapshoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many superstars potentially and a lot have to
retire early because of injuries. We don't know what they could
have been,'' O'Cain observed. ``Some horses are spectacular horses
that don't reproduce themselves in the breeding shed. I don't know
what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just hit and miss. Sometimes great horses come from
places you'll never expect. I'm kind of glad it's that way, because
not everyone can afford to breed to Mr. Prospector.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Prospector, who died in May at age 28, was far and away the
most prized stud in the world, active through his final year.
Housed at Claiborne Farm outside Lexington, Ky., his stud fee was
between $150,000 and $200,000 with no guarantee that there would be
a foal. Because of Mr. Prospector and other super studs, the
syndicate that owns Spectacular Bid decided in 1991 to move him
from Kentucky to upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went from being a big fish in a big pond to a big fish in a
small pond,'' explained Dr. Jonathan Davis, a veterinarian and
``Bid's'' syndicate manager. ``He was competing with 15 premier
stallions in Kentucky. On the other hand, there are very few proven
stallions in the state of New York and he's definitely one of them.
He gets top billing on the marquee.''
</P>
<P>
   Another marquee thoroughbred living the good life in upstate New
York _ the only living Triple Crown race winner other than
Spectacular Bid _ is Go and Go, who is at Waldorf Farm in North
Chatham. The 1990 Belmont Stakes champion, retired in 1992, has
been at Dr. Jerry Bilinski's farm since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Bid,'' he has thus far failed to reproduce his speed in
his progeny, knocking his stud fee down to $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not been a whirlwind at stud,'' Bilinski acknowledged.
``He's been average; he was getting higher fees eight years ago
than today.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a reason why owners still seek out Go and Go, and
fork over more than two grand for the right to raise one of his
offspring: the thrill of the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know, he could become very valuable tomorrow if a
horse he produces wins the Travers,'' Bilinski said. ``It's a
high-risk business, and you never know what's going to happen.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: MAESTROS, INSIGHTS AND INTERMISSION IN THE
SAGEBRUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASPEN, Colo. _ A small town in which James Levine, James Conlon
and David Zinman, to name only conductors (and only some of them),
roam the streets at the same time? Salzburg, Austria, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   No, this town is smaller, though not nearly as small as it was
even a decade ago. Indeed, as trendy shops proliferate, it begins
to resemble the Upper West Side of Manhattan, as an old Aspen hand
noted, though styles and prices run more toward Paris.
</P>
<P>
   And a major factor in that growth is the Aspen Music Festival
and School, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary with the help
of those conductors and other figures central to its history. The
summer season accounts for some 40 percent of Aspen's annual
economy, a study by the University of Colorado, Boulder, which the
festival likes to cite, found a few years ago, and summer in Aspen
is closely tied to the festival.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, too, continues to evolve. Having unveiled an
impressive year-round chamber hall, the Harris Concert Hall, six
years ago, it plans to open a new, redesigned concert tent next
season to replace the 35-year-old one now in use, whose worn
condition (added to inherent acoustical flaws) has been drippingly
evident during a rainy summer the rest of the country might envy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the festival has announced the creation of an
American Academy of Conducting next year, conceived by the
festival's music director, Zinman. But the academy may be hard put
to improve on maestros who have already passed through the festival
and school.
</P>
<P>
   Levine, for one, was returning after a 23-year absence to
conduct the Aspen Chamber Symphony on Friday evening and the Aspen
Festival Orchestra on Sunday afternoon. Both orchestras combine
professional players, in principal positions, with students.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday program consisted of Mahler's Third Symphony, which
Ara Guzelimian, a former artistic administrator of the festival,
neatly tied to the anniversary in a preconcert lecture. In its
searching ambition, Guzelimian suggested, this grand paean to
nature and ultimately to God (whether pantheistic, Jewish or
Christian), shares the idealism of those who gathered here in 1949
to celebrate the Goethe bicentennial and ponder the task of postwar
cultural reconstruction. Both the festival and the Aspen Institute
for Humanistic Studies grew out of that meeting, the two tendencies
being exemplified in the person of one person present, Albert
Schweitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Mahler's Third has long been a favorite work of Levine. When he
conducted it a few years ago with the Philadelphia Orchestra, the
``Parsifal'' effect seemed to be setting in: what Levine loves, he
tends to love to death (or rather, to a shimmering new life),
lingering, savoring and caressing at ever greater length.
</P>
<P>
   He added another wrinkle in Philadelphia, injecting an
intermission after the first movement, citing Mahler's own
precedent at the 1902 premiere (no matter that Mahler took 10
minutes, and a modern intermission is 25). He did the same here,
and even more than in Philadelphia, the scale, intensity and
eventfulness of the first movement justified _ all but demanded _
an intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge that an intermission awaits may indeed encourage
Levine to risk more. Here, at any rate, was a magnificent construct
of a first movement, gaining momentum in the marchlike section
leading into the great central climax, which was perfectly offset
by its counterpart at the end. All of this emerged cohesively
despite an interruption when a low-flying plane drowned out the
music. The musical juncture was opportune, and Levine simply
stopped, waited and picked up again.
</P>
<P>
   The intermission had another advantage here, letting a listener
wade hip-deep into sagebrush outside the tent and gaze in awe at
majestic peaks receding into the haze toward Independence Pass: the
very picture of what had just been heard in Mahler's nature study.
And throughout, the wind riffling through aspen trees and whipping
the tent flaps enhanced the sense of nature's presence.
</P>
<P>
   Levine let the four inner movements breathe their more relaxed
atmospheres (with Michelle DeYoung a lovely-toned mezzo-soprano and
the Colorado Children's Chorus piping attractively but with the
women of the Colorado Symphony Chorus sounding unfocused). Then he
offered another model of sustained line in the finale, with layer
upon layer building to a stunning conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The playing was, of course, no match for the Philadelphia
Orchestra's; the horn players, in particular, struggled repeatedly,
but what youngsters would not falter in such music, where
professionals fear to tread? Youthful ardor, in any case, counted
for more than plushness.
</P>
<P>
   Levine, for his part, is often praised for the smoothness and
polish he achieves, less often for the depth of his
interpretations. Yet here, despite rough edges, he elicited one of
the finest Mahler Thirds _ one of the finest Mahler interpretations
_ this grizzled Mahlerite has heard.
</P>
<P>
   Levine's other program _ the Bach-Webern Ricercar, Wagner's
``Siegfried Idyll,'' Milhaud's ``Boeuf sur le Toit'' and Schubert's
Fourth Symphony _ afforded less potential for imposing rhetoric,
and pelting rain on the tent roof intruded loudly on much of the
music. Still, Levine and the Aspen Chamber Symphony made much of
these works, showing a mutual affection as obvious as that in the
Mahler.

 ASPEN: the Mahler.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One event specifically celebrating the anniversary was Bernard
Rands' chamber opera ``Belladonna,'' commissioned for the occasion
and performed on Thursday evening, with Zinman conducting. Rands
and his librettist, Leslie Dunton-Downer, seemed focused not so
much on a mere 50-year span as on the millennial scale, looking
back to the elevated dinner conversation of ancient Greek thinkers
and to the Last Supper and Passion of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prefer to think of `Belladonna' as music theater rather
than opera,'' they write, but there is little that is truly
theatrical, or in many cases even comprehensible, in this elaborate
intellectual conceit. Set as a dinner party of five thoroughly
modern women, its discussion of love veers from a high-flown scene
presented all in Latin (with more Latin in supertitles) to a
farcical sendup of opera. (Here, at least, the music mirrors the
humor of the libretto, as it does not in earlier scenes.)
</P>
<P>
   Interludes are larded with more Latin (three kinds in all, the
authors point out), sung offstage without even the benefit of
titles, and scarcely anything registers but the odd sexual swoon.
Along with the farce, the presence of a falling-down drunk insures
easy laughs, but it is hard to imagine what audience this farrago
is intended to attract or will. Only the most literate listener
with a taste for slapstick need apply, apparently, though the
friendly crowd filling the Wheeler Opera House, a lovely little
antique painstakingly restored, seemed to take its cue from the
farcical aspects and cheered lustily.
</P>
<P>
   In marked contrast, Conlon's master class for opera singers in
the Wheeler on Saturday morning was all about communication. With
intelligence, grace and humor, Conlon turned fine performances into
potentially excellent ones, and indifferent performances into
promising ones, making it all look easy.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he imparted insights, not only to singers but also
to a rapt full house made up largely of civilians, on the rendering
of texts in Italian and German; fine points of vocal technique, and
sheer musical savvy. ``Don't  &UR; you &LR;  cry,'' he said of singing
Puccini and verismo generally. ``Make  &UR; them &LR;  cry. Don't reflect too
much on your own emotions. That's what turns it into kitsch.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have been talking just as well about Levine's Mahler.
Musical ideas, like musicians, have a way of bumping into one
another in this little town in the summer.

 &HT;    QUAYLE STRESSES POLICY, NOT POLITICS, IN PRESS CLUB SPEECH
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Declaring that ``it's the message that wins
elections,'' former Vice President Dan Quayle on Tuesday repeated
his call for a 30 percent across-the-board tax cut and said the
United States should work on improving relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the National Press Club, Quayle also said he
opposes independence for Taiwan and downplayed the importance of
the upcoming Republican straw poll in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   While largely avoiding mentioning his rivals for the GOP
presidential nomination, Quayle took a swipe at Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas, under whose father Quayle served as vice president from
1989 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought the younger Bush was qualified to be
president, Quayle declined to respond directly. But he said, ``I
don't believe we need another president who has inexperience when
it comes to foreign policy. There's only so much you can get from
briefings and briefers and crash courses when it comes to foreign
policy. But I can just tell you, from my point of view, I'll be
ready on day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said his tax cut proposal _ far beyond the amount being
sought by Republican congressional leaders _ would benefit the
middle class by offering a typical family a $6,000 reduction. His
overall goal, he said, would be to limit all taxes _ local, state
and federal _ to no more than 30 percent of income.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are overtaxed,'' he said. ``You've got
this perceived surplus out here ... and the Congress will spend it
if they don't let the people keep more of it. I know them. I served
in the House. I served in the Senate. I worked with them when I was
vice president. They will spend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle rejected President Clinton's proposal to use the surplus
to reduce the public debt and shore up Social Security's finances.
He said he would prefer giving people the choice of investing 30
percent of their Social Security payroll taxes in individual
retirement accounts and reducing their retirement benefits by 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign affairs, Quayle said the United States should engage
China in order to promote democratic change and hoped to eventually
see it as part of the World Trade Organization. He said the United
States should encourage a peaceful solution to the dispute between
China and Taiwan over its status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not support the idea of independence for Taiwan, but it
is a democratic entity, and I hope that they don't do it. But it
must be made clear to the rulers in Beijing that this issue will be
resolved peacefully and not through military force.''
</P>
<P>
   The former vice president _ the focus of countless jokes by
late-night talk show hosts and others _ discounted the suggestion
that he is running for president to rehabilitate his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running to win,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he expected to do in the Aug. 14 straw poll in Iowa,
Quayle avoided making a projection and downplayed its importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The straw poll is exactly what it says it is _ a straw poll. I
wouldn't read too much into it,'' he said.

 &HT;    Firm receives Microsoft award
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ IntelliNet has been recognized by Microsoft for an
intranet site that lets Cox Communications identify, track and
archive problems with its many cable TV systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based software company built the Cox Communications
site, called NOCNET 2000, using Microsoft's SQL server software.
Microsoft in turn honored IntelliNet for the innovative use of its
software, giving it the company's Best Knowledge Management
Solution Collaboration Award for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   IntelliNet was among 10 developers worldwide given awards by
Microsoft for use of its SQL software. The winners were chosen from
among 19,500 developers using SQL.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining moment for IntelliNet,'' said Frank Bell,
the company's founder, president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   IntelliNet is the largest developer in the Southeast licensed to
use SQL. It used the software to develop a centralized way for Cox
Communications, the fifth largest cable TV operator, to monitor its
systems for problems.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is controlled by Cox Enterprises, a
diversified media company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (IntelliNet's intranet site) has significantly improved our
efficiency in performing daily tasks,'' said Gary Adkins, Cox
Communications' manager of monitoring and operations support.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins said that NOCNET lets his staff build applications to
solve problems and release them ``with the click of a button.''
</P>
<P>
   The NOCNET site is accessed using a simple Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Before, Adkins said, Cox Communications had to monitor problems
with paper and Excel spreadsheets. Information was scattered.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with NOCNET, all records and actions are centralized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We no longer have to chase down different books of information
in different places in solving a network problem,'' said Adkins.

 &HT;    New wireless phones can surf the Internet, too
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Surf phones are here.
</P>
<P>
   Two wireless carriers Tuesday announced availability of the next
generation of Motorola phones, two devices that will give the user
access to the Internet _ although it is a version stripped of
graphics and glitz.
</P>
<P>
   But with the introduction of the phones, Southern LINC and
Nextel got a jump on their five rivals in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern LINC will offer customers an expanded two-way flow of
information that will help them improve the performance of their
employees and their business,'' said Bob Dawson, president and CEO
of Southern LINC.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's other wireless providers use a different kind of
technology. While they are also planning data-friendly devices, an
Internet phone is many months away.
</P>
<P>
   Both Southern and Nextel appeal primarily to business customers
and professionals, but each with a slant.
</P>
<P>
   The Net-surfing phones are equipped with a slimmed-down browser
that allows a search of the Net. The technology also permits a user
to receive and send e-mail. As with other phones offered by
Southern and Nextel, the devices also include two-way radio, paging
and cellular phone capability.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Southern has set no pricing for the new service
yet. The company will charge $175 and $255 for the two phones.
Virginia-based Nextel is running a promotional sale of $99 on one
of the phones, which it plans to sell later for $199. One phone
weighs 5.4 ounces, the other 8.6 ounces.
</P>

   Southern, unlike Nextel, has no national network. On the other
hand, Southern's network is much more extensive in the 127,000
square miles it covers. Nextel aims at businesses whose employees
travel frequently, while Southern aims more at those whose travel
keeps them within a few hundred miles of home.

 &HT;    Private line system of BellSouth and AT&AMP;T passes lab test
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth and AT&AMP;T have completed yet another
important test in a series of tests to ensure that the millennium
bug won't crash their communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   This time the companies were testing their system of private
lines, used by airlines, banks, universities and gas companies.
</P>
<P>
   The companies report that, at least in lab tests, their private
line systems worked without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is yet another vote of confidence for our Year 2000
efforts,'' said Rick Harder, BellSouth's vice president with
overall responsibilities for Year 2000. ``Our customers should rest
assured that private line services should not be affected by the
century date change.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth and AT&AMP;T tested whether their private lines would
recognize several important dates. Those dates included Sept. 9,
1999 and the rollover from Dec. 31, 1999 to Jan. 1, 2000, as well
as leap year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary objective is to make the arrival of the new year
transparent to all telephone customers,'' said John Pasqua, vice
president of the AT&AMP;T Year 2000 program. ``For that reason, we view
preparing for Year 2000 as a cooperative effort, not a competitive
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   While hidden from the public, private lines are an important
backbone infrastructure for many companies. Banks, for example, use
them to string together their ATM machines. For some gas companies,
private lines are the way they monitor remote meters.
</P>
<P>
   Although competitors, BellSouth and AT&AMP;T nonetheless have been
working hard to make sure their networks will continue to work with
each other after the new year.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have conducted nearly 500 tests on their
public telephone networks for potential Y2K foul-ups. They say the
tests were 100 percent successful.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is an Atlanta-based telecommunications company with
$23 billion in annual sales, providing local telephone service in
the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is the world's largest long-distance carrier.

WHEN IMPORTANT ARTWORKS GO MISSING, CON MEN AREN'T ALWAYS TO BLAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it weren't The World's Most Expensive Painting by Almost
Everyone's Favorite Artist, it's unlikely that the whereabouts of a
single artwork would translate into an international story.
</P>
<P>
   But there it was late last month, in Sunday newspapers all over
the globe: Vincent van Gogh's ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' gone
missing. It made the news again last Friday, when it was reported
that the painting had turned up _ sort of. Apparently, a U.S. buyer
had paid at least $87 million for the work, though nobody was
saying where he or she had stashed it.
</P>
<P>
   Big news? That's debatable.
</P>
<P>
   What's not debatable is this: Famous artworks get ``lost'' more
often than any of us can imagine. And usually, as the van Gogh
episode seems to be illustrating, their disappearance is followed
by their reappearance.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: After being stolen from the Louvre in 1911, da
Vinci's ``Mona Lisa,'' perhaps the most legendary painting in the
world, turned up three years later, when one of the thieves turned
himself in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all kinds of reasons why a work can kind of seem to
disappear,'' said Anna Kislik, director of Art Loss Register, the
world's largest database of stolen artworks. ``Theft is one of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Effectively, an artwork is considered lost when art historians
and the general art market don't know where it is. The Art Loss
Register lists about 110,000 objects missing, or missing and
recovered _ although those numbers reflect countless works of
little interest to historians and dealers. True, the Jan Vermeer
stolen about nine years ago from the Isabella Stewart Gardner
Museum in Boston is listed as missing, but so is everything from
Lalique jewelry to family portraits, Kislik said.
</P>
<P>
   One category of stolen art gaining increasing attention is
material the Nazis took from European Jews, whose descendants are
beginning to relocate and claim their rightful possessions, Kislik
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Another form of looting involves removal of objects from
churches, temples and tombs, as thieves prey upon sites in Eastern
Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Latin America, among
other points. An example of a happily recovered work in these parts
are the frescoes stolen from a Cypriot church, ransomed by the late
Dominique de Menil and now securely housed in a chapel/museum in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But art theft is a centuries-old practice.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Casler, the Kimbell Art Museum's curator of Asian art,
cites countless paintings that have been stolen over the centuries
from the Imperial Treasury in China. They were taken by eunuchs in
the imperial household, by invading Japanese forces and by Chiang
Kai-shek's troops, among other pilferers and plunderers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilfering often befalls artworks that are in museum storage, and
obviously not on view. They may be too delicate to display
regularly, or they may be relatively unimportant and unattended.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, even a masterpiece can be lost _ although it may be
sitting in plain sight _ because its history, including the
identity of its maker, is not known, said Kimbell Director Timothy
Potts.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with Michelangelo da Caravaggio's ``Taking of
Christ,'' which hung in a Jesuit refectory in Dublin, Ireland, and
was part of the order's daily life. Only recently was it recognized
as a Caravaggio and placed on public display, most recently at the
National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimbell and other museums are constantly on the lookout for
such rediscoveries _ the Kimbell's Caravaggio, ``The Card Sharps,''
is one. They see them as opportunities to bring major works into
the public realm.
</P>
<P>
   Yet such opportunities are becoming increasingly rare, Potts
said, due to the number of dealers and academics who study every
auction that comes up. Often, such works are put on the open
market, where museums must compete with deeper-pocketed private
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Even the disappearance of ``Dr. Gachet'' can be viewed in
context. In the go-go '80s, there was a flood of flush Japanese
investors who paid high prices for stellar (and sometimes mediocre)
examples of French 19th-century painting.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these works are probably chilling out in warehouses in
Tokyo, just as ``Dr. Gachet'' no doubt did for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become quite a problem for curators of European art,''
said Jane Myers, chief curator for the Amon Carter Museum in Fort
Worth. ``I think there are many stories like the van Gogh story.
It's an economic situation.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   More common for Myers, who specializes in American art, is a
different sort of missing picture: one that has disappeared because
it went out of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, an artwork's history, including its authorship,
may be known _ and dismissed, because the artist is not considered
significant. Such vagaries of fashion account for untold numbers of
19th-century American artworks lurking in dark attic corners, or
hanging in people's living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter, for example, is replete with rediscovered works _
from its ``Garden of Eden'' by Thomas Cole to its Martin Johnson
Heade masterpiece, ``Thunder Storm Over Narragansett Bay,'' which
was found in an antique store. And one of the Dallas Museum of
Art's most popular pictures, Frederic Edwin Church's ``Icebergs,''
was a major rediscovery.
</P>
<P>
   And, as artistic reputations are revived and pictures are put
with the names, ``curators get unbelievably excited,'' Myers said.
``When something you've known only through scholarship, only
intellectually, materializes for the first time, it's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of known, but still unlocated, American paintings
includes such important works as Thomas Eakins' portrait of
Rutherford B. Hayes (circa 1877); William Harnett's ``Thieves in
the Pantry'' (1879), a painting of mice nibbling cheese, known by a
photograph and a sketch on scrap paper; and George Caleb Bingham's
``The Stump Orator'' (1847). That last picture was the prize in a
lottery at the American Art-Union in New York in 1848: It was
awarded to William Duncan of Savannah, Ga., and has not been heard
of since.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing category of works comes last, though: cases
in which obviously great artworks are known, but the artist has not
been identified. Vermeer and Georges de La Tour, two of the great
names in art, were not known until the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Yet scholars are uncovering artists' names and slowly forging
connections between them and their masterpieces _ quite
spectaculary, in fact, in terms of Martin Johnson Heade. Curator
Ted Stebbins of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston has identified
some 200 works during the past several years that can be attributed
to this re-emerging American master.
</P>
<P>
   So. There are any number of ways in which artworks can drop from
sight. And aggressive scholarship is one of the forces that brings
them back to light.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' saga suggests, so is the
pressure exerted by the chance to make a profit.

   SCOT-GOLF _Opponents of more golf course resort development in
St. Andrews, Scotland, backed away from launching a legal challenge
to Chateau Elan's plans for a hotel, two courses and a conference
center on what used to be Kingask farm. Owners of the Georgia
winery-golf resort can continue their development, the town's

   ATLANTA MASS KILLINGS
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTINGS-MURDERS _ ATLANTA _ The mass killings that have marred
July in this city obviously have prompted the homicide rate to
climb by nine, for the year to date. APD Chief Harvard says there
is nothing anyone can do to prevent someone from going off and
killing nine people. However last year, APD recieved a $76,000
federal grant to study homicides in Atlanta and how police could
prevent them by finding out more about where they occurred, who the
victim/suspects were, motives, etc. Barton's spree and where it
erupted does not fit the typical profile of homicide in Atlanta,
and Barton does not fit the profile of the typical killer. (Longa,

<P>
   w/SHOOTINGS-GRADY _ ATLANTA _ Is no place safe? Even as four men
wounded in Thursday's rampage in Buckhead were struggling to
recover in hospital beds upstairs, a security guard shot a man
brandishing a gun near the pharmacy at Grady Memorial Hospital
Tuesday morning. Kenneth Gay is in critical condition. Gay's family
was bringing him in with hopes of having a psychiatric evaluation,
but when they reached the metal detectors at the entrance to the
13th-floor pysch unit Gay became agitated and pulled out a gun. He
jumped in an elevator, getting off at the first floor where he was
confront by a retired APD officer now working at the public
hospital. Grady chaplains quickly responded by trying to buffer the
Buckhead victims from any knowledge of what was going on near the
hospital's Pratt St. entrance. Employees and others all rattled by
a shooting so soon after Mark Barton's rampage. (Longa, Atlanta

<P>
   SHOOTINGS-YUSEF _ Yusef Liberzon, 39, became a day trader
because he wanted to learn computers and get away from being a taxi
driver _ which was too dangerous for too little money, friends
said. Liberzon, a Russian immigrant from Kiev, was shot in the head
by Mark Barton and has undergone surgery to remove the bullet and a
good portion of his brain. Today (8-4), doctors will see if there
is any sign of hope _ by checking brain activity. Liberzon, a U.S.
citizen after nine years, is the sole support for his wife and his
mother. His wife is a citizen, but his mother is not _ and has no

   NASHVILLE-VOTE _ NASHVILLE _ Voters head to the polls Thursday
to elect a new mayor to succeed popular Mayor Phil Bredesen, but
most observers predict the non-partisan race involving nine
candidates will require a run-off vote in September. The leading
candidate in local polls is two-time former mayor Richard Fulton,
who also is a former U.S. Congressman. At least one analyst
believes turnout on Thursday will be low.
</P>
<P>
   `One reason is that things are going well,
</P>
<P>
   ` said M. Lee Smith, a Nashville political analyst. The crime
rate has dropped in Nashville. School funding increased in
Bredesen's term. The Tennessee Titans begin their inaugural season
in August in a new $290 million stadium downtown. (DuBose, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   NEWCOPS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Among police departments in Ohio's
largest cities, Dayton has the whitest force with 88 percent. For
years, the Dayton Police Department has struggled with its facade,
attempting to make it more closely represent the 40 percent black
people who live in the Gem City. But in the past decade, the
department's racial makeup has changed little. All this is splashed
against a backdrop of celebration as Dayton's 90th recruit class
graduates tonight, adding three black men, seven females, one
Native American man and 10 white males to the force. (Vasconez,

   Y2K-POLL _ More than half of Atlantans are concerned that
computers might stall when the Times Square ball rings in the year

   BRADLEY _ Tapping into fresh doubts about Vice President Gore's
ability win the general election, former senator Bill Bradley is
chipping away at the aura of invincibility that once surrounded
Gore's campaign for the Democratic nomination. The former NBA star
has exceeded all expectations. He's attracting millions in
financial support, plenty of big name endorsements and national
media attention. With nearly as much money in the bank as Gore and
a reputation for frugality, Bradley has erased doubts that his
campaign won't be able to go the distance with Gore in Iowa, New
Hampshire and beyond. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 35.

   BUSH-RICHARDS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Former Gov. Ann Richards, the
first Democrat to lose to him, says the best way to go after George
W. Bush is not to. ``I wouldn't pay any attention to the
opponent,'' Richards said when he asked for her advice on how to
run against Bush. As Bush looks more and more like the inevitable
GOP nominee, the Democrats are scrambling for the most effective
way of running against him. So far, the Gore camp has adopted a
relatively low- key, subtle approach. But the Democratic National
Committee, ignoring Richards advice and perhaps foreshadowing
what's to come, is mounting a full-frontal assault. A look at the
Democratic strategy for beating Bush, an early front-runner in this
earliest of election campaigns. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman)

   &UR; To bolster your coverage of the hunt for Osama bin Laden and
the one-year anniversary of the Aug. 7, 1998 bombing of two U.S.
embassies in East Africa, The New York Times Syndicate is offering
six excerpts, described in detail below, from the book, ``Unholy
Wars,'' by John K. Cooley. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -- A veteran foreign correspondent for ABC-TV News, Cooley has
written widely on the Middle East and North Africa. In 1996 he won
the George Polk Memorial Award for more than 40 years of global
coverage. He is the author of five other books on the Middle East,
including ``Payback: America's Long War in the Middle East'' and
``Libyan Sandstorm: Qaddafi's Revolution.'' --
</P>
<P>
   -- The following excerpts will be released on the wire Tues.,
Aug. 3, in category codes ``k'' for commentary and ``a'' for
general news. --
</P>
<P>
   PART I: ``Osama bin Laden: The Early Years'' -- This Saudi exile
charged in the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa last year tops
the FBI's ``10 Most Wanted'' list, with a $5 million reward for his
capture. The first excerpt describes how his father, an industrious
immigrant, built a fortune from scratch, and how, as a university
student, young Osama bonded with Prince Turki bin Faisal al-Saud.
It tells how the bin Laden company's bulldozers and other equipment
cut roads, storage depots, bunkers and base camps in Afghanistan
which, on Aug. 20, 1998, would be the targets of retaliatory
strikes by U.S. cruise missiles. (slugged: BC-OSAMA-WEALTH-ONE)
</P>
<P>
   PART II: ``Terrorists from Freedom Fighters: Recruiting for the
Holy War'' -- Only after the U.S. Embassy bombings on Aug. 7, 1998
did disturbing facts begin to trickle out about how Osama bin Laden
and his corporate empire provided a bankroll for the recruitment
and training of volunteers in the ``holy war'' against the former
Soviet Union, from 1979-89. Those zealous volunteers would soon
provide a pool of talent _ men whose skills would be turned to
unholy wars of global terror. (slugged: BC-OSAMA-TALENT-TWO)
</P>
<P>
   PART III: ``Deadly Skills: the Training to be A Holy Warrior''
-- This excerpt details the sort of top-notch training and military
discipline which turned bands of novices and rogues into an
adversary strong enough to defeat the Red Army. The CIA-managed
training was conducted by U.S. military special-ops forces and
Pakistan's powerful intelligence service. (slugged:
BC-OSAMA-JIHAD-THREE)
</P>
<P>
   PART IV: ``Bin Laden and the Worldwide Jihad'' -- In August
1990, when Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait, Osama bin
Laden was shocked to learn that King Fahd of Saudi Arabia had
invited U.S. troops to defend the kingdom. To him, this was
treason. After the Persian Gulf War, when the Americans did not all
withdraw, bin Laden revolted against the royal family. He moved to
Sudan, increased his personal fortune and expanded his support for
the world's most dangerous terrorist organizations.
(BC-OSAMA-TERRORISM-FOUR)
</P>
<P>
   PART V: ``The Jihad Comes to America'' -- On the morning of Aug.
7, 1998, the jihad against America would become real. Truck bombs
devastated the area around the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The bombs killed 224 people and injured
more than 4,500, in attacks that were perceived almost instantly to
bear Osama bin Laden's signature. This excerpt details and updates
information on the capture and fate of the bombers as well as the
aftermath of the controversial U.S. cruise-missile retaliatory
strikes. (slugged: BC-OSAMA-EMBASSIES-FIVE)
</P>
<P>
   PART VI: ``They Unsheathed Their Knives ... and Were Pointing
Them At Our Backs'' -- Some experts call it ``blowback'' _ the
aftermath of U.S. involvement in the Afghan war. It consists of a
global drug trade; of U.S. weapons openly sold in Pakistani
bazaars; and of highly trained, highly motivated men, who turned
against their former benefactors and vowed to eradicate the ``Great
Satan'': all traces of secular Westernized culture. The
all-too-tragic results have been seen at recent sites of terror _
among them, Khobar Towers, the World Trade Center, CIA headquarters
in Langley, Va., and the U.S. Embassies in East Africa. (slugged:

AIR FORCE CHIEF SAYS F-22 DELAY MAY HAVE RIPPLE EFFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff,
warned Tuesday that the service may have to curtail or cancel its
participation in a fighter program with the Navy and Marines if
Congress does not restore money for the F-22 fighter program.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said the Air Force would have to ``go back and rethink''
the Joint Strike Fighter if lawmakers do not reverse a House
recommendation to delay the F-22 Raptor and delete $1.8 billion for
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The two costly classes of airplanes are designed to work
together, Ryan said. The F-22 is to take on the high-speed air
interception role and the Joint Strike Fighter is to perform ground
attack missions. Delaying the F-22 diminishes the rationale for the
Joint Strike Fighter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the possibility of scaling back or canceling its
commitment to the Joint Strike Fighter, Ryan said: ``We are looking
at it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers have suggested that in order to save money, the
Joint Strike Fighter might replace the F-22, a proposition Ryan
rejects.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Strike Fighter is only ``a paper airplane'' in the
preliminary design stages, Ryan told reporters, adding that it
doesn't ``come close to doing the things that we need the F-22 to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   But the general added that he was confident the full Congress
would restore the F-22 funds when House and Senate lawmakers meet
in September to finalize defense spending for the coming year. The
plane has more support in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our assumption is that we are going to get the F-22,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are knowledgeable about what we believe will be the
threats in 15 years or so are convinced that this airplane is what
the (Air Force) needs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and F. Whitten Peters, the Air Force secretary, met Monday
night with Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., an ardent F-22 critic who
was behind last month's House vote. Ryan described the discussion a
``good conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee's defense
panel, asserts that the F-22 is too costly and that the Pentagon is
spending too much money on aircraft at the expense of other
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his push for a delay, Lewis and Rep. John P.
``Jack'' Murtha wrote in a column published Monday in the
Washington Post that the F-22 ``is the most expensive fighter plane
ever to be built, by a factor of three or four.'' Murtha, D-Pa., is
a member of the defense subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan has countered that any delay would signal the death of the
F-22 and weaken national security.
</P>
<P>
   The F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter mean big business for the
defense industry and jobs scattered around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the Air Force to spend $65 billion on 339 F-22s
capable of flying at supersonic speeds and evading radar. The
plane, built by the Lockheed Martin Corp., is the service's top
weapons priority. The company already is flying prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps intend to buy at
least 2,800 Joint Strike Fighters at a cost of more than $150
billion. The Boeing Co. is competing against Lockheed Martin for
the lucrative contract.

 &HT;    LAW STUDENTS SAY RACIALLY DIVERSE CLASSES ARE BETTER
 &HT;    400&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By Andrew Mollison
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most students at two of the nation's best-known law
schools believe that having classmates from other racial and ethnic
groups improves the quality of their education, according to a
survey released Tuesday by the Civil Rights Project of Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors said the Gallup Poll survey of 1,820 law students
at Harvard and the University of Michigan might help convince
judges to let elite law schools deliberately choose students from
different racial and ethnic groups. Legal opponents of such
affirmative action practices disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters reached 79 percent of those attending the two law
schools. Some key findings:
</P>
<P>
   - Nearly two-thirds reported that having students of different
racial and ethnic backgrounds improved classroom discussions.
</P>
<P>
   - By a ratio of 10-1, those who had been in both single-race and
multiracial classes said the racially diverse classes were
superior.
</P>
<P>
   Courts in recent years have rejected or criticized consideration
of race in admission decisions at several selective law schools and
universities, despite a 1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision that race
could be a criterion. The universities and law schools are so
popular that they can pick and choose from a large pool of
well-qualified candidates.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge B. Avant Edenfield of Savannah said in a
ruling last month that the University of Georgia had failed to
provide reliable evidence for its argument that ``an increase in
ethnic diversity ... leads to a more diverse collection of
thoughts, ideas and opinions on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that racial and ethnic diversity ``does have
educational value'' comes in the student poll, said Gary Orfield,
co-director of the Cambridge-based center, as he released the poll
at the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, ``Most (students) believed that diversity
had enhanced the way topics were discussed in their classes.''
</P>
<P>
   But a leading opponent of affirmative action in higher education
said the poll merely showed the value of having students with a
variety of viewpoints and backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, diversity is educationally valuable. The
disagreement is over whether you can judge a person's viewpoints
and background from the color of their skin,'' said Terry Pell of
the Washington-based Center for Individual Rights. ``They say yes,
and we say no.''
</P>
<P>
   The center has sued the University of Michigan over its
admission policies and participated in a successful lawsuit against
the University of Texas that effectively ended affirmative action
at Texas public colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   In other findings from the poll:
</P>
<P>
   - More than half the Harvard students and nearly three-fourth of
the Michigan students agreed that ``conflicts because of racial
differences'' had caused them to rethink their own values.
</P>
<P>
   - More than 95 percent of the white Americans, 70 percent of the
Asian Americans, 55 percent of the African Americans and 47 percent
of the Latinos said they had at least two ``close friends of
another racial or ethnic background'' in their law school. Only
foreign students reported having few close friends from other races
or ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Among the students surveyed, 7.6 percent said they were foreign,
while the Americans identified themselves as of white (66.9
percent), Asian (10.3), African (6.7), Hispanic (4.3), or mixed
(2.8) background, or gave other answers (1.6).

   NEW YORK _ Some words hit dead on in our appetite centers. For
some people, perhaps too many, the words ``melted cheese'' do the
trick. ``Slow roasted,'' ``truffled'' and ``seared'' are sure bets,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Now another word is clearly striking a chord with diners:
confit. It is so effective, in fact, that many chefs seem
determined to apply it to just about anything on their menus.
</P>
<P>
   At the Marco Polo Cafe, there are grilled breads spread with a
confit of lemon or olive puree and tomato confit. Slices of porcini
confit are laid beneath soft-shell crabs at Montrachet. The roasted
chicken with tarragon at Veritas comes with garlic confit. Palladin
had a kumquat confit on its last dessert menu and has a cherry
confit on the current one.
</P>
<P>
   Confit (italics)is(end italics) a good word. It suggests
comfort, softness, an intensity of flavor achieved by means unknown
to most everyday cooks. Not many of us would want to bother making
a true confit these days: preserving duck legs or another meat in
salt, then cooking it and storing it in fat.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone looking for inspiration could easily find it in the
dishes restaurants are calling confit simply because the word
evokes a certain rustic richness.
</P>
<P>
   A shallot confit at Picholine, for instance, appears as nothing
more than a humble tangle of the sliced root. But it is
exceptionally good. The shallots are cooked slowly and softened to
the point at which their structure is held intact merely by the
volume of butter and foie gras fat added. They are caramely and
heavily salted, but not salty. Each spoonful is delicate, succulent
loveliness.
</P>
<P>
   But is it _ or for that matter, are any of the new variations _
really confit?
</P>
<P>
   Literally, confit means preserved. In a culinary sense, it means
to draw the moisture out of a food and to replace some of it with
butter, oil or other fat. Traditionally, it was used for perishable
meats like duck and pork. Before refrigeration, these meats were
preserved by layering them in coarse salt for a day, then cooking
them in their own fat, packing them into crocks and covering them
with the fat.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared this way, the meats could be stored for months rather
than days. The preparation outlasted the pre-refrigeration era
because these meats were also incredibly tasty _ salty, rich and
robust.
</P>
<P>
   Today, chefs use the word to describe food with the same
qualities as confit. It is usually cooked slowly, reducing and
concentrating its juices until the food is tender, and the essence
of its flavor is as developed as a piece of ripe fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Because their flavor is so intense, confit foods are usually
served as garnishes or side dishes, a way of adding punch to a
dish's flavor without overwhelming it. Onion confit may lie under
slices of roasted lamb or may be rubbed on a sandwich. Tomato
confit may be cut into slivers and placed on fish or blended into a
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   With tomato confit, halved ripe tomatoes are typically roasted
slowly with oil until reduced to a sweet, intense pulp, which is
milder than a sun-dried tomato and richer than a fresh one. It is a
great way to preserve tomatoes for use in winter, though chefs seem
intent on using them now.
</P>
<P>
   Terrance Brennan, the chef at Picholine, has refined the method.
His tomato confit is sweet and supple. He peels the tomatoes and
lets them sit in salt for a few hours before cooking. Then he
simmers them in a puddle of olive oil at 275 degrees. The fibers in
the tomato break down, and what is left is simply the robustly
flavored flesh.
</P>
<P>
   But while the method might be more or less the same, I
discovered when I tried several recipes that each food reacted
differently. For the confit of carrots and cumin from Jo Jo, whole
carrots are simmered in orange juice, cumin, olive oil and cayenne
in a covered casserole placed in the oven at a low temperature of
275 degrees. After two hours, the carrots were as soft as butter,
coated in juices reduced to a syrup.
</P>
<P>
   You could say they were braised, but the effect was not quite
that. They did not brown, and the long time in the oven allowed the
cumin to penetrate the carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Most vegetables can be prepared as a confit in a similar way _
braised as slowly as possible in just a light coating of fat. I
tried a recipe from the Lenox Room for fennel confit that is made
using just olive oil, salt and lemon zest. The fennel, cut into
one-inch squares, softened so much that when you put it in your
mouth, it fell apart like a puree; the olive oil gave it a buttery
round flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon confit, which seems to be everywhere, is not one of these
modern versions of confit. It is a staple in Mediterranean cooking
(it's usually called preserved lemons), and is used to flavor
dishes much in the way salt is. There are several ways of making
it. You can rub dry salt on quartered lemons, or pack them into a
jar and cover them with coarse salt and lemon juice and let them
macerate for several days to several weeks. As the salt penetrates
the lemon, it breaks down the flesh, eventually dissolving the
pulp. After several weeks, what you are left with is a tender rind.
</P>
<P>
   David Cunningham, the chef at the Lenox Room, does not simply
salt his. He first makes a brine, colored with turmeric and heady
with peppercorns, fennel seed, coriander seed and cinnamon. He
boils the brine, pours it over quartered lemons and lets them soak
for a month. Then he dries off the lemons, packs them into jars
with branches of fresh bay leaves and covers them in olive oil.
They will keep for months in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   He uses the lemons like many cooks use garlic. He chops the
salted rind finely and tosses it in tomato salad, slices it and
mixes it with olives and cracked coriander, serves slivers of it
with entrees like a vegetable tagine or adds small pieces to soups
to brighten their flavor.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the spectrum, far from traditional, is fish
confit. Pop serves what it calls a swordfish confit. The fish is
poached in warm duck fat infused with herbes de Provence, garlic
and peppercorns. La Fourchette also does a fish confit, but in a
less decadent medium, olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Its rare tuna confit is effortless. Olive oil is heated with
whole garlic cloves, thyme, bay leaf, star anise and peppercorns
and poured over the fish, then it sits for a day in the
refrigerator. The heat partially penetrates the fish, cooking the
outer edges, and the fragrant oil slowly infuses the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With foods like fish, the line between what is confit and what
is not certainly blurs. Pouring hot olive oil over fish will not
preserve the fish, but it is a cooking technique for which there is
no word in the English language.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case with the cherry confit, served with a cherry
clafouti, at Palladin. The cherries are simmered in port wine with
sugar, orange zest and vanilla. The cherries soften, and the sauce
is delicious. There is a word for this preparation. It is poached.
</P>
<P>
   But poached is a word with hard edges and austere connotations.
There is a reason we so often steal from the French when it is time
to describe food. Imagine ordering fattened goose liver rather than
foie gras, meat and bean casserole instead of cassoulet, or stewed
onions instead of Picholine's shallot confit. The French words seem
to capture the sensual experience of the food in a way English
words don't.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, anyway. David Page, an owner of Home and
Drovers Tap Room, said: ``It's really Eurocentric and really
Francophilian nonsense to use the word confit. That process of
preserving meats is found in many cuisines throughout the world.''
If he offered a confit, he said, he would use a word like preserved
or potted.
</P>
<P>
   There are others who would object to the way chefs are throwing
around the French term _ although there is no chance that the
original meaning will be forgotten soon. Even now, smack in the
middle of summer, duck confit, rabbit confit and chicken confit are
on menus across the city, right next to variations like the corn
confit at Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   It is a silky, buttery stew of corn, served with crab cakes.
When asked to describe it, Scott Campbell, Avenue's chef, called it
``a savory confiture.'' It is really just braised corn. But what a
pretty pretension. &QL;

 &HT;    Russian immigrant clinging to life after Atlanta shootingBy
Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nine years ago, taxi cab driver Yuzef Liberzon and his
wife, Galina, left their native Russia to come to Atlanta to seek a
better life. Until recently, the 39-year-old spent long hours as a
day trader in the hopes of making more money through less dangerous
work.
</P>
<P>
   But that all changed last Thursday. Liberzon was shot twice in
the head; one of the 13 wounded whose dreams were shattered by Mark
Barton. Since the shooting, Liberzon has been in critical condition
and on life support, said Alex Bershadsky, a close family friend.
Doctors are expected to examine Liberzon today to see whether there
is any sign of brain activity. If not, the family will face the
difficult decision of whether to continue life support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all so upset about this,'' Bershadsky said Tuesday.
``He was such a hard worker. He had worked to come here, he had
worked to pay for his mother to come here. He had worked to try and
make a family. And then this happens. It is just so terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberzon, who is Jewish, came here to escape religious
persecution, Bershadsky said. Although his wife is Christian, life
was not easy for them while they lived in Kiev. ``To be a Jew in
Russia _ how should I say it? _ is a difficult thing,'' said
Bershadsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberzons were assigned to Atlanta by the U.S. consulate,
but grew to love the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``They liked the people. The people are nice to you. They will
listen and be patient,'' Bershadsky said. ``In some European
countries, you simply ask for directions to find a street and they
turn away from you. That's not true here. People are friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple bought a condominium, and planted a small flower
garden. Liberzon drove a cab. His wife got a job doing facials at
Spa Sydell. ``They love each other very much,'' Bershadsky said.
``(Since he's been shot) she's crying all the time. She doesn't
want to talk to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Liberzon _ an only child _ saved the money to
bring his mother to Atlanta, paying for the plane tickets and the
immigration costs himself. ``Usually, you get a sponsor,'' said
Bershadsky. ``But he paid everything up front.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple also hoped to have a child, with Liberzon working to
save money toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   On the day he was shot, Liberzon was showing a friend how to be
a day trader, Bershadsky said. Moments after Mark Barton entered
the office, Liberzon had been shot twice.
</P>
<P>
   Liberzon fell on top of another day trader, who was uninjured.
``We don't know whether he intended that or not,'' Bershadsky said,
``but he ended up saving someone else's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberzon's wife learned about the shooting from a friend and
fellow spa employee, who called her at work. A co-worker then drove
her to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a sweetheart,'' said Richard Harris, Spa Sydell's
president and CEO. ``We were all stunned. She's always been one of
our best employees. We are so saddened that this has happened to
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Spa Sydell has offered to match any donations made by its 300
employees to the family, he said. The company also offers health
insurance to its employees, he said. However, it was unclear on
Tuesday whether Liberzon's medical bills are covered.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting is also distressing for family and friends because
they are worried about the fate of Liberzon's mother, Maya. She has
applied for, but not yet established, residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is almost 65 years old and speaks no English and has no
papers,'' Bershadsky said. ``Who is going to hire her?''
</P>
<P>
   The Tucker Federal Bank has established the Yuzef Liberzon
Family Fund to help defray the cost of the family's medical bills.
The account number is 0001153915. The address is 2355 Main St.,
Tucker, Ga., 30084.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of a searing heat wave, Mondays high temperature at
Goodland, Kan., was only 68 degrees, a record low high temperature
for the date. The daytime chill was fostered by clouds, light rain
and drizzle from low clouds trapped under a warm ridge of high
pressure several thousand feet above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, daytime coolness will prevail across parts of the
western high plains and the Front Range of the central Rockies as
weak, moist winds from the southeast rise up the sloping terrain.
Temperatures could stay in the upper 60s in parts of eastern
Wyoming, eastern Colorado and western Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms will again erupt in the
afternoon across parts of Arizona and New Mexico as a northward
flow of tropical moisture several thousand feet aloft combines with
the uneven heating of mountains and valleys to promote rising
currents of moist air.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, widely separated thunderstorms will develop across
parts of eastern Oregon and Washington as very warm air near the
ground rises and accelerates through a high-altitude pool of cool
air arriving from the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated to widely separated showers and thunderstorms will
develop across the Ohio Valley, eastern Great Lakes and northwest
New England in response to upper-level cooling in advance of a jet
stream disturbance swinging southeast from upper Michigan.
Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms will escort a cool
front associated with the disturbance across the western Great
Lakes and northern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Florida Records
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, the temperature at Miami rose to 96
degrees, a record reading for the fifth day in a row. Meanwhile the
mercury fell to 70 degrees at stormy Hollywood, tying the record
low for the date. During summer, record lows in steamy Florida and
the sultry Gulf Coast are commonly set in the daytime, when
rain-cooled air from thunderstorms causes the mercury to lower
toward record levels. Dry air drawn into downdrafts within
thunderstorms can enhance daytime cooling through evaporation.
After sunset, the risk of storms fades, leaving sultry, warm air to
stay most nights.

QUAYLE TOUTS FOREIGN-POLICY CREDENTIALS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Vice President Dan Quayle on Tuesday touted
his credentials to be president and questioned whether Texas Gov.
George W. Bush was ready to move into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we need another president who has inexperience
when it comes to foreign policy,'' said Quayle, speaking at
National Press Club luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Bush's consultations in Austin, Texas, last spring
with foreign and domestic policy experts, Quayle said, ``There's
only so much you can get from briefings and briefers and crash
courses when it comes to foreign policy. But I can just tell you,
from my point of view, I'll be ready on day one.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle also took aim again at Bush's ``compassionate
conservative'' refrain and the governor's reluctance to flesh out
his positions on issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here not to just say, ''I care,`` but more importantly
what I will do,.'' Quayle said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his experience in Congress and the presidential
administration of Bush's father, Quayle has been unable to
completely shed the image of the gaffe-prone politician and policy
lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   Most surveys show him heavily trailing Bush as well as the other
Republican contenders. His campaign has also struggled to raise
money and win endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   But appearing relaxed and confident, the former senator from
Indiana outlined what he called his ``Raising a Nation'' campaign
agenda, which included using the White House as a bully pulpit to
change the current culture, which he _ like Bush _ blames on the
self-indulgent attitudes of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In his most caustic dig at the current administration, Quayle
said that it ``seems that the Clinton-Gore administration started
out as the Woodstock of 1969. Big hope. Great expectations.
Promises of harmony and understanding. But it ended like the
Woodstock of 1999: trashing standards, trashing ideals, trashing
institutions like the White House, which are not theirs to trash.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle also advocated 30 percent across-the-board tax cuts, and
proposed that students be expelled the first time they bring a gun
to school, that members of Congress be subject to term limits, and
that patients be allowed to choose their own physicians.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, he said the United States should not
interfere in civil wars abroad or serve as peacekeepers around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a 911 global operator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle broke with some in his party by advocating more
engagement with China, arguing that he viewed the Asian power as
``a huge opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The former president also talked about his personal ties with
mainland China because of the recent wedding in Shanghai of his
25-year old son Tucker to a Chinese woman.
</P>
<P>
   Although Quayle has appealed to social conservatives, he shied
away from many of their issues in the National Press Club address.
The subject of abortion only came up when he was asked about Bush's
statement that he would not use it as litmus test in appointing
judges.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said he would appoint judges that ``have an understanding
and appreciation for morality and religion in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question about hiring gays and lesbians, Quayle
said, ``I don't ask people their sexual orientation when I
interview them.'' However, Quayle said he was against gay
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said he was not relying on a strong showing in a
Republican straw poll in Iowa later this month to give his
lackluster campaign a much-needed boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't read too much into it,'' he said of the Aug. 14
event in Ames, Iowa. ``It is a political event. Maybe if there's
not a lot of other news going on that day, it will be a two- or
three-day story.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Quayle cited the event to draw a comparison between his
economy campaign and Bush's lavish efforts to draw supporters to
the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come to our tent if you want to,'' he said. ``We'll give you a
hamburger, a hot dog, soda pop. Some of them will be serving
steaks. If you want steaks go over and get a steak from somebody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``If you vote, vote for me and not the guy who's
serving steak.''
</P>
<P>
   It was apparently a jab at Bush, who spent $43,000 on his booth
at the straw poll. The next most expensive booth was about $8,000,
paid for by multimillionaire publisher Steve Forbes.

GOVERNMENT TO PAY $16 MILLION FOR ZAPRUDER FILM OF JFK
ASSASSINATION 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DALLAS _ Visiting Dealey Plaza for the first time Tuesday, Roger
Clark of Teague, Texas, paused near the concrete abutment beside
the grassy knoll where nearly 36 years ago an immigrant Russian
dressmaker named Abraham Zapruder turned on his 8 mm Bell &AMP; Howell
movie camera and exposed to the November sunlight the most
important piece of celluloid in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Valuable, yes, but worth $16 million?
</P>
<P>
   Clark thought for a moment and then uttered a thought similar to
those offered by other tourists who were visiting the place where
President John F. Kennedy was shot Nov. 22, 1963: ``Aw, man, I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the value placed on the 26-second strip of film earlier
in the day by a three-member arbitration panel that had been
appointed to resolve a two-year dispute between Zapruder's heirs
and the federal government. Since last summer, the film has been
stored in a 25-degree room at the National Archives.
</P>
<P>
   Required by law to make just compensation to the family for the
film, the government offered $1 million. Zapruder's heirs _
daughter Myrna Ries of Dallas and son Henry Zapruder of Chevy
Chase, Md. _ had asked for $30 million. To avoid lengthy
litigation, the parties agreed to arbitration and a decision that
cannot be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision by the arbitration panel secures the original
Zapruder film for the public and guarantees that it will be
preserved in the National Archives, where it belongs,'' said David
W. Ogden, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released through their Washington, D.C.,
attorney, Robert S. Bennett, the Zapruder family said, ``We are
relieved that the Zapruder film is now permanently part of the
United States Archives. We are proud of our record of balance and
cooperation which created the opportunity to resolve the issue of
compensation amicably. We believe the result is fair and
reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the arbitration proceeding did not deal with copyright
ownership, the family remains entitled to compensation for
commercial use of the film. However, the statement said, ``We are
actively pursuing arrangement for transferring ownership of the
copyright to a public institution which could continue our policies
of proper caretaking on a permanent basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Future transfer of the copyright did not resolve the controversy
over the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's outrageous,'' said Jim Lesar, president of the
Assassination Archives and Research Center, a private collection of
assassination documents. ``It's not the ownership of the film
that's the problem, its the copyright.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Zapruder family charges high rates to reproduce the
film for documentaries and it is not certain that transferring the
copyright to a public institution will lower those charges.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others with historical links to the Zapruder film do not
quibble with the monetary value set by the arbitration panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no more a historic piece of film than that,'' said
author and retired Southern Methodist University professor Darwin
Payne, who was the first reporter to track down Zapruder after the
assassination. ``How do you determine its value?''
</P>
<P>
   Payne, then a reporter for the Dallas Times Herald, ran to
Dealey Plaza just moments after shots were fired at Kennedy's
motorcade. While interviewing witnesses, he was told by one woman,
``My boss took a movie of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He ran to Zapruder's nearby office and found the dressmaker
shaken and in tears. On a television set in the office, a reporter
was saying that Kennedy had been shot and was rushed to Parkland
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's dead, I know he's dead,'' Zapruder sobbed to Payne. ``I
saw his head explode.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie camera was sitting on top of a file cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get him to let me take it to the Times Herald,''
Payne said. ``But he wanted to turn it over to the Secret Service
or the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, news agencies were negotiating for rights to the
film and Zapruder sold it to Life Magazine for $150,000. The
magazine printed images from the film but there was no public
showing of the footage until 1969, when New Orleans District
Attorney Jim Garrison used it in his unsuccessful prosecution of
Clay Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Life sold the film back to the Zapruder family for $1.
</P>
<P>
   The Assassination Records Review Board declared in 1997 the film
to be a permanent possession of the United States, setting off the
debate over value.
</P>
<P>
   The decision for the government to now pay $16 million for the
original celluloid was reached on a 2-1 vote by the arbitration
panel after listening to expert appraisers argue values ranging
from $1 to $25 million.

<P>
   For the first half of the decade since the Cold War's end, the
atmosphere in the U.N. Security Council was decidedly improved.
With less East-West divisiveness, the council met more frequently
and did more business.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven vetoes were cast in the post-Cold War period vs. 240
in the first 45 years of U.N. life. Twenty peacekeeping operations
were mandated, more than the total for all the preceding years.
</P>
<P>
   But then the initial optimism about the council's ability to get
its job done in a vetoless world turned sour. Over the past 12
months, it has been particularly dismaying as the council has been
bypassed, defied and abused.
</P>
<P>
   The council was bypassed when NATO began military action against
Slobodan Milosevic's Yugoslavia without first seeking Security
Council approval. Indeed, the NATO countries knew their action
would be vetoed by Russia and China. The significance of NATO's
slight was not diminished by its agreement, after the conflict,
with Russia to seek Security Council endorsement and U.N.
participation in the policing and administration of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In another example, Saddam Hussein defied the Security Council;
he assessed correctly that he could get away with disobeying its
disarmament resolutions thanks to a combination of influential
friends there, a general loss of will within the body and a
sympathetic secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   During the past eight years, many but not all of Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction have been eliminated. Disarmament tasks remain
to be completed, however, and monitoring and verification systems
need to be secured to ensure that Saddam does not reconstitute his
illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Security Council has been unable to reach a decision
that would restore, even in a modified way, the implementation of
its own law. Indeed, some members _ including, incredibly, Canada,
a nonpermanent council member _ have sought to lower the standard
of Iraqi compliance.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been abuse of council procedures. China prevented
minor peacekeeping operations from proceeding in Guatemala and
Macedonia and threatened to do the same in Haiti, merely because
those countries had dealt with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Although vetoes driven by national interest, more than any sense
of collective responsibility, were common during the Cold War, they
have been less so since, with nothing that was comparable to these
Chinese vetoes, delivered and threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council's ability to function as the guardian of
international peace and security has been thrown into question by
such incidents. In all these cases, permanent members have weighted
their narrow national interests over collective responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Security Council is not working adequately. To fix
it, two key areas must be addressed urgently.
</P>
<P>
   First is the veto, which has been abused by permanent members in
defense of their interests, client states and ideological concerns
_ subjects which very often had nothing to do with maintaining
international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it is accepted, for argument's sake, that the profligate
use of the veto during the bitter contest of the Cold War might
have forestalled its worst consequence _ nuclear holocaust _ still,
in the current context, the raw exercise of veto power is no longer
appropriate, much less necessary. Today's world is more
interdependent and, if threatened, it is by weapons proliferation,
not superpower rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   The veto issue is a vexed one. Clearly, the major powers will
not give up their veto power voluntarily, and the U.N. charter
allows them to block any proposal that would remove the power to
exercise a veto.
</P>
<P>
   The question thus becomes whether the major powers can
voluntarily agree to a more constructive interpretation of the
nature of the veto and the uses to which it may legitimately be
put.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States, the undisputed lone superpower, indicated
a willingness to discipline its own use of the veto, it could then
ask other permanent members to do the same. Certainly, in the
absence of an American concession, nothing will change. If others
will not agree, then nor should the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Only if there is success in reforming the use of veto power can
the Security Council be rescued from its present breakdown. An
American initiative, however, would also have another advantage: It
would temper the growing anxiety in the international community
about the policies of its one superpower and America's position in
the unipolar world. A move by the United States to effectively
share authority would speak volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Arms control is the second area that requires urgent attention.
Thirty years ago, the international community began a process of
drawing up treaties on the nonproliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, starting with nuclear, and then working through
biological, chemical and missile technologies. One of the key
questions that inevitably arose was who would enforce such
treaties, especially in the event of a detected breach.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the answer given _ sometimes in writing within a
particular treaty, but certainly in political terms _ was the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The council is the custodian of nonproliferation. It has the
task of providing confidence to the international community that
the tapestry of treaties designed to ensure that weapons of mass
destruction do not spread is enforced and kept whole. There is
simply no other body that can do this job, and this is widely
understood.
</P>
<P>
   But how does the council's decision-making process, including
the use of the veto, square with its obligation to enforce the
nonproliferation treaties?
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: North Korea clandestinely continues to develop
nuclear weapons in contravention of its obligations under the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Because of Chinese, and to
some extent Russian, interests, the Security Council has responded
inadequately. The attempted solution to the problem was agreed on
largely outside the council, and is not proving viable.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq represents an even more profound failure. Saddam Hussein
has broken all of Iraq's nonproliferation undertakings. He has lied
to the United Nations' weapons inspectors. Data indicate that he
continues to conceal illegal weapons of mass destruction.
Unquestionably, he retains the capacity to make them.
</P>
<P>
   These facts are known in the Security Council, including by
those permanent members who have given Saddam strong support.
Russia, Iraq's strongest backer in the council, is fully aware of
Iraq's weapon status, not least because the Soviet Union was
Saddam's major supplier of arms and the means to manufacture them.
</P>
<P>
   The authority of the council is deeply challenged when objective
cases of treaty violation such as these end up being judged on a
narrow, subjective political basis by veto-wielding permanent
members.
</P>
<P>
   Were this to become the council's standard way of dealing with
weapons proliferation, it would amount to a profound and, I
suspect, mortal failure.
</P>
<P>
   If the permanent members could make reforms in the areas of arms
control and veto power, it might help the Security Council get over
its ``annus horribilis'' _ as well as serve the interests of the
international community in the 21st century.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GOMA, Congo _ The search for peace in Congo depends on disarming
the very men who attacked a young woman named Alima Asami last
Friday. Her scalp looks like a baseball coming unseamed, with brown
stitches holding together three slices from a machete. Two fingers
on her right hand, and one on her left, were hacked off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I was a woman and had a baby I could not escape,'' she
said, sitting on a hospital bed here.
</P>
<P>
   The men demanded money. Three of them raped her, she said. They
killed her little girl, Shakuru, who was 4, along with 22 other
people on their way to a market not far from here. Ms. Asami had
gone to the market to buy beans.
</P>
<P>
   She said the attackers spoke the language of neighboring Rwanda,
identifying them as former soldiers or militiamen from the Hutu
ethnic group, who killed at least 500,000 ethnic Tutsis in Rwanda
in 1994 then fled into the forests of Congo to launch raids back on
their home country.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have become the key element in the cease-fire plan to
end the war in Congo but an unpredictable one that, many experts on
Africa say, represents the biggest threat to peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the wild card at this point,'' said Hannelie de Beer,
senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Studies in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The peace accord, drafted in mid-July, optimistically calls for
the warring parties in Congo to disarm these groups, some of the
most violent guerrillas fighting in some of the world's harshest
terrain. The United Nations has pledged peacekeepers in the region,
but almost no one believes their mandate will include the dangerous
job of disarming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very difficult to disarm them, if not impossible,''
Ms. de Beer said. ``If you disarm them, what are you going to
promise them? How are they going to fit in?''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many problems, Ms. de Beer and other experts say, is
that given the groups' status as international outlaws, there was
no way to provide incentives in the cease-fire for them to stop
their war against the Tutsi-led government of Rwanda. Rwanda, in
fact, wants to bring the leaders back to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps paradoxically, the guerrillas _ known here as the
interahamwe _ may be even more potent now than they were a year
ago, when the most recent war in Congo broke out. The reason is
that the president of Congo, Laurent Kabila, recruited thousands of
Hutu guerrillas against the rebels fighting him, giving them arms
and military training.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has undoubtedly strengthened them, in terms of equipment
and training,'' a Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan government officials say that Zimbabwe, one of Kabila's
allies in the Congo war, has also provided training and arms,
making it unlikely they will now disarm them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Zimbabwe is committed, this is going to be a very easy
process,'' said Emmanuel Ndahiro, a top defense official in Rwanda.
But, he said: ``Zimbabwe has already indicated that it is not
obliged. If people think signing an agreement is enough, that's a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe is one of six nations with troops in Congo that signed
the cease-fire agreement, along with Rwanda, Uganda, Angola,
Namibia and Congo itself. The cease-fire agreement _ despite
Ndahiro's accusations _ obliges each country to track down members
of the interahamwe as well as members of other rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the cease-fire has not gone into effect because rebel groups
are still deciding whether to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Hutu soldiers in the Rwandan Army, they fled across
the border into Congo as the 1994 war ended. But they continued
attacks into Rwanda. That prompted the new Tutsi-led government of
Rwanda to back the rebellion in 1996 against a powerful ally of the
Hutu, Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator of the nation then known as
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle of bloodshed and revenge wore on, and the rebels, led
by Kabila, along with Rwandans, were accused of massacring Hutus
inside Congo during that war.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kabila, the border attacks continued. A year ago, Rwanda
covertly supported a second rebellion, this time aimed at
overthrowing Kabila, who by then had made his own alliance with the
Hutu guerrillas. But Rwanda said its interest was only to stop the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that is accomplished, our role in Congo will be
significantly diminished,'' Ndahiro said. ``We need Congo as a
state, not as a situation of anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of Hutu guerrillas and former Rwandan
Army soldiers in Congo vary widely, ranging from 5,000 to 25,000.
Rwanda says several hundred have been trained in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Few experts doubt that they have fought around Congo against the
rebels trying to overthrow Kabila. Maj. Gen. Augustin Bizimungu,
the Hutu defense chief at the time of the genocide, is reported to
be the commander of Hutu troops in the diamond-rich city of
Mbuji-Mayi, a key target for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Rwanda say that there can be no real solution to the
interahamwe until the Rwandan government greatly expands power
sharing with the Hutu majority. The United States also comes under
heavy criticism in the region _ and much suspicion in Congo itself
_ for its close friendship with the Rwandan government.
</P>
<P>
   These critics say that by setting the second rebellion into
motion, Rwanda strengthened the interahamwe not just militarily but
in popular support and organization.
</P>
<P>
   Many Congolese are convinced that Rwanda wants to annex eastern
Congo, and that has created the sense that the Hutu guerrillas
``are a resistance force, that they are trying to stop the
expansion of this empire,'' said one aid official with long
experience in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``These forces in the field don't represent very much,'' said
the official. ``But the question we should be asking ourselves is:
Has this war allowed these extremist forces to develop a political
structure, if not an ideology?''

 GOMA, Congo: an ideology.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is recent evidence that the Hutu guerrillas may be simply
too violent to sustain that support _ a development that may help
the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said local Congolese fighters known as the Mayi
Mayi _ allies of the Hutu guerrillas because of their shared hatred
for Tutsis _ may be now distancing themselves. This would be a
problem for the guerrillas because they have depended on the Mayi
Mayi to forge goodwill with local Congolese who provide money and
food.
</P>
<P>
   That perception was supported by a man from the city of Bukavu,
in eastern Congo, who sought out reporters recently saying that he
spoke on behalf of Mayi Mayi groups looking for greater legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   The man, a local politician who asked to be identified by part
of his name, Mukange, said that the guerrillas' philosophy seemed
to be, ``You meet somebody and you kill them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mayi Mayi didn't want to be like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The aid official said he believed that, far more effective than
disarming the guerrillas, the international community should send
more money to eastern Congo. The money could rebuild roads or
markets _ projects to pull local people away from war and, thus,
the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   In the hospital here, just outside the ward where Ms. Asami lay,
a man on crutches named Bagenga Sanvula, 22, needed no convincing.
Five months ago, a group of 15 guerrillas attacked a car he was
driving in with his two brothers, he said. They asked for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any,'' Sanvula said. ``They said, `Since you
don't have any money, we are going to kill you.' Then they shot.''
</P>
<P>
   His two brothers were killed. He survived with a bullet in his
left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must go back to Rwanda,'' Sanvula said, ``and let peace
happen here.''

THE LATEST HOT TRAVEL SPOTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BOB MORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Often a search for the unexpected turns out to be a trip down
the road more traveled. Over the last 30 years tourists have
stormed the Great Wall and the Berlin Wall. They've rediscovered
South Beach and Vietnam, worn Patagonia in Patagonia and become so
excited about nature that environmentalists fear that they are
loving it to death. Call it eek-o tourism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like the latest fashionable color or restaurant, travel hot
spots tend to cool off around the time they stop eliciting
excitement at dinner parties. For the competitive traveler, just as
the Gucci stiletto or the color brown is now deemed over, so is
Prague. The status trip to book in the months ahead is to Bhutan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may be true that the adventurously noble Robert Louis
Stevenson traveled ``not to go anywhere, but to go.''
Status-conscious travelers don't go only to get away from the world
as they know it but also to hold court when they return. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a guide to a dozen hot spots of the last few
decades. You should be able to dine out on the most recent ones for
at least the next couple of months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHINA Far and forbidden, China was the place to go for its story
value for many years. The country first opened its doors to
American journalists (and Richard Nixon) in the early 1970s. As
travel restrictions lessened in the early 1980s, the Great Leap
Forward seemed to describe not Mao's economic program but rather
the surge of American tourists rushing to touch the Great Wall and
taste the food, which by most accounts was never as good as the
food at the Empire Szechuan on the Upper West Side in Manhattan.
Even Tiananmen Square, which momentarily cooled travel to China
after the events of the summer of 1989, has once more become a
tourist attraction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE GALAPAGOS Darwin started it. When the original eco-tourist
visited the Galapagos in 1835 prior to writing ``The Origin of
Species,'' the one species on these isolated islands off Ecuador
that wasn't much in evidence was Homo sapiens. In more recent
years, visitors have gone from a handful in the 1960s to nearly
100,000 today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH BEACH, FLA. In 1984, ``Miami Vice'' started giving this
Art Deco zone its first resuscitation. It glamorized the city as a
kind of American Marseilles _ making it look even more exotic,
dangerous, pastel-painted and fabulous (in a seedy kind of way)
than it actually was. Life followed art. Then came the stylists.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '90s, South Beach was, as one observer noted, ``up
to its Ray-Bans in espresso.'' These days, even with a celebrity
murder, overdevelopment and an almost-hostile takeover by fashion
people, it is still the most convenient tropical getaway for
knowing New Yorkers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PATAGONIA Which came first _ the book or the clothes? The
clothes. They were introduced by a Montana-based company in 1974 to
evoke ``romantic visions of glaciers tumbling into fjords, jagged
windswept peaks, gauchos and condors.'' It wasn't until Bruce
Chatwin published the esteemed ``In Patagonia'' in 1988 that this
pristine tip of Argentina got to be a hot spot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ted Turner, the Benettons, George Soros and Joe Lewis of
the Hard Rock Cafe have property there. There goes the
neighborhood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BERLIN For over 25 years, West Berlin was an isolated island of
alternative capitalism in Eastern Europe. Expatriates and citizens
enjoyed the elan and advantages (from legal squatting to freedom
from the draft) of living in a quasi-burned-out city with a history
of bohemianism. East Berlin, meanwhile, was a shadowy neighbor with
bad food, good prices, the Pergamon Altar and the Berliner Ensemble
theater _ all for day trips only.
</P>
<P>
   Then, kaboom. In 1989, the remains of the wall became the new
mecca for Western tourists. A year later, Club Med was leading its
first Eastern European tour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MOSCOW It was once chic because it was somewhat transgressive to
visit. A brief golden moment of post-Communist tourism _ from the
summer of 1989 to the summer of 1990 _ was quickly eclipsed as
Gorbachev's reforms began to sour. Since then (after facing delayed
flights, crime, inflated prices, and disgruntled citizens) tourists
have not been returning from Russia with love.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   PRAGUE Along with its reborn capitalism, crooked lanes, copper
domes and Gothic towers, Prague's original appeal to its first,
post-1989 wave of hip young visitors was Kafka, the shabbiness of
its almost artful neglect, and the newly installed
playwright-turned-president, Vaclav Havel, who likes Frank Zappa
and Lou Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Soon however, Prague started sprucing itself up for the masses.
Now all the touristic conveniences _ neon-lighted money exchange
shops, overcharging cabdrivers _ undercut the feeling of visiting a
poetic and shadowy place.
</P>
<P>
   SAVANNAH What ``Miami Vice'' did for Miami, ``Midnight in the
Garden of Good and Evil'' did for Savannah. It took John Berendt's
1994 chronicle about a voodoo priestess, con men, drag queen and
gay murder to draw attention to Georgia's pleasant city of gardens,
history and old-school charm. Since its publication, tourism has
soared by nearly 50 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM War tourism was the big attraction for those who first
visited Vietnam after 1994, when President Clinton lifted the
American trade embargo. But since this is the first time in 1,000
years that the Vietnamese have welcomed foreign invaders, the
country is struggling to keep up with the hordes.
</P>
<P>
   It will be helped, no doubt, by all the hotel chains that are
developing properties. There's even a Hilton Hanoi Opera Hotel.
It's a few blocks away from the Hanoi Hilton, as American soldiers
nicknamed the prison where POWs were held during the war. Now
what's left is a museum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN Since the election of Nelson Mandela and the end of
apartheid, this naturally beautiful city's appeal has soared (after
a dip last year when a bomb went off in a Planet Hollywood). Mark
Thatcher, son of Britain's former prime minister, bought a house.
So did the ninth Earl Spencer, brother of the Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jackson looked for property and Naomi Campbell and Kate
Moss went to model Versace and pay a visit to Mandela. This South
Beach, seriously far from New York, has mountains, vineyards and
two oceans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BHUTAN Tibet is Chinese. Sikkim is Indian. And Shangri La
doesn't exist. There is, however, Bhutan, the last independent
Buddhist kingdom of the Himalayas. It has no national TV station.
It has no traffic lights, even in its capital city, Thimpu. But it
has lots of natural beauty and native culture preserved by a king
who wants to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Since tourism opened in 1974, the number of visitors has been
limited to around 6,000 a year, but recently, even though it's very
expensive to visit, interest is growing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANTARCTICA The first group of tourists to visit the South Pole
arrived in 1988. Today the 800-mile-long Antarctic Peninsula, which
is without vegetation or culture, and where the average temperature
in the warmest months hovers around freezing, attracts about 11,000
tourists a year.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have, ostensibly, gone to escape the grip of
civilization, most of them are getting off cruise ships into
Zodiacs in groups, one after the other, day after day, to look at
the same penguins, seals and birds. Environmentalists are
expressing worry about all this foot traffic. The animals, as far
as anyone can tell, are not.

BILBAO'S CINDERELLA STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., August 8)  
(jt) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILBAO, Spain _ Bilbao was once full of stay-away perils for the
traveler. Its mood was melancholy, its skies gray, its buildings
grimy and its air foul from the blast furnaces along a stinking
river that trafficked in floating objects. The gloom was deepened
by the continual rain of what is statistically one of the dampest
cities in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Today the only danger is dodging the aggressive street-sweeping
machines that come humming and swishing around the corners of the
spruced up old town with its narrow streets and bay-windowed
townhouses. Shiny green and white sausage-shaped vehicles with
exclamatory clean-up messages scripted on their sides, they
symbolize the efforts the local people have made to turn their
onetime eyesore of a city into a tourist attraction rivaling the
more customary Spanish destinations like Madrid, Barcelona, Toledo
and the Andalusian triumvirate of Cordoba, Granada and Seville.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing too, because people are coming in hordes to
Bilbao, drawn by the world's most celebrated new building, the
Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. It is not surprising anymore to see the
standard European tour of London, Paris and Rome include a detour
to this city on the Nervion River near Spain's northern coast that
has triumphantly shed its post-industrial smudge of soot.
</P>
<P>
   More aware of Bilbao's old off-putting reputation than its new
alluring one, my wife, stepdaughter, teen-aged son and I added on a
side trip to San Sebastian an hour along the coast as an
enhancement to a weekend in the old Basque port. But we needn't
have.
</P>
<P>
   Museums and galleries have become the secular churches and
cathedrals of the late 20th century, and Bilbao today demonstrates
the exhilarating truth that one of them, grandly conceived and
combined with some ambitious urban planning, can restore a city's
soul.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sight in Europe more esthetically stimulating these
days than the Guggenheim Museum that opened here in October 1997,
and not even the choruses of praise that the building has received
can fully prepare you for the rush you feel at your own personal
encounter with it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sight that makes people point, motion to their friends,
utter ``wow'' sounds in all the languages that make up Bilbao's
newly international street talk. It looms outsized at the end of a
street of unremarkable masonry, a shimmering object that looks as
if it just landed there after a trip from its own planet. With Jeff
Koons' welcoming flower-bedecked ``Puppy'' standing benignly at its
entrance, this is a friendly extraterrestrial that beckons you
forward and puts an added skip in your approach.
</P>
<P>
   From first glance to last lingering look, the building fulfills
the promise that is bringing throngs to Bilbao. But what is less
expected is the pleasure in store for your freshly educated eye
once you've seen the museum and ventured out into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Bilbao's architects apparently didn't feel bound by the spirit
of northern reserve that characterizes the rest of the city. A hint
of the fanciful piles that crop up around the city is just four
blocks away at the Plaza Moyua. It's the 19th-century Subdelegacion
de Gobierno, a rococo concoction of red and black walls, turreted
towers and fanciful facade ornamentation that looks as brash and
self-indulgent next to the neighboring conventional office blocks
as a dandy at a church social.
</P>
<P>
   If you consider the behavior of pedestrians a telling measure of
a city's personality, you will know what kind of place Bilbao is
bythe clutches of people at every corner waiting patiently for the
light to change before they take a step forward.
</P>
<P>
   The residents drop this sense of civic obedience, incidentally,
when they get behind the wheel. I saw several instances of cars
sounding their horns angrily after barely missing a passer-by as if
to say, ``You won't be so lucky next time.'' Another tip on walking
around Bilbao: Check out the sidewalks from time to time. There are
lots of dogs.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the Guggenheim puts you in mind of walking. It is a
building that you don't just visit but inhabit, marveling at its
pillowy white interior spaces and then circling around outside to
take in the play between its undulating worked titanium shell and
the changing daylight. Chances are you'll wander back in the
evening to see it then too.
</P>
<P>
   Even away from the museum, walking is a pastime full of rewards
in Bilbao, and the broad leafy boulevard that dissects the city,
the Gran Via de Don Diego Lopez de Haro a good place to start
collecting them. Flanked by statues at either end, the avenue is a
busy commercial thoroughfare with brawny monumental buildings like
the Edificio de Sota and the Palacio Foral and the whimsical
Subdelegacion along the way.
</P>
<P>
   We strolled it our first night in successful pursuit of that
just-arrived desire to fix the sense of place where you are. The
grandeur of the street told us we were in a Continental city, and
our destination, the Cafe Iruna two blocks off the boulevard, was
to set us firmly in the Basque Country.
</P>
<P>
   Hearty talk and laughter poured out of the tapas bars and cafes
along the side streets leading to the Plaza San Vicente and the
Iruna. A nymph with water pouring out of an amphora in her hands
stands quiet sentinel over the little park while an animated group
crowds around the bar of the Iruna drinking draft beer and the tart
local Txakoli aperitif wine.
</P>
<P>
   The night we were there, a stirring ensemble of dancers from the
south were stamping out their flamenco tattoos on the small wooden
stage to a wildly appreciative crowd of locals. Diners sat around
tables at the base of the stage or off in curtained alcoves on a
mezzanine level. Built in 1903, the cafe has a hint of fin de
siecle decadence with walls and pillars covered in decorative
tiles, a coffered ceiling of stucco panels and wooden fans lazily
ruffling the smoky air.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On hearing our accented Spanish, the manager Jose Maria Gomez
Valle laid out a tasting menu's selection of local hams and cheeses
that upheld the Basque boast of being Spain's most revered food
region _ a reputation enhanced by the city's several restaurants
with Michelin stars. In snatches of conversation squeezed into the
brief silences between the clattering heels of the dancers, Gomez
Valle said that he had many more visitors these days than he had
before the museum was built and that many of them were Spaniards
who until recently had considered Bilbao best avoided.
</P>
<P>
   During our weekend visit, we remarked on the happy fact that so
much of the tourist onslaught was Spanish and didn't therefore
alter the character of the place the way a crush of foreigners
might.
</P>
<P>
   Midway along the Gran Via, at the Plaza Moyua, we came upon
slinky glass and steel-ribbed constructions that looked like
caterpillars burrowing into the pavement. They house the escalator
entrances to the sleek new subway designed by Sir Norman Foster,
the newly ennobled British architect who is the 1999 winner of the
Pritzker Architecture Prize, widely viewed as the most prestigious
in the field. Residents fondly call these additions to Bilbao's
landscape ``Fosteritos.'' The stations are attractions in
themselves, brightly lighted tubes with spare high-tech platforms
and staircases hung in space like javelins frozen in flight. It is
design that embodies motion.
</P>
<P>
   A great part of the success of Bilbao's planned renaissance is
owed to the bold decision by the city's leaders to go after
world-class architects like Lord Foster and Frank Gehry, the
American creator of the new Guggenheim Museum.
</P>
<P>
   They have been aided in altering Bilbao's onetime reputation for
periodic violence and public unrest by the unilateral ceasefire
called last year by the Basque guerrilla group ETA. Even the old
revolutionary graffiti has been washed away in the rise of civic
pride.
</P>
<P>
   A two-stop metro ride took us to the Casco Viejo, the old town
with an area known as Siete Calles for seven crisscrossing streets
that present an irresistible invitation to go exploring.
Generations of artisans busied themselves creating the flourishes
and designs that adorn the churches and monuments and townhouses
along the shadowy streets of the Casco Viejo.
</P>
<P>
   Trestlework lanterns hang from balcony corners, and second-story
bowed windows, paneled in dark wood and covered by lace curtains
that inevitably suggest mysteries within, hang out over the
ground-floor level, almost nudging their counterparts from the
other side of the street. Look up and you'll see an abundant
collection of facade ornaments, weathervanes, scrolls, wreaths,
coats of arms, emblems and ovals inscribed with the names of famous
writers and artists who once lived in these houses.
</P>
<P>
   Where the alleys spill out into open squares or onto the
riverfront, edifices ranging from grand to gaudy await. The Teatro
Arriaga and the Ayuntamiento, a government building, would be
comfortable in a Paris square, the tilework Abando train station in
a carnival arcade. The churches are austere, dark and reverentially
quiet. Many of the passageways along the river are colonnaded,
framing fleeting figures darting about in the shadows on what are
probably mundane daily errands, but who's to know.
</P>
<P>
   Life in the old city revolves around the Plaza Nueva, an airy
square ringed by fine apartments with well-tended flower boxes in
their windows. There is no statuary in the square, only a broad
central space and lengthy arched walkways that on Sunday mornings
teem with men in the V-necked sweaters, woolen jackets and floppy
black berets favored in the Basque country, milling about the
hundreds of stands set up in front of the cafes that ring the
square. This is a traditional part of Spain, and there are very few
women about.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of goods is typical of outdoor markets, but the
content is different from that found along the Mediterranean coast
of Spain. The harsh Atlantic climate governs here, and the things
on offer are for people who stay inside. There are old books,
magazines, collector's trinkets and pendants and pins, recordings
and tapes, movie posters, stamps, coins, stones, rocks, goldfish,
hamsters, pet turtles and religious objects.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular gathering places, the Cafe Bilbao, has
dates on its storefront that touch on the city's descent and
rebirth. ``Fundado 1911'' it says. ``Rehabilitado 1992.'' The
waiter who served us had pigeons flapping about his legs as he
brought us our sandwiches and Txakoli. Moments later cascading
church bells sounded, and the birds swept up from the floor of the
square and scattered away over the rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   A lone flutist played in one corner, a raucous thrown-together
band of fiddle, clarinet, trumpet and accordion in another. More
gentle music trilled on the side where hundreds of cages of
canaries and parakeets and parrots were hung out for shoppers'
inspection. Later that morning we went to the Plaza San Vicente to
watch a staged competition held twice a year in Bilbao _ a songbird
contest.
</P>
<P>
   As the match began, the birds' handlers spoke soothingly to
their feathered charges at the edge of the grass and then hung the
individual cages on numbered stakes, retreating prayerfully to the
margins. Earnest men with clipboards then took their positions in
the center and cocked their ears toward the thrushes as they struck
up their tunes. It provided a lovely coda to a visit to Bilbao, a
tough town that's found grace in the gentle touch of art.

GEORGE JONES DEALS WITH `COLD HARD TRUTH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL DEAN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Truly, at this point in his long and stroried life, George Jones
is not only lucky to be singing, he's also lucky to still be
breathing air into the vocal chords that, by all rights, could have
stopped long ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones is like the cat doomed to fall out of the tree _ only
to land on all four feet and miraculously live to tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has lost a superstar ex-wife, several friends, probably
several fortunes, and nearly _ oh, so nearly _ his own life in a
car crash in March.
</P>
<P>
   But in many respects, and justifiably so, he has never sounded
as alive, vibrant and repentant _ or thankful that those vocals
chords still work their magic _ as he does on the new album, ``Cold
Hard Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the accident, in which Jones crashed his black
sports utility vehicle into a bridge near his home, he had recorded
all the album's basic tracks. In June, Jones pleaded guilty to
driving while impaired and violating Florida's open-container law
in the accident. He promised to complete alcohol counseling and was
fined $550.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to add ``final'' vocals were canceled because of the
accident _ in which he nearly died after puncturing a lung and
developing pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   No matter.
</P>
<P>
   If, God forbid, ``Cold Hard Truth'' had become the 67-year-old
singer's final legacy, it would have been a fitting and worthy one.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on Jones' incredible string of 158 charting
singles, the most touching, memorable and gut-wrenching have been
those that showed us his life in the crash lane.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' marriage to and breakup with Tammy Wynette was touchingly
and sometimes painfully told in song. In ``The Ceremony,'' they
re-enacted their wedding vows, and in ``We're Gonna Hold On'' _
released a month after Wynette filed (but soon withdrew) her
divorce petition, they sang about their struggle to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new album's closing song, ``When the Last Curtain
Falls,'' seems designed by Jones' record label to be the big
churner this time, its lack of direct lyrical connection to Jone's
life makes it less moving.
</P>
<P>
   The barn-burner of ``Cold Hard Truth'' is the title cut itself,
a searing, serious example of Jones' favorite kind of song (the
``crying in your beer ballad'') that makes the hairs on your neck
stand up with its brazen honesty.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation with his own conscience, Jones meets ``the
cold hard truth'' of his own actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a woman we both know,'' the ``conscience'' narrator
sings. ``I think you know the one I mean. She gave her heart and
soul to you, you gave her only broken dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   After that stab, the final verse draws the blade home: ``I'm
going to say this just one time: Time is running out on you. You
best remember me, my friend ... I am the cold, hard truth.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other autobiographical knife-turnings in the ballads
``Day After Forever'' (``It's only a matter of time, day after
forever you're on your own''), and ``Our Bed of Roses'' (``I sit
alone and watch it rain on our bed or roses'').
</P>
<P>
   And almost surprisingly, Jones seems to enjoy himself on such,
up-tempo songs as ``Sinners and Saints'' (``The only thing
different in sinners and saints, one is forgiven and the other one
ain't'').
</P>
<P>
   On the most impressive of these, ``You Never Know Just How Good
You've Got It,'' he gamely sings such lines as ``Yes I must
confess, my life's a big mess, I'm so alone I could lay down and
die.'' And he shows his famous warble has never sounded better,
while throwing in a final, deep ``weellll,'' for vocal fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thought the Possum's amazing luck had finally run out
should check out ``Cold Hard Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In its composition, execution and delivery, the album's truth is
neither cold nor hard _ but as touchingly real as the life of its
singer.
</P>

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Spunky Thai Curry Enhances Salmon   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Terra, one of the top restaurants in the Napa
Valley, feels like a Tuscan villa, so it's surprising to find
dishes such as Salmon with Thai Red Curry Sauce on the same menu as
French and Italian specialties.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But few cooks have the talent of Hiro Sone, who owns the
restaurant along with his wife, Lissa Doumani. They met while he
was a chef at Spago in Los Angeles and she was working in the
pastry kitchen. Now he's in charge of the kitchen and she oversees
the dining room at this fresh and exciting St. Helena restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The red curry salmon has a lot of ingredients and steps, but
they aren't difficult and the results are well worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   First, you make the spicy curry sauce and prepare the purple
cabbage with a soy/ rice wine vinegar dressing. Near serving time,
make the basmati rice, then grill or saute the salmon.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble the dish, place about a half cup of rice in the
center of the plate, and top with the fish. Pour the sauce around
the perimeter. Top each fillet with a pile of dressed cabbage and
sprinkle on cracked peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   It's a combination that works all the senses _ the hallmark of
any great dish.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Corn Taste, Crisp Texture Mark Top Tortilla 
 Chips   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  The snack aisle in supermarkets is packed with
tortilla chips of every kind and color. But is there a difference?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted 13 brands of full-fat yellow corn tortilla
chips and found that there is. They agreed chip taste is a matter
of personal preference. Some of the panelists like thin crispy
chips, while others like thicker, homestyle ones.
</P>
<P>
   There was no consensus, but three brands came out with similar
votes. In fact, first place was a tie.
</P>
<P>
   First place was a draw between  &UR; Doritos Toasted Corn &LR;  (141/2
ounces, $3.19 at many supermarkets) and  &UR; Padrinos Restaurant &LR; 
 &UR; Style &LR;  (13 ounces, $2.19 at many supermarkets).
</P>
<P>
   Two panelists liked the corn taste of the Doritos, but two
others thought there wasn't enough corn flavor. One described the
chip as a classic American-style. Three would buy them; two might.
</P>
<P>
   One panelist liked the seasoning and crispiness of Padrinos, and
another thought they were well suited for dipping. Another found
the chips greasy, though she liked the corn flavor. Three would buy
them; two might.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Santitas &LR;  (14 ounces, $1.59 at Safeway) came in third. One
panelist described the chips as well-balanced and fresh tasting.
Another thought they had a good, earthy flavor and appearance. But
others described them as lifeless and lacking corn flavor. Three
would buy them; two might.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the rest was a tie between  &UR; Casa Sanchez &LR;  (16
ounces, $2.99 at Andronico's) and  &UR; Native &LR;  (16 ounces, $2.99 at
Andronico's).
</P>
<P>
   Three panelists thought the Casa Sanchez chips were too hard and
greasy. But panelists liked the corn flavor and the homemade
appearance. Two would buy them; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were also split on Native. One panelist loved the
crunch of the thick cut. Another described them as what you'd get
at an authentic Mexican restaurant. But others disliked the hard
and sharp texture. Two would buy them, one might buy them, and two
would not.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists also tasted Corn Cheaps, Mexi-Snax, Mission, Tostitos
Santa Fe Gold, Newman's Own, Mai Zings, R.W. Garcia and Trader
Joe's, but they all scored too low to rate.

 The Eggs Come First At Petaluma Farms  By Karola Craib  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; PETALUMA, Calif. _ &LR;  They used to call Petaluma the egg basket of
the world, a moniker invented by a public relations man in 1918. It
was more than a PR gimmick. The town and its economy were driven by
chickens and eggs, and nobody asked which came first.
<P>
   But times have changed. Egg cartons, for the most part, are now
filled by factorylike operators, mega agribusinesses that rely on
high-tech methods to produce millions of chickens and billions of
eggs _ mostly in areas with lower land and labor costs than the Bay
Area.
</P>
<P>
   But much is still the same at Steven Mahrt's egg ranch, Petaluma
Farms. Both Mahrt and his wife, Judy, were born and raised in
chicken country. His family roots go back to a great-uncle who came
to Petaluma from Germany and started raising chickens in the 1920s;
his wife's family founded a hatchery in Calistoga in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   While other chicken ranchers moved on to greener pastures, Mahrt
stayed the course, getting a bachelor of science degree in poultry
raising and continuing to operate the family ranch _ the last true
independent  &LR; producer/packer &LR;  in the North Bay community. There is
one other non-corporate operator, but it's a large cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   The Mahrts go it alone on a ranch that occupies 30 acres
northwest of town. By industry standards, Petaluma Farms is a small
operation, producing 4,000 to 5,000 dozen eggs per day that are
sold under a variety of names.
</P>
<P>
   Raising chickens the old-fashioned way _ free-range _ is labor
intensive, Mahrt says. Free range does not mean barnyard fowl
pecking through the apple orchard. In essence, his birds spend
approximately two years of their useful laying life in a giant pen.
If left to roam outside, chickens are vulnerable to disease. In
large numbers, they are also major polluters. Chickens, Mahrt
deadpans, cannot be potty trained, so his work force of about 20
spends a lot of time cleaning up after the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Petaluma Farms eggs are ``almost organic,'' Steve Mahrt says,
with chickens eating a vegetarian diet free of antibiotics. The
Mahrts, however, also produce eggs under the Judy's Family Farm
label that are certified organic. The biggest part of their
production, marketed under the Rock Island label, are fertile brown
eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mahrt is excited about an experiment started last March in
which birds are fed an algae compound reported to be responsible
for the high amounts of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), one of the
fabled omega-3 group found in salmon and other seafood from frigid
northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   Mahrt says DHA, first linked to beneficial health when a 1970s
study found extremely low rates of cardiovascular disease in
Greenland Eskimos despite their high-fat diet, is now believed to
have positive effects not only on heart health but on visual
acuity, brain function and human mood and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   By supplementing the diet of some of his flock (a small
percentage at this experimental stage) with the DHA-rich algae, he
feels that he can truly offer an egg at the top of the nutritional
pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   Marketed under the Gold Circle Farms label, these eggs retail
for about $3.39 a dozen, about 90 cents more than the Rock Island
brand. The organic Judy's Family Farm eggs retail roughly in the
middle of this price range. All are available at major Bay Area
markets, including Whole Foods, Andronico's and some Safeway
stores,  &LR; as well as at the ranch at 700 Cavanaugh Lane near &LR; 
 &LR; Skillman in Petaluma. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mahrt's venturing into futuristic dietary territory seems no
contradiction to his tradition-rooted Petaluma background. After
all, it was in Petaluma that the egg incubator was invented in 1879
_ a landmark improvement for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Mahrts' commitment to the farming life runs deeper than
profit, although they do make a decent living off their ranch. It's
hard work and a healthy, natural lifestyle, Steve Mahrt says. He
grew up working on the family ranch, and his own four sons (ages 2
to 10 years) are already helping out around the place _
uncomplainingly, he maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Something, one supposes, for parents to cluck about.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &UR; Storing Your Eggs &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
If Petaluma egg rancher Steve Mahrt had his way, refrigerators
would be redesigned _ simplified, in fact. Those indented door
shelves intended to safely store eggs would be a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Eggs, says Mahrt, should be stored in their carton and as far
away as possible from anything with a strong odor. With their
porous shells, eggs are prone to picking up odors and acquiring
off-flavors _ and that can ruin the finest egg a hen ever laid.
</P>
<P>
   Well-closed egg cartons offer a measure of protection,
especially the heavy paper cartons (which Mahrt uses exclusively)
which absorb moisture and a certain amount of odors.
</P>
<P>
   Mahrt says his eggs _ all from chickens fed an antibiotic-free
vegetarian diet _ are popular with high-end restaurant chefs who
say the eggs taste better and whip up better than cheaper
mass-produced eggs. They make great souffles, he contends.

 WINE POTPOURRI: Underappreciated, but Admired   By Gerald Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  One of the most difficult and important tasks in
winemaking is blending. Bringing together the various components,
or complementary wines, into an artful blend takes experience and
skill.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blending is at the very core of many of the world's great wines
such as Bordeaux, Champagne and California Meritage. It is sherry,
though, that stands out as the apex of the winemaking art of
blending and the solera system that makes sherry one of the world's
great under-appreciated wines.
</P>
<P>
   A solera is a fractional blending system where the oldest wine
is nurtured and matured through a series of rackings or
transferring the aging wines from one row of barrels to another. In
a sherry bodega, the rows are called ``scales'' and the barrels are
known as ``butts.'' Each scale contains wine of the same type but
of different age.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the solera works: Soleras can technically consist of
an unlimited number of rows of barrels, each stacked upon the
other, but in practical terms, most soleras consist of three rows.
Soleras used for the production of fino sherry are often five rows
high. The top two rows are known as the criadera, or ``nursery,''
where young wines ``learn'' from older wines how to be sherry. The
bottom row is called the solera.
</P>
<P>
   Fermented wine is placed in the top criadera, which already
contains some older wine. Many of the operating soleras in the
bodegas of the Spanish sherry district in southwestern Spain have
been continuously in use for decades and the theory is that a small
amount of the original sherry that charged the system still
circulates through the solera. Because of the solera system,
vintage-dated sherries do not exist and any date on a sherry label,
like ``Solera 1899,'' refers to the date the solera was first laid
down.
</P>
<P>
   As the fully aged sherry is drawn off from the bottom solera, a
portion, usually one-third of the volume, is drawn off from the
middle criadera barrel and poured into the solera barrel. In turn,
a portion is drawn off from the top criadera and poured into the
middle criadera. This ingenious system insures that the finished
sherry will be the same year after year.
</P>
<P>
   The two basic styles of sherry are fino and oloroso. Fino is dry
and light, the perfect aperitif. Manzanilla, noted for its
briny-salty flavors, is the driest of the finos. The fuller
amontillado, dry or semi-dry, is an ``aged'' fino. Olorosos are
fuller-bodied, richer and darker sherries and can be dry ( &LR; seco &LR; ) &LR; 
 &LR; or medium. Rarer is palo cortado, a style that falls between
amontillado and oloroso. Cream sherry is the sweetest.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the above styles of sherry are produced by larger
bodegas such as Pedro Domecq, Williams &AMP; Humbert, Sandeman and
Gonzalez Byass. Also worth a try are sherries from Emilio Lustau,
Antonio Barbadillo, Valdespino, Delgado Zuleta, Osborne, Hildago
and Garvey.
</P>
<P>
   Rare Blends Festival
</P>
<P>
   An opportunity to experience the art of wine blending first hand
will take place this Saturday at the Rare Blends Festival, 2-6
p.m., at Richard's Grove, Saralee's Vineyard, Slusser Road,
Windsor. The festival is a fun way to learn about wine blending in
general and multi-winery varietal blends, listen to some good music
and sample the food from top chefs like Bradley Ogden of Lark Creek
Inn, Michael Chiarelo of Tra Vigne and Todd Humphries and Mark
Erickson of the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone.
</P>
<P>
   Wineries pairing off to create blends include Windsor and
Firestone, Sterling and Silverado, Au Bon Climat and Bonny Doon,
Geyser Peak and Eberle and William Hill and Atlas Peak.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the Trellis Alliance, the event will benefit
viticultural research at the University of California at Davis.
Tickets are available at the gate for $75 per person. For more
information about the event, call the Trellis Alliance at (530)
752-1380.

Wine Basics
</P>
<P>
   German wine labels are among the most difficult to understand.
Some wine drinkers claim it's the main reason why German wine sales
are slow in the United States. True or not, a little background on
the terms you see on German wine labels will help you better
understand German wines.
</P>
<P>
   The German wine classification system was introduced in 1971 and
is based on quality and the degree of sweetness of the grape juice
from which the wine is made.  &LR; Deutscher Tafelwein &LR; , or German Table
Wine, is the lowest level.
</P>
<P>
   Next is  &LR; Landwein &LR; , or table wine from a delineated district or
region, known as QbA ( &LR; Qualit &LR; a &LR; tswein bestimmter &LR;   &LR; Anbaugebiete &LR; ) &LR; 
 &LR; wine from any one of 11 regions such as the Rheingau or
Mosel-Saar-Ruwer.
</P>
<P>
   The highest quality is Qmp, ( &LR; Qualit &LR; a &LR; tswein mit &LR;   &LR; Pr &LR; a &LR; dikat &LR; )
wines that have achieved their prescribed level of sweetness
without the addition of sugar. From the driest to the sweetest, the
Qmp wines are:  &LR; Trocken &LR;  (dry),  &LR; Halb-Trocken &LR; ,  &LR; Kabinett &LR; ,
 &LR; Sp &LR; a &LR; tlese &LR; ,  &LR; Auslese &LR; ,  &LR; Beerenauslese &LR; ,  &LR; Eiswein &LR;  and
 &LR; Trockenbeerenauslese &LR; .

ATF Suspends Permit
</P>
<P>
   R.H. Phillips Winery of Esparto has had its license pulled by
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for labeling and
advertising violations of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act.
</P>
<P>
   According to ATF, R.H. Phillips bottled and labeled wine as
being from the Dunnigan Hills viticulture area, when the wine did
not meet the application of origin requirements for the Dunnigan
Hills viticulture area. R.H. Phillips is in the Dunnigan Hills
American Viticulture Area, northeast of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ATF says that R.H. Phillips further caused ``consumer
deception'' by advertising the wines to consumers on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   R.H. Phillips wines have received wide acclaim, including
recommendations on The Chronicle Wine Page, for their quality and
value, as well as kudos for the company's creative wine labels. We
can only hope that R.H. Phillips gets things sorted out and returns
to the market soon.

YOSEMITE MURDERS A HATE CRIME, BEREAVED WOMAN SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RANDI ROSSMANN   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUREKA, Calif. _ Carole Carrington, who lost her daughter,
granddaughter and a family friend to murder, is taking her story to
Washington to tell federal officials that the slaying of her loved
ones was a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   Carrington, who lives in Eureka, expects to testify before a
House judicial committee Wednesday. The committee is considering
legislation, the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, calling for the
expansion of the federal hate crime statute to include gender,
sexual orientation and disability. If passed and signed, the act
could result in tougher penalties for those convicted of such
crimes and could provide more resources for law enforcement to
investigate them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel this was a hate crime. The man did not know Carole
and Juli and Silvina and the only reason he killed them was because
they were women,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Carole Sund, her teen-aged daughter, Juli, and
17-year-old Silvina Pelosso disappeared from the Yosemite area
motel where they were vacationing. Carole and Silvina were found
dead in the trunk of their rental car and Juli was found dead a
week later.
</P>
<P>
   Handyman Cary Stayner, 37, has confessed to the crime. He is in
custody in Fresno, accused of killing a fourth woman, 26-year-old
Joie Armstrong, who lived in Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
   Stayner told FBI agents that he'd dreamed of killing women for
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National Organization for Women have called the
murder of these four ``the worst possible hate crimes against
women'' and a great example of why the federal hate crime bill
should be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Carrington said she is not taking a political position,
but wants the chance to tell her story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know that much about the bill,'' she said. ``I
just felt this was a chance to have a national forum to get out the
fact there are so many women missing.''
</P>
<P>
   During a vigil in Modesto last March, which attracted 1,400
people in a show of support, Carrington and her husband, Francis,
learned just how often such crimes occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many have never been found. We were very shocked to find
that out,'' Carole Carrington said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm speaking on behalf of women, to say that we do need
more support in finding these criminals. Very often they occur in a
rural community and there are very few people to work on it even.
It's in the paper, a week, 10 days and then gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrington will also speak about the reward fund and foundation
she and her husband began.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation offers reward money to help publicize
disappearances, and to help families of victims who don't have the
money themselves. It also offers help in getting volunteers
organized, fliers distributed and support for shocked and grieving
families who find themselves going through what the Carringtons,
husband and father Jens Sund and the Pelossos went through, as well
as Armstrong's family.
</P>
<P>
   Carrington said she never dreamed she would be speaking before a
federal committee, but is not frightened of the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done a lot of speaking lately. Last year I would have
been frightened to go and speak to a Kiwanis Club,'' she said. ``I
think I have a message and a story and I just want everybody to
know it.''

EDITORS NOTE: Main story followed by recipe. 
 
 McNair Puts a Spin on Classic Cakes   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  What Michael Crichton is to aficionados of crime
thrillers, James McNair is to those of us addicted to the culinary
arts: Each book, which both authors turn out with astonishing
regularity, has a new plot, but we know we will find it intriguing
and satisfying.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are a lot of cookbooks being published these days, and
many of them are good, but few books are as reliable as McNair's.
And no wonder, not only is he a consummate cook of all trades, but
he does his own photography and styling.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest endeavor, this master of single-subject books
tackles cake _ not  &LR; gateau &LR;  or  &LR; torta &LR; , but genuine, familiar cake.
Well, there  &LR; is &LR;  a recipe for  &LR; genoise &LR; , which has a French-Italian
pedigree, but it has become such an international standard that it
fits right in with American white cake and sponge cake (its kissing
cousin).
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who grew up in his father's Louisiana Baptist parsonage
and has made Northern California his home for many years reports in
his introduction to ``James McNair's Cakes'' that a young niece
calls him Happy Cakes. As the family's provider of birthday and
other special-occasion cakes, he likes this honorary title.
</P>
<P>
   The cakes in the book certainly have the potential to create
happiness, both for the home baker and the people who get to eat
these creations.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cakes are classics, McNair puts his own stamp on
them. His opening recipe is for pound cake that he calls a little
lighter than the conventional cake. Maybe so, but the basic
character of a true pound cake is retained, getting its light yet
firm texture solely from eggs _ no leavening.
</P>
<P>
   He follows it with 11 variations that include the original Happy
Cake, a recipe he and his mother discovered when he was a boy. The
twosome baked it and ended up eating almost the whole cake warm
from the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Many recipes betray the author's Southern background _ Banana
Foster Cake; Plantation Cake, a sophisticated offspring of canned
fruit cocktail cake; Southern Coconut Cake _ but he also includes a
San Francisco classic, Blum's never-forgotten Coffee Crunch Cake,
and a fine Scottish Dundee Cake.
</P>
<P>
   McNair takes his mother's pineapple upside-down cake to a new
dimension by using fresh rather than canned tropical fruit. His
favorite version uses mangoes.
</P>
<P>
   With his customary thoroughness, McNair has an introductory
chapter explaining all the basics of cake baking, from ingredients
to utensils and techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be intimidated by the gorgeous photos in this book. Your
cakes may not end up looking quite as handsome as master
baker/photographer McNair's, but if you heed his advice and follow
his recipes to the letter, there is little chance they won't be
Happy Cakes.

UPSIDE-DOWN TROPICAL FRUIT CAKE
</P>
<P>
   This also may be made using fresh apples, pears, nectarines,
peaches, plums or berries.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   21/2 cups sliced bananas, mango, papaya or pineapple
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, at room temperature, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup whole milk, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Position racks in the middle of the oven; preheat the oven to
350 degree. Grease a 9-inch round cake pan.
</P>
<P>
   Combine 1/4 cup of the butter and the brown sugar in a saucepan.
Place over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the
butter melts and the mixture is slightly caramelized, about 3
minutes. Pour into the prepared cake pan and quickly swirl to coat
evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the fruit slices in slightly overlapping concentric
circles over the sugar mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Place the flour, baking powder and salt in a strainer or sifter
and sift together into a bowl three times. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Using an electric mixer, beat the remaining 1/2 cup butter at
medium speed until soft and creamy. With the mixer running, slowly
add the granulated sugar, then stop the mixer and scrape down the
sides of the bowl into the center. Continue beating at medium speed
until the mixture is very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly drizzle in the eggs and beat well; stop at least once to
scrape the sides of the bowl. Add the vanilla and blend well.
</P>
<P>
   Fold in about a third of the flour mixture, then half the milk,
scraping the sides of the bowl and folding just until ingredients
are incorporated. Fold in half of the remaining flour mixture, the
rest of the milk and, finally, the remaining flour.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape the batter over the fruit in the pan and smooth the
surface with a rubber spatula.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until the cake springs back when lightly touched in the
center with your fingertips and a wooden skewer inserted into the
center of the cake comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the pan to a work surface and let stand 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Run a knife around the inside edge of the pan to loosen the cake
from the sides of the pan. Invert a serving plate over the pan,
invert the plate and pan together and lift off the pan. If any
fruit sticks to the pan, remove it with a spatula and reposition it
on the cake. Set aside to cool slightly before serving warm or at
room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8.

EDITORS NOTE: Bay Area Classics profiles food-related businesses
more than a half century old. 
 
 A Savory Link to the Past   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN LEANDRO, Calif. _  Sausages, says Jim Mosle, are the original
convenience food. He should know. His family has been in the
sausage business for more than 40 years and has built a small
empire from it, link by link.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saag's Products, Inc., had its origins in a small butcher shop
on Williams Street behind the Oakland Capwell's store, where a
German immigrant couple, Georg and Luise Saag, set up shop in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   German and other central European expatriates flocked to the
shop to buy meat cut for such specialties as beef rouladen (beef
rolls) or  &LR; kalbsnierenbraten  &LR; rolled veal roast with veal kidneys
tucked in the center). And they came for the sausages _ bratwurst,
weisswurst, landjaeger, mettwurst, blutwurst and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The business thrived even more after 1954, when Jim's parents,
Walter and Kathi Mosle, came from Appenzell, Switzerland, and
bought it. They expanded the business to a second shop near
Oakland's Housewives' Market. Walter was the butcher/sausage maker
and Kathi did the books.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kathi who hatched grander plans, starting to wholesale
some of their products to other retail stores in the '60s. The now
defunct Berkeley Co-op stores were Saag's Products' first
customers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from those early days of old-fashioned European
butchering to the now 25-year-old Saag's factory in the industrial
part of San Leandro, which boasts high-tech, largely
computer-controlled machinery operated by 65 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Kathi Mosle is CEO and chair of the board of the privately held
company. Son Jim, who made deliveries for the now-closed Saag's
retail stores as a teenager and joined the family enterprise
full-time in 1983, is vice president of operations. His father died
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The executive team is rounded out by president Timothy Dam, food
scientist John Ling and plant production manager Bernhard Steinert,
who came here for a vacation from his native Germany and ended up
moving to the East Bay. He has been with Saag's 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Steinert is as conversant with computers as he is with the
recipes for the traditional sausages made under his supervision.
With a few clicks of his mouse, he can trace a year's worth of
production times, cooking temperatures, moisture, sodium and fat
content and other pertinent data.
</P>
<P>
   For all the modernity, though, Saag's 100-plus products remain
resolutely traditional. The spices that flavor sausages are the
same as those used in central European butcher shops for
generations. The storage room holds fresh milk and crates of fresh
eggs as well as vegetables. Hams and other smoked products are
treated with real smoke from hickory sawdust _ liquid smoke is not
found on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference between today's sausages and their
continental antecedents (aside from the computer-guaranteed
consistency) is healthfulness. The line no longer includes raw
products (no more mettwurst, which is made from raw pork, cured and
smoked). Meat is more closely trimmed to reduce fat, and for the
last couple of years, Saag's has made a line of poultry sausages
from recipes by Lark Creek Inn/One Market chef Bradley Ogden that
bear his name and picture.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional meat man Steinert, standing by his Windows
95-operated, state-of-the-art German meat chopper, says that the
poultry line has helped grow the business.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mosle and company president Dam expect Saag's to expand both
its physical plant and its distribution area, which now is
concentrated in California, the Northwest and Hawaii _ and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you board a cruise ship in Miami,'' Mosle says, ``you may
be served a Saag's sausage from San Leandro.''

</P>
<P>
   GRAND-ILLUSION-FILM (New York) _ Frequently called one of the
``best films of all time,'' Jean Renoir's ``Grand Illusion'' (``La
Grande Illusion''), released in 1937, about people caught up in war
can be something of a surprise. Not that there is any particular
reason to dispute the ranking, but there is a simplicity, if that's
the word, and a kind of sprightly directness that can be startling
in a work deemed so towering. Or that is the impression one gets
from a strikingly vivid, newly subtitled restoration from Rialto
Films now playing in Manhattan. By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KAT-KINGS-THEATER (Cape Town, South Africa) _ There is still one
victim of apartheid that until now has remained unsung: doo-wop.
That is not meant facetiously. Normally, it might be offensive to
lightly link the AK-47 rattle of racial liberation with the
patent-leather tap of rhythms bopped out under a street lamp, but
``Kat and the Kings,'' the South African musical now in previews at
the Cort Theater on Broadway, where it is to open on Aug. 19, does
not trivialize the suffering of the people it portrays. It is, like
their lives, bittersweet. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   VOICES-THEATER (New York) _ Even last month's scorching heat
could not melt a major special effect of the new Broadway play
``Voices in the Dark.'' Still, when the thriller officially opens
on Thursday, at least one man will be as white-knuckled as the
heroine, played by Judith Ivey, who is menaced repeatedly in her
snowbound Adirondack retreat. For Greg Meeh, the action on the
Longacre stage begins and ends with the snow that has to fall
steadily for two hours of real time outside the cabin's picture
windows. ``I just hope it doesn't come down in clumps or stick to
the scrim,'' Meeh was saying recently, as he kicked around several
piles of the white stuff backstage. One thing was clear: the mounds
weren't turning into water. This ``snow'' is made of thin plastic
shavings. Meeh, who has orchestrated inclement weather for dozens
of Broadway productions, was the man behind the downpour in ``The
Lonesome West,'' the pea-soup fog in ``An Inspector Calls'' and the
violent typhoon of ``Geniuses.'' By Andrew Jacobs.

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT-CRAFT-MUSIC (Undated) _ Although he is best known as Igor
Stravinsky's Boswell, collaborator and aide-de-camp, Robert Craft
has been, along with Leonard Bernstein and John Cage, one of the
main shapers of American musical taste in the second half of the
20th century. By David Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIABIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ The slightly mad find their most
eloquent spokesmen in the ranks of the eminently sane. That, at
least, is the subtext of a remarkable new recording of Scriabin's
music by Pierre Boulez and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. On this
Deutsche Grammophon CD, Boulez conducts ``The Poem of Ecstasy,''
the Piano Concerto and ``Prometheus: The Poem of Fire.'' By Bernard
Holland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ELEANOR-ANTIN-ART (Los Angeles) _ The movie marquee in the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art says, ``Now Showing: Eleanor Antin.''
Beneath it are a few stills of Ms. Antin's most famous roles, plus
a free-standing cutout of her in full ballerina regalia. If you
can't find Eleanor Antin in your movie guide, try the deadpan
dictionary, the feminist gazette, the lexicon of subversive notions
or, better still, the catalogue named after her by Howard N. Fox,
curator of ``Eleanor Antin,'' the first retrospective of 30 years
of this artist's work (through Aug. 23). By Vicki Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD-MEIER-ARCH (Paris) _ Architects who consider themselves
artists are understandably delighted when their work is featured in
museums, but Richard Meier, the designer of the Getty Center in Los
Angeles, has special reason to feel honored. The Musee du Jeu de
Paume in Paris has chosen Meier, an American, as the subject of its
first-ever architectural exhibition. And in doing so, it has set
out to reinforce the notion that architecture is art. ``Richard
Meier Architect,'' will be on show through Sept. 26. By Alan
Riding.
</P>
<P>
   LAYLAH-ALI-ART (Undated) _ In Laylah Ali's cheery little
gouache-on-paper drawings, skinny characters with bulbous heads and
colorful uniforms trade hostilities in regimented ways that
resemble team sports. Both ``sides'' are frequently masked like
burglars. Perpetrators in one frame of her cartoon-strip-like works
are likely to be victims in the next. In a style as innocuous as
the Sunday funnies, they might be shown strung upside down,
whipped, shrouded, straitjacketed or impaled. No text bubbles
explain these ambiguous goings-on. Instead Ms. Ali, who is based in
Boston, and whose first solo museum show opens Saturday at the
Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, invites viewers to supply
narratives. By Ann Wilson Lloyd.

CHINESE PLAN DEBT-FOR-EQUITY SWAPS TO WORK OUT $200 BILLION IN
DEBT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Faced with more than $200 billion in bad debt at
moribund state-owned companies, Chinese officials said Tuesday that
they would begin a broad program of debt-for-equity swaps that
could include some foreign ownership.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders, effectively taking one more step on the long
and pothole-ridden road to privatization, have also decided that a
larger percentage of government-owned shares can be sold on the
nation's stock markets, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Zheng Silin, vice chairman of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, the agency in charge of public-sector reform, said at a
news conference that officials were proceeding with plans to handle
China's debt through new asset management companies modeled on the
Resolution Trust Corp. in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Zheng insisted that China was keeping to the ambitious plans
announced last year by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to eliminate the
debt of large and medium-sized state companies within three years,
or by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Despite indications that Zhu's authority on policy matters has
recently been undercut, in part by the Beijing leadership's current
preoccupation with a campaign against the Falun Gong movement,
Zheng painted an optimistic picture of China's
economic-restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been gratifying momentum in China's reform and
development of state-owned enterprises,'' he said. ``There has been
a remarkable improvement in the economic performance of these
enterprises.''
</P>
<P>
   State-owned companies earned a total of about $3 billion in the
first half of this year, Zheng said, or more than double that in
the comparable period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1997, he continued, China had 16,874 large- and
medium-sized state companies, and 6,599 of them, or 39 percent,
were losing money. By the end of 1998, he said, the number of such
money-losing companies had been reduced to 5,121, either through
bankruptcy or improved management.
</P>
<P>
   ``In another year and a half, we're confident we will get
state-owned enterprises out of difficulty,'' Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
   China's state companies are mired in murky accounting and hidden
debt _ so much so that it is hard for outside auditors to verify
the accuracy of a company's balance sheet, which draws question
marks around Zheng's optimistic assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet leaders seem to finally be accepting the view of Chinese
economists: that companies need to find a way to confront their
overwhelming bad debt, caused by decades of blank-check funding by
the national and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   While Communist Party leaders still routinely insist that the
state will maintain majority ownership even in companies that sell
stock, they have reluctantly agreed to one step after another that
pulls China's economy away from state control.
</P>
<P>
   But debt-for-equity swaps in China are plagued by many
obstacles, above all the question of who might want to buy equity
in a money-losing company accustomed to decades of management by
officials who are politically wise but ignorant about business.
</P>
<P>
   Hopeful that greater public ownership will help, Chinese
officials said Tuesday for the first time that foreign buyers would
be allowed in some cases to buy stock that is converted from debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Chinese enterprises have been listed at home and abroad,
so in principle foreign investors are allowed to participate in
this way,'' said Wang Wanbin, another vice chairman of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Zheng played down the likelihood that Beijing's new approval
of debt-for-equity swaps would lead to a flood of initial public
offerings. ``We have to be very cautious in getting state-owned
shares listed,'' he said, adding that the number of state-owned
shares are much greater than the number of shares now circulating
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   He announced that in addition to the existing Cinda Asset
Management Corp., which was set up in March, China had established
three new companies: the Hualong Asset Management Corp., Changcheng
Asset Management Corp. and Dong Feng Asset Management Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The four companies will handle debt-for-equity swaps for each of
China's four big state-owned commercial banks: the China
Construction Bank, the Agricultural Bank of China, the China
Industrial and Commercial Bank and the Bank of China.

FAILURE TO RATIFY NUCLEAR TEST BAN PACT MAKES WORLD LESS SAFE, SAYS
REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The failure of the United States and other
nuclear powers to ratify an international treaty that bans nuclear
testing, while they have weakened pacts against other weapons of
mass destruction, undercuts decades of arms control and is making
the world much less safe, says a report by nuclear arms experts
commissioned by Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The report, to be made public at the United Nation on Wednesday,
says the most immediate threat is to Asia. China and North Korea
have embarked on a series of missile tests, and India and Pakistan
exploded nuclear devices last year, changing the entire Asian
security landscape for the worse in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   The experts also chided the United States for allowing relations
with Russia and China to deteriorate, adding to tensions and
fostering an environment conducive to worldwide rearmament
involving not only missiles, but also missile-defense systems and
other arms.
</P>
<P>
   The report says it is urgent that the United States, along with
Russia, China, India, Israel, North Korea and Pakistan, ratify the
pact against nuclear testing, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, to
prevent arms control from unraveling further. Moreover, it says,
the world must not condone India's policy or in any way reward the
nation, which wants a permanent Security Council seat and which,
the study says, ``considers the possession of nuclear weapons an
attribute of great-power status.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Asian tests tempt others to break restraints against
nuclear development, the experts added in a sweeping survey of
worldwide developments. One of those asked to prepare the report in
response to Japan's concern over the Indian and Pakistani tests,
Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center in
Washington, a group that researches arms and international
security, said the scope of the report had initially been much
narrower.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the longer we worked on this, the broader it became,''
Krepon said in an interview Tuesday. ``We saw a deteriorating
situation on just about every front. It was a very sobering view.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration signed the nuclear test-ban treaty in
1996 but has not made ratification a public issue or fought
strenuously for it in Congress, where Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said it would
be ``dead on arrival.'' Last week, a group of leading American
nuclear scientists wrote to the Senate urging ratification, if only
as a way to block Chinese nuclear espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty has been signed by 152 nations but ratified by only
41, among them Britain, France, Japan and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   India's unexpected tests in May 1998, which prompted neighboring
Pakistan to follow suit, caused considerable alarm across Asia,
including in China.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the only country to have experienced a nuclear attack,
the tests led Ryutaro Hashimoto, then prime minister, and Keizo
Obuchi, his foreign minister and now prime minister, to call
together about 24 arms control experts to study the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing of India's action greatly compounds other nuclear
dangers and makes nuclear disarmament harder to achieve,'' their
report says. It is critical of India for having revived the specter
of nuclear war at a time when Russia and the United States were
making deep, if slow, cuts in their nuclear arsenals, a process
that the experts say should be speeded up.
</P>
<P>
   While the Start II treaty reducing long-range missiles in the
United States and Russia languishes in the Russian Parliament and
there are scant hopes that the next stage of cuts, known as Start
III, can be embodied in a treaty any time soon, ``Russia, concerned
about its status, has revalued nuclear weapons,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of experts went beyond nuclear issues, mentioning the
dangers also of allowing the Chemical Weapons Convention to be
weakened by recent decisions on how it will be verified, some of
the moves demanded by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   On biological arms, the experts said just as the ability to
produce more lethal forms of germ warfare was growing, nations were
not able to agree on how to strengthen the treaty that bans such
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The independent experts, who met over the last year under the
title of the Tokyo Forum for Nuclear Nonproliferation and
Disarmament, included Joseph Nye, a specialist on arms control and
Asia who is dean of the Kennedy School of government at Harvard;
Robert Gallucci, a former negotiator for the United States with
North Korea and now dean of the School of Foreign Service at
Georgetown; Therese Delpech, director of strategic affairs for the
French Atomic Energy Commission, and Joachim Krause of the German
Society for Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Other members are Patricia Lewis, director of the U.N. Institute
for Disarmament in Geneva; Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish ambassador to
the United States and founding chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission on Iraq, and Hu Xiaodi, deputy director-general of the
Chinese Department of Arms Control and Disarmament, who
disassociated himself with some of the conclusions in the report.
</P>
<P>
   In strong words, the experts concluded, ``At the turn of the
21st century, the momentum toward a universal and effective global
nuclear nonproliferation regime generated by the close of the Cold
War is in danger of being lost.''
</P>
<P>
   As one step, the report recommends speedier action on a treaty
to cut off the production of fissile materials, which is stalled in
the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.

DELAWARE DROPS PLAN FOR PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Hampshire primary moved a step toward maintaining its
preeminent role Tuesday when Delaware Republicans said they would
scrap plans for a presidential primary and hold a caucus instead.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, New Hampshire has held the first presidential
primary in the nation. And by law, the state has required that no
other primary be held less then seven days after its own.
</P>
<P>
   But Delaware moved in on New Hampshire's turf in 1996, holding a
primary just four days after the Granite State's. New Hampshire has
urged presidential candidates to pledge not to participate in the
Delaware contest or allow their names to be placed on Delaware's
ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Delaware Republican Chairman Basil Battaglia conceded
defeat. He said Delaware Republicans would hold a caucus on Feb.
12, and he said the state should consider participating in a
regional primary, along with Maryland and Pennsylvania, rather than
continue to challenge New Hampshire on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``To continue with a primary that almost every major candidate
in both parties is boycotting accomplishes very little,'' Battaglia
said. ``Under current law, it is very possible the current front
runner won't even be on our ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   Battaglia also said the primary would cost taxpayers too much
money, $825,000, for too little return. Nevertheless, Delaware
Democrats said they still plan to hold a primary vote, even though
Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley
will not campaign there.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Secretary of State William Gardner is expected to
set the date of the Granite State's primary soon. Tuesday, he said
the latest it would be is Feb. 8, 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ It was promoted as an omen of the new
era in Palestinian-Israeli relations ushered in by the election of
Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that Dalia Itzik, Israel's new environment
minister, would take her staff to the blighted Gaza Strip and spend
a day with Yousef Abu-Safieh, her Palestinian counterpart. They
would inspect sites, discuss mutual concerns and renew the nascent
cooperation that was stunted during the three tense years when
Benjamin Netanyahu was prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   And as the two delegations slogged from overfilled garbage dump
to pungent-smelling water treatment plant, they said that despite
this week's tension over the latest land-for-security deal, their
cooperation represented a change.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke of the symbolism of environmental collaboration _
``We drink the same water, we breathe the same air,'' said Ms.
Itzik _ and planted seeds of collegiality.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the day, the session also laid bare the
twisted complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian relationship,
making clear that long-term peace will require more than good will.
</P>
<P>
   The visit began auspiciously enough. Ms. Itzik, 46, a former
teacher, union activist and member of Parliament and the only woman
in Barak's government, was greeted by Abu-Safieh at the Erez border
crossing between the Gaza Strip and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   After smiles and drinks, her delegation was whisked away in a
fleet of black Mercedes and silver Peugeot limos under the
supervision of Yasser Arafat's personal security guards, a sign of
the Palestinian leader's appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ms. Itzik's first visit to the Gaza Strip. As sirens
wailed and her motorcade sped through Gaza City, she saw through
her tinted windows some of the challenges of life here: the
mule-drawn carts, the sand-choked refugee camps, the shoeless
children. Yet progress was also on view: new street and traffic
lights, buildings under construction, foreign-financed development
projects being completed.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Safieh said he found Ms. Itzik herself to be a breath of
fresh air. Her predecessor was Rafael Eitan, one of Israel's most
outspoken rightist politicians, who advocates harsh measures toward
the Palestinians. Abu-Safieh said he had never invited Eitan and
would never have received him.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian minister is himself a symbol of renewal for his
people.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Safieh, 49, was raised in Jabaliya refugee camp on U.N.
rations, the eldest of 10 children, the son of an illiterate
farmer. He studied and worked in Lebanon and Libya, then earned a
doctorate in environmental sciences at the University of Texas at
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He helped found two universities in Gaza before winning a seat
on the Palestinian legislative council in 1996, becoming
environment minister a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   He took his guests to Al-Salam, or Peace, Restaurant on the
beach for a lunch of grilled white bream that had been caught in
the gleaming Mediterranean outside. He gave Ms. Itzik a Palestinian
embroidered shawl. She offered him a silver clock and the words,
``We have no more time to waste.'' He agreed that the only hope was
rapid cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite all the symbolism and good will, the Palestinian's
agenda was more one of lament than enthusiasm. Why were the
Israelis not stopping what he said was illegal dumping of toxic
chemicals by Israeli companies on Palestinian land? Why was Israel
permitting the building of projects inside the West Bank that he
said had been deemed environmentally unsound within its own
borders? Why was Israel destroying green areas and uprooting trees
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Itzik, in office only two weeks, listened. Her staff, some
members of which are holdovers from the previous administration,
contended that the Palestinian side was involved in its own share
of environmental wrongs. It is dumping raw sewage into the harbor,
they said, and its waste is seeping into the area's underground
aquifer, which both sides share.
</P>
<P>
   If that is so, replied the Palestinians, it is because the
Israelis are not permitting us to build the sewage treatment plant
we need. They have put pressure on the Germans not to give us the
money that has been promised because they say it is too close to
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Never heard about that, said the Israeli staff members. We have
offered many times to build cooperative waste treatment plants with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But they want us to cooperate with the Jewish settlers here,
Abu-Safieh noted, referring to the 4,500 Jewish settlers in Gaza.
We cannot do that. The settlers have stolen our land and our water.
Whenever we have asked to monitor the water use of the settlers,
the Israelis have refused.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went: Polite but pointed, familial yet accusatory.
Each problem had a history for which the other side was deemed
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   When they toured a new garbage dump, Abu-Safieh said that
throughout the Israeli occupation of Gaza, from 1967 to 1994, the
Israeli military disposed of trash randomly all over the area
without any regard for the environment. The Palestinians have had
to close dozens of illegal dumps and transport the garbage to the
new, properly lined one.
</P>
<P>
   The group also toured the fishing port that the Palestinians
have built without coordination with the Israelis. Ms. Itzik
acknowledged that there was little to be done about it now but
asked that there be coordination on any future such projects.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gazans on the street stared at the entourage and wondered where
it would all lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no hope anymore,'' said Said Dawwas, 39, as he tossed
dough onto a hot convex metal burner to form large flat bread at a
bakery near the minister's office. ``I don't think Israel wants
peace. It's been six years, and I still can't go visit my relatives
in Nablus,'' in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are imprisoned in Gaza while the Israelis say, `Wait,
wait,''' Dawwas said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian journalists asked Ms. Itzik questions outside her
domain, about Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and delays in
carrying out the Wye River agreement on further steps toward peace
that was signed in Maryland last October. She offered her best
assurances. They seemed unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   At day's end, hot, exhausted and a bit saddened, Ms. Itzik
offered an assessment of the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at their lives here,'' she said. ``They are very
difficult, and it is hard to look at. But we are not coming here as
a favor. That was the attitude of the previous government. That is
patronizing. We see it as in our interest and that is why it is
important to come and see it firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must deal with these problems. These are our neighbors, and
if their water is polluted, so is ours. There is nothing more basic
to peaceful coexistence than that.''

CELTICS DID WHAT THEY HAD TO DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, it wasn't all about the money. It was maybe 80 percent about
the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no desire to trade Ron Mercer,'' maintains Rick Pitino.
(Beware. With Rick there is sometimes a Pinocchio effect, but let's
take him at his word. This time.)
</P>
<P>
   In a more fiscally sane world, there would be no issue. A player
of the caliber and personality of Ron Mercer would sign with Team X
and remain there for many years. We, of course, do not live in
fiscally sane times. We live in fiscally preposterous times. So if
you're General Rick Pitino or Lieutenant Chris Wallace, you do what
you gotta do to salvage an unpleasant situation. You put Mercer on
the market and see if you can get, as Pitino puts it, ``50 cents,
60 cents, or even 70 cents on the dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Break out the bubbly. They may have gotten a great deal more
than that.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening to the Celtics happens to every team, sooner or
later. A kid like Mercer enters the NBA, does very nicely, and
that's all. He sets no records, evokes no memories of Michael
Jordan, does not establish himself as a franchise player and, in
fact, tails off a bit in Year 2 from his nice rookie season and
then decides he is worth the maximum money available for his next
contract (i.e. Keith Van Horn's six-year, $73 million deal).
</P>
<P>
   In Mercer's case, he was clearly the third-most important
commodity on the team. Had he been realistic, he'd still be here.
But with him declaring he would leave after next season if he
didn't have a new contract now, and with him being millions of
dollars apart from the Celtics from a negotiating standpoint, this
was an easy call. He had to go.
</P>
<P>
   The only relevant question now is this: Are the Celtics a better
team on paper today than they were at this time two days ago? The
clear answer is yes. Danny Fortson and Eric Williams make them so.
Mercer is good, but this particular Boston Celtics team can live
without him.
</P>
<P>
   Out of context, Mercer is a better player than Fortson. It
doesn't matter. The Celtics need what Fortson does more than they
need what Mercer does. If Williams resembles the 1995-97 Williams,
that's a major bonus.
</P>
<P>
   They also get a bookkeeping aspect of the deal known as Eric
Washington, a huge chunk of cash, and a future No. 1 pick from
Denver that has Lieutenant Wallace salivating. ``That could be a
very nice piece of real estate, so to speak,'' he points out.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Fortson has never had an identity crisis. He appears to
realize that the reason he was put on this earth was to retrieve
loose basketballs. Playing just 28 minutes a game last year, he
pulled in 11 rebounds a game and was, according to the numbers, the
best offensive rebounder in the league. Given that the Celtics
were, as Wallace puts it, ``mauled on the boards'' last year, the
addition of a young, Oakleyesque Mr. Nasty is very welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Messrs. Fortson and Williams do something else. Each man finds
his way to the foul line. Fortson gets there for obvious reasons,
while Williams is a prototype slasher whose entire approach to
offense is angular. He has never seen an opening to the hoop he
didn't like. The question with him is health. He was exiled to
Denver the first time because his training habits angered the
coach, and he has subsequently had the customary ACL knee surgery.
He didn't do much of anything after returning to action last year.
</P>
<P>
   But General Pitino says that Williams has become a ``weight-room
monster.'' He says that extensive research reveals Williams to be a
completely humbled and matured man. He assures us that Williams has
paid all the dues, learned all the lessons, and made all the
amends. Again, remember to address all future complaints to the
General, not to this newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are better than they were at the end of last season,
but they are still a marginal playoff team, at best, and they still
have not addressed a need Pitino identified on many occasions last
season. They need a prime-of-life veteran presence somewhere. The
key players are all young. Antoine Walker will begin the new season
at age 23. Paul Pierce? 22. Vitaly Potapenko? 24. Tony Battie? 23.
Fortson? 23. There is 32-year-old Dana Barros, sure, but he's a
fringe player. Kenny Anderson (29)? Please.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has rashly promised the playoffs for next season, but may
we do the math together? There were eight playoff teams last
season, so one of them must fall out. Tell me which one. Atlanta?
Perhaps. Philadelphia? Not very likely. Go ahead. Find a truly
vulnerable team.
</P>
<P>
   Then factor in Toronto and Charlotte, each of whom performed at
a playoff level last year. And don't forget about Cleveland, which
gets Zydrunas Ilgauskas back and will benefit from a new coach.
It's going to get a little crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if the
best player were someone other than Antoine Walker. As he enters
his fourth year he engenders not even a teensy-weensy bit more
confidence that he has any more of an idea what constitutes winning
behavior in this league than he did two years ago. He remains a
physically gifted time bomb. Opponents pay homage to his package of
physical skills while having no respect for him as a professional.
He is a perfect example of the system's essential folly, since he
has already been financially rewarded far beyond his actual
achievement level. He is frighteningly comfortable for someone who
has so much to learn.
</P>
<P>
   How can Pitino, of all people, not see this? The answer, we can
assume, is that he does. It would not be at all surprising to
discover that Rick Pitino wakes up each and every morning hoping
that this is the lucky day when some foolish GM wants to make The
Deal. Antoine is still young enough to change and grow, but it
would be nice if he would show us a sign every now and then. The
supposed best player on your team is supposed to make you feel
secure, not nervous. (If you'd like to argue that Pierce is already
the best player, you can look elsewhere for an argument.)
</P>
<P>
   This deal with Denver is not a Bill Russell, Kevin McHale,
Dennis Johnson, or Paul Silas move. What it does is turn a
potential double bogey into a solid par. In the modern world of
sport, that makes it a very good day.

BRITISH DEFENSE CHIEF SET TO ASSUME NATO LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A few years ago, George Robertson, the longtime British
lawmaker who lives in the Scottish town of Dunblane, suggested
authorities pull the gun license of a local man named Thomas
Hamilton because Hamilton appeared unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Robertson's caution was warranted, and Hamilton
later used his license to buy the guns that were used to kill 16
schoolchildren and their teacher in one of the worst mass murders
in recent British history.
</P>
<P>
   When someone suggested that Robertson should point out not only
that he had predicted the tragedy but that his local political
rival had refused to endorse his call to pull Hamilton's license,
Robertson wouldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   That story captures the essence of Robertson, who a year after
the tragedy in Dunblane became the British defense minister and who
Wednesday is expected to be named secretary general of NATO. In a
business where blowing one's own horn and being self-centered is
usually part of the job description, Robertson is a politician
whose self-effacing style has defined his career.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 NATO ambassadors who are expected Wednesday to formally
endorse his replacing Javier Solana of Spain, who will become the
European Union's director of foreign and defense policy, will find
in Robertson the quintessential team player. He will become the
10th secretary general, and the third Briton to hold the job.
Throughout its 50-year history, NATO's civilian head has been a
European, while its military head has been American.
</P>
<P>
   Under the North Atlantic Treaty, it is the civilian secretary
general who tells the military generals what to do, making him the
commander in chief of the world's biggest military alliance. But it
is because NATO operates under rules of consensus that the
secretary general must be a master politician. The secretary
general has to hold together a diverse alliance where ancient
animosities, such as those between Greece and Turkey, and more
recent ones, like the incessant squabbles between the United States
and France, must be put aside.
</P>
<P>
   At 53, Robertson is arguably the best-liked minister in Prime
Minister Tony Blair's Cabinet. His lack of self-importance and his
almost boyish enthusiasm for the defense job he was appointed to in
1997 quickly won over British generals, who are fiercely loyal to
him.
</P>
<P>
   As Lieutenant General Michael Jackson, who leads NATO forces in
Kosovo, put it in April, when Robertson's daily briefings saw him
emerge as the most enthusiastic defender of NATO's war against
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, ``I like Robertson because
what you see is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   What you see is a doughy, ruddy-faced man with a Scottish burr
and a knack for putting people at ease. Robertson is the type, say
those who know him, who would see it not as a slight but as his
good fortune that the initial front-runner for NATO's top job,
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping of Germany, didn't get it because
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder considers Scharping too
valuable to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Blair is not anxious to lose Robertson, aides say, but
Robertson's elevation to NATO fulfills Blair's aim to position
Britain as the bridge between the United States and the rest of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Eyal, director of studies at the Royal United Services
Institute, a London-based military think tank, said Robertson is
ideally suited for NATO's top job.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a personal level, his complete lack of pretension and his
self-deprecating Scottish wit goes over very well with people,''
said Eyal. ``But he is also a policy wonk who has attended every
major international conference on security since the mid-1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Solana, whose past as a socialist who once opposed NATO
made the Americans suspicious, Robertson will take the job with the
confidence of both Americans and Europeans, said Eyal. Britain
stood alone with the United States in launching airstrikes against
Iraq in December, but it has also joined with France in pushing for
a common European defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are the French and Americans comfortable with him,
the new members of NATO from Eastern Europe are elated to have a
Brit as secretary general,'' said Eyal. ``The Eastern Europeans
feared having a German secretary general because they think the
Germans tend to appease the Russians, and think the Brits believe
you sometimes have to stand up to the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Brussels, a NATO diplomat said Robertson's efforts
to increase European defense spending make him equally popular with
the Americans, who want Europe to shoulder more of the cost, and
the French, who think US military dominance leads the Americans to
dictate to their European allies.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks Robertson is good for NATO, or that NATO is
good for Europe. Alice Mahon, a left-wing British Parliament
member, said she found suggestions that Robertson got the job
because he had ``a good war'' distasteful and disturbing. She said
NATO made matters worse in Kosovo, and thinks the saber-rattling
denunciations of Milosevic prolonged the war.
</P>
<P>
   In his new job, Robertson will be judged by his ability to keep
NATO out of conflict, not only with the likes of Milosevic, but
with itself, as an alliance born of the certainties of the Cold War
enters a less-certain 21st century.

WOODS-DUVAL EXHIBITION ESTABLISHES GOLF IN PRIME TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ As a golf match, it could have passed as
a revival meeting. That was fitting, because evangelism was at the
heart of this enterprise. Competition took a back seat _ though few
among the crowd of some 2,000 wanted to _ for the so-called
Showdown at Sherwood Monday night, when Tiger Woods beat David
Duval, 2 and 1, in golf's maiden prime-time telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting,'' said Woods after reasserting his
superiority in this exhibition duel between the world's first- and
second-ranked players. ``First, it was the first time it's ever
been done. Two, it was a different viewing audience.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to those who watched on ABC (which drew a
rating of 6.9, meaning almost 7 million homes were tuned in) but
the assessment just as easily could have applied to the well-heeled
corporate schmoozers who paid between $100 and $550 for the chance
to shed their inhibitions once the cameras rolled.
</P>
<P>
   There was none of the namby-pamby polite applause that greets
the majority of shots, good or bad, in regulation events. These
people were in full bellow mode.
</P>
<P>
   There was no semblance of order, either, in chaotic contrast to
traditional tournament protocol. Course marshals first demanded,
then pleaded for the crowd to remain behind the yellow restraining
ropes, with equal success: They were utterly ignored by the
high-powered customers, who acted as if this were Monday Night
Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   And the match was treated as a block party by some occupants of
the million-dollar homes overlooking Sherwood Country Club from the
Santa Monica Mountains. Cacophonous background sounds of barking
dogs, shrieking children, and full-throated partisanship rained
down from the exclusive perches.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest,'' said Woods, ``I didn't think the crowds would
be that boisterous.''
</P>
<P>
   Riotous was more like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no gray areas,'' he added. ``We were commenting
going down 14, talking about the crowds. They weren't out there
just to watch. They were cheering one way or another. They
definitely had their favorites. He had his crowd, and I had mine.''
</P>
<P>
   It was on that 14th fairway that the rope rogues were joined by
Wayne Gretzky, wearing a T-shirt, shorts, and sandals and toting a
beer as he joined the posse for the remainder of the match.
</P>
<P>
   The retired hockey icon was asked after the match concluded on
the 17th if he had a particular rooting interest. ``Nah,'' he
replied. He was more intent on bumming a ride to the clubhouse from
one of the marshals driving a cart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, this is for Tiger and David,'' the marshal informed
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then can you get us another one?'' asked Gretzky's wife,
Janet.
</P>
<P>
   This was the sort of radical chic Duval had in mind when he
addressed the phenomenon of the atmosphere. The normally stoic PGA
Tour money leader was positively brimming with enthusiasm as he
discussed the game's appeal manifested in this diversion, which
paid $1.1 million to the winner, $400,000 to the loser, and, Duval
hoped, produced incalculable goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   ``My desire, as was (Woods's),'' he said, ``was to bring more
people into it, help it expand. Since Tiger turned pro in '96, pro
golf has gotten a lot more cool, a lot more hip.''
</P>
<P>
   That last word came as a shock to those who assumed Duval
recognized it only as a body part, but he was just getting warmed
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great athletes who retire in other sports (Gretzky, Michael
Jordan, John Elway) now talk about how they're going to play golf
all the time,'' he added. ``It's cool. It's not dorky anymore.''

<P>
   With that in mind, Woods wouldn't be averse to seeing one-on-one
matches like Monday's become more than a curiosity _ and not just
to supplement his bankroll.

<P>
   ``I think it's a wonderful concept,'' he said. ``Maybe it could
become an annual thing. Not necessarily between David and me, but

   It's doubtful they could find anyplace noisier.

Monday captured a solid summer audience.

   The three-hour show on ABC (8-11 p.m.) earned a 6.9 rating and

BRITISH DEFENSE CHIEF SET TO ASSUME NATO LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Reslugging)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A few years ago, George Robertson, the longtime British
lawmaker who lives in the Scottish town of Dunblane, suggested
authorities pull the gun license of a local man named Thomas
Hamilton because Hamilton appeared unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Robertson's caution was warranted, and Hamilton
later used his license to buy the guns that were used to kill 16
schoolchildren and their teacher in one of the worst mass murders
in recent British history.
</P>
<P>
   When someone suggested that Robertson should point out not only
that he had predicted the tragedy but that his local political
rival had refused to endorse his call to pull Hamilton's license,
Robertson wouldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   That story captures the essence of Robertson, who a year after
the tragedy in Dunblane became the British defense minister and who
Wednesday is expected to be named secretary general of NATO. In a
business where blowing one's own horn and being self-centered is
usually part of the job description, Robertson is a politician
whose self-effacing style has defined his career.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 NATO ambassadors who are expected Wednesday to formally
endorse his replacing Javier Solana of Spain, who will become the
European Union's director of foreign and defense policy, will find
in Robertson the quintessential team player. He will become the
10th secretary general, and the third Briton to hold the job.
Throughout its 50-year history, NATO's civilian head has been a
European, while its military head has been American.
</P>
<P>
   Under the North Atlantic Treaty, it is the civilian secretary
general who tells the military generals what to do, making him the
commander in chief of the world's biggest military alliance. But it
is because NATO operates under rules of consensus that the
secretary general must be a master politician. The secretary
general has to hold together a diverse alliance where ancient
animosities, such as those between Greece and Turkey, and more
recent ones, like the incessant squabbles between the United States
and France, must be put aside.
</P>
<P>
   At 53, Robertson is arguably the best-liked minister in Prime
Minister Tony Blair's Cabinet. His lack of self-importance and his
almost boyish enthusiasm for the defense job he was appointed to in
1997 quickly won over British generals, who are fiercely loyal to
him.
</P>
<P>
   As Lieutenant General Michael Jackson, who leads NATO forces in
Kosovo, put it in April, when Robertson's daily briefings saw him
emerge as the most enthusiastic defender of NATO's war against
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, ``I like Robertson because
what you see is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   What you see is a doughy, ruddy-faced man with a Scottish burr
and a knack for putting people at ease. Robertson is the type, say
those who know him, who would see it not as a slight but as his
good fortune that the initial front-runner for NATO's top job,
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping of Germany, didn't get it because
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder considers Scharping too
valuable to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Blair is not anxious to lose Robertson, aides say, but
Robertson's elevation to NATO fulfills Blair's aim to position
Britain as the bridge between the United States and the rest of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Eyal, director of studies at the Royal United Services
Institute, a London-based military think tank, said Robertson is
ideally suited for NATO's top job.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a personal level, his complete lack of pretension and his
self-deprecating Scottish wit goes over very well with people,''
said Eyal. ``But he is also a policy wonk who has attended every
major international conference on security since the mid-1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Solana, whose past as a socialist who once opposed NATO
made the Americans suspicious, Robertson will take the job with the
confidence of both Americans and Europeans, said Eyal. Britain
stood alone with the United States in launching airstrikes against
Iraq in December, but it has also joined with France in pushing for
a common European defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are the French and Americans comfortable with him,
the new members of NATO from Eastern Europe are elated to have a
Brit as secretary general,'' said Eyal. ``The Eastern Europeans
feared having a German secretary general because they think the
Germans tend to appease the Russians, and think the Brits believe
you sometimes have to stand up to the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Brussels, a NATO diplomat said Robertson's efforts
to increase European defense spending make him equally popular with
the Americans, who want Europe to shoulder more of the cost, and
the French, who think US military dominance leads the Americans to
dictate to their European allies.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks Robertson is good for NATO, or that NATO is
good for Europe. Alice Mahon, a left-wing British Parliament
member, said she found suggestions that Robertson got the job
because he had ``a good war'' distasteful and disturbing. She said
NATO made matters worse in Kosovo, and thinks the saber-rattling
denunciations of Milosevic prolonged the war.
</P>
<P>
   In his new job, Robertson will be judged by his ability to keep
NATO out of conflict, not only with the likes of Milosevic, but
with itself, as an alliance born of the certainties of the Cold War
enters a less-certain 21st century.

TEXAS HOPES IT HAS KEY TO COLLEGE GRANT SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Accompanied by BC-COLLEGE-GRANTS-BOX) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RENEE C. LEE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas lawmakers knew they were getting into a potentially
difficult situation this legislative session when they created the
TEXAS Grant program to help low-income students go to college this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   All they had to do was look at other states such as Florida,
Georgia and Louisiana, where similar grant programs have been
developed to open higher-education opportunities to all students
and to keep their best and brightest students in state.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of the grant programs are fairly new, some states
have run into problems, forcing them to make funding and
eligibility adjustments. Many grant programs are funded by state
general revenues, which can create uncertainty in funding when
revenues fluctuate or when scholarship demand exceeds the program's
budget.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, for example, demand for its 2-year-old grant TOPS
program was underestimated. Lawmakers had to call a special session
during the first year of the program to put in an addional $30
million in general revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative was to reduce the number of scholarships
awarded, but state officials were committed to giving every
eligible Louisiana student a grant, said Jack Guinn, executive
director of the Louisiana Office of Student Financial Aid.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's HOPE Scholarship program, which was started in 1993
and has become a national model, has a more stable funding source
with state lottery money. But officials found that many grant
recipients needed remediation in math and English once in college.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this fall, students will have to make a B average or
better in their high school core curriculum to receive the grant.
Before, elective courses such as physical education were considered
in the grade-point average.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials say the TEXAS Grant program (Toward EXcellence
Access and Success), which takes effect this fall, has been
designed to avoid such problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We considered the shortcomings from other state programs, and
we made calculated decisions in drafting the bill,'' said state
Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, a co-sponsor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Cuellar said lawmakers knew they couldn't afford to help every
eligible student pay for college. Such a venture would have
required at least $500 million every two years, he said. So they
decided to focus the state's limited dollars on the students who
are academically prepared but least able to afford college.
</P>
<P>
   It's a move that has won praise from higher-education experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like they've learned from what other states
experienced,'' said Jacqueline King, director of the American
Council on Education. ``What's appealing to me about it is they've
geared it toward achieving a policy goal that's specific.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1999 legislative session, lawmakers allocated $100
million in general revenue during the next two years to provide
10,000 to 11,000 low-income students with grants equal to average
tuition and fees at Texas institutions. Tuition and fees at public
schools are about $2,400 a year. At community colleges, the costs
are about $940 a year.
</P>
<P>
   State officials will award $18 million in scholarships this year
and $33 million next year. The remaining $49 million will be
reserved for the 2000-01 budget to cover renewal grants.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature will decide every two years how much will be
appropriated to the program based on general revenue available. But
lawmakers anticipate allocating another $100 million _ in addition
to the $49 million reserve _ for the program in the 2000-01 budget,
state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Students must graduate from high school with a C average in a
college-preparatory curriculum and demonstrate financial need to
receive the grant. The money will be awarded to the neediest
students first until it is gone.
</P>
<P>
   The annual grants are renewable up to six years as long as the
student maintains a 2.5 grade-point average.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Students can apply for the grants at the institution they plan
to attend this fall. Each school was given an allocation from the
state based on a formula that includes the number of low-income
students the school attracts each year. School officials will then
determine which students qualify, state higher education officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Higher-education experts applaud the Texas program because it's
one of the few that doesn't abandon the premise of financial aid,
which is to help those who most need it.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia and other states, they said, have eliminated most state
need-based programs to support merit-based programs that offer
full-tuition scholarships to every eligible student. The result,
critics say, is that students who least need financial aid often
get the benefits while low-income students are left out because
many can't meet the academic requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not a bad thing to want to support bright
students,'' said Claire Handley, associate director of the Southern
Education Foundation in Atlanta. ``The problem is that very often
our low-income students face a lot of challenges that
upper-middle-income students don't face. Getting to a higher level
of achievement can be more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia HOPE Scholarship program (Helping Outstanding Pupils
Educationally), for example, eliminated its $100,000 family income
cap three years ago. As long as students have a B grade or better,
they qualify for the grant and can renew it every undergraduate
year.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1998-99 school year, 141,174 students received HOPE
Scholarships, totaling $189.2 million, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mortenson, a senior scholar with the Center for the Study of
Opportunity in Higher Education, said the HOPE program has a major
flaw. Under the law, the state scholarship is waived if a student
receives federal financial aid, forcing low-income students to come
up with the difference, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve Tompkins, director of communications for the Georgia
Student Finance Commission, said the rule affects about 10 percent,
or 14,000 to 15,000 students academically eligible for the program,
and would cost the state about $20 million if it were eliminated.
He said Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes is considering repealing the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is being served under the program,'' Tompkins said.
``The results have been SAT scores going up, and academic
achievement is on the minds of parents and students.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinn agreed. He said the benefits from the Louisiana TOPS
program (Tuition Opportunity Program for Students) far outweigh the
criticism. More students are applying for financial aid, and
academic standards are rising, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state average ACT score increased by a tenth of a point last
year after being stagnant for about four years. And that's even
with more students taking the test, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Students who qualify for one of five grants under the TOPS
program must have a 2.5 grade average or better in core curriculum
and have a minimum ACT score of 19.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the program will require freshman students to have a
C average in a college-preparatory curriculum to ensure that they
are prepared for college course work, Guinn said.
</P>
<P>
   But some higher-education experts said it's too early tell how
effective state grant programs are in raising academic standards.
There are many unresolved issues, experts said. The biggest is how
states continue to fund such programs, especially as more students
qualify for scholarships. Officials also need to determine an
appropriate academic bar to avoid excluding students who need
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, at least, officials have tried to remove the barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we look at it, if we can help them come out prepared
for success and then help them afford to go to college, then we've
removed the two greatest obstacles they have in finishing
college,'' said Teri Flack, director of public information for the
Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which will oversee the
Texas program. ``That's the wonderful thing about the bill, is that
it lays the foundation for removing obstacles.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The made-for-TV golf match between Tiger Woods and David Duval
Monday captured a solid summer audience.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour show on ABC (8-11 p.m.) earned a 6.9 rating and
12 share in the overnights, a measure of the 44 largest markets.
Woods's 2-and-1 win did a little better in Boston, pulling a 7.9
rating and 14 share, about 176,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   It was a greater audience than would ever watch the Tour de
France, for example, but the golf pulled fewer households than the
usual ABC Monday fare of made-for-TV movies and ``20/20.''

CHAN GAILEY, JOHNNY OATES ENDURE DAILY INTEGRITY EXAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnny Oates walks a fine line these days. So, obviously, does
Chan Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Personal integrity is a central issue in the professional and
personal lives of both men. And that's not just these days, that's
every day.
</P>
<P>
   But Gailey is a head coach in the NFL. And Oates is a
major-league manager.
</P>
<P>
   In these kinds of jobs, you had better bring your high-wire
shoes. That integrity issue must constantly mesh with the whims and
personal feelings of a clubhouse or locker room full of
large-dollar, jock-world egos.
</P>
<P>
   The media demands that you be honest. The players demand that
you be fair. And ``fair'' to players often translates to being
protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling it a fine line that must be walked is very accurate,''
Gailey said yesterday in Wichita Falls. And that goes double, or
triple, as coach of the Cowboys. This is a franchise that battled
image wars before Gailey arrived, and although his presence might
have helped some in changing public perception, that image war is
not necessarily being won.
</P>
<P>
   Oates and the Rangers are in another world from the Cowboys when
it comes to a do-right reputation. But Oates does have the daily
brush fires he must deal with. Like Juan Gonzalez the past few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Oates has had to be honest with himself and honest to the rest
of the team when dealing with various Juan issues. But at no time
should he allow this to slip him into a ``him or me'' type of
fight. Over the long haul, a manager will not win that kind of
slugfest with a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your guard is always up,'' Oates said, ``because it often
comes down to a question of either losing your integrity or causing
hurt feelings in the clubhouse. Neither one is good. But the answer
to me is rather easy.''
</P>
<P>
   And that answer?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have to apologize for telling the truth,'' Oates
replied. ``As long as I tell the truth, I never have to try and
remember what I said if it comes up a couple of days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the truth hurts, and sometimes it's scary, but when
you are honest, you don't have to backtrack.''
</P>
<P>
   But in dealing with a massive sports media _ as an Oates, a
Gailey, a Ken Hitchcock of the Stars and a Don Nelson of the
Mavericks must do daily in North Texas _ the definition of
``truth'' is often blurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I might not tell \Rthe media\S everything, I'm
not being dishonest,'' Oates said. ``I can say it's a private club
matter, and to me, that's walking the fine line.''
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily, however, in some media opinions. One summer ago
in Wichita Falls, Gailey was under training camp siege after the
neck-slashing in the dorm. At first he described it as
``horseplay,'' but quickly changed to ``It's something that will be
handled within the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was blasted for a ``cover-up'' and stonewalling. The
``horseplay'' comment was a definite mistake. But only two weeks
into his first Cowboys training camp some media members were
questioning his integrity, which Gailey admitted was a first in his
coaching life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be times when I get in a bind,'' Gailey
said yesterday. ``I may stop short of saying everything I know, and
that's not going to please a lot of the media. I will never be
intentionally dishonest, but I will always do what is best for the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, veteran players were saying during the '98 season
that Gailey's public handling of the training camp neck-slashing
incident brought him instant credibility with his new team. There
were also off-the-record comments that, within the privacy of the
team, Gailey was strong and firm in dealing with Michael Irvin's
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not proud of anything that happened in all that,'' Gailey
said. ``But it was dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   More questions do surface, however, on how Gailey balances the
ongoing Leon Lett mess and last week's signing of troubled Alonzo
Spellman with his own credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take each case individually, and judge how it impacts the
team as a whole,'' Gailey said. ``With Leon, there is not one
player grumbling that this guy should not be with us. You know why?
Because no matter how it looks, Leon is not a bad person. I know
there have to be standards. I believe strongly in standards. But
with some players you will try to work through individual
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   As a five-time loser on NFL drug tests, Lett is an anchor who,
perception-wise, hangs heavy on Gailey and owner Jerry Jones. But
Gailey is convinced that he's right. Oates, meanwhile, doesn't have
anything close to a Lett issue, but each day he deals with his
various ordeals.
</P>
<P>
   It's also interesting that Gailey and his wife have become
friends with Oates and his wife. Different sports, but there is
still much in common. Personal integrity is strong in both, but a
daily test always awaits both.
</P>

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Even with all the various versions of ``state''
being bandied about in Taiwan these days, it still comes as a
surprise to hear someone actually talk about statehood. As in,
American statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Yet David Chou comes right out and says it: Taiwan should become
the 51st state of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chou is not joking. He has a plan. It may never work, but just
try telling Chou that. He has been working on it for years.
</P>
<P>
   Chou set up the 51 Club in 1994 to promote his idea. He admitted
51 members. But to him it is not a gimmick. It is a cause. With all
the confusing explanations that Taiwan's government puts forth
about whether it is part of China or something separate, Chou's
unusual proposal is refreshingly straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were a state, our most serious problem _ security _
would be solved,'' said Chou, 49, who looks and sounds considerably
more normal than his proposal might suggest. ``The current
government can't solve it; neither can the opposition. But
statehood can.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has been drowning in political debate since July 9, when
President Lee Teng-hui caused an uproar by saying that from now on
talks with China should be held on the basis of equal states, in a
``special state-to-state relationship.'' Beijing immediately
denounced Lee for trying to thwart China's reunification with the
island, while opinion polls in Taiwan show cautious support for
Lee's statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special state-to-state relations, yes, as a U.S. state,'' Chou
said. ``That's the only state we should want to be, the state of
Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Face facts, Chou says. Taiwan would not exist without the United
States. Ever since 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists
retreated to Taiwan after losing China's civil war to Mao Zedong's
Communists, they have survived by American protection, American
trade and the education of countless Taiwan students in American
universities.
</P>
<P>
   Chou argues that most people here, if given a choice, would
prefer to be American.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in Taiwan are embarrassed to say so,'' Chou
said, whispering conspiratorially. ``The government will never say
so. But it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Chou seems to fancy himself a visionary. He studied law in the
United States, but ended up as a businessman in the toy industry.
He seems fiercely committed to the idea of American statehood, but
is a bit weak on how to organize.
</P>
<P>
   He needs money, he acknowledges. So in July he set up a
foundation called the FormUSA Foundation _ a play on Taiwan's
earlier name, Formosa. So far, it has 18 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Communist Party started with 12,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Will it take as many decades to achieve his goal as it did for
Communist leaders to achieve theirs?
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely, Chou said, but exactly how long depends on Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the PLA has to do is lob a few missiles over, and people
will be swarming to us,'' he said, referring to the People's
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Chou lived and worked in New York, Pennsylvania and California
over a period of 10 years, and he fell in love with what he sees as
a reliable legal system and an open-minded society. His 6-year-old
son was born in the United States, and Chou has big plans for him,
as a naval officer and perhaps one day as commander of the U.S.
Pacific Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that his son has an American passport, giving the
family a measure of security while Chou carries a Taiwan passport
himself, has nothing to do with his efforts to try to get similar
security for his 23 million fellow citizens on Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of Taiwanese have reservations about this,'' he
said. ``They may worry that they'll lose their culture. But I tell
them, you can still eat rice, no one will force you to eat
hamburgers.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 23, when Richard Bush, an American special envoy, came
to Taiwan to meet Lee, Chou organized a tiny demonstration outside
the office that represents U.S. interests here and presented a
petition addressed to President Clinton and leading members of
Congress. It was accepted by Susan Stahl, an American official who
promised to forward it to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   More mainstream Taiwan residents, in random questioning, see the
idea as little more than a bad joke. The Government has yet to
dignify it with a comment. Chou said he thought the Taiwan press
has largely ignored him because it is controlled by the local
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet The China Times, a leading Taiwan newspaper, took him on
with an editorial on July 25, titled ``Who Wants a 51st State?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States allowed far-away Taiwan to become a 51st
state, a lot of small undeveloped African countries would have done
it long ago,'' the editorial said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of Chou's supporters, David Shu, said that, like many young
people here, he used to think that the island should declare formal
independence, since it has been effectively separate from China for
50 years. But he reasoned that if independence is not feasible,
what with China hovering so close by, American statehood is
second-best.
</P>
<P>
   When he tries to sell the idea to friends, Shu said, he compares
Taiwan to a pretty young woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is like a gangster,'' Shu said. ``The United States is
like a policeman. Every time the gangster tries to take the girl in
his arms, she has to call the policeman to come save her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to get the girl married to the policeman,'' he
continued. ``Then there is no danger, and the protection is
permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   Chou put it another way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who goes to America comes back happy,'' said Chou.
``Taiwan cannot be independent, so we have to merge with another
country. Who should it be?''

JOHN LION: A MAKER OF MAGIC ONSTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN WINN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Lion, the founder of San Francisco's Magic Theatre, who
died Sunday at age 55, made his mark in a different era,
introducing the plays of Sam Shepard, David Mamet, Michael McClure,
John O'Keefe and many other playwrights, both famous and forgotten,
to the Bay Area from the 1960s to the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   While Lion, who died of a heart attack in Los Angeles, had
drifted off the local radar screen in the past decade, he had an
enduring influence on the cultural life of the Bay Area and the
country.
</P>
<P>
   As a dedicated and resourceful producer of new plays, Lion
created a climate for avant-garde theater that made the marginal
seem essential. He staked out his turf and defended it with a
tough-guy pugnaciousness in public and tender loyalties behind the
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Today's struggling writers, storefront theaters and performance
artists owe a debt to Lion. So does the Magic itself, which
continues to carry the torch for new writers an astonishing 32
years later and counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's influence was absolutely seminal,'' said O'Keefe
(``Shimmer,'' ``Vid''). ``He produced two of my plays when I was
still a graduate student and sent me on my way as a playwright.''
</P>
<P>
   ``John was one of the creators of the not-for-profit theater in
America,'' said the Magic's current artistic director, Larry
Eilenberg. ``He defined one end of the spectrum and delighted in
thumbing his nose at mainstream society.''
</P>
<P>
   Lion made playgoing daring, hip and intellectually challenging
at a time when the culture was opening up to new ideas. Drawn to
the European absurdists, Lion, a University of California graduate
student at the time, founded the Magic in a Berkeley barroom in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   That was the same year the American Conservatory Theater moved
from Pittsburgh to San Francisco. The Bay Area's new theatrical
establishment and its major alternative arrived together, in what
would prove to be a mutually enriching coincidence. Lion moved his
company across the bay in the 1970s and took up permanent residence
in its two Fort Mason theaters in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Like his contemporaries in New York's Wooster Group and Mabou
Mines, Lion loved experiments in language and form. He produced the
Beat poet Michael McClure, puppet artist Winston Tong and the
austere performance art troupe Soon 3.
</P>
<P>
   Most famously, Lion produced Shepard, then a Mill Valley,
Calif., writer in his pre-Hollywood years. ``Buried Child,'' ``True
West'' and ``Fool for Love,'' among other works, premiered at the
Magic. The company's Shepard casts included Ed Harris, Kathy Baker
and Peter Coyote. While Lion was always firmly writer-centered,
great writing begat great acting, directing and design work when
the Magic was at its best.
</P>
<P>
   The Shepard plays moved on to larger theaters and so,
eventually, did the writer, who stopped opening his works at the
Magic in the early 1980s. A friend said Tuesday that the break with
Shepard was painful for Lion. And the Magic was never quite the
same glamour address without its famous house playwright offering
his new works there.
</P>
<P>
   But Lion, who also directed and acted from time to time, stayed
the course. Murray Mednick, Adele Shank, Wolfgang Bauer, Martin
Epstein, Lynne Kaufman: The list of playwrights who found the door
open to them, and not just for a first play, was a long one.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, as the new writers thinned out or moved to other media
in the 1980s, Lion mounted more and more established playwrights,
even Eugene O'Neill. His support on the theater's board frayed, and
Lion was forced to resign in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Like ACT's Bill Ball and the Berkeley Repertory Theatre's
Michael Leibert, Lion ran into tough times as a founding artistic
director cut loose from his institution. He sold cars for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1994, he picked up where he left off, taking a job
directing the Kennedy Center's American College Theater Festival in
Washington, D.C. The Kennedy Center's Susan Shaffer said Lion was
devoted to nurturing young talent. He increased the festival's
writing awards and added one for Latino playwrights. ``He was a
great champion of playwrights here,'' Shaffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Lion was due to begin a new job this week, as chairman of the
theatre arts and dance department at California State University at
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves behind a wife and four children younger than 12. The
Magic is planning a memorial celebration of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the somber reactions Tuesday, O'Keefe recalled a night when
he, Lion and actor-writers David Schein and Bob Ernst slept on the
Magic's Berkeley stage during a power struggle over control of the
theater. O'Keefe, a wide-eyed newcomer from Iowa, asked about the
future of the already famous Magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at it,'' Lion growled, and rolled over and went
to sleep. To Lion, a theater was never a building. It was always
people and the strange new plays they created together out of their
heads.

   WASHINGTON -- California's Antelope Valley is pushing hard to
host Lockheed Martin's VentureStar project, a privately-funded
attempt to build a fully reusable orbital space craft. The area,
which includes Edwards Air Force base, is already home to the X-33
prototype.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long history of space vehicle construction here and
we think this is a good precursor to get the VentureStar,'' said
Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford, who also noted that Antelope Valley's
nickname is ``aerospace valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 31 possible sites for VentureStar, four are in
California, including Harper Lake in San Bernadino Valley, an area
in Los Angeles County south of Andrew's Air Force Base, Vandenberg
Air Force Base and Castle Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen other states are also competing for the approximately
$5 billion project.
</P>
<P>
   The Lockheed Martin Skunk Works facility, which manages Venture
Star, will not be making a decision on which site gets the project
until 2001, said Gary Grigg, the acting director of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Ledford says that Palmdale's efforts to get the VentureStar
include $800,000 in construction for the X-33, which was a joint
project between Lockheed Martin and NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Ledford pointed to the history of the region as a key selling
point of Antelope Valley. Edwards Air Force Base was home to the
original X planes, including the first supersonic plane, the Bell
X-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a work force that is trained and state-of-the-art
facilities...so it makes sense we get the VentureStar,'' Ledford
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Johnston, a director of aerospace with the nearby city of
Lancaster, is very excited about the economic benefits that could
come with the VentureStar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking a potential multi-billion dollar industry,
which would have a major impact on the economy,'' Johnston said.
``It would not go unnoticed.'' Johnston added the valley's
geography lends itself to the project's main criteria: safety
combined with access to trained personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have kind of a mixed bag here,'' he said. ``We are remote
enough to avoid a heavy population being affected... and our
highway and freeway infrastructure help us.''

</P>
<P>
   The VentureStar is designed to be a reduce costs in space travel
by being completely reusable. The vehicle would not use expendable
fuel tanks and rocket boosters, as the current NASA space shuttle
does. It could replace the space shuttle in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Haystack Butte on Andrew's Air Force Base already hosts the X-33
prototype. The delta-shaped craft is one-half the size, one-ninth
the weight and one-fourth the cost of the VentueStar vehicle. Its
primary purpose is to give Lockheed Martin a way to predict how the
much larger VentureStar will perform under similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The Haystack site is 40 miles northeast of the Lockheed Martin
Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, CA. A series of test flights for
the X-33 are planned for summer of 2000 at the $32 million flight
operations center built on Andrew's Air Force Base just for the
X-33.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation is working with NASA on the X-33, but the
VentureStar will be built without government funding.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed may choose two sites eventually because there will be
three or four VentureStar vehicles built, spokesman Grigg said,
making a second site economically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   If a second site is chosen, it is not clear if it will be chosen
at the same time as the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The robustness of the industry in the area is certainly a
factor,'' Grigg said of California's strengths of their bid. ``The
weather is also generally good.''
</P>
<P>
   Grigg stressed that the competitive phase of the site selection
process has not really begun, as information is still being
collected on all of the possible choices.

CAMBODIAN LAW WOULD POSTPONE TRIAL OF KHMER ROUGE COMMANDER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ The Cambodian government moved Tuesday to
postpone a trial for a Khmer Rouge commander, endorsing a law that
would extend his pretrial detention period to three years from six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law, which would apply to people charged with
genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity, was endorsed by
the two leading parties and is due for a vote in Parliament next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodian and foreign experts said the motives of the government
were unclear. The legal change does not appear to affect
preparations for a trial of the commander, Ta Mok, for the crimes
of the Khmer Rouge, which caused the deaths of more than a million
people when they held power from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Ta Mok, a longtime Khmer Rouge leader with a reputation for
brutality, was arrested in March, and the government faced a
deadline in early September to bring him to trial.
</P>
<P>
   It planned to try him only on a charge of violating a 1994 law
banning membership in the Khmer Rouge. A conviction would allow his
long-term detention during preparations for a second trial on the
more serious charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see any problem with that,'' a Western diplomat said.
``They can make the first trial as quick and clean as they want and
lock him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Hun Sen has said he supports a proposal for a
tribunal to be held in a Cambodian court but with technical
assistance from the United Nations. The United Nations has promised
to send legal advisers soon to Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   But Hun Sen also was behind the move to lengthen pretrial
detention and postpone Ta Mok's appearance in court.
</P>
<P>
   Ta Mok is one of two high-ranking Khmer Rouge officials, along
with the prison commandant known as Duch, who are now awaiting
trial. As the Khmer Rouge collapsed over the last three years,
several other top leaders have been allowed to rejoin society and
have not been arrested.

   &QL;   &QL;  &UR; NASA FUNDING FIGHT FAR FROM OVER &QL;   &UR; By Jonathan Lipman &QL;  &QC; 
States News Service &QL;  &QC;  WASHINGTON, Aug. 3 One chapter in the NASA
budget fight will close this week, but another part will stretch
into September, congressional sources said, as the two houses of
Congress each proceed on their spending bills. The House
Appropriations committee voted for a $1 billion cut in the space
agencys budget last Friday, but the bill must still come to the
full House for a vote. The NASA spending bill will come to the
House floor by Thursday, said Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for
Majority Leader Richard Armey, R- Texas. A final vote is expected
on the same day, or possibly Friday. It will definitely be over
before recess, Davis said. The Senate committee has not even
written their version of the bill, and wont until September, said
Dan Hubbard, a spokesman for subcommittee chairman Kit Bond, R-Mo.
We know it will be after the recess, but more than that I have no
idea, Hubbard said. Most senators on the spending committee have
refused to comment until they actually take up the bill. In the
meantime, they say, there are other priorities in Congress.

NOT-SO-COMIC STRIPS THAT ACT OUT BIG SOCIAL ISSUES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ill.)  (af) 
 Ann Wilson Lloyd's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was on
summer art exhibitions in Provincetown. Mass.  
 By ANN WILSON LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Laylah Ali's cheery little gouache-on-paper drawings, skinny
characters with bulbous heads and colorful uniforms trade
hostilities in regimented ways that resemble team sports. Both
``sides'' are frequently masked like burglars. Perpetrators in one
frame of her cartoon-strip-like works are likely to be victims in
the next.
</P>
<P>
   In a style as innocuous as the Sunday funnies, they might be
shown strung upside down, whipped, shrouded, straitjacketed or
impaled.
</P>
<P>
   No text bubbles explain these ambiguous goings-on. Instead Ms.
Ali, who is based in Boston, and whose first solo museum show opens
Saturday at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, invites
viewers to supply narratives.
</P>
<P>
   They're advised, however, to look for metaphoric rather than
literal meanings. About the big-headed figures she says: ``I think
of them as being very cerebral, smart and doing problematic things,
like in real life. We pretend it's people who don't think about
things who are causing trouble. Real trouble is often meticulously
planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Her series subtitles _ ``Greenheads,'' ``Blueheads'' _ invoke
the insect world, but the figures' precisely drawn poses and
gestures are clearly human. ``Each character has a personality,''
she explains, ``though I'm not creating a little fantasy world.
They are very much related to the world in which I live _ and to
the weird, unpredictable complexity of human encounters and
responses to other people's race, gender and sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   This accounts, perhaps, for subtle echoes of media images in the
work, particularly from news reports of strife between ethnic and
racial groups. ``I am interested in the idea of parallel societies
and assimilation; how different groups and individuals appear to be
working together, but how that is often subverted,'' Ms. Ali says.
``The idea of secret populations implies a certain clandestine
potential for power.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather Felty, a curatorial assistant at the Museum of
Contemporary Art, calls Ms. Ali a provocative artist who combines
strong esthetics with even stronger subject matter. ``Her work
questions social structures, racial perceptions and complicated
power struggles behind basic interactions,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ali's work is included, appropriately, in the Altoids
Curiously Strong Collection now traveling around the country, and
is also featured in an annual show of New England artists at the
DeCordova Museum and Sculpture Park in Lincoln, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The picture-book clarity of Ms. Ali's work comes from a refined,
flat graphic quality, delicate brushwork and a crisp palette
dominated by greens and blues. ``I get many of my color and costume
ideas from what people are wearing on the subway,'' Ms. Ali says.
``I look at everything, really _ ancient Egyptian art, Persian
miniatures, advertising, newspaper photos, TV.''
</P>
<P>
   As an art form, the seemingly simple comic strip is a format
used effectively for complex subjects by Art Spiegelman, Keiji
Nakazawa and Joe Sacco, all of whom Ms. Ali cites as influences.
``They are artists who have taken cartoons to a level that unnerves
and prods,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1968, Ms. Ali's generation came of age in the aftermath
of groundswell social revolutions like civil rights and feminism.
The vague, confusing actions depicted in her works comment on mixed
messages she perceives as society's rules continue to shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching footage and hearing speeches from the civil rights
era were extremely influential on my politics and aspirations while
growing up,'' Ms. Ali says. ``But it also created a model for
social revolution that has been impossible to recreate in the 1980s
and 1990s. The impulses for social change are still there, but less
connected and thus less politically influential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think my work is about the desire to take radical
action. Or to create heroes who come to save the day. But the
violence _ it rarely seems to work out for the best in the
drawings.''

MYSTERY WRITERS HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD IN THE FICTION MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a summer when Thomas Harris' ``Hannibal,'' Janet Evanovich's
``High Five'' and Mary Higgins Clark's ``We'll Meet Again'' have
taken turns atop the bestseller lists, with Patricia Cornwell's
just-released ``Black Notice'' about to take its turn, it's no
mystery what kind of novel Americans are reading most.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the so-called ``whodunits'' have done
it. More and more readers are turning to mystery novels as their
fiction of preference, and some industry insiders now estimate that
one of every five or six novels published is a mystery book.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been a strong market for mysteries; now there
is a constantly burgeoning market,'' said John Cunningham, an
editor at St. Martin's Press. ``When you crunch the numbers of
what's selling best, it can get pretty obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   It is so obvious to St. Martin's that the publisher has
established Picador, a new imprint that will publish mystery novels
exclusively beginning next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll put out 45-48 hardcover (mysteries) this fall alone,''
Cunningham said. ``If people are reading more and more mysteries,
we want to publish more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most critics date the emergence of the modern mystery novel to
the 1840s, when Edgar Allan Poe published ``The Murders in the Rue
Morgue'' and ``The Purloined Letter,'' both featuring an amateur
sleuth named C. Auguste Dupin who solved crimes by means of
``ratiocination,'' or deductive reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Conan Doyle expanded the mystery market in the late 1880s
with Sherlock Holmes. Dashiell Hammett introduced the hard-boiled
private eye in the 1920s, Agatha Christie's Miss Marple popularized
female investigators in 1930, and Ian Fleming and John LeCarre
widened the genre to include spies in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But never before have readers been offered so many mysteries and
sleuths to choose from in print, and they're responding by buying
the whodunits and clamoring for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be (that) the main market for mysteries consisted
of women of a certain age, maybe from 30 to 60,'' said Geraldine
Galentree, manager of The Mystery Bookstore in Dallas. ``Now there
are more men, more kids. I think it is because this is a time of
people looking for respite from the real world. In mysteries, it's
almost always true the villain is caught and punished. I've been
selling books since 1970, and it's reasonable to say mystery sales
have easily grown by 50 percent during that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles F. Adams, a senior editor at Simon &AMP; Schuster, added
that the mystery market is growing as sales for more mainstream
fiction have diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one reason it is now easier for first novelists to get
published by writing mystery novels,'' Adams said. ``Mystery fans
are much more eager to seek out new authors. Readers of more
traditional fiction tend to stick with writers they already know.
So that leads to more expansion of the mystery market.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellie Lutz, an independent book industry analyst in New York,
believes mysteries are selling better than ever because there are a
variety of protagonists in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until, say, 10 years ago, most of the heroes were white males
who talked tough and who had women swooning all over them,'' she
said. ``Now you've got these strong, intelligent, talented women _
Kay Scarpetta in Patricia Cromwell's books, Stephanie Plum in Janet
Evanovich's series, though Stephanie is also sort of a klutz. With
more variety of protagonists, more readers can enjoy escapism, sort
of daydreaming about being the star of the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate Miciak, senior editor at Bantam Dell, credits literary form
as the reason for mystery novels' continued appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a beautiful literary device,'' Miciak said. ``The
open question of who did it drives a book from the first to the
last page. That's why there isn't a publishing house in town that
isn't aggressively seeking out suspense novels. Publishers know
ahead of time what a mystery title's audience is, and that audience
is a huge one.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they have the advantage of a growing market, Adams says
that modern-day mystery writers also face a built-in disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to break a mystery writer into the mainstream
market,'' he said. ``Mystery readers tend to only read mysteries.
It takes a lot of time for a Mary Higgins Clark, a Patricia
Cornwell, a Sue Grafton to get noticed and read by those so-called
`mainstream' readers, the ones who might not usually believe a
mystery novel is quality literature.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an ever-more-frustrating real world, Cunningham believes
that mystery writers have discovered the solution to near-eternal
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries work as escapist fiction, but beyond that they
engage a reader's mind in a way other commercial fiction does
not,'' he said. ``Scattered clues throughout the book make you pay
attention to detail. It's near-complete intellectual involvement,
and that's what reading is supposed to be all about.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The promise of the space business was shown
recently when Hughes Electronics announced a $1.5 billion
investment from America Online to deliver Internet service via
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The pitfalls of the space business were seen the same day when
Hughes disclosed, much more quietly, problems in manufacturing
satellites that would cause it to write off $125 million and take a
big quarterly loss.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the latest in a series of setbacks for Hughes, the
unit of General Motors Corp. that is the nation's largest satellite
company. Last year one of its satellites failed in orbit, knocking
out paging service for most of the nation. Another satellite blew
up when a rocket exploded. The company's assistance to China in
analyzing launch failures has placed it under criminal
investigation for violation of national security laws. And the
resulting furor in Washington forced Hughes to forfeit a $450
million contract for an Asian satellite system.
</P>
<P>
   As Hughes goes, so goes the satellite industry. Rarely, it
seems, has an industry been blessed with so much potential and
cursed with so many problems. Manufacturing glitches and rocket
failures have made it more difficult and costly to get satellites
into the sky. Tighter export controls in the wake of the
controversy about technology leaks to China are slowing projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events of the last year have created higher hurdles for
the companies to get the work done,'' said Clayton Mowry, executive
director of the Satellite Industry Association, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest problem is that Iridium LLC, which owns a
66-satellite system offering worldwide mobile telephone service,
has failed to attract subscribers and is struggling to stave off
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   All these problems have taken some of the bloom off the
commercial satellite business, which has only recently surpassed
the government-owned satellite market in size. Investors are
becoming wary of pumping billions of dollars into numerous systems
to provide telephone service or high-speed data transmission. Many
projects will be scaled back or might never get off the ground,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ICO Global Communications, which is developing a satellite-based
phone service to compete with Iridium, failed to raise the $500
million it sought from a public rights offering despite extending
the deadline twice. It is now scrambling to raise money from
unnamed investors. If ICO fails, Hughes, which is building the
satellites for it, could have to write off as much as $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   And Boeing Co. has, for now, shelved plans to buy a controlling
stake in Ellipso, another company planning a satellite-based
telephone system.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Mowry and many other executives and analysts shrug off
various problems as short-term ones. ``I don't think the problems
we're facing today are any more severe than the industry faced
after the Challenger explosion,'' said Hughes chairman Michael
Smith. ``This is a risky business, and we've never said anything
but. But it's also high-reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kaimowitz, an analyst at ING Baring Furman Selz, was even
more upbeat, saying, ``Everything in the industry is going great
right now.'' He expects the global industry to grow 12.8 percent a
year from its current size of $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the nation's two
biggest aerospace companies, are trying hard to move into
commercial satellite communications, which is potentially
faster-growing and more profitable than military contracting.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed, with a new division called Lockheed Martin Global
Telecommunications, is trying to buy Comsat for $2.7 billion and
has joined forces with TRW Corp. and Telecom Italia to develop
Astrolink, a $3.6 billion system to deliver Internet service and
high-speed data from satellites. Boeing is developing a satellite
system to provide Internet service to airline passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent technical problems, in fact, seemed to be caused by
a rush to fill orders. ``The development capability is stretched to
the thinnest,'' said Smith of Hughes. ``We had gotten to the point
where we skipped tests, and that's not wise.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been six well-publicized rocket failures in the last
year, prompting investigations by the Pentagon and by rocket makers
Lockheed and Boeing. There have also been ``more in-orbit satellite
failures than we have been used to in the past,'' said Rick Hauck,
president of Axa Space, a space insurance underwriter in Bethesda,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes had component failures in six satellites in orbit in the
last year, though only the paging satellite failed completely.
Lockheed Martin reported a second-quarter loss, in part because
orders for satellites dropped and component defects caused a
six-month manufacturing delay.
</P>
<P>
   Launches are also being postponed. Arianespace, the European
launch company, was supposed to have conducted six launches so far
this year but has handled only two because the satellites are not
ready.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the big money to be made is not in building and launching
satellites, but in offering services using them, and that is where
investors focus most attention.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hughes' share price _ it trades as a tracking stock,
GM's class H stock _ has held steady despite its satellite problems
because of its DirecTV division, which delivers dozens of digital
channels to 18-inch home dishes by satellite. Cai von Rumohr, an
analyst at S.G. Cowen &AMP; Co., estimates that the domestic DirecTV
business is worth as much as $50 of Hughes' share price, which
closed Tuesday at $53.6875.
</P>
<P>
   DirecTV's rival, Echostar Communications Corp., a service
company not weighed down by satellite manufacturing, has seen its
stock zoom from a low of less than $9 a share a year ago to a high
of $88.25 in July, although it has now dropped to $71.50.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Neither DirecTV, with 7.5 million customers, nor Echostar, with
2.6 million, is profitable yet. But each is adding 100,000
subscribers a month and is on track to move into the black in a
year or so.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite TV business has a lot going for it. Through
mergers, the industry has already shrunk from five players to two.
And broadcasting, which involves one-way transmission from a single
source to many receivers, is well suited for satellite technology.
A single satellite in geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the
earth can beam its signal to much of the nation, much as a
spotlight beam widens as it gets farther from its source.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the satellite-based telephone business has not yet
gone through a consolidation. And using a broad beam to carry
telephone conversations, which go between two points, does not seem
to make as much intuitive sense. Moreover, the calls are two-way,
meaning the telephones must transmit to the satellite as well as
receive.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Iridium failure is more serious than the industry's
recent technical problems because it raises questions about the
fundamental demand for satellite services.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium's system, which cost $5 billion, is designed to allow
calls to be made or received anywhere in the world. But Iridium,
which began service in November, had only 10,300 subscribers at the
end of March _the last figures it has announced _ far short of the
52,000 called for in its agreements with lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Iridium World Communications, the U.S. arm of Iridium
LLC, have dropped 82.5 percent in the year to date, though its
close of $6.90625 a share, is up from the 52-week low of $4.96875
in June. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, Iridium's biggest backer with an 18 percent stake, has
said it will not put in more money unless other backers do as well.
So Iridium is scrambling to restructure its finances and avoid
bankruptcy or liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium has suffered from technical glitches and marketing
errors. Its phones are bulky compared with cellular phones and
initially cost about $3,000. Calls cost around $7 a minute. And
because an uninterrupted line of sight between the phone and the
satellite is needed, Iridium calls can be made from the top of
Mount Everest _ but not from inside buildings, inside cars or even
on city streets near tall buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, cellular service has spread rapidly since Iridium was
conceived and standards now allow some phones to be used in more
than one country, reducing the need for satellite phones.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium has now slashed the price of phone service to about $3 a
minute and the price of phones to less than $1,000, and its
executives hope for a turnaround. ``In the last six months we were
in a trial launch mode when we told the whole world we were in full
commercial launch,'' said chief executive John Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors are making multibillion-dollar bets that Iridium's
failure is the result of poor execution, not lack of demand. Next
up is Globalstar Telecommunications, a company backed primarily by
Loral Space &AMP; Communications that plans to begin service in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar and some other satellite phone services on the
drawing board intend to serve not only business executives but also
remote villages in the developing world not reached by wires. Even
when people in these villages cannot afford their own telephone, a
phone booth can be set up in the village center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 3.5 billion people who don't have any communication
in a modern sense,'' said Bernard Schwartz, chairman and chief
executive of both Loral and Globalstar, calling this ``probably the
largest market in the world today.''
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar recently arranged a bank credit line of $500 million,
giving it the final financing needed to begin service. Its stock
has been doing relatively well, even as Iridium's has collapsed and
ICO's has dropped by half since its initial offering last year.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar's phones will initially be priced at $1,100, and air
time will sell for only about 65 cents a minute retail. An ING
Barings report says that since Globalstar and ICO will have more
capacity than Iridium, Globalstar could break even selling service
wholesale for 14 cents a minute and ICO for 23 cents, compared with
$1.37 for Iridium.
</P>
<P>
   Similar questions about demand are facing companies that plan to
deliver high-speed data and Internet service by satellite. The
biggest gamble here is Teledesic, the company backed by cellular
telephone magnate Craig McCaw and Microsoft chairman Bill Gates.
Teledesic plans a $10 billion system of 288 satellites that will
begin service in 2004. Motorola, despite the problems with Iridium,
is Teledesic's prime contractor and has committed to invest $750
million in it. Over all, Teledesic has raised more than $1.5
billion so far.
</P>
<P>
   But satellite services are in a race with cable and phone
companies to provide high-speed Internet access. Phone and cable
companies have an economic advantage in urban areas, while
satellites probably have one in less dense areas.
</P>
<P>
   Teledesic is also facing competition from less costly systems,
some of which will be in operation before it is. These include
Hughes' $1.5 billion Spaceway, the Lockheed-led Astrolink, and the
$4 billion Skybridge, which is backed by Alcatel of France.
Teledesic, though, argues that its system will provide Internet
service quality unavailable from the others.
</P>
<P>
   With such sums being wagered, one thing is certain. As Schwartz
of Loral put it: ``It's a large business. Our failures are going to
be large. Our successes are going to be large.''

BAT ADVANCES ON PHILIP MORRIS AS BIGGEST CIGARETTE MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Brushing aside falling sales and legal challenges to
big tobacco, British American Tobacco PLC said Tuesday that it
would buy the 58 percent stake of Imasco Ltd. of Canada it does not
already own for $6.8 billion. The deal reflects British American's
goal of displacing Philip Morris Co. as the world's largest
cigarette maker.
</P>
<P>
   The British company also shook up Canadian bankers by announcing
that it would recoup part of the cost of the Imasco purchase by
selling Imasco's nontobacco businesses in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Included would be the sale of Canada Trust, the nation's oldest
and largest trust company, to Toronto Dominion Bank for about $5.4
billion, which would significantly strengthen Toronto Dominion's
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Since its $8.2 billion acquisition of Rothmans last month,
British American Tobacco has ranked as the world's second-largest
cigarette maker with its own brands like Lucky Strike and Rothmans'
brands, including Dunhill, giving it 16 percent of the market,
compared with Philip Morris' 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of the Montreal-based Imasco, which produces the du
Maurier and Player's brands, would give British American Tobacco
two-thirds of Canadian sales. Although the acquisition would only
marginally increase its global market share, British American
Tobacco's chairman, Martin Broughton, said it represented a further
step in the company's ``strategy to become the world's leading
international tobacco company.''
</P>
<P>
   British American Tobacco began its push in 1997 and intensified
the efforts last September when BAT Industries PLC shed its
financial services arm.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition announced Tuesday valued Imasco shares at $40.34
Canadian, or about $27 U.S., an almost 25 percent premium over
Imasco's price before British American confirmed in June that it
might seek such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Imasco's shares fell more than 6 percent, to $38.90
Canadian, on the Toronto Stock Exchange, as investors who had
bought on anticipation of a deal sold to lock in profits.
</P>
<P>
   British American shares fell 3.5 percent here, to 5.165 pounds,
or $8.37. Part of the decline was attributed to the company's
separate announcement that first-half earnings fell 7.5 percent to
$451 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry analysts called the market reaction a temporary
setback that did not reflect the potential for growth in the
business, primarily in developing countries. ``I think this will be
the nadir in the trading environment,'' said Jonathan Fell of
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts said the acquisition would enhance British
American Tobacco's earnings, Broughton, the chairman, painted a
gloomier picture. ``We have anticipated that the world's cigarette
market would remain flat in volume terms in 1998,'' he said. ``It
is now apparent that total world market shipments have declined
significantly in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   The company attributed the earnings decline to setbacks
including a restored sales tax in Brazil, weak markets in Asia and
costs associated with last year's tobacco industry settlement of
health-related litigation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The results did not take into account last month's merger with
Rothmans.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, the implications of the Imasco deal were far more
significant to the financial services industry. Under the terms,
Toronto Dominion Bank will acquire CT Financial Services, the
parent of Canada Trust, the country's largest nonbank financial
institution.
</P>
<P>
   It has 12,000 employees, 420 branches, $46 billion in assets and
a reputation for innovation in retail banking.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Dominion is Canada's fifth-largest bank, with assets of
$190 billion Canadian, or $125.4 billion U.S. Combined with Canada
Trust, it would vault into the No. 2 position in key categories
including mutual fund holdings, personal deposits and residential
mortgages. But it would climb only one notch when measured by total
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal Department of Finance last year turned down
two mergers proposed by Canada's largest banks, analysts said they
thought that Toronto Dominion Bank would be allowed to acquire CT
Financial. Toronto Dominion is the smallest of the big Canadian
banks, they said, and the combination would not result in unfair
market power. The analysts said the agreement also had a good
chance of approval by Canadian regulators because it would leave
Canada Trust under Canadian ownership.

STUDY SHOWS EDUCATION BENEFITS FROM CAMPUS DIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Offering a defense of affirmative action just as it is most
under attack, a Harvard University survey released Tuesday shows
what its authors say is the first significant evidence that racial
diversity on campus improves the educational experience and
intellectual growth of minority and white students.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallup poll of students at two of the nation's most
prominent law schools addresses the issue that courts have raised
in striking down racial preferences: What, beyond warm and vague
notions, is the educational value of diversity?
</P>
<P>
   As the first survey of its kind, the findings are expected to be
widely used in defending court challenges to affirmative action,
including a closely-watched case at the University of Michigan to
be argued this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best evidence we have had in 21 years,'' said Gary
Orfield, coauthor of the report documenting the survey results and
co-director of the Harvard Civil Rights Project. ``We actually
found out the difference diversity makes, in terms of the effect on
education, the effect on personal development, which are the basic
goals of educational institutions. It has a bigger effect on more
groups, on more issues, than people have ever realized.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey asked 1,820 students at Harvard and Michigan law
schools a series of questions about how racial diversity affects
their educational experience, including how it specifically affects
the way they learn about such issues as civil rights, criminal
justice, and economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The students surveyed, about 60 percent of them white, had
largely attended segregated schools before college or law school.
About 70 percent of the students said that the racial diversity of
their law school classes had enhanced or moderately enhanced how
they and their peers thought about problems and solutions in class.
Between 60 and 70 percent, depending on the campus, said diversity
had clearly or moderately enhanced classroom discussion. And almost
three-quarters of students said that having students of a different
race in class was a ``clearly positive'' element of their
educational experience.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of students said having discussions with law
school peers of different races had changed their view of the
criminal justice system. And about the same percentage said that
diversity in class had changed their view of the issues ``that need
to be considered in resolving serious conflicts over rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey also compared student experience in all-white classes
with the experience in diverse classrooms. In diverse classrooms,
47 percent of students said, there was ``more serious discussion of
alternative perspectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Orfield noted that top law school students might be expected to
be more open-minded about diversity and affirmative action. But the
change in attitudes, he said, happened during law school. And even
those students who did not endorse affirmative action, he said,
acknowledged that racial diversity improved their educational
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We show huge numbers of people changing not only their minds,
but their values,'' he said. ``Affirmative action is usually
treated as if it's something that is a gain for minorities and a
loss for whites, but this...clearly shows the group that has the
weakest experience with diversity growing up are whites. They
perceive a really strong gain when they are in a diverse classroom.
It is not a zero sum game, it's a positive sum game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's Bakke decision in 1978 allowed schools to
use race-sensitive admissions because, Justice Lewis Powell said,
diversity was a clearly justified goal in the classroom. But recent
lower federal court cases have called the value of diversity into
question.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 case in Texas found that diversity was not worthy goal.
Just last month, a Georgia case said that schools needed to prove
that diversity had more than just speculative good effects. And in
striking down race-sensitive admissions policies at Boston Latin
school, the first circuit court of appeals said it was too abstract
to merely have expert witnesses argue that diversity ``nourishes
the intellect'' or ``furthers mutual understanding and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An inquiring court cannot content itself with abstractions,''
the judges wrote. ``To persuade us that diversity may serve as a
justification...the school committee must do more than ask us
blindly to accept its judgement. It must give substance to the
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say that if any of those cases reach the Supreme
Court, the Bakke defense of affirmative action could be completely
overturned unless the schools can prove the value of diversity. The
Boston School Committee declined to challenge the first circuit
decision before the Supreme Court, fearing that unless the
committee could show the value of diversity, it would lose the
case, prompting the elimination of affirmative action in schools
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But the Harvard survey drew some criticism Tuesday. The Civil
Rights Project is generally thought of as a defender of affirmative
action programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if it could be shown convincingly that there are great
educational benefits that stem specifically from racially
preferential admissions policies, that would be important to the
courts,'' said Stephan Thernstrom, Winthrop professor of history at
Harvard, and the author of a 1998 article on affirmative action's
effects on law schools. ``But I don't think that if this is
introduced in court that it's likely to be very persuasive to
anyone who's not already a true believer.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, Thernstrom argued, defined diversity too vaguely.
And proof of educational benefit, he said, should be shown in test
scores or other specifically educational outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in any of these questions that deals with
what I think is quite critical, which is what images do these
students have of the intellectual capacity of their black and
Hispanic classmates? One of the central arguments against these
policies is, if you bring in these students whose scores and grades
are not up to the average, they're going to end up at the bottom of
the class. If you think there's a problem of blacks being
stereotyped, these policies can only reinforce that.''

INDONESIAN CHIEF ACCEPTS VOTE IN WHICH HIS PARTY WAS BESTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Stepping in to end nearly two months of
delays and squabbling by elections officials, Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie on Tuesday officially accepted the results of a
Parliamentary election June 7.
</P>
<P>
   The focus now moves to an even more complicated and contentious
stage in the long process of choosing the country's first freely
elected president in four decades. Months of intraparty battles,
back-room deals and coalition building lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result of the ballot is very clear,'' Habibie said,
referring to a count in which his party, Golkar, placed second,
with 22 percent. The Indonesian Democratic Party for Struggle,
which is the party of his main challenger, Megawati Sukarnoputri,
finished first, with nearly 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But very little else is clear.
</P>
<P>
   In this newly open process, every stage is an experiment. And in
many stages, the rules and regulations are being created, even as
the process unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   The allocation of Parliamentary seats, following an almost
incomprehensible formula, will veer away from the percentages that
Habibie confirmed today. And in the end, neither party, in the
48-party field, can be sure of victory in the next stages of the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   That race now appears too close to call, a Western diplomat
said. In the case that they are even, the diplomat said, the
Parliamentary voting bloc of the armed forces will decide the
outcome. So far, it has played a painstakingly neutral role, and
political analysts disagree over which side it might favor.
</P>
<P>
   Before that _ or any other scenario _ can occur intense battles
will have to be fought all around this energized and fractious
nation. It will be a striking spectacle, given the stifling of most
political activity throughout the 32 years of one-man rule by
President Suharto, who was forced from power in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   His vice president, Habibie, succeeded him as president and as
the presidential candidate of his governing party, Golkar, in the
current election. His political nemesis, Mrs. Megawati, became the
rallying point for angry and frustrated Indonesians from all across
the political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the political battles lies the continuing possibility of
real violence on the streets. Most analysts point to the committed
and emotional supporters of Mrs. Megawati, convinced by the vote
count that she has won, as a possible source of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the armed forces, Gen. Wiranto, took the occasion
Tuesday to issue a warning. ``There are indications of certain
groups preparing to mobilize the masses to strengthen their
opinion,'' Wiranto told reporters. ``This has the potential to
cause clashes or riots.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens in the streets, there is sure to be
political turmoil for months to come. The infighting in the
Electoral Commission over the last two months has been an unhappy
omen, with individual ambitions and party rivalries' paralyzing the
process.
</P>
<P>
   As the schedule now stands, the president is to be chosen in
November by a 700-member electoral assembly that convenes in
October. The election that was ratified Tuesday produced a
Parliament that will make up just 462 of those members.
</P>
<P>
   In view of the complex formula to allocate seats, experts are
still uncertain just how the leading parties will be represented.
The new issue of the Tempo weekly news magazine estimated that Mrs.
Megawati's party would win 154 seats, compared with 120 for Golkar.
A foreign electoral expert calculated the outcome at 156-126.
</P>
<P>
   The next battle will be within the parties, which have the right
to select the representatives who will hold the seats. ``That could
get very messy and very complicated,'' the Western diplomat said.
``The parties can manipulate their lists any way they choose.''
</P>
<P>
   The election in June also produced local assemblies in each of
the 27 provinces. The assemblies have to convene and choose five
members each, for a total of 135, to join the electoral assembly in
October. But first each provincial assembly has to decide on its
method of selecting its delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could take a long time,'' the diplomat said. ``They've
got to set up their own rules. There's going to be a lot of
infighting, a lot of machinations.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of the provincial representatives are quite likely to
be members of the armed forces, increasing the military's bloc from
its statutory base of 38 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The national Election Commission, the same body that could not
agree to endorse the June vote, has the task of selecting the
organizations that will choose 65 members of professional and
social groups to join the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   When the assembly does take shape, one of its first orders of
business will be to set its rules. The most crucial will be whether
the final presidential vote among its 700 members will be open or
secret. That is a highly emotional issue. The problem is that in
this experimental process nobody can be sure whether an open or a
secret ballot will favor a more democratic outcome.

GENETICALLY ENGINEERED RICE CAN BUILD VITAMIN A 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ A bright yellow-tinted rice genetically engineered
to have a vitamin A derivative _ with two genes from a daffodil and
one from a bacterium _ may help reduce vitamin A deficiency, a
problem that is particularly severe in developing countries where
the major staple food is rice, Swiss and German researchers said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While vitamin A deficiency is virtually unheard of in the United
States and other industrialized countries, 1 to 3 million children
die each year from a lack of the vitamin, which is essential for
proper functioning of the immune system. Vitamin A deficiency,
linked to a variety of infectious dieseases, is also the leading
cause of blindness in children in the developing world. According
to UNICEF, supplementation with vitamin A is estimated to lower a
child's risk of dying from several diseases by about 23 percent.
More than 100 million pre-school-age children suffer from vitamin A
deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of work, Ingo Potrykus of the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology's Institute for Plant Sciences in Zurich,
and his colleagues in Freiburg, Germany, achieved production of
beta-carotene, which converts to vitamin A in the body, in rice
grain by adding three genes to rice plants. The results were
announced at the XVI International Botanical Congress in St. Louis,
where more than 4,000 scientists are meeting this week to discuss
the latest results of plant research.
</P>
<P>
   Rice plants normally produce beta carotene, but only in the
green parts of the plant, not in the component of rice grain eaten
by humans. Beta carotene is found in dark green, leafy vegetables,
and is responsible for the yellow and orange color in fruits and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first successful beta carotene rice grains have not
yet gone through animal or human testing, scientists and public
health experts believe the results will be ``encouraging.''
Potrykus predicts that the yellow rice should be in the hands of
farmers within the next two to four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the rice is acceptable to the children, it could
immediately begin to make a difference. ... This is a tremendously
important advancement and an extremely valuable tool,'' said Dr.
Alfred Sommer, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and
Public Health, who led the research that linked vitamin A to higher
death rates in children.
</P>
<P>
   The most common sources of vitamin A are meat, egg, and dairy
products _ foods that are too expensive or unavailable to most
people in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Following environmental and food safety tests, the new varieties
of rice are expected to be distributed free of charge by the
Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute and various
agricultural research centers in developing countries. Local rice
growers, using traditional breeding techniques, will transfer the
characteristics of the beta-carotene rice into varieties adapted to
local conditions.
</P>
<P>
   To battle vitamin A deficiency, UNICEF gives out vitamin A
capsules when parents bring their children for immunizations. In
addition, some countries have fortified staple ingredients with
vitamin A. In Latin America, sugar has been fortified, and in the
Philippines, wheat is fortified with vitamin A.
</P>
<P>
   But since the results are only proven in the laboratory at this
point, UNICEF doesn't plan to change its focus on supplementation
and fortification, said Schultink. ``There are still quite a few
steps before we can really use this rice,'' Schultink said.
</P>
<P>
   But Potrykus' results may force UNICEF to further look into a
broader issue: genetically engineered food in general, which has
provoked a lot of controversy in Europe and some in the United
States. Most genetically altered products are benefiting farmers in
the developed world, helping them increase yield, but the practice
has not trickled down to developing nations. Schultink said that
UNICEF currently does not have an official stand on genetically
altered food.
</P>
<P>
   On the horizon, said Potrykus, is genetically modified rice with
twice the amount of iron. Iron deficiency anemia, the most common
nutritional disorder in the world, affects nearly 2 billion people,
impairs immunity, and reduces people's mental and physical
capabilities. Between 40 and 50 percent of children under five in
developing countries, and more than 50 percent of pregnant women in
those nations, are iron deficient.
</P>
<P>
   To double the iron content in the rice, the research team added
a ferritin gene derived from a French bean. Ferritin is an iron
storage protein found in many animals and plants.

BAY STATE INSURANCE REGULATION LAGS, GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts lags ``woefully behind other states'' in
monitoring and reporting on the practices of insurers selling
policies to its residents, according to a report released Tuesday
by a consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Insurance Research in Cambridge said state
regulators filed only one examination report on the market
practices of an insurer between 1991 and 1997, a period in which
Linda Ruthardt presided much of the time as the state's top
insurance regulator. Ruthardt was appointed in August 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts insurance division disputed the report, saying
it has completed dozens of reports on insurers and is currently
conducting six, though it is not required to file them. ``We take
our market conduct efforts very seriously here,'' said Christopher
Goetcheus, the division's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   However, the study on the complex issue of insurance regulation
does zero in on an area of insurance regulation that has had a
spotty history in Massachusetts. Reasons for the low number of
reports filed, sources in the industry said, have to do with
state's failure to designate a full staff dedicated to filing
so-called ``market conduct'' reports on insurers until April 1997
when Craig Spratt, deputy insurance commissioner, was made head of
a market practices group.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Spratt, who had worked for the state for about a
decade, resigned abruptly in June, without explanation. He was
unavailable to comment, but other sources said they believed that
his attempts to examine insureres were plagued by a lack of staff
and some turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any significant emphasis on industry-wide market
conduct examinations until a market conduct section was created
about two years ago,'' said Steve D'Amato, former head of a unit of
the insurance division that represented consumers in setting
insurance premiums. D'Amato is now a consumer advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a handful of talented attorneys in the section, it ``was
and still is dramatically understaffed,'` said D'Amato, who, early
this year publicly accused state regulators of ``coziness'' with
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Massachusetts' single filed examination report,
Connecticut _ the nation's insurance capital _ filed 250 reports;
New York, its financial capital, filed 36. Even tiny Rhode Island
filed more reports _ seven _ than did Massachusetts, a state with
nearly 1,300 auto, life, and health insurers.Massachusetts also
initiated far fewer exams than the other states.
</P>
<P>
   The center's report reviewed a span of time in which insurance
fraud was revealed across the country, including allegations that
some of the biggest US insurers were ``churning'' policies to reap
great profits from unwary customers. In Massachusetts, state
officials reached multimillion-dollar settlements of charges of
improper sales practices with Boston-based John Hancock, Prudential
Insurance Co. and other insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts regulators reported that they initiated 30
so-called ``market conduct'' examinations of insurers and completed
40 of them from 1991 through 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Market conduct reports are comprehensive exams to determine
whether insurers are complying with consumer-protection laws and
include reviews of agent sales practices used to sell life
insurance, for example, or inspection of premiums charged
homeowners for their policies or charged businesses for workers
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   These reports, along with examinations for financial soundness,
are key to preventing abuses, insurance experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts lags woefully behind other states in its
enforcement efforts,'' the Center concluded.
</P>
<P>
   While Massachusetts regulators claim to be policing market
conduct, insurance experts noted that as long as the state does not
file its reports with the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, there is no proof _ or record _ of exams.
</P>
<P>
   NAIC is an agency that attempts to standardize insurance
regulation in an industry in which federal regulation is virtually
nonexistent, leaving a fragmented system of regulation among state
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't required by the NAIC to file the market conduct
examination reports with them,'' Goetcheus said.
</P>
<P>
   The state, however, has not flagged in its enforcement:
Massachusetts regulators collected $1.2 million in fines and other
restitution from insurers in 1998, up from $1.08 million in 1997,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts also falls short of nearby states in the number of
reports initiated, according to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1991 and 1997, regulators in Connecticut initiated 340
reports. New York initiated 168. Connecticut and New York have more
than 1,100 insurers operating in each state. Rhode Island, where
about 1,000 insurers sell policies, initiated 45 reports.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeland called Massachusetts' record ``abysmal.'' He said
that the division failed to discuss its regulatory practices when
contacted by the center over the telephone and in written requests.
</P>
<P>
   Goetcheus, spokesman for the state, said the division has also
been vigilant in another area of regulation: Examining the books of
insurance companies to ensure their solvency. This in turn often
reveals improper market practices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is done routinely with financial examinations which
encompass market conduct by scrutinizing claim payment practices,''
Goetcheus said.

   LOS ANGELES _ A savvy woman from Minnesota could soon be
hundreds of thousands of dollars richer by knowing something about
the Internet and the market for drugs before anyone else did.
</P>
<P>
   A brokerage based in suburban Chatsworth, GreatDomains.com, is
in the middle of auctioning a domain name, drugs.com, for the
owner, Bonnie Neubeck of Minneapolis. According to an officer of
the brokerage, the highest verified bid to date is $260,000.
</P>
<P>
   And the price could get higher before the auction ends Friday.
Since July 15, when the name went on auction, there have been even
higher bids, but their validity hasn't been verified, said Jeffrey
Tinsley, chief executive officer of the brokerage company.
</P>
<P>
   Internet watchers say the bidding is lively for the drugs.com
name because it could be a boon to an online pharmaceuticals
retailer. After all, what Web site could be easier to remember for
surfers looking for drugs for their ailments?
</P>
<P>
   Drugs.com gets thousands of hits each month from online surfers
despite the fact that there are no advertisements pointing surfers
to the site, and there is not yet any drug information at the site,
Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is such a simple name. This is the core name for this
industry, and this industry is just so huge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing confidentiality agreements, Tinsley said he could not
disclose who turned in the highest bid verified so far. Neubeck did
not return telephone calls Monday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Dodd, an analyst for Jupiter Communications in New York,
said a Web site with a name so easy to remember could be popular
with medicine hunters, but only if the site itself is run well and
provides reliable service.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever owns the drugs.com site will still have to build up
consumer confidence, he said. The name itself won't guarantee
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a head start, and if they do it well it certainly
could be worth that initial investment. It could put them in the
forefront,'' Dodd said. ``If they don't do a good job of
fulfillment, that name, in and of itself, won't be the silver
bullet in terms of market leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Domain names can command a large price. In May, for example, a
former Albuquerque stockbroker named Eric Wade and two partners
sold the name wallstreet.com, which they had registered in 1994 for
$70, for $1.03million.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer was a Venezuelan company called Players Only, which
plans to use the Internet name for a site offering stock quotes,
company information, online trading and a gambling game based on
stock performance.
</P>
<P>
   Bids are verified by GreatDomains.com to ensure that they are
legitimate and that the bidders can indeed pay. Among the bidders
for the drugs.com name are a handful of jokers, Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them aren't exactly good,'' Tinsley said. ``We've
gotten six offers from `Bill Gates.'''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, the real Microsoft chairman isn't interested in the
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Tom Pothoff's workday starts at the bleary
hour of 5:30 a.m. His mind and his instincts had better be sharp.
His livelihood depends on it.
</P>
<P>
   Pothoff has about an hour to digest the day's financial news and
decide which way the Wall Street wind is blowing before he hunkers
down for his daily ride on a financial roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Pothoff earns his living as a day trader, a profession where a
long-term hold on a stock can last all of 45 minutes. Guess wrong,
blink or take a coffee break, and large chunks of cash can vanish
into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when I buy a stock and my heart will just
start pounding,'' Pothoff said Friday after the market had closed.
``There is stress obviously, but it's not like people are ready to
do something drastic. If they had a losing trade, it's all part of
the game. Hopefully you win more than you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a little uncomfortable now for some in this profession
awash in the harsh spotlight of tragedy. Its most notorious
practitioner has become Mark O. Barton, a former day trader who
killed 12 people in Atlanta, including his wife and their two
children, and then killed himself Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nine victims were shot at two day-trading brokerages. The
killings have focused national attention on the high-stakes,
frantic practice of trading stocks online, most of the time from
home but many times from offices across the country just like the
ones Barton ambushed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a relatively new profession, fueled by the speed and access
of the Internet. In it, practitioners try to amass profits by
trading stocks based on minute-by-minute changes in prices. Trades
take seconds, which is how long it can take for small fortunes to
be made and lost even though the price may shift only by pennies.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage industry estimates say individual traders can
sometimes account for up to 25 percent of a day's stock market
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The peaks can be very high.
</P>
<P>
   And the valleys very low.
</P>
<P>
   A letter left behind by Barton suggested he was depressed about
trading losses, police said Friday. Barton, a former chemist, had
lost roughly $105,000 in stock trading in less than two months.
</P>
<P>
   The industry appeared to be aware of the stresses associated
with day trading before Barton went on his killing spree.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the National Association of Securities Dealers
board approved a rule that would require online brokerage services
to screen customers to determine whether they are suited to the
lightning-fast daily trading style.
</P>
<P>
   ``With day trading, there's no quicker way to stare into the
abyss of your soul,'' said Joey Anuff, a San Francisco day trader
and editor of Suck.com, a Web site owned by Lycos that focuses
attention on bad Web sites. ``A day trader's life is always about
the deal they missed or a stock they got stuck with.''
</P>
<P>
   Anuff is writing a book, ``Dumb Money: Confessions of a Day
Trader,'' that he says will be published in September by Random
House. He says that day trading can be a stressful occupation.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to attract people who like being drawn to the edge,
where the abyss can be filled with profits or financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extreme activity,'' Anuff said. ``You have to operate
from a mind set of total confidence without any hesitation. If you
hesitate, you're dead. And you have to face the fact that the
problem is you. You'll never be able to blame your losses on anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can't just log on and start trading.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders typically lease software that facilitates this type
of electronic commerce for about $300 a month. An investment in
high-speed Internet access and powerful personal computers are also
musts.
</P>
<P>
   So is an investment of at least $5,000 in an account with
companies that support electronic day trading.
</P>
<P>
   Pothoff, for example, monitors two computer screens full of
financial information, business news shows and a chat room for day
traders.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, his initial assessment told him the trading day
would not be good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down 18 points below fair value, which meant it was
going to be a pretty bloody day,'' he said, referring to a
calculation day traders use to assess whether the market will be
gaining or losing ground. ``It started off pretty bad and continued
throughout the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Pothoff did not like the signals the market was sending on
Friday, so he did not make any trades. Nevertheless, it was still a
workday filled with a constant rush.
</P>
<P>
   That's a little bit too much excitement for Phillip Soufer. He
tried day trading and didn't like it. Now he's a position trader,
holding onto stocks for a longer period of time than day traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like a few days or a few weeks to be more prepared. It's a
lot more dangerous to day trade because you have to be more precise
with your timing. It's a lot more stressful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stress doesn't bother Abbie Zands. He trades by the minute
and then runs a party rental equipment company after the market
closes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is a risk. But then that's part of the attraction,
too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely grates on you,'' he said of day trading. ``You
just treat people around you different depending on how you did
that day. It's hard not to take what you are doing during the day
and displace it on your loved one. But you've got to take
responsibility for your actions and no one else.''
</P>
<P>
   Zands made two trades on Friday. They went the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a decent weekend,'' he said. &QL;

 &HT;    Low-key Bradley working on campaign with big names, slow
spending
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ With a sweaty CNN soundman dangling a
microphone overhead, the candidate wandered into the backyard of
Tim and Debbie Fischer and held out his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Bill Bradley. I'm running for president. I hope you'll
give me a hand in this race.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's flat, monotone sounded like he was campaigning for
school board _ not the nation's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's low-key campaign style, combined with aggressive
fund-raising, have so far brought him surprising success in his bid
for the Democratic presidential nomination. Still very much the
underdog, Bradley nonetheless is making a competitive contest out
of a race that most expected to be a cake walk for Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, several hundred volunteers left jobs from around the
country to knock on doors in New Hampshire for Bradley _ an early
showing of grassroots support that surprised Democratic state
chairwoman Kathy Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, he has also begun building delegate slates, a
necessary but often neglected step for an extended campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The former basketball star is also adding glitz to his campaign
with big name endorsements from sports and Hollywood celebrities,
including Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson, ex-Boston Celtic
John Havlicek and actors Harrison Ford and Robert Redford.
</P>
<P>
   And in the crucial fund-raising arena, Bradley has exceeded most
expectations. He's raised $11.7 million to Gore's $19.6 million,
but he is spending it at a far slower rate. As of June 30th,
Bradley had $4 million less in the bank than Gore, all but assuring
himself of the resources to last deep into the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the day of the Iowa caucuses, he'll have more cash on hand
than Al Gore,'' said Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.), an informal adviser
to Bradley who says he is ``perilously close'' to publicly
endorsing his former Senate colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's appeal rests partly in the candidate's sports star
status, and partly in doubts some Democrats have about Gore's
ability to defeat a well-financed Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a widespread feeling that the Clinton administration
will not win a third term,'' said former Illinois senator Adlai
Stevenson III, a Bradley supporter. ``Gore's been too enthusiastic
an accomplice...It's time to close that chapter and open a new one
with a candidate who is unimplicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts have also detected fatigue with Gore among
Democrats, but they question how deeply the sentiment runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming majority of party people, elected officials,
traditional Democratic interest groups are with Gore,'' said Thomas
Mann, a political scientist at the Brookings Institute. ``It would
be a mistake to overstate the level of concern.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's sports status as ``Dollar Bill''_the NCAA star
from Princeton who signed a six-figure contract with the New York
Knicks in 1967 and helped lead the team to two NBA
championships_attracts the curious and the committed to his events.
</P>
<P>
   Others say they are interested because Bradley is the brainy
former senator from New Jersey who steered clear of scandal and
distinguished himself with his command of complex issues, such as
Third World debt or water scarcity in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen on a Sunday afternoon in May people packed into an
auditorium in Creston, Iowa, to see Bill Bradley,'' said Rob Tully,
Iowa Democratic Party Chairman. ``When you have people coming up
and saying, 'How do I give this guy money,' that impresses me.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Bradley, followed by about a dozen members of the
media, canvassed door-to-door in three neighborhoods after his
supporters spent the previous week doing the same in scores of
others.
</P>
<P>
   The Fischers wanted to know how Bradley would make schools
safer. Bradley said he would ban cheap, Saturday-night specials and
require every handgun to be licensed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA has control of the process,'' he said. ``We need
someone to stand up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the home of Daniel Mailhot, Bradley said he opposed prayer in
school _ not what the missionary wanted to hear. After the visit,
Mailhot said he would await Bradley's other positions before
looking elsewhere. But he said he would never back Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He supported the president way too much,'' Mailhot said.
</P>
<P>
   On the front porch of Bob Born's home in Nashua, Bradley
acknowledged that the $900 million cost of his plan to publicly
finance congressional elections was high, but noted it was about
what the U.S. spent on ``promoting democracy around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Born later said he thought Bradley was an ``impressive man,''
but he wasn't ready to commit. ``I wouldn't set myself to vote for
someone so far in advance,'' said Born.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who just turned 56, said he came to New Hampshire to
canvass so early out of ``respect for New Hampshire voters.'' The
real reason, of course, is because he hopes to win New Hampshire,
where he trails Gore two to one in recent polls, and carry the
momentum to the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's campaign said the canvassing effort touched some
100,000 voters, though the process did not always go smoothly. Mike
Aho, a Columbia University economics professor, and Mike Dowling,
the public safety commissioner for Asbury Park, N.J., for example,
found half the homes on their canvassing list empty when they
knocked on doors Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some who were home, like teacher Jean Stefanik, said it was too
early to think about the primaries. ``It's not until February and
I'm working on August,'' she told Dowling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the news wasn't bad for Bradley. Canvassers were
instructed to gage voter interest. After two hours of canvassing,
Aho tallied the results: Nine undecideds, one Bradley supporter and
no Gore supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, one of Bradley's biggest achievements was
championing President Reagan's 1986 tax cut, which slashed tax
rates and eliminated $200 billion in tax loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest blunder, perhaps, was remaining silent over then
Gov. Jim Florio's massive tax increase in New Jersey. Voters in
1990 were so angry they they nearly threw Bradley out in favor of
Christie Todd Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley acknowledged later that he felt an obligation to keep
silent on the tax increase because Florio was supporting his
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has other drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   A former Rhodes scholar, he has always impressed people with his
intellect. But Bradley's penchant for lofty thinking sometimes
outstrips his ability to communicate in simple terms.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Bradley's lackluster attempts at public
speaking. Bradley's speech to Democrats at the 1992 convention
bombed (Jerry Brown hecklers chanting ``Let Jerry Speak'' didn't
help), and Bradley himself has acknowledged a lifelong frustration
with microphones and large audiences.
</P>
<P>
   As a campaigner, Bradley also appears oblivious to the theater
and drama that have become an essential aspect of presidential
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Before canvassing Saturday, Bradley drove to a nearby high
school to attend a rally with 300 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen's ``Glory Days,'' about a ballplayer spending
his days in a bar longing for past glory, blared from loudspeakers
as Bradley arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd burst into a chant of ``Bradley, Bradley!'' But
Bradley remained in his car talking. After a few minutes the crowd
quieted and shifted uncertainly. A minute later, Bradley emerged,
oblivious to the moment he had just missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not good at being pulled away,'' noted New Jersey state
Sen. Dick Codey, who was travelling with Bradley. ``It's a real
pain in the ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley rarely mentions Gore, a move that will probably change
in the coming months when he begins laying out more detailed
positions on health care, taxes and education.
</P>
<P>
   The form of the positions will likely mirror proposals on gun
control and campaign finance. On these issues, Bradley has staked
out positions that exceed what Gore has called for _ a strategy
that allows Bradley to claim bold reforms and call Gore timid.
</P>
<P>
   ``His life experience has been primarily based in Washington,''
Bradley said of Gore. ``And I think he's been more
cautious....Towards the fall, people will see that we would be very
different presidents.''

 &HT;    Senate chair turns down support of defense bill
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Staking out an early bargaining position, the
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee said Tuesday that
he will not support a defense spending bill that kills production
funding for the F-22 Raptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't take a bill to the floor that does not have the
F-22,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). ``This is the plane that
takes us above all known threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens issued his warning on the F-22, built in Georgia and
Texas by Lockheed Martin, as the House and Senate move toward a
September conference to iron out differences between their versions
of the 2000 defense spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate included $1.8 billion for the production of six F-22s
as part of its $264.7 billion defense budget, while the House
deleted the funding in its $266.1 billion bill.
</P>
<P>
   Neither chamber has yet appointed members to the conference
committee, but Stevens will automatically be a member because he is
both chairman of the committee and chairman of the appropriations
subcommittee on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Calif.), chairman of the appropriations
defense subcommittee in the House, will be his counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Stevens' comments, Lewis also held firm to his
position that F-22 production should be halted so the Air Force can
re-examine its need for advanced, tactical air fighters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $62 billion F-22 program, the Pentagon is
also building a new ``Super Hornet'' fighter for the Navy and new
plane that could be shared by the Air Force, Navy and Marine Crops
called the Joint Strike Fighter. The total cost of all three planes
is about $340 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in the compromising business right now,'' Lewis said.
``I'm serious. The least that ought to happen here is a pause to
look at what our needs are in tactical air.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force's senior officer, reiterated on
Tuesday the Air Force position that any pause in the F-22 program
would kill it. ``Our assumption is we're going to get the F-22,''
Ryan added.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Young (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, suggested there might be room for compromise on the
F-22, but he declined to speculate how such a deal might be worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will have to be some give and take on both sides because
both are quite adamant,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Young also noted that conference committee negotiations on
spending bills generally involve a good deal of bluster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Stevens is one of the best negotiators up here,'' he
said. ``He understands you have to start from the hardest point you
can start from.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge facing negotiators is money. Even without
the F-22, the Senate and House bills are nearly $2 billion apart on
total spending.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens suggested that Congress might kill or scale back the
Joint Strike Fighter as a way to pay for the F-22.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis agreed that whatever the outcome of the F-22 debate,
Congress would almost certainly make some strong recommendations
about the three fighters in development and production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford all three,'' Lewis said.

`DICK' LAMPOONS WHOLE WATERGATE MESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS .1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What would the movies do without Richard Nixon?
</P>
<P>
   The 37th president has been a source of menace and mirthful
burlesque since before his resignation, 25 years ago next week, as
a result of the Watergate scandal. From ``All the President's Men''
to, pretty much, the complete works of Oliver Stone; from
Vietnam-era trashings such as ``Millhouse: A White Comedy'' to the
arch allegory ``Nasty Habits'' and the psychodramatic inquiry
``Secret Honor,'' the disgraced chief executive has traumatized
Hollywood almost as much as he did Washington.
</P>
<P>
   What's left to explore about Nixon on film? Well, how about his
relationship with two bubble-headed 15-year-old girls during the
height of the Watergate imbroglio?
</P>
<P>
   That's the imaginative comic premise of ``Dick,'' the new film
that stars ``Cheers'' alum Dan Hedaya as the tricky title prexy and
teen stars Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams as the White House
dog-walkers who all but unconsciously bring down his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of director Andrew Fleming (``The Craft,''
``Threesome'') and co-writer Sheryl Longin, ``Dick'' lampoons
everyone involved in the scandal, including the self-mythologizing
heroes of the investigation, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward
and Carl Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Spoofing Watergate in a way it never has been before proved
surprisingly easy, Fleming says. Basically, just stick to the facts
and add adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the idea first _ What if Deep Throat was two teen-age
girls? _ and that sort of made us giggle,'' Fleming, who was about
10 when Nixon resigned, says. ``The more we learned about the
actual events and the general attitude of high jinks in that
administration, we felt like we had more permission to be
satirical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, some of those people were so broad _ G. Gordon Liddy,
Martha Mitchell _ that the sober version of events usually ends up
being unintentionally funny. And the funny thing about Nixon is
that, in strict terms, he is the ultimate tragic character. There
was a fatal flaw in his personality, he was at the height of power,
and he brought his own self down and the country with him. But ...
he was also just funny. Everybody remarked upon how disconnected he
was, how out of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedaya, who often brings an eye-popping, goofy brand of comedy
to his work, mostly played Nixon straight. And, true to Fleming's
words, he was all the more effective for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to say the things he does, in that kind of voice,''
Hedaya notes. ``But there are certain sections of the movie that
could really be lifted out of a drama. They're extremely serious
and unsettling, especially when the girls confront him with his
vulgarity and anti-Semitism and deceit. He lies, denies and resorts
to outbursts of arrogance; I didn't feel good after doing those
scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not audiences feel good after attending ``Dick''
remains to be seen. The film comes to market somewhat
demographically challenged. In form, it's a giddy teen comedy aimed
at young females who hadn't been born when Watergate was news. In
specifics, it riffs on minute details of the crisis and other
cultural references you sort of had to have been around in the
early '70s to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a star of TV's controversial hit series ``Dawson's
Creek'' and daughter of a two-time Senate candidate, is concerned
that today's youth may be too politically apathetic and
historically uninformed for ``Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My father always stressed the importance of history and
government, so I grew up with a good grasp of the subjects,''
Williams, 18, explains. ``But I'm disappointed that so many of my
peers don't care about any of that. I can't believe it; how can you
not be passionate about what goes on in the world around you and
how it affects you?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Williams learned a few new things making ``Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was a hard-core Republican, so it was amazing to find
out that Nixon was a bad man,'' she cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Dunst, who's essentially been too busy with a hot child acting
career (``Interview With the Vampire,'' ``Little Women,'' a stint
on TV's ``ER'') for the last 10 years to care about politics,
figures her ignorance only added to her characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in '82; don't you feel old?'' Dunst chirps like
Betsy, her on-screen featherbrain. ``I understood little things in
the movie, like erasing the 18{ minutes of tape, but I didn't know
everything. They really didn't teach me a lot about Watergate in
school, but the movie is about these two girls who didn't know
absolutely anything about it. I mean, it actually helped me more
not knowing everything that went on, because these girls are just
so oblivious, it's not even funny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick's'' producer Gale Anne Hurd, who's best-known for making
action blockbusters such as ``Aliens'' and the ``Terminator''
movies, hopes the more modest ``Dick'' will attract the younger
crowd and pique their elders' interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big problem that we were concerned about was whether or
not our target audience, especially teen-age girls, would even
care,'' Hurd admits, ``or whether they would find this so
unconnected to their daily lives that they wouldn't want to see the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the movie will still be in theaters three weeks
after it comes out. At that point, I think, the word-of-mouth will
be such that the people who generally don't show up on opening
night, 30- and 40-year-olds, will then be convinced that they
should go see a movie that stars two teen-age girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, concurrent events might inadvertently have given
``Dick'' more relevance to today's moviegoers. But the eerie echoes
of a much more recent and publicly disdained White House scandal
are also another X factor in the comedy's marketability.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Lewinsky contretemps broke out just weeks after
Columbia Pictures gave the green light to Fleming's production, and
revelations of the current president's peccadilloes shadowed the
film's Toronto shoot through the spring and summer of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the first story broke, all these people would call me and
say, `It's so great for your script!''' Fleming recalls with a
laugh. ``It was a very absurdist notion that suddenly became less
absurdist and more relevant. But we didn't change anything; we
wrote it before the story broke and just went with it. We did not
try to capitalize off of Clinton's situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The producer, understandably, was a bit more alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually freaked out,'' Hurd admits. ``The idea that a
young girl was poised on the brink of bringing down a presidency _
in a completely different context than our movie _ was frightening.
We weren't sure whether people would become so jaded or so cynical
that this film wouldn't or couldn't be perceived as fun anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Williams' Arlene develops a powerful,
unreciprocated crush on the chief executive may not be some
people's idea of fun now. Then again, it could attract some patrons
who think they're seeing a completely different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I mentioned I was making a movie called `Dick,' and
it takes place in the White House, people would go, `They're making
a movie about the whole Monica thing already?''' Williams reports.
``But, obviously, Arlene's relationship with Nixon is nothing
sexual at all. It's more a fantasy of having this powerful father
figure in her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its peculiarities, ``Dick'' is the kind of smart,
singular project that creative types of all ages yearn to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be part of all those huge, teen-scene
movies,'' Dunst admits. ``Those aren't really about the people in
them, just how much money they can make. I prefer movies that have
good characters and challenges; `Dick' was just so much fun that
way, it was like going to play every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about demographics when I'm writing, quite
frankly,'' Fleming says. ``I just think you have to follow your
instincts about what's amusing. And I like the mixture of daffiness
and sobriety in this movie. The girls are all spontaneity and
energy and the guys are very serious about what their doing.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Study: Baby boomers' sex drive going strong
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baby boomers started the sexual revolution in the '60s. And now
that they're nearing their 60s, most of them are still enjoying
sex.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of men and women ages 45 to 59 say they
have sexual intercourse at least once a week, according to a new
survey by the American Association of Retired People.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest myth out there at all is that older people don't
have sex or aren't interested in sex,'' said Hugh Delehanty, editor
in chief of AARP's Modern Maturity magazine. ``After a certain age
you're supposed to go to Florida, play golf and wait for Ed McMahon
to knock on the door.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey refuted that stereotype, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other big predominant myth is just the flip side,'' he
said. ``Now with the age of Viagra, everyone is supposed to be the
cartoon version of Hugh Hefner. Doing it all the time but not
enjoying it very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that despite media hype over Viagra and other
drugs, a small percentage of people 45 and older are taking these
new medicines, and those who take them don't have sex more often.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that most people ages 45 to 59 found
meaning in sex; 71 percent of men and 48 percent of women said it
was critical for their quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   And it found that, rather than getting tired of their partners,
people find them more attractive and romantic as they get older.
</P>
<P>
   The AARP also reported that, among people ages 45 to 59:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About 28 percent of men have sexual thoughts more than once a
day, compared to a 5.1 percent of women. And 16.8 percent of women
have no sexual thoughts at all, compared to only 2 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  23.5 percent of men feel sexual desire more than once a day,
vs. 2.7 percent of women.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  77 percent of men say they always have orgasms, compared to 32
percent of women. Still, 30 percent of women say they're extremely
satisfied with their sex lives, compared to 27 percent of men.
</P>
<P>
   That apparent contradiction in the final point didn't surprise
Dr. Lynda Dykes Talmadge, an Atlanta sex therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women like sex as much as men do, they just have different
ways of approaching it and different requirements,'' said Talmadge.
For example, women aren't generally interested in jumping into bed
unless there's some romance and talk before foreplay begins. Men,
on the other hand, are generally more interested in action than
talk.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 1,384 pre-selected adults ages 45 and older was
conducted in March.

LEFT BEHIND (Phoenix) - As readers snap up any and all books on the
end of the world, one series stands out in the crowd: Left Behind,
fiction novels based on the evangelical Christian interpretation of
the Book of Revelation. Author Jerry Jenkins, who worked with Billy
Graham on his memoirs, and pastor and prophecy expert Tim LaHaye

the true believers in Christ will suddenly disappear and those who
are left behind, well, this is how their lives could play out. The
sixth in the series, ``Assassins,'' is due out Aug. 5.
``Assassins'' initial printing is 1 million copies, unprecedented
for a Christian fiction novel, and depending on the time of day,
the book is ranked the fifth or ninth ``hot buy'' on amazon.com. By
KELLY ETTENBOROUGH. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL;

Crystal Gale. Next week, eight of the nine GOP aspirants will try
to lock in enough votes to win the Iowa straw poll_a vote that
doesn't count in an obscure place on the map in a state that has
less than a handful of electoral votes. In the quirky world of
politics, the Aug. 14 poll has become a vital battleground. By KRIS
MAYES. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHEMAN (Phoenix) - A Phoenix woman competing in the Senior Games in
London is being accused of being a man. ``Just look at her,`` one

England, and the tabs are loving it. By CLAY THOMPSON. Story will

 &HT;    Two web health companies, two deals
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jostling for the inside track in the race to exploit
the expected boom in Internet health care, two Atlanta hopefuls _
Adam.com and WebMD _ announced deals Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Adam.com was first out of the blocks in the morning with a
high-profile agreement placing its content at the fingertips of
visitors to the Web site of Merck-Medco Managed Care.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement, part of a ``syndication'' strategy, lets a user
at Merck-Medco click to Adam's healthcare information without
knowing that he or she is connecting to a computer controlled by
Adam.
</P>
<P>
   To the user, it may make little difference. But it sure matters
to Adam.com, said Robert Cramer, chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   That set-up lets Adam.com control the content, making changes as
necessary. More important to revenues, Adam.com can keep tabs on
the number of times a user clicks through its content _ and that
information translates into the fees Adam can charge, either for
advertising or for licensing its material.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are a lot of viewers passing through the
Merck-Medco site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a very important deal because Merck-Medco is
a very prestigious company and suppliers of prescriptions to more
than 50 million Americans,'' Cramer said. ``This is another step
toward our becoming the dominant health provider on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam built a reputation as a developer of healthcare information
on software and compact disc. Despite high grades for qualilty
products, the company bumped through years of inconstant earnings
and erratic stock performance.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, Adam revamped its strategy and bet on the Net. That
gamble, which included a name change from Adam Software to
Adam.com, has been largely rewarded by Wall Street. Adam stock,
languishing at $4 a share in February, closed Tuesday at $19.25 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Healthcare is seen a vast Internet opportunity. The sector
represents 14 percent of the nation's $6 trillion-a-year economy,
but thus far only a tiny fraction of that is carried by the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's rival, Atlanta-based WebMD, plans a September merger with
Healtheon, whose stock has suffered through a long swoon that began
shortly after the deal was announced. Healtheon, which crested at
$105 a share in May, closed at $44.43 3/4 a share Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But WebMD too has set its sights on nothing less than dominance
of Internet healthcare. The company sees the combined site as the
key destination for both consumers and their doctors, as well as a
billing service for institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The company Tuesday announced that it has newly-reached
agreements with nearly three dozen healthcare systems, deals meant
to bolster WebMD links to doctors. The deals call for WebMD to
provide healthcare information services to the systems and their
42,000 physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are arming physicians and other participants of the
healthcare industry with the information they need to stay on top
of the latest developments and the tools they need to streamline
their practices,'' said Jeff Arnold, WebMD chairman and chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Among the systems in Tuesday's agreement with WebMD, are
Columbia Cornell Care in New York, the University of Texas Health
Science Center, OhioHealth Group in Columbus, Ohio, Health Choice
Network in Memphis and the American Medical Strategy Organization.

AS A FEMINIST, A KING; AS A BALLERINA, A KLUTZ  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The movie marquee in the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art says, ``Now Showing: Eleanor Antin.'' Beneath it are a few
stills of Ms. Antin's most famous roles, plus a free-standing
cutout of her in full ballerina regalia.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find Eleanor Antin in your movie guide, try the
deadpan dictionary, the feminist gazette, the lexicon of subversive
notions or, better still, the catalog named after her by Howard N.
Fox, curator of ``Eleanor Antin,'' the first retrospective of 30
years of this artist's work (through Aug. 23).
</P>
<P>
   A lot of this show stars Ms. Antin on video as the marquee
promises, and even more of it is theatrical in a quirky way,
fleshing out the female role in the human comedy with laughter and
cultural smarts and a deep curtsy to despair.
</P>
<P>
   Female roles, rather: Ms. Antin hooked up early to the idea that
personality, even gender, were not unified and static but various
and shifting, and at different times she has tried on fantasy
autobiographies as a king, a ballerina and a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   In real life (whatever that is these days) she was a painter and
an actress first, then, in the later 1960s, a conceptual artist.
She became a feminist artist, a video artist and a performance
artist in the first years of the 1970s, coming early to all three
parties and helping to make them memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Antin made a kind of still movie in 1971-73: ``100 Boots,''
a set of 51 photographic postcards that were mailed to hundreds of
people around the world. These chronicle a picaresque journey taken
by a staunch corps of boots from the Pacific Ocean to the Museum of
Modern Art in New York, with a number of standard-issue adventures
like going to market and to church, being unemployed, doing their
best, and taking a hill (a victory of sorts), before going to the
big city and ending up in a seedy dump.
</P>
<P>
   This reverse journey, from middle-class military to scruffy
bohemia, is made by the most independent articles of clothing since
Gogol's overcoat or Dr. Seuss' pale green pants with nobody inside
them.
</P>
<P>
   Mail art was still rather new, but male art bestrode the world
and always had. Ms. Antin wryly commented on society's expectations
of women and on women's possibilities of redefining themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carving: A Traditional Sculpture'' (1972) is a
pseudo-scientific record of her weight loss on a strict 36-day
diet. She had herself photographed naked every morning _ front,
back, left, right _ as she ``carved'' her ``ideal'' self through
abnegation. In a wall text she refers to Michelangelo, ``our great
predecessor,'' who wrote that a sculptor could not create anything
that was not already in the marble.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s women were still tossing around the heady
idea that they could do something other than diet themselves to
perfection. Feminism released a number of female fantasies into the
realm of artistic expression, including autobiographies as
explorations of gender, pace Marcel Duchamp.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Antin paraded in the costume of a king for a while, in her
self-appointed kingdom of Solana Beach, Calif., documenting her
transition to manhood in a video of applying a beard. (Costume
loomed large in feminist and performance art: big girls dressing
up.)
</P>
<P>
   Her subjects were puzzled when she greeted them on sidewalks,
pushed a marketing cart and thumbed a ride, but this was
California, so perhaps it did not seem so strange.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Antin was not a cheerleader for the feminist movement and
did not think women were any more likely to have it all than men
were. Her king appeared in a video leading his (or her) followers
to the promised land, which turned out to be a realm of bones and
ashes. Her stories tend to be quixotic comedies wrapped around an
elegy.
</P>
<P>
   The exploration of the naked self and the clothed fantasy was
one tactic in the campaign to introduce ``feminine'' material into
the mainstream of art. Though male artists like Pollock and Rothko
had abstracted their angst, self-revelation in the 1970s was
assumed to be predominantly female.
</P>
<P>
   When men revealed themselves, they would do so under wraps. No
messy confessions on Roy Lichtenstein's canvases or Carl Andre's
lines of bricks, no tears or hysteria, no leaky emotions or
insecure moments hung out to dry. At least not recognizably.
</P>
<P>
   Women put their inner lives, their well-kept secrets, their
embarrassing imaginations on view. In Judy Chicago's ``Dinner
Party,'' the female genitalia, which nature has discreetly tucked
away, came barely disguised to the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   In novels like Erica Jong's ``Fear of Flying,'' women's sexual
fantasies _ at least one woman's _ were laid bare. Around that
time, narrative swung in on the art pendulum as a reaction to
minimalism's insistence on the circumscribed, storyless, hard
material fact of the object.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Antin, a low-life playwright in a high cause, had been
hooked on stories for some time. She put aside her royal male self
for another fictional autobiography, this one the most feminine of
fantasies, the ballerina. Millions of little girls once dreamed of
being a ballerina, paragon of grace, beauty and weightlessness,
soaring above baby fat and acne on delicate clouds of tulle. Ms.
Antin had herself photographed on point in classic poses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She also had the photographic session filmed for a piece called
``Caught in the Act,'' where she is seen galumphing unsteadily off
her toes or clinging to a prop to steady herself for her fabulous
split second aloft. Giselle is a klutz! Deadpan, Ms. Antin deals a
mortal blow to the illusion of beauty and perfection offered by
photography and foisted by all the media, and hints that even
dreams of twinkling toes wear running shoes by day.
</P>
<P>
   The scenarios of ``The Loves of a Ballerina'' _ short, silent
films viewed through the windows of a mock movie theater _ unfold
like romance novels written by Harpo Marx. In ``Love's Shadow,''
the ballerina's shadow is implored by a three-dimensional lover
who, when she rebuffs his suit, impetuously shoots her silhouette.
At once he is overcome by despair and tenderly clasps her dying
shadow.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Swan Lake,'' the ballerina, in a brief, black tutu, leans
over and waggles her cute little behind. Et voila, there emerges
from the groin of her male companion the head and long, curved neck
of a plush swan. Alas, it soon droops, but the ballerina coaxes it
up again, and the couple exits to applause.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Antin's most extensively pursued role was Eleanora Antinova,
the only black ballerina in Diaghilev's company. In Antinova's
first dance, ``L'Esclave'' (``The Slave''), she was chained and
never moved her feet. ``I was the only dancer in the world to do a
stationary dance,'' her text says. ``Luckily, the artists adored
its self-referential ironies.''
</P>
<P>
   The feminist movement in its early years was a white women's
movement not overly concerned with race or ethnicity. Ms. Antin
brought up the race issue early, and was criticized for playing a
black woman. (She recently said that African-Americans didn't
criticize her; only white liberals did.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a black ballerina in Diaghilev's company in the
1920s, when ballet was white to the tippy tip tips of its satin
shoes and Paris was enamored of the American-born Josephine Baker,
clad in bananas and dancing bogus jungle dances, is more pointed
than a ballerina's big toe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Ms. Antinova, by then past her prime, down on her luck
and subsisting on sherry, gave performances in New York and
elsewhere in a salon that the Los Angeles show recreates, decorated
with photographs of her great roles, her own amusing accounts of
her choreography and her elegant water colors of Diaghilev and his
scintillating circle.
</P>
<P>
   In performance she recalled her days of glory and slowly sank
into her sherry. Again the fantasy does a smart jete and lands on
the lip of the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Antin kept reinventing herself, proving that American
fantasies had second and third acts. In an interview with Fox in
the show's catalog, she remarks that ``service is the main role our
culture has allotted to women, and we've been put down for it ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   In comes Nurse Eleanor, cheerfully exploited by all manner of
men and involved in soap opera adventures, some a bit too
long-winded to be gripping, though she does perform an operation by
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse Eleanor had another incarnation as Eleanor Nightingale,
the heroic founder of the profession. Her all-too-properly
buttoned-up family and her landmark career in the Crimean War are
playacted by Ms. Antin and others in fine, fake period photographs.
</P>
<P>
   In a related play, Nurse Eleanor muses that bandaging a soldier
meant sending him out to kill again. The war photographs include
several images of the wounded and dead, subjects that Roger Fenton,
the photographer who actually went to that war in 1855, never
photographed because the British were not supposed to see them.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, Ms. Antin's references have grown wider. In
``Vilna Nights'' (1993), the windows of a mock-up of a bombed-out
building in the Jewish ghetto in Vilna show scenes of the people
who once lived there. A sobbing tailor ceaselessly mends the
tattered clothes of dead children. A woman clutches letters in
anguish before burning them. Two frightened, hungry children are
miraculously visited by a menorah and a Hanukkah feast, only to
have it all disappear when they sit down to eat.
</P>
<P>
   This view of the Holocaust is similar in spirit to work by
Shimon Attie, who has projected pre-war photographs of residents
and establishments of the former Jewish district in Berlin on the
buildings that still stand there.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Antin, Jewish, a woman and an artist, considers herself an
outsider through and through, so in a way a piece like ``Vilna
Nights'' is but a more desperate comment on the identity and
experience of the outsider than her comedic saunters through
fantasy autobiographies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be ironical, I may be funny,'' she says in the catalog
interview, ``but I'm not kidding.'' She also says that even in her
baby days she had her calling: causing trouble. Lucky us.

'60S SEX ATTITUDES ALIVE AND WELL AT MIDLIFE, SURVEY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women who grew up in the Age of Aquarius are carrying the
sexually permissive attitudes of the 1960s into midlife, according
to a new national survey that suggests an imminent revolution in
sex in the last third of life.
</P>
<P>
   More than men their age, women of the baby boom generation
approve of sex outside marriage. In fact, most women between the
ages of 45 and 59 think it's OK for unmarried people to have sex,
but most women over 60 disapprove of unmarried sex.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to their mothers, women in midlife are also far more
likely to engage in oral sex and masturbation and ``are less likely
to believe that sex is only for younger people,'' said Constance
Swank of the American Association of Retired Persons, which
sponsored the study and published it Tuesday in its magazine,
Modern Maturity.
</P>
<P>
   The findings suggest that women of the baby boom will be less
inclined to accept a celibate life as they move into their older
years.
</P>
<P>
   The study confirms the trends Dr. Stanley Ducharme, a Boston
Medical Center sex therapist, sees in his office every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who are products of the '60s have come a long way in
realizing that a healthy sexual outlet and regular sexual activity
is a normal part of life, that it enriches life, and that they have
a right to it as much as men,'' Ducharme said.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that women have increasing difficulty finding
male partners as they age. Four out of five women are widows by the
age of 75.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll, based on mail questionnaires from 1,400 adults
over age 45, shows that very few older women without partners
engage in any kind of sexual activity. Among older men without
partners, 6 percent reported having sexual intercourse once a week
or more, 29 percent reported kissing or hugging at least that
frequently, and 26 percent reported masturbation.
</P>
<P>
   The AARP survey is the first of older Americans to separate
participants' responses based on whether they have a current sexual
partner. Because earlier surveys lumped together those with and
without partners, they probably understated the amount of sexual
activity among older people with regular partners.
</P>
<P>
   According to the new research, slightly more than half of men
and women over 45 report having sexual intercourse at least once a
week. That declines to 31 percent of men and 24 percent of women
ages 60 to 74. Among those over age 75, 19 percent of men and 7
percent of women report intercourse at least weekly.
</P>
<P>
   One surprising finding, several specialists said, is that so few
men are getting treatment for impotence, despite a high incidence
of serious erectile dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   About one American man in every four over age 45 is moderately
or totally impotent, the survey reveals. John B. McKinlay of New
England Research Institute, a consultant on the AARP survey, said
this is consistent with the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, which
found that 52 percent of men have some degree of erectile
dysfunction by age 70, but a smaller proportion have moderate or
total impotence.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 6 percent of American men are being treated for the
problem, and fewer than 10 percent have ever sought treatment.
``We're told there's . . . a lot of Viagra being consumed, but it
probably isn't true,'' McKinlay said. ``Oral medications are really
a big breakthrough for this problem, and yet most men don't avail
themselves of it. I think that's a great tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rapid aging of the US population, one million new
cases of erectile dysfunction will emerge annually between now and
2025, according to unpublished research by McKinlay. ``We've
estimated that by the year 2025, there will be 170 million new
cases worldwide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even fewer women _ only 7 percent _ have ever sought treatment
for sexual problems, even though therapists say that sexual
dysfunction is a widespread problem among older women.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 4 percent of women who reported they are currently on
some kind of medicine for a sexual problem, the most common
treatments were estrogens (38 percent). Only 5 percent use a
vaginal hormone cream, which counteracts dryness and makes
intercourse more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The new survey dispels some well-entrenched myths about sex and
aging, such as the idea that people in the youth-oriented US
culture find their partners less attractive over time or that men
are less romantic than women.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the proportion of respondents of both sexes giving
their partners the highest possible ratings for physical
attractiveness actually rose with age.
</P>
<P>
   For men over 45, the attributes of their partners most important
to sexual satisfaction were ``feeling that their spouse or partners
is romantic'' and ``feeling that their spouse or partner is
sensitive to their moods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This contradicts popular stereotypes that women are more
concerned than men with romance and having a sensitive partner,''
the survey authors wrote. ``Actually, it is quite the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Among women, the most important factors affecting sexual
satisfaction were ``having a partner who is imaginative about
sex,'' ``whether or not I feel that people dislike me,'' and
``having an exciting partner.''
</P>

BREES, DAYNE FOCUS ON VICTORIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Purdue junior quarterback Drew Brees and Wisconsin
senior running back Ron Dayne are being mentioned as leading
Heisman Trophy candidates. But neither school is mounting an
aggressive publicity campaign. And that's just fine with both
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not winning, I won't win it,'' said the soft-spoken
Dayne, who needs 1,717 yards to break Ricky Williams' NCAA Division
I-A career rushing record.
</P>
<P>
   Brees, who threw for 3,983 yards and 39 touchdowns last season
to set Big Ten single-season records, said he also realizes that
his performance on the field is worth more than publicity off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of publications are saying I'm a Heisman
candidate,'' he said yesterday during the Big Ten Conference
football media days. ``If we win 10 games, I think the personal
honors will come. The first day of two-a-days, I'm not going to
say, `OK, first step for the Heisman.' It's going to be the first
step to winning 10 games.''
Brees supports Major ]An Austin native who knows a little bit about
playing quarterback, and he has his own opinions about the
University of Texas quarterback situation.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Brees doesn't think there will be a Longhorns quarterback
controversy between sophomore Major Applewhite and freshman Chris
Simms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people are talking about Simms pushing Major and there
maybe being a quarterback controversy,'' Brees said. ``I don't
think \RTexas coach\S Mack Brown will let it become a
controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is going to be a heated quarterback competition, Brees
said, it will be at the backup position, where Simms will be
challenged by Adam Hall, a freshman from Austin Westlake High
School. That's also Brees' alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam Hall's the man,'' Brees said with a grin. ``I'm not
saying either one is going to beat out Major; he's earned his
stripes and played in some big games. He knows how it's done. I
think people are counting out Adam Hall; he's a hometown kid and
Simms is a big name, highly touted. I know Adam can play at this
level.'' Briefly John Cooper, who is starting his 12th season at
Ohio State, has the longest tenure in the Big Ten Conference among
the league's 11 coaches. Cooper was asked to name the coaches at
the other schools when he joined the league in 1988. ``Hmmmmm,'' he
said after a long pause. ``I think I could do it, but I'd have to
think about it quite a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State, Michigan and Ohio State were picked to finish 1-2-3
in the Big Ten race. Wisconsin returns 16 starters from an 11-1
team. Purdue returns 15 starters from a 9-4 team. ``I understand
why those teams are ranked where they are,'' Purdue coach Joe
Tiller said. ``They're like heavyweight champions. You have to beat
them in the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's Chris McIntosh was asked about the Badgers' 38-31
victory against UCLA _ which was in the national championship
picture until the last week of the regular season _ in the Rose
Bowl. ``We've played off that game in the off-season and during
spring practice,'' said McIntosh, a 6-7, 310-pound offensive
lineman. ``I think that game showed us what we were capable of
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State opens the season Aug. 28 by playing host to Arizona
in the Pigskin Classic. Nittany Lions coach Joe Paterno said he has
turned down similar preseason games in the past. ``I personally
didn't want to do it, and I was even more convinced when I saw how
good Arizona was,'' Paterno said of the Wildcats, who are expected
to be ranked in the preseason top five. ``We talked to the team
about it and they wanted to play the game. They were much more
enthusiastic than I was.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a level at which there are few second chances in
the U.S. military, Gen. Joseph Ralston has been not only redeemed
but resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   When an affair 13 years in the past blocked his promotion to the
country's top military job two summers ago, the general never
complained, associates say, and if he looked back at all, certainly
never let anyone catch him at it. Instead, he made his new boss
look good and kept putting his hand up for assignments few others
could handle.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States made the mistake of bombing the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade last May, it was Ralston who accompanied
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on a midnight visit to the
ambassador's residence here. When Washington planned to attack a
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in retaliation for the terrorist
bombings of two American embassies in Africa, again it was Ralston
who flew to Pakistan to deliver the explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1997, he withdrew his name from consideration as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff a week after the Air Force
was intensely criticized for forcing a female pilot to leave the
service for lying about an illicit relationship. While his friends
were all saying how sorry they were to see a brilliant career
short-circuited by scandal, he stayed on for a second term as vice
chairman, working 18 hour days. He spoke for the Pentagon at high
level policy meetings, directed the purchase of new weapons systems
and equipment, coordinated with military commanders around the
world. And he went out of his way to make his boss, Gen. Henry
Shelton, the new chairman, look good.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will literally go the extra mile to shore up a relationship
even when it meant going half-way around the world to New
Zealand,'' said Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his constancy in a changed environment has been rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Two wars, two years and a major funding infusion later, Ralston
is again considered a crucial member of the inner circle on
national security policy. Last week, he was named as the Pentagon's
choice to replace Gen. Wesley Clark as supreme commander of NATO
forces in Europe. And some at the Pentagon and in Congress even say
he may be back on track for the chairman's job.
</P>
<P>
   When his name was first raised as the Pentagon's choice for
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the case of 1st Lt. Kelly
Flinn, the first female pilot of a B-52 bomber, had particularly
outraged a number of women in Congress: How come he gets the
ultimate promotion after his affair, they asked, and she gets to
explore new career opportunities?
</P>
<P>
   The general withdrew his name, friends said, and never gave
himself time to reflect. ``He didn't miss a beat,'' said a senior
administration official who works with him almost daily. ``When I
tried to express sympathy for him and his situation, which had to
have been infuriating, he'd basically say, ``It's no big deal,
let's get on with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, of course, the Flinn case has faded from view. The
commander-in-chief, President Clinton, has himself survived a sex
scandal that divided and then wearied the country, causing several
members of Congress to suggest that, post-impeachment, they feel
more than two years older than they did back when Lt. Flinn was
Topic A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the environment has settled down a bit and I think it
has,'' said Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the
Armed Services Committee. ``We're able to look more objectively at
the whole person, the context and the texture of events rather than
drawing these complicated human events with broad brush strokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralston's affair, with a civilian employee of the the CIA,
apparently began during a separation from his wife, though in 1988
divorce papers his wife said the relationship had continued after
the couple reconciled and eventually caused their breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there was a consensual affair when he was
separated from his wife should not disqualify him from even serving
as chairman of the Joint Chiefs,'' Levin said. Asked if that seemed
likely, he answered, ``He's surely qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family now say that no one was more surprised by the
choice assignment _ and the latest extension of his 34-year career
_ than Ralston himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had already bought a house in Alaska'' where he expected to
retire on March 1 of next year, said his daughter, Paige Ralston,
deputy press secretary to Rep. J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the
speaker of the House. ``My stepmother had already bought the
furniture and picked out the curtains.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is ready to do what the secretary and the president want
him to do,'' said his father-in-law, retired Gen. Russell
Dougherty, a former commander of the Strategic Air Command, whose
daughter is Ralston's second wife. ``You don't get excited about
these things. You do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   He still has critics, especially among loyalists to Clark. Some
of them suggested that the current NATO commander, who sometimes
disagreed with his superiors but won NATO's air war against
Yugoslavia, is being replaced with a go-along, get-along type.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the military wing of the old boys' network had simply
been waiting for things to calm down so they could restore
Ralston's standing without much of a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's the greatest guy since Patton, but we ought to at
least acknowledge that they're still winking at this and continuing
a double standard,'' said Tod Ensign, director of Citizen Soldier,
a military watchdog group in New York. ``In this post-impeachment
environment,'' he said, Defense Secretary William Cohen and Shelton
``probably feel now, `What can the White House say? Who's going to
really complain?'''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Font, a Boston lawyer with a number of clients in the
military, said that just last May, a low-ranking male client of his
had been sent to Leavenworth and served four months in prison for a
consensual affair with a civilian.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little question that the heat has gone out of the
debate now; Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, promised to ``work diligently to get his nomination
through.'' And Ralston's congressional allies expect an easy
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who complained about a double
standard when Ralston's promotion was announced two years ago,
said, ``I'd like to see Kelly Flinn have a comeback,'' but added
that she did not plan to make an issue of his past affair at this
point. Like many of the core group of women in Congress who
supported Lt. Flinn, Ms. Maloney also was a strong defender of
Clinton during the impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, who runs the Center for
Defense Information, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, said:
``I would like to believe this is at least a slight easing in the
harsh line the Pentagon has always taken.'' Bumpers spoke on
Clinton's behalf on the Senate floor during the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the general's fans at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and at
the White House said his improved standing also has everything to
do with his own performance. Ralston, 55, could not have known he
would get another shot at the top job when he just kept showing up
for work at 5:30 every morning after withdrawing his name from
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ralston grew up outside Louisville, the youngest of four
children born to a tobacco farmer and an X-ray technician. ``He
came from a poor family in Kentucky and it was all up to him,''
said Ms. Ralston, his daughter. But somehow, he never considered
himself poor, or no worse off than most other folks he knew, and
the family eventually sent three children to college.
</P>
<P>
   Miami University of Ohio was an intimidating place for him in
the fall of 1961, and he has often told the story of the kind
stranger in a military uniform who helped him figure out his class
schedule on one of his first days on campus. The man pointed out
that he had Tuesday and Thursday afternoons free for Air Force
ROTC, so he signed up, and began his military career. (He also met
his second wife, Dede, through ROTC. He knew her on campus, where
she was involved in the women's program then known as ``Angel
Flights,'' and they reconnected after his divorce.)
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1965, he became a fighter pilot, flying 147
combat missions, most of them over North Vietnam. At one point in
the summer of 1968, when the Air Force was losing planes at a
particularly alarming rate, he flew five combat missions over Hanoi
in three days.
</P>
<P>
   When he came home, he seemed most interested in repairing the
mistakes made in Vietnam and helping the military become more
combat ready, first as a squadron commander, then a wing commander,
and then head of the Alaskan Command. Finally, in 1995, he was
named the top fighter pilot commander in the Air Force, becoming
the head of the Air Combat Command at Langley Air Force Base in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   During his first term as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, his
boss, Gen. John Shalikashvili, recommended him as the next
chairman. ``He's just a remarkable individual for the knowledge and
the judgment he brings to the job,'' Shalikashvili said.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, when Cohen and Shelton sat down to figure
out how to replace half a dozen senior military officers whose
terms were up next summer, they again thought of Ralston and
quickly realized he was the man they wanted to succeed Clark.
</P>
<P>
   They got the enthusiastic support of the White House. And they
felt so strongly about Ralston, in fact, that they advanced the
retirement of Clark by two months to make sure Ralston would be his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   (Under law, Ralston has to assume another command within 60 days
after his term as vice chairman ends at the end of February, or
face automatic retirement.)
</P>
<P>
   Even now, those close to him seem afraid to drop the slightest
hint that he might feel vindicated. ``He doesn't have the job
yet,'' said Ms. Ralston, his daughter. ``It's still early.''

DEATH TOLL REACHES 258 FROM HEAD-ON COLLISION OF TRAINS IN INDIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEARAK

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Rescue workers Tuesday continued to pry the
dead from railroad cars that were crushed like tin accordions on
Monday in a head-on collision in eastern India. So far, 258 bodies
have been recovered, according to national railway spokesmen. Some
officials fear that the death toll will climb to 400.
</P>
<P>
   Cranes have yet to fully untangle the wreckage, and three
mangled coaches were still to be cut open.
</P>
<P>
   The two speeding passenger trains, both going faster than 50
miles an hour, were traveling in opposite directions on the same
track. They smashed into each other at Gaisal Station near the
border of West Bengal and Assam states.
</P>
<P>
   Railway officials said they had yet to determine whether the
crash was caused by human error or a mechanical failure. One of the
trains, the Awadh-Assam Express, had been racing along the wrong
track for more than five miles.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian Railways minister, Nitish Kumar, who is nominally in
charge of the country's gargantuan rail system, accepted blame for
the tragedy and sent a letter of resignation to Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I wanted to do I have done, owning moral responsibility
for the tragedy,'' he said to reporters. ``I don't want to punish
others. I am interested in punishing myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people converged at the scene of the disaster
Tuesday, some of them to gawk but others to seek out of the fate of
loved ones. The distraught meandered from one vantage point to
another. Many bodies were damaged beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the ninth major Indian train disaster in the last
four years, each claiming more than 50 lives, and a panel is
expected to be appointed to make safety recommendations for the
dilapidated, money-starved rail network.
</P>
<P>
   Similar committees have been assembled before. But the system,
which serves 13 million passengers a day, has yet to make
substantial improvements.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ North Korea's preparations for the test launching of a
new long-range missile this month have caused a dramatic change of
course in defense strategy and diplomacy for both Japan and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is considering stretching the constitutional limits on its
military while South Korea is beginning to overcome deep suspicions
of Japan and consider ways to cooperate in the face of a common
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has agreed to take part in a ``theater missile defense
system'' created in Washington and at the same time is speeding up
its own plans for a satellite surveillance system. Most surprising
is Japan's decision to consider equipping its largely toothless air
force with airborne refueling and attack capabilities that would
enable its F-15s to launch retaliatory strikes against North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, whose capital, Seoul, lies within easy range of its
northern neighbor's missiles and artillery, has already indicated
to Washington its desire to build new missiles capable of reaching
much of North Korea, including the capital, Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1979 agreement, South Korea must obtain Washington's
consent before building missiles with a range of over 112 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, Defense Secretary William Cohen indicated
the United States would work with South Korea to overcome that
limit, something that could be accomplished if Korea joined the
Missile Technology Control Regime.
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of high level visits, and a cascade of
statements aimed at the North Korean government, Washington has at
once sought to dissuade Pyongyang from going ahead with the
expected test, while reassuring American allies in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The message, as stated here last week by Cohen, and repeated
over and over by others, is that by launching a new missile with an
estimated 3,700-mile range _ one theoretically able to strike
Alaska or Hawaii _ North Korea has nothing to gain and everything
to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as expectations of the imminent missile launching grow,
what all of this activity reveals more than anything else is that
in the short- and medium-term, Washington and its major Asian
allies face a dearth of options in dealing with perhaps the world's
most isolated and unpredictable country.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen seemed to acknowledge as much during a news conference
here last week. Referring to the carrot and stick approach that
Washington and its allies have chosen to take toward Pyongyang, he
said, ``We are prepared to work with North Korea to open economic
and political opportunities, and North Korea should seize this
chance to build a new and positive relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``A refusal to show restraint would,'' he said, result in
``stalling or indeed stopping potential cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Seoul last week, Cohen said that the United States
would mobilize ``all available means'' against North Korea if it
fires the new missile, known as the Taepodong II. But this does not
include the use of military force, he has said repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cohen's statements reflect the policy options being
considered in Washington, Tokyo and Seoul, where the growing
assumption is that nothing can be done to prevent the missile
launching.
</P>
<P>
   These options include attempts at working with North Korea,
particularly in the area of the so-called ``agreed framework''
under which Pyongyang has forsworn the deployment or proliferation
of nuclear weapons. In exchange, North Korea is entitled to
economic assistance in the form of food and fuel deliveries, and
help in building a light-water nuclear reactor for generating
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Manning, a former senior State Department policy adviser,
have suggested letting North Korea ``stew in its own juices,'' amid
a near economic collapse attended by one of the worst famines of
the century. In response to a new missile test, the United States,
Japan and South Korea must ``cut aid and restrict contacts,'' he
wrote in a recent policy paper.
</P>
<P>
   Undermining arguments for either approach, however, is a
fundamental uncertainty about what drives North Korean
decision-making. What the West sees as carrots, things like
increased trade, aid, travel and political contacts, for example,
may paradoxically be what some in North Korea fear most.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's withered economy is so fragile that even gradual
attempts at opening it up could be deeply destabilizing. Certainly,
having witnessed the example of the demise of the Soviet Union and
its Eastern European allies, Pyongyang will be loath to do anything
that smacks of reducing near absolute government control over
people and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   If the problem is seen through this prism, those suggesting the
firmest responses to the North's expected missile test may
inadvertently be Pyongyang's best allies. According to this view,
nothing, perhaps, is more important to retaining the cohesiveness
of President Kim Jong Il's regime than furthering a view of the
outside world as hostile and predatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There haven't been very many satisfactory options for dealing
with North Korea for 40 years,'' said Morton I. Abramowitz, author
of a recent policy paper published by the Council on Foreign
Relations that advocates a mixture of continued engagement and
limited sanctions in case of a new missile test. ``They are a dying
state, or a near-dying state. To change that, they have to change
the way they do business, and this involves opening up, which some
undoubtedly find terrifying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, if North Korea goes ahead with its missile test, as is
widely expected, it may find its famous unpredictability matched by
the political reactions of its neighbors, and even by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Already, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung is facing domestic
criticism over the perceived slim returns from his ``Sunshine
Policy'' toward the North, which has involved encouraging
investments by South Korean companies and authorizing a lucrative,
but tightly controlled tourism trade to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, meanwhile, the prospect of a new missile launch has
transformed the national debate over defense and security matters
in ways that would have scarcely been imaginable only two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A previous generation of North Korean missiles, known as the
Rodong, had long been capable of striking parts of Japan. Even
after the launch of a longer range Taepodong I missile last year,
whose flight traversed Japanese airspace, deeply pacifist public
opinion on defense questions scarcely countenanced any change in
the military stance by the government.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, though, as expectations of the Taepodong II
launch have grown, some have questioned aspects of Japan's
traditional and constitutionally-mandated anti-militarism,
contributing to a wave of increasingly nationalistic sentiments
among mainstream politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gradually Japanese people are becoming aware that they are
facing a threat from North Korea, and this has been a very good
chance for the society to re-evaluate our security posture,'' said
Tomohisa Sakananaka, president of the Research Institute for Peace
and Security, a private policy organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese Constitution since 1953 allows the country to
take defensive measures against any threat against the nation's
existence. That is not new,'' Sakananaka said. ``But this is
completely theoretical. We don't have any capability to attack
North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   It is now believed that a new missile test by North Korea would
go a long way toward changing that.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have four options,'' said Toshiyuki Shikata, a retired
general with Japan's National Self Defense Force. ``We could just
keep smiling and continuing the Sunshine Policy toward North Korea,
or develop our own long-range missile, which people in the region
and our own public opinion would oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between these two extremes we are choosing two other options:
developing a theater missile defense system with the U.S., which
would take several years, and giving Japan retaliation capability
through its air force. If a Korean missile should fall in Japanese
territory, and particularly cause casualties or some destruction,
the prime minister could then order the destruction of North Korean
missile sites, and I believe the Japanese public would support the
government in these measures.''

U.S. TO ALLOW DIRECT CHARTER FLIGHTS TO CUBA FROM N.Y., L.A. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration announced Tuesday that
it would permit direct charter flights to Cuba from both New York
and Los Angeles, the latest step in the administration's effort to
open informal contacts with the island nation.
</P>
<P>
   The flights from New York's Kennedy International Airport and
Los Angeles International Airport will be an addition to charter
flights already operating from Miami, long the sole gateway from
the United States to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said it was unclear when the new
flights would begin, and they insisted that the move did not
reflect any easing of the U.S. economic embargo imposed on Cuba and
its Communist government four decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the process that has been put in place for
some time where we are trying to improve people-to-people contact
and doing it in such a way as not to provide benefit to the Cuban
regime, which is precisely what the embargo is designed to
prevent,'' said James Rubin, the State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Still the move, which does not require congressional approval,
was harshly criticized by Cuban-American lawmakers and other
prominent American critics of Fidel Castro and his government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the Clinton administration's campaign to
circumvent the Cuban embargo and put pressure on Congress to lift
it,'' said Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., who was born in
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on visits to Cuba by American tourists remains in place.
Under federal regulations, travel to Cuba is limited to
journalists, scholars, athletes, artists, representatives of human
rights groups and others with a professional interest in Cuba, and
Americans who have family there. Americans with family on the
island are permitted once-a-year humanitarian visits.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said New York and Los Angeles were chosen as the new
gateways to Cuba as a result of a marketing study of passenger
demand, demographics and the availability of customs and
immigration agents to process the flights.
</P>
<P>
   He said the administration would not determine the schedule of
the new charter flights. ``It's up to the charter companies to
determine flight schedules,'' he said. ``We're simply authorizing
these flights, and market forces will determine the schedules.''
</P>
<P>
   The flights between Miami and Havana were reinstated last year
after a two-year ban that resulted from the deaths of four
Cuban-Americans whose unarmed civilian aircraft were shot down by
Cuban jet fighters north of the island.

 &HT;    Investors jump into unknown territories togetherBy Michael E.
Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a kind of moveable financial feast _ or maybe
it's more of a floating game of craps.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of investors, already successful in several other
technology pursuits, have again joined together to plunk down their
money and reputations on a promising but untested start-up company.
</P>
<P>
   Derivion Corp. is the young hopeful, setting up to sell
expertise to other companies who want to have customers
electronically pay and discuss bills. Behind that hope are some
familiar faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same group as we had with WebMD,'' said Boland Jones,
chairman and chief executive of Premiere Technologies, which has
invested in WebMD. ``If one of us ever gets an idea, we informally
bring it to committee. And we are all looking for deals that will
help our core businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he was the first approached by Derivion's founders,
was convinced and took the notion to others. ``We saw it as a
hugely viable business that nobody else was going for.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Ellis, chairman and CEO of iXL Holdings, said the
attraction was obvious _ and familiar. ``We see it as another
WebMD-type opportunity. This group understands the risks, rewards
and the style of the Internet. And we trust each other. Someone
says, 'here's the deal, and how much are you in for?'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jones and Ellis sit on the board of Derivion, as well as
that of WebMD. Also on both boards are Rex Fuqua, managing director
of Fuqua Capital, and Olympic organizer Billy Payne, who is also
vice-chairman of WebMD and a board member of Premiere.
</P>
<P>
   And Derivion's offices are moving to a building near the
headquarters of both Premiere and WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD, which a year ago was an unknown gearing up for a launch,
is today poised for a merger with California-based Healtheon.
Neither company has yet made a profit, but even though Healtheon's
stock _ and WebMD's presumptive worth _ has been sliding, it is
still worth about $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Like WebMD, 55-employee Derivion is pegging its future to the
Internet. But unlike WebMD, consumers will not know they are
dealing with Derivion, which sells its service only to businesses.
And while WebMD was founded and led by Jeff Arnold, a salesman and
marketer, Derivion's management is a bit more technical.
</P>
<P>
   Greg J. Rable is Derivion's CEO, working from the company
headquarters in Atlanta. Working for companies that included
Georgia Pacific and i2 Technologies, he has done strategic
development and project management. Dushyant Sharma, who met Rable
at i2, is now president and chief technology officer of Derivion,
heading up a research team in Toronto. He is an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Like WebMD's founder, they are 30 years old.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just the same old crew that sees a jackpot in
Derivion.
</P>
<P>
   Greystone Capital Partners recently invested $5 million in
Derivion. Greystone is in the business of trading working capital
for partial ownership of a young company. Venture capitalists don't
expect a quick turnaround _ just a hefty profit if the company
succeeds and goes public. Two-year-old Greystone, based in Atlanta,
has also invested in several other Atlanta companies, including
iXL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell how successful Derivion can be,'' said
Tom Rosencrants, chairman and chief executive of Greystone. ``What
is especially interesting is that the top management is very young
and they don't put any limits on themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors like the market Derivion is after and they like the
company's technology _ the potential is enormous. But that is not
enough to coax an investment, Rosencrants said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is secondary _ the people are always first,'' he
said. ``First and foremost, we invest in people. You could convince
me you have the best technology ever developed, but if we don't
have supreme confidence in the people, we will never invest.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right people was also critical from the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Rable said he and his partner Dushyant Sharma had the idea and
the technology and started making the rounds in metro Atlanta,
looking for ``champions.'' Soon enough, they found Jones and Ellis.
And through those two, they found Sergio Zyman, former chief
marketing officer of Coca-Cola Co. and Fuqua.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good successful people in Atlanta have a lot of contacts
themselves,'' Rable said. ``It's no secret that having backers that
are successful helps out a lot. It's really immeasurable.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to measure it would be in terms of cash: from those
contacts and a number of others, Derivion has so far raised nearly
$14 million in venture funding, the latest round coming in the
spring. Greystone and Premiere were the two lead investors in that
second round. The rest came from Fuqua Capital, Mercury Ventures,
American Software, Intercept Group and The Raptor Fund.
</P>
<P>
   About 8 million bills were paid online last year, but Derivion _
and most analysts _ believe the number is climbing. Derivion cites
experts who forecast 1 billion bills will be paid online by 2001. A
1998 study by Killen &AMP; Associates projects the market to reach
$18.8 billion in revenue by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Avivah Litan of the Gartner Group said the company has
shaped a good business plan that should appeal to small and
medium-sized companies that do not have resources enough to build
their own Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   That market should grow from $250 million this year to $1.5
billion in two years, she said. ``The challenge for Derivion is
that they are competing with some pretty big players who have also
had some good wins.''
</P>
<P>
   What Derivion needs most is a compact with CheckFree Holdings,
another Atlanta company which has a virtual stranglehold on
Internet distribution of payments.
</P>
<P>
   Derivion plans a $5 million advertising campaign meant to extend
its reach as the pile of possibilities increases. And Rable said he
expects to make good on the potential his backers saw in his
company.

 &HT;    Mindspring strategy is targeted marketing
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises executives, after a week of
confusing stock analysts, are clear about their company's new
marketing mission.
</P>
<P>
   They want to get their software into as many people's hands as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't want just anybody. The company is aiming for a
very specific segment of ``open-minded, independent'' people whom
piles of research and focus groups have shown are most likely to
become MindSpring subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring's strategy is to carefully target its advertising
campaign within the top 20 metropolitan markets. Direct mail and
point-of-purchase deals will focus narrowly on places where
potential customers spend their offline time.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike America Online, which in its heyday nearly covered the
earth with installation disks, MindSpring's strategy calls for
smart bombing, not carpet bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to tell people what we are selling,'' says MindSpring
Executive Vice President Lance Weatherby. ``We have to let people
know we sell Internet access and we do it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not turning into America Online,'' he says,
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to admit they are great marketers. I don't want
to make light of all the money we are spending, but AOL spends a
whole lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes at least 1million of the targeted consumers
will sign up with MindSpring.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, MindSpring stunned analysts and investors with the
news that it planned to forgo profits in the next three quarters to
increase spending on marketing and advertising to a total $45
million to $55 million above the original goal of 20 percent of
revenues. The plan is to grow its subscriber base from 1.2 million
to 2 million by this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts' response to the news was mixed. One analyst downgraded
the stock moments after the announcement. Others, who were usually
bullish on the Midtown-based ISP, were frustrated by its failure to
immediately outline details of the campaign or what research it was
based on. MindSpring stock took a beating, losing 26.6 percent over
the past five trading days. It closed Tuesday at $29.56 1/4, down
$1.43 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Mindspring was ready to talk details.
</P>
<P>
   The problem facing MindSpring and other Internet service
providers looking to acquire more subscribers is the higher costs
of bringing new members on board.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that MindSpring is spending $200 for each new
subscriber, compared with only $75 a year ago. Rival ISP Earthlink
spends about $126 per new subscriber vs. $110 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's very apparent is that it's getting more competitive to
acquire customers,'' says Jeff Sadler an analyst with FAC Equity in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler says the cost of gaining new subscribers will rise even
higher in the coming year as the field becomes more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   But MindSpring feels the time has come to sacrifice
profitability in favor of growth and Chairman Charles Brewer's
desire to be a clear No. 2 after industry leader AOL.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, Weatherby says the company has to launch a brand
recognition campaign combined with getting those MindSpring disks
out to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   This week MindSpring announced a deal with Office Max, the
office supply superstore, to distribute co-branded MindSpring disks
in every OfficeMax retail store. That's just the tip of the
marketing iceberg, according to Weatherby. He says MindSpring disks
will be available in more than 2,700 different retail stores by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Other initiatives include TV, radio, print and billboard
advertising and focused direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing blitz will start in September with the launch of
version 4.0 of the MindSpring software, which has been in
development for about a year. It will be much easier to use and
will feature a community section that will include events, chat and
instant messaging software from Excite Pal.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring is also retooling its start page, another big concern
for analysts. They insist that without a ``sticky'' homepage filled
with things like chat and instant messaging, it will be harder to
keep users onboard. MindSpring will soon offer a personal start
page users can customize with a variety of news, sports, finance
and entertainment sources.
</P>
<P>
   Making a better product should help lure subscribers, but new
and improved software isn't worth much if nobody's using it. That's
where careful marketing comes in. ``This is not a blanket
campaign,'' Weatherby says, adding that there's no point in adding
subscribers if the system can't support them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the scale of the effort brings with it a problem
MindSpring has been struggling with ever since it topped 1 million
subscribers in January with the acquisition of pioneer Internet
provider Netcom _ that is how keep the offbeat qualities and
excellent customer service that led users to the company in the
first place. The plan is to convince new Internet users that
MindSpring is an easy to use and enjoyable Internet experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question we keep asking ourselves,'' says Weatherby, ``is
how do we go out and get big without losing our soul.'' Frances
Katz writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga.

ARMEY DOUBTS CONGRESS WILL PASS ANY GUN-CONTROL MEASURE BEFORE
RECESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By FRANK BRUNI  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Majority Leader Dick Armey said Tuesday that
disagreements between Republicans and Democrats about how
extensively to regulate gun shows remained serious enough that
Congress was unlikely to pass any new gun-control legislation
before the beginning of a monthlong recess Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't anticipate we will get it done,'' said Armey, who then
proceeded to blame the sluggish pace on Democrats' insistence on
the language and terms of a tough gun show provision that was
narrowly approved in the Senate in May but failed in the House in
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to be just sort of locked down on that one
provision,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic advocates of gun control acknowledged that they were
wedded to the measure, but only, they said, because anything
substantially short of it would be ineffectual and represent a
capitulation to the National Rifle Association, which has lobbied
fiercely against the Senate gun show provision.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday that he would mount a
filibuster in the Senate against any gun-control measure that did
not include the Senate gun show provision, or something very close
to it.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to Republican leaders' sustained opposition to that
measure, Schumer added, ``It could be a stalemate.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was referring to the fate of compromise legislation
being hammered out at a conference of House and Senate lawmakers
who are supposed to reconcile the differences _ many involving gun
control measures _ in juvenile crime bills that passed each
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lawmakers on the conference have yet to schedule
their first public meeting, their staffs are working busily behind
the scenes to find some middle ground on gun control, and
especially on the regulation of gun shows, that will not alienate
Democrats like Schumer but will also appeal to enough Republicans
to succeed. The conference report would be put before each chamber
and would require majority votes in both to be enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Armey and Schumer demonstrated just how tricky a
task the conferees face, and how much of their work will focus on
the terms and nuances of any measure to regulate gun shows by
requiring all vendors at the events to conduct mandatory background
checks on customers. Currently, only licensed dealers, who
represent about 60 percent of the vendors at gun shows, must
perform those checks.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate provision defines gun shows liberally and allows up
to three business days for vendors to get the results of background
checks. Many House Republican leaders, like Armey, prefer a
narrower definition of gun shows and a 24-hour limit on background
checks, terms that the House approved in an amendment to a wider
gun-control package that ultimately died.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates said the longer time period was essential
to make sure criminals did not get guns, and that a tough gun show
provision would represent a much more effective advance in gun
control than any of the other measures like to emerge from the
conference, including child safety devices for handguns and a
prohibition on gun ownership for adults convicted of violent crimes
as juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., one of three Senate Republicans
appointed to the conference, said in a television interview Sunday
that the Senate gun show provision ``could be a killer amendment,''
guaranteeing the demise of any legislation to which it was
attached.
</P>
<P>
   The statements by Sessions and Schumer could be deliberately
exaggerated attempts to sway the conference. Pressed about whether
any dilution of the Senate gun show provision would prompt a
filibuster, Schumer indicated that he might accept subtle changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has to have the spirit and concept of the
Senate-passed legislation,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic and Republican aides in the House said that
such a measure was precisely what negotiators were striving to
craft. But they acknowledged that a deal that could get enough
votes from lawmakers on the conference would not necessarily get
enough votes in the House.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Tuesday that he was not
meddling in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to let the conferees work it out,'' Hastert said.

CHILD'S EARLY EATING HABITS AFFECT HIS ADULT HEALTH
</HEADLINE>

By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You will become what you eat. What children eat as toddlers in
many cases will decide how healthy they will be as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are uncovering links between childhood nutrition and
serious adult diseases, including osteoporosis and obesity. They
say the first years of life are crucial in building the bone mass
needed to prevent osteoporosis and in establishing the lifestyle
habits necessary to stave off obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatric nutrition experts discussed these recent research
findings at a telebriefing in conjunction with the 14th National
Conference on Advances in Perinatal and Pediatric Nutrition. It was
sponsored by Children's Health Services at Stanford University
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Experts noted the alarming trend of obesity among American
children. More than 20 percent of children are overweight, and as
many as 50 percent of obese children become obese adults, with a
higher risk for heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a child is overweight at 6, he has a 25 percent chance of
becoming an overweight adult. If he is overweight at 12, there is a
75 percent probability he will be overweight as an adult,'' said
Dr. William Klish, professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of
Medicine and head of the department of medicine at Texas Children's
Hospital in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overweight parents make overweight children,'' said Klish.
Former chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on
Nutrition, he directs the eating disorders clinic at Texas
Children's.
</P>
<P>
   Children who are obese are also at risk for developing sleep
apnea and skeletal abnormalities. A lot of obese children begin
having problems with their hip joints and knees early in life.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest problem of obesity in children may be the
lasting psychological effects, Klish said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of self-esteem is overwhelming. There is a lot of
depression,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also discussed the need for parents of infants to take
preventive measures against osteoporosis, a bone disease most
commonly associated with old age in which bones lose density and
become more brittle. The condition is associated with a loss of
calcium from the bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Osteoporosis is a pediatric disease,'' said Dr. Laura
Bachrach, associate professor of pediatrics at Stanford and a
specialist in pediatric skeletal health. ``Infancy and childhood
are critical times to build bone mass. Prevention must begin from
the first days of life. We must optimize bone health in young
people. Gains in the first three decades sustain you for a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You reach your peak bone mass, your lifetime maximum amount,
at 20 to 30 years,'' said Bachrach. ``It serves as your bone banks
for the rest of your life. The larger the bank account, the longer
it can withstand withdrawals.''
</P>
<P>
   Changes in hormone levels, especially at menopause; some
diseases, including asthma and the drugs necessary to control it;
cystic fibrosis; eating disorders; and certain genetic combinations
all deplete the account, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, 25 million to 30 million Americans are affected by
osteoporosis. It costs $13 billion a year to treat the
complications, primarily bone fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Despite advertisements in popular magazines, there is no pill to
cure or repair the damage from osteoporosis, Bachrach said. To
prevent it, a diet high in calcium and weight-bearing exercise are
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to milk and cheese, calcium-rich foods include dark
green leafy vegetables, figs, sardines, nuts, sesame seeds and
soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   Klish warns against using food to comfort children, and stresses
the importance of children eating regular meals, preferably family
meals, sitting at a dining table, rather than grazing all day. He
encourages parents to offer a variety of foods and not let their
own food prejudices get in the way of promoting healthful eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to teach our children early on that there's lots of
variety out there. Keep offering them new foods to try, and don't
put in your own biases. When a parent doesn't like a food, he
transmits that dislike to his children,'' Klish said.

GIAMBI MAKES IMPACT WITH ROYALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- A web site devoted to fantasy baseball describes
Jeremy Giambi as the one rookie in the major leagues this year who
has the potential to win a batting title some day.
</P>
<P>
   But, Giambi, 24, a left-handed outfielder and sometime DH for
the Kansas City Royals, isn't one of those guys who looks that far
ahead. In fact, this week he's simply satisfied being able to visit
his parents' Covina home while the Royals play a three-game series
with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to sleep in my own bed for a few nights,'' Giambi
said. ``That's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Giambi he'll be back on the road after the
Royals and Angels wrap up their series tonight at Edison
International Field.
</P>
<P>
   As for the batting title, those who best know Jeremy, a 1992
graduate of South Hills High School in West Covina, believe it's in
his reach someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being able to hit for a high average,'' Giambi said.
``Another thing I have going for me is that my on base percentage
has always been high.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt he can also hit in the clutch, said his high
school baseball coach Jim Bastion.
</P>
<P>
   He should know. Bastion also coached Jeremy's brother Jason
Giambi, the Oakland A's power hitting first baseman. ``His game is
more power,'' Jeremy said of his older brother.
</P>
<P>
   As for the younger Giambi?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremy was a very good clutch hitter -- one of the better
clutch hitters I've ever had coaching,'' Bastion recalled.
</P>
<P>
   South Hills fans will remember the 1992 CIF championship game
that Giambi helped win with a crucial RBI single to tie the game in
the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of his biggest hits ever,'' Bastion said. ``We
were trailing by one, Jeremy knocked in the tying run and we went
on to win. He even pitched about 5 2/3 or 6 innings of that game.''
</P>
<P>
   The word champion seems to follow Jeremy Giambi. After leaving
South Hills, he attended Cal State Fullerton and was a member of
the school's 1995 squad that won the National Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy was taken by the Royals in the sixth round of the 1996
June Free AGent Draft. By 1998 he won the PCL batting title and led
all minor leaguers with a .372 batting average at Omaha. He ws
called up by the Royals in September of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's spent some time on the disabled list this season,
Giambi has had an impact on his team. Going into the series with
the Angels, Giambi had posted a .288 average in 146 at bats.
Through Monday he had 42 hits, 18 RBIs and one home run.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday he struggled against the Angels, going 0-4 with a
walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said this, `I'm finding out quickly that there a big
difference between Triple-A and major leagues,' '' Bastion said.
``He seemed to be struggling a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   His health isn't a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm healthy,'' Giambi said. ``I'm hanging in there and working
on my consistency. I'm still learning the pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Being on a team loaded with young talent, helps Giambi's
attitude, despite the fact that the Royals were 44-61 entering
Tuesday's game with the Angels. But, the team is also on a bit of a
winning jag, having won six of their last 10, including Monday's
game against the Angels by a 12-4 score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps when my team's doing well,'' he said. ``That's when
things pick up for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that Giambi is playing for Kansas City, he's
still very much tied to the San Gabriel Valley. Last fall he
participated in the inaugural South Hills Scramble Golf Tournament
and plans to do the same this year, Bastion said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in my foursome last year,'' Bastion said. ``And when I
asked him to do it again, he said, `Heck ya.' ''

<P>
   Remember: It is important to prevent health problems rather than
treat them.
</P>
<P>
   Play with your children outdoors, biking and walking together
and sharing interests in all kinds of sports.
</P>
<P>
   To foster bone health, think of ways to get the skeleton working
against gravity: running, jumping, climbing, dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Sit down at a table and eat with your children. Encourage
children to eat three meals a day, and one snack in the afternoon.
Discourage grazing.
</P>
<P>
   Establish adequate calcium intake and make sure your child gets
enough each day. Young children need 800 milligrams; adolescents
should have 1,300. Most adolescents fall far short. (A cup of milk
contains 300.)
</P>
<P>
   Don't assume your baby is hungry every time she cries. Don't
offer sweet treats to comfort toddlers and older children when they
are upset.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that it's never too early to start healthful eating and
healthful lifestyle habits. It's great that 5- and 6-year-olds are
getting to play soccer, but 2- and 3-year-olds need to be out
tumbling around on playgrounds and jumping off low blocks or steps.
</P>
<P>
   Offer your child a variety of food. Try a new food with your
child at least once a week. Remember, children develop likes and
dislikes early in life.
</P>
<P>
   Limit time spent in front of a television or computer. Keep a
log and add up the time spent in energetic activities.
</P>
<P>
   Set a good example.

MORTGAGE RATES TOP 8 PERCENT IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER KAMINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The average interest rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate
mortgage for both Massachusetts and the nation climbed above 8
percent Tuesday for the first time in two years, a move some
observers predicted could rein in the booming housing market.
</P>
<P>
   While economists acknowledge a fixed-rate mortgage interest rate
of 8 percent historically would be considered moderate - the rates
averaged just under 7 percent just last April- many home buyers
cursed themselves for failing to purchasing a home sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some real estate agents are are literally laughing at
all the hubbub.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started in the business (in the late 80s) rates were at
12 percent,'' said Robert Byrne, owner of a Century 21 The
Alexanders real estate in Needham. ``I remember selling a house to
a man when the rates dropped from 12 to 10.5 percent. And he was
thrilled to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrne said that even when mortgage rates rose to 18 percent the
market kept on chugging. ``People still bought and sold houses. It
just changes what you can buy,'' Byrne said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts average 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rates
actually topped 8 percent for the first time in two-and-half years
on Monday afternoon. That was probably in anticipation of the
national rate increase which occurred Tuesday, said Gary Sweatt,
vice president of Mortgage Information Services, a Needham group
that tracks state mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
   Although the change in the interest rate from a week ago is just
a few hundreths of a percentage point, Sweatt said the 8 percent
benchmark has the potential to impact the entire domestic economy,
from home construction to manufacturing and eventually to the
retail sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't buy a house, then you can't buy furnishings,''
Sweatt said. ``And then you can't get the roof fixed. This will
affect the whole economy.''
</P>
<P>
   A change in the mortgage market ignites fears that inflation
rates are creeping, said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH
Associates, a New Jersey financial publisher. HSH tallied the
national average on a 30-year fixed-rate at 8.08 percent Tuesday,
up from a two-year low of 6.85 percent in September 1998. The
weekly survey by mortgage company Freddie Mac, released Thursday,
is expected to show a similar level.
</P>
<P>
   The jump to an 8 percent mortgage rate has stemmed primarily
from a similar rise in the interest rates of 10-year U.S. Treasury
bonds. The two rates generally mirror one anothers movements
because most mortgages are resold as investment products known as
mortgage-backed securities, which compete for investment dollars
with various types of bonds, including the 10-year Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bond rates have climbed on fears that inflation is on
the rise, and that the Federal Reserve Bank will increase interest
rates across the board to stem a surge in the prices of consumer
goods when the board meets next on Aug. 24. Higher interest rates
tend to reduce consumer spending, and, consequently, the costs of
goods.
</P>
<P>
   The re-financing market has alreaded been affected. Maureen
Elliot, with Ivy Mortgage Corp. _ a subsidiary of Staten Island
Savings Bank _ said more people are turning to adjustable mortgage
rates to avoid fixed rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three months ago our business was 99 percent straight fixed
mortgates,'' Elliot said. ``Now I would estimate about 20 to 30
percent of our customer have turned to adjustable rates. We are
definitely seeing a shift.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists recognize that higher mortgage interest rates could
actually slow the economy and give housing market a well-needed
breather, but that is not going to happen overnight, Bumbinger
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure the Fed would welcome some slowdown of the economy
and a cooling in housing,'' Bumbinger said.
</P>
<P>
   But some economists are asking ``What's so magic about eight?''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Nothaft, deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac said the
8-percent benchmark is receiving undeserved attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth any increase in the level of mortgage rates will slow
down housing activity than what it would have been otherwise,''
Nothaft said. ``But it doesn't mean the world is going to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first six months of the year have been absolutely
excellent. Any change would ratch it down to only a very good
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Realtors are hoping that the higher rates might actually
increase number of home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general when mortgage rate increase there is a tendency for
people sitting on the fence to buy a house more quickly, so we see
a slight pick-up in business in the short term,'' said Jim
Dougherty, president of the Massachusetts Realtors Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``But any time the rates move up even a quarter of a point,....
there is going to be a segment of people that become uncomfortable
and act more strongly than I think is necessary at this time,''
Dougherty said.

 &HT;    Hawks have second thoughts about sending Jackson to L.A.
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Hawks on Tuesday backed away from a sign-and-trade
deal that would have sent newly acquired guard Jim Jackson to the
L.A. Clippers for center-forward Lorenzen Wright.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while the Hawks still would like to have Wright, they
are committed to both Jackson and Isaiah Rider for at least one
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the team we have,'' general manager Pete Babcock said
Tuesday. ``I've given it an awful lot of thought and I believe
we've improved our team. We have a team that can and will run the
ball and has versatility. I don't want to jeopardize that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers approached the Hawks about a Jackson-for-Wright
sign-and-trade soon after it became apparent that the Hawks and
Portland had arrived at a deal to exchange shooting guards. The
Hawks were so interested in the possibility of getting Wright that
he was in town Monday and Tuesday to take a physical and be
interviewed by Hawks management.
</P>
<P>
   But moving Jackson would have made the Hawks totally dependent
on Rider as their shooting guard and the mercurial player has shown
in six NBA seasons that he can be utterly unreliable at times,
missing 12 games in three years due to suspensions alone.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the wisdom of that decision, the Hawks Tuesday
evening had not spoken to Rider more than 24 hours after completing
the trade that sent Steve Smith and Ed Gray to Portland. Rider had
been located at his mother's home in Alameda, Calif. But he had not
returned Babcock's call. ``We'll get him,'' the general manager
said. ``I'm not worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider has until 4 p.m. Monday to pass a physical. In the event
he has not taken a physical at that point the deal can be
nullified, but that isn't likely.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a positive spin on things, Babcock said he liked the
versatility that he gets from Jackson, who is 6'-6'', 220 pounds
and can also play small forward. But in the main, the 28-year-old
is a relatively cheap insurance policy ($1.96 million this season,
$2.17 million in 2000-01) against Rider's potential contretemps
this season. He becomes a plausible alternative next season when
Rider becomes a free agent if the Hawks elect not to re-sign him
and instead go with Jackson and Dion Glover, their No. 20 pick in
June.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks remain interested in Wright and apparently have
offered a counter proposal but their chances of landing the 6'11''
center-forward are clearly diminished. In their favor, however, is
the precarious position in which the Clippers find themselves. They
have already lost three free agents _ Garrick Martin, Rodney Rogers
and Lamond Murray _ without compensation. Point guard Sherman
Douglas may not be far behind. The Hawks do have extra guards under
contract and an extra first round pick from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Hawks were still trying Tuesday to set up a
physical for Rider, Jackson flew in late Tuesday afternoon to Hawks
management and undergo a physical today.
</P>
<P>
   On moving to his fifth new team in 2 1/2 years, Jackson said at
an early evening press conference that, ``I've been through a
lot,'' so much so that even when Babcock told him that the Clippers
trade was dead, Jackson still wasn't certain that he would play for
the Hawks next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the business and I understand that,'' he said, adding
that it's up the player to make the best of a situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I sacrificed my game and J.R. sacrificed his game
and we were able to get to the Western Conference finals. So, we
saw it pay off. I'm willing to come here and make sacrifices again,
if that's what it takes to get us to a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Grinning, he said, ``Of course, if they want me to score I'll be
glad to do that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no question Jackson can score. He averaged
19.2 points in 1993-94, 25.4 points in 51 games at Dallas in
1994-95, 19.6 ppg. the following season.
</P>
<P>
   . In other important business, the Hawks still want to re-sign
free agents forwards Grant Long and Chris Crawford and Babcock
said, ``There are some big men out there in which we have some
interest'' if Wright is unattainable.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said he has virtually reached agreement with agent Keith
Glass, who represents Crawford, the Hawks starting small forward
after LaPhonso Ellis went down with a torn stomach muscle 20 games
into the abbreviated season. He started 30 games, averaging 6.9
points, 2.1 rebounds and delivered a stunning 31-point playoff
performance against the Knicks while playing with a separated right
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Long apparently can have a three-year deal at the middle class
exception, a $6.6 million package, if he stays with the Hawks after
returning to the club last season and averaging 9.8 points, 5.9
rebounds as an alternate power forward behind Alan Henderson.

 &HT;    Scottish opposition to resort development gives up
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Community leaders in picturesque St. Andrews, Scotland,
are giving up their fight to stop a Georgia-based developer from
adding a 520-acre golf resort to the ancient birthplace of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of the line as far as the local opposition
goes,'' Frank Riddell, chairman of the St. Andrews Community
Council, said Tuesday, the day after that body decided against
taking legal action to block the development.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been too expensive _ and perhaps too quixotic _ to
try to stop an $80 million project in court, the dejected Riddell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Panoz and his big battalions have got the money and they
can force this through,'' he said, referring to the Georgia
millionaire and founder of Chateau Elan who is among the project's
backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as the community council, with an income of about 2,000
pounds a year ($3,200), we don't have the money to fight,'' Riddell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Panoz was on vacation Tuesday and could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Iain MacKinnon, the project's operations director in
Scotland, said the plans already have been adjusted substantially
to take into account local concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In MacKinnon's view, the meeting Monday night provided proof
that most of the people in the town favor the project.
</P>
<P>
   Riddell sees the project _ two golf courses, conference center,
208-room hotel, luxury cottages, restaurant/bar and spa/leisure
complex _ as more damage to an already tourist-weary town.
</P>
<P>
   St. Andrews, where golf was born more than 500 years ago,
already has six courses, including the legendary Old Course and the
Royal &AMP; Ancient Golf Club. Two more are planned. Every year, about
300,000 visitors pass through the town of 14,500 people on the way
to the tees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing what we can to reduce traffic in the (center of
town center) _ which is at its limits _ and to deal with our
tourism, and this development will cause damage on both counts,''
Riddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction began three weeks ago and is expected to continue
for four to five years. Both the late golf great Gene Sarazen and
prominent Scottish golfer Sam Torrance were involved in planning
the project's two courses.
</P>
<P>
   One course tentatively is set to open by July 2001 and the
second, a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The project is being developed by St. Andrews Bay Development
Ltd., a Scottish subsidiary of Fountainhead Development of
Braselton, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Henk Evers, the CEO of Fountainhead, expressed elation Tuesday
that the opposition finally had ended. He and Panoz visited the
site in May 1998 and acquired it later that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absolutely stunning site,'' Evers said. ``It's right
on the bay, about two kilometers from the city of St. Andrews.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fife Council, which has authority over planning in the
county, approved the plans a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Riddell's complaints, MacKinnon said, ``All those
issues were dealt with before it was approved by the Fife Council.
It's a very environmentally conscious area, and with good reason,
and we are conscious of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also intends to meet with the Scottish Heritage
Society, a preservation group, to make sure the project is
compatible with its surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The project will be connected to the city by a coastal path at
low tide, and every effort is being made to fit it into the area's
green belt efforts, Evers said.
</P>
<P>
   Riddell and others accuse the Fife Council of ignoring its own
standards on controlling development in the rush to create jobs.
They point bitterly to the fact that none of the Fife Council
members who approved the plan come from St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of being in St. Andrews is clear to any golfer, of
course. ``The birthplace of golf is St. Andrews, and that's where
it all started,'' Evers said.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers from North America and Japan all want to play in St.
Andrews, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But the project will also appeal to Scots themselves, he
predicted. And it will be a great addition to the Scottish economy,
which is already heavily oriented toward tourism.

<P>
   Finally, a part of professional wrestling that might not be
rigged.
</P>
<P>
   Most ardent fans of the World Wrestling Federation know that
matches between grapplers like Stone Cold Steve Austin and the
Undertaker are heavily scripted. Apparently, few care, judging by
the tremendous popularity _ and huge profitability _ of what is one
of the most-watched events on television.
</P>
<P>
   So after cashing in on the public's taste for increasingly
outrageous competitions, the company that promotes and stages the
most popular wrestling events, including Wrestlemania, will try to
cash in on the public's fervor for initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc. said
it would seek to raise up to $175 million by selling a minority
stake in the company, which produces such television shows as ``Raw
Is War'' and ``WWF Smackdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to its wrestlers as ``athletic performers'' who are
particularly prized for their ``acting ability,'' the wrestling
company explains in its filing with regulators how it ``develops
soap opera-like story lines employing the same techniques that are
used by many successful dramatic television series,'' including
``good-versus-evil or settling-the-score themes.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its shortcomings as a sport, wrestling is an extremely
lucrative business. It dominates the rankings of cable television
shows, delivering to advertisers millions of males aged 18 to 34,
one of the most sought-after groups.
</P>
<P>
   Those high ratings have produced stellar financial results,
according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In those documents, which disclose for the first time financial
information about the privately owned company, the World Wrestling
Federation said its revenues tripled over the last two years, to
$251 million in the 12 months ended April 30. Pretax profits grew
even more quickly, to $56 million in the most recent period from a
loss of $6.5 million two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid gains will probably make the shares highly attractive
to individual investors, particularly wrestling fans.
</P>
<P>
   But the stock offering could also signal that wrestling has
reached one of its cyclical peaks of popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Maguire, a professor of sociology at Western Illinois
University, who has studied wrestling as well as deviant behavior,
said that in its latest period of rising popularity, professional
wrestling has turned to more and more outlandish and violent
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only go so far with that before you start putting
people off,'' Maguire said. ``They may have already hit that
mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, professional wrestling and its practitioners have
gained a higher profile after last year's election of a former
wrestler, Jesse Ventura, known as ``the Body,'' as governor of
Minnesota. Several other current and former wrestlers have pondered
public office, including Bob Backlund, who is a Republican
candidate for Congress from the Hartford, Conn., area.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ventura has been loath to turn his back on the ring. Last
month, the WWF announced that the Body would act as a referee for
SummerSlam, a pay-per-view event scheduled for Aug. 22 in
Minneapolis. The WWF stages 12 pay-per-view events annually; they
account for roughly one-third of its total revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wrestling Federation is not the only major televised
wrestling league; its archrival, World Championship Wrestling, is
owned by Turner Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Time Warner. (So
fierce is the rivalry that CNN, the Time Warner news network, did
not cover the announcement of Ventura's participation in the WWF
event, which was carried live by the Fox News Channel and MSNBC.)
</P>
<P>
   The WWF so far has the edge, at least in viewers. The television
ratings of the World Wrestling Federation are in fact the envy of
many sports leagues. Its flagship television program, ``Raw Is
War,'' was the top-rated cable television program for 19 straight
weeks through June 30, according to the Nielsen ratings. And its
two Monday-night hours on the USA Network earned 26 of the top 30
rankings on the Nielsen list of most watched shows among all basic
cable networks in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly for a company in the business of
staging dramatic fights, the WWF is engaged in plenty of its own
battles. Most recently, the family of Owen Hart, the wrestler who
was known as Blue Blazer, sued the company for negligence following
the death of Hart in May during a televised pay-per-view wrestling
match. Hart fell 50 feet into the ring as he was being lowered from
the ceiling of the Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The company said in its securities filing that it will fight the
suit, but added that an unfavorable outcome could have ``a material
adverse effect'' on its financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to its somewhat unwholesome reputation, the WWF is a
family business, spanning four generations of the company's
founding family. Currently, World Wrestling Federation
Entertainment is wholly owned by Vincent K. McMahon, of Stamford,
Conn., who serves as chairman, and Linda McMahon, who serves as
president and chief executive. McMahon's father, Vincent F.
McMahon, founded Capitol Wrestling, a predecessor company. His
father, Jess McMahon, also was in the professional wrestling
business. And Shane McMahon, son of the company's chief officers,
is now president of the WWF's new media business.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The WWF has been a stunning success for the McMahons. In June,
the company paid McMahon $25.5 million of accumulated profits, or
nearly two-thirds of the company's total cache of retained
earnings. In addition, the company lent McMahon $32 million to pay
taxes. Ms. McMahon also owns a travel agency that provides services
for most of the performers and employees of the wrestling
federation.
</P>
<P>
   The McMahons will surrender little if any control by selling a
stake in the business. In an offering led by Bear Stearns &AMP; Co.,
the company plans to offer an as yet unspecified number of class A
shares, leaving the McMahons with voting control of the company
through their ownership of all of the Class B stock, which has 10
votes for every one vote of the class A shares. The company plans
to use the proceeds of the offering to upgrade its television
facilities and expand its Internet operation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the wrestling business is quite as
profitable for the performers, who are classified as independent
contractors. The company's documents contain no details on how much
the performers are paid, although the most popular performers are
believed by sports and entertainment experts to earn millions of
dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 110 wrestlers do not now own stock, but the
company said it planned to use shares of stock ``to assist us in
attracting and retaining key employees, directors, consultants and
performers.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike professional athletes who are generally free to sell
their services to any team, the wrestlers do not own the characters
they portray. If a wrestler attempts to move to a rival wrestling
league, the WWF retains the right to the ring persona.
</P>
<P>
   That unusual feature of the business has been the subject of
numerous legal disputes. For example, James Hellwig, a former WWF
wrestler, has filed a lawsuit in state court in Arizona claiming he
owns the rights to the characters Ultimate Warrior and Warrior. The
company has filed a countersuit in federal court in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently settled for an undisclosed amount a lawsuit
brought by Rena Mero, a former WWF women's champion who wrestled
under the name Sable and had sought $110 million for a host of
claims, including being harassed for refusing to have her gown torn
off during a match. USA Today reported last month that as part of
the settlement, Ms. Mero, who recently posed for Playboy, agreed to
stay out of wrestling for three years and relinquished her claims
to the Sable name.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling is not the company's only business. It owns a hotel in
Las Vegas, which it said it intended to sell, and recently signed a
deal to create a $25 million theme restaurant, seating more than
600 patrons, in the old Paramount Theater site in Times Square, at
the northwest corner of 43rd Street and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   There, patrons will be able to sit amid memorabilia of their
favorite wrestling stars and debate whether the outcomes of WWF
matches are rigged. To that question, James Byrne, senior vice
president for marketing at the WWF, gives an opaque reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrestling is 100 percent entertainment,'' he said. ``There's
no such thing as fake entertainment.''

PANEL ORDERS GOVERNMENT TO PAY $16 MILLION FOR FILM OF KENNEDY
ASSASSINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A divided federal arbitration panel announced on
Tuesday that the government must pay the heirs of Abraham Zapruder
$16 million for his film of President John F. Kennedy's
assassination, the highest price ever paid for a historical
American artifact.
</P>
<P>
   The award, which cannot be appealed, was about halfway between
the $30 million sought by the Zapruder family and the $1 million
offered by the Justice Department as compensation for the
quarter-inch-wide, six-foot long strip of film that experts said
was too fragile to safely run through a projector.
</P>
<P>
   The government acquired Zapruder's 26-second film last year
under a federal law that requires all records of the Kennedy
assassination to be transferred to the National Archives for
preservation, research and other noncommercial purposes. The
government had acknowledged that the Zapruder family was entitled
to fair reimbursement as owners of private property taken by the
government for public use.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, two of the panel's three members, Arlin M. Adams and
Kenneth R. Feinberg, wrote in their majority decision that the film
made by Zapruder, as the Kennedy motorocade rolled through Dallas
on Nov. 23, 1963, was ``a unique historical item of unprecedented
worth.'' A third member of the panel, Walter E. Dellinger,
dissented. He said that the price set by the majority ``was simply
too large an amount in light of the evidence in the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellinger said that an award of $3 million to $5 million would
have been more realistic. He said that since the Zapruder family
already controls the licensing of images on the film, the only
issue was the value of the original film strip as a collectible
object.
</P>
<P>
   Dellinger said that there have been no documented sales of any
other historically significant original film strips, a finding
which he said, ``strongly suggests that a camera original
ordinarily has little independent value.''
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's majority said that they were persuaded that the
film was immensely valuable by experts hired by lawyers for the
Zapruder family who testified at a two-day hearing in May. The
experts, former employees of auction houses like Sotheby's and
Christie's, said that the film was a one-of-a-kind historical
relic.
</P>
<P>
   The majority decision concluded that the film's worth was
further enhanced by the soaring prices commanded for Kennedy
historical memorabilia in recent years, like the Louis XVI desk on
which President Kennedy signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963,
which sold at auction in 1996 for $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The majority said it was also guided by the astronomical prices
paid recently for other historically unique artifacts, like the
$30.8 million paid in 1994 by Bill Gates, the co-founder and
chairman of Microsoft, for the Leonardo da Vinci Codex, a rare
notebook containing more than 300 illustrations and scientific
writings by the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Zapruder, a Dallas dress manufacturer, died of cancer in 1970 at
the age of 66.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued on Tuesday by a family company, LMH, the
Zapruder family said, ``We believer the result reached by the
arbitration panel is fair and reasonable.'' The statement said the
family was pursuing a permanent arrangement to transfer licensing
rights to the film, which the family retained, to a public
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. Bennett, a lawyer for the family, said on Tuesday that
he was pleased by the decision. ``The family and the government
agreed that arbitration was the most dignified way to satisfy the
constitutional requirement of just compensation,'' he said. ``This
approach assured that the National Archives will possess the film
for the benefit of all the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   David W. Ogden, acting assistant attorney general for the
Justice Department's Civil Division, offered no assessment of the
amount of the award. He said in a statement, ``The resolution of
these issues insures that this evidence of one of the most tragic
events in American history will be protected for scholarly and
research uses.''
</P>
<P>
   The award was a clear-cut victory for the Zapruder family. The
government offered to pay the family $3 million before the
arbitration proceedings began, rejecting the Zapruder's proposal to
settle for $18.5 million, said several people who followed the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The final award was much closer to the family's settlement
figure. The family will be awarded an interest payment, which some
lawyers said would increase the final award amount to about $17
million. But the family must pay taxes and lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the price for the film is the most ever paid for an
historical American artifact. An original print of the Declaration
of Independence sold for more than $2 million, a manuscript of
President Abraham Lincoln's ``House Divided'' speech opposing
slavery sold for $1.5 million and President Dwight D. Eisenhower's
D-Day order sending allied troops into Europe during World War II
sold for $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The government faces a similar case in a legal challenge in
Federal District Court in Washington by the estate of former
President Richard M. Nixon, which is seeking to collect $35 million
in compensation and $175 million in compounded interest for tapes,
photos, films and documents the government seized after he left
office on Aug. 9, 1974. The government contends the estate is
entitled to nothing.

HIGH NUMBER OF HEPATITIS A CASES ALARMS TEXAS COUNTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hepatitis A is plaguing Eastland County, Texas and some panicked
residents have been forced to drive hundreds of miles for shots
because local doctors have run out.
</P>
<P>
   With 70 cases since April _ including one rare death attributed
to the virus _ the rural county of 19,200, about 100 miles west of
Fort Worth, has an infection rate as high as some poor border
towns, said Brad Walsh,.MDSU/.MDBR/.MDNM/ regional epidemiologist
for the Texas Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 70 cases now, which is a lot for a county that
usually has one to three a year,'' Walsh said. ``That makes it one
of the highest incidence counties in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest outbreak occurred in April and May, and Walsh said
its origin remains unclear. But more recent cases, linked to a
day-care center and two restaurants, have raised the level of
concern.
</P>
<P>
   About three weeks ago, seven adults and seven children
associated with an Eastland day-care center came down with the
virus, Walsh said. Then this week and last, health officials
announced that two area restaurants each had a worker with the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, health-care providers have been flooded with calls
from people who fear they were exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious residents have been forced to get on waiting lists for
vaccines or, for those already exposed, immune globulin or ``IG''
shots. Phones at local doctors' offices are so busy that state
health officials have resorted to communicating with them by fax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 200 calls yesterday,'' said Brenda
Bailey,.MDSU/.MDBR/.MDNM/ a nutritionist with Eastland County
health services. ``All residents calling, `Oh, I ate at the Sonic.'
People are just terrified in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis A is a viral infection of the liver whose flu-like
symptoms include nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and in some
cases fever and jaundice. The symptoms can last for several weeks
and can result in serious weight loss and dehydration, according to
the health department.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is spread by inadequate hand-washing after using the
restroom or changing an infected baby's diaper.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak in Eastland is blamed for the death of a
60-year-old who had other medical problems. But fatalities are
considered rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, if you're otherwise healthy, it's not dangerous,''
Walsh said. ``It's just miserable for a couple weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   That is small comfort to hundreds of residents who fear they
have been exposed and have had trouble getting the IG shot, which
is effective only if administered within 14 days of exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on the 12th page of the waiting list on Monday to get
in there to get the IG _ if they received it on time and if they
had enough,'' said Marilyn Gonce,.MDSU/.MDBR/.MDNM/ 45, a homemaker
who lives just outside Eastland.
</P>
<P>
   Gonce and her husband were eager to get the IG shot after
hearing last week that a worker at Sonic Drive-In in Eastland had
the virus.
</P>
<P>
   State officials urged anyone who had eaten there from July 21
through July 25 to get the injection. The Gonces had eaten at Sonic
twice during that period. Health officials issued the same warning
Monday for anyone who ate at the Smokestack Restaurant in Thurber
on July 25 or 26.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to get an appointment with a local doctor, and worried
that the 14-day window would close, the Gonces called friends
around the state and asked them to call doctors' offices in their
areas to see if the IG shots were available.
</P>
<P>
   They were prepared to drive 51/2 hours to Amarillo until they
located a doctor in Garland who could help them. They made the trip
_ 31/2 hours each way _ and received their shots Monday with two
days to spare.
</P>
<P>
   Eastland County Judge Brad Stephenson.MDSU/.MDBR/.MDNM/ said the
shot shortage is being addressed. The county administered 260 IG
shots Friday and ordered 350 doses of the vaccine to be distributed
this week, he said. In addition, the health department has obtained
600 doses of the pediatric vaccine, 100 doses of the adult vaccine
and 200 doses of IG.
</P>
<P>
   ``All efforts are being made to provide vaccine or IG to anyone
who wants it,'' Stephenson said.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreaks have been front-page news in a county whose two
biggest claims to fame occurred in the late 1920s: A violent bank
robbery by a man in a Santa suit, and a horned toad that supposedly
emerged alive after 31 years in a time capsule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We much prefer to talk about those two things,'' said Russ
Thomason,.MDSU/.MDBR/.MDNM/ president of the Eastland Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson said some residents are unduly alarmed about the
outbreak, noting that the Sonic restaurant received such high marks
in a recent state health inspection that it is unlikely that the
infected worker would have transmitted the virus to any customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fears are running high,'' he said. ``Some of it's justifiable
but some of it's really not.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomason, an attorney who once worked as a registered nurse,
said the outbreaks probably have made area restaurants extra
vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seen out every day in public eating at one or more
restaurants,'' he said ``Now we probably have some of the safest
restaurants in the state.''

<P>
   Eight present-day players _ and not a single catcher, second
baseman or third baseman _ are scattered among 100 candidates for
the dream roster.
</P>
<P>
   That's how you know the candidates were chosen by a
baseball-savvy committee and not by the dark marketing forces
responsible for basketball's all-time list a couple of years ago.
The NBA found room in its 50-man pantheon for nine active stars,
including Shaquille O'Neal and Patrick Ewing, surely selected for
their impressive collections of league-championship rings and MVP
trophies, not for their big-city promotional value.
</P>
<P>
   If the NBA people ran the baseball election, the ballot would
have to include Pedro Martinez, Randy Johnson, Mike Piazza, Jeff
Bagwell, Sammy Sosa, Larry Walker and at least one of the American
League's trio of sharp young shortstops.
</P>
<P>
   None of them makes it, although Roger Clemens, Greg Maddux, Mark
McGwire, Cal Ripken Jr., Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey Jr., Tony Gwynn
and Rickey Henderson do. So young voters are sent to the history
books, and lucky old-timers to their memories, to compare the
achievements and significance of players from 1900 to 1998, from
the World Series spotlight to the Negro League shadows.
</P>
<P>
   How many active players can reasonably be squeezed into the
25-man all-time all-star team that fans are asked to choose between
now and mid-September?
</P>
<P>
   I'm going for two: a pitcher, Maddux (in a close call over
Clemens), for defying the 1990s' offensive explosion and for
figuring out the modern strike zone, and an outfielder, Griffey
(over the less-complete Bonds), for a sensational first decade.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to find a spot for one more: Ripken, not just for 2,632
games in a row, also for what he did in them. But the ballot calls
for two shortstops, and there's no room next to Ernie Banks and
Honus Wagner, both of whom outrank Ripken even in the good-guy
department.
</P>
<P>
   It gets no easier after that.
</P>
<P>
   We're asked to pick six pitchers; lucky this club gets a lot of
days off. Here goes: Maddux, Lefty Grove, Walter Johnson, Sandy
Koufax, Satchel Paige and Cy Young himself.
</P>
<P>
   Six is not enough. There's no room for a reliever, who would be
Rollie Fingers, or my personal write-in choice, Hoyt Wilhelm, whose
late ascent to the big leagues at age 28 and 21-year career gives
hope to all of us undiscovered knuckleball pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Two catchers: Johnny Bench and Yogi Berra. Piazza is on pace to
better their offensive numbers. But he'll never match their winning
aura. Nobody will.
</P>
<P>
   Two first basemen: Lou Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx. McGwire just
passed Gehrig in home runs and is closing in on Foxx. Now Big Mac
needs to hit safely in 500 consecutive at-bats to match Foxx's
career batting average or 630 to match Gehrig's.
</P>
<P>
   Two second basemen: Joe Morgan and Jackie Robinson. To those
who'll point to Morgan's .271 career average _ you had to see him
in his prime as the best all-around member of the Big Red Machine.
To those who'll say Robinson is a politically correct choice _
you're right if you mean he's here because he's the most important
player in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Two third basemen: Mike Schmidt and Brooks Robinson. Bill James'
Historical Baseball Abstract named Schmidt the No. 1 third baseman
of all time. That book was written in 1984. Schmidt would play five
more years, adding 123 home runs and a third MVP award. The image
of Robinson, on his stomach, holding his Rawlings aloft to show
he'd hung onto Bench's liner in the 1970 World Series, sums up the
old baseball tradition of aw-shucks triumph. Earl Weaver _ Earl
Weaver! _ broke down crying at Brooks' retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Nine outfielders (can't we make it a dozen?): Start with Babe
Ruth, and then, in no particular order, Griffey, Hank Aaron, Ty
Cobb, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Stan Musial and Ted
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson? Frank Robinson? Pete Rose? I tried. Yes, Rose is on
the ballot, as is Shoeless Joe Jackson, despite their official
baseball bans.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you can find space for them on your bench.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots are available at ballparks, in Kmart stores, in Sports
Illustrated and TV Guide magazines and online at
majorleaguebaseball.com. Results will be announced Oct. 23 before
the World Series opener.
</P>
<P>
   Write-ins are permitted, so vote for Raul Mondesi if you must. &QL;

PANEL CITES INADEQUATE DATA ON RISKS OF `ENDOCRINE DISRUPTERS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A panel of experts convened to study a class of environmental
contaminants known as ``endocrine disrupters'' has concluded that
not enough is known about them to determine whether they cause
health problems at the low levels in which they typically occur in
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, convened by the National Research Council at the
request of federal agencies and Congress, said in its report
released Tuesday that as yet there is insufficient evidence to say
the chemicals are causing human cancers and other problems, like
infertility. While high concentrations of such compounds, like the
medication diethylstilbesterol and the pesticide DDT, can be
harmful to health, the panel wrote, ``the extent of harm caused by
exposure to these compounds in concentrations that are common in
the environment is debated.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the panel seemed to take pains to refer to the
compounds not as endocrine disrupters but rather as ``hormonally
active agents.'' The experts said much more research was needed
before the dangers of day-to-day exposures to the contaminants can
be ascertained but added that scientists did not agree on what
exposure levels should be studied or even how to screen for the
compounds and their possible influences in people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This field is rife with uncertainty,'' said Dr. Ernst Knobil,
who was chairman of the panel. Knobil, a professor in the medical
school at the University of Texas-Houston Health Science Center,
added, ``It's an exceedingly complex environmental issue and there
are no easy answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about endocrine disrupters have been growing for nearly
a decade based on a series of observations and deductions. Certain
pesticides, like DDT and PCBs and chemicals in plastics, mimic the
hormone estrogen. Wildlife that had been exposed to the chemicals
in high concentrations were harmed. And women whose mothers had
taken high doses of the synthetic estrogen diethylstilbesterol when
they were pregnant _ in the hope of preventing miscarriages _
developed vaginal cancers.
</P>
<P>
   The fear was that as use of these chemicals rose, humans were
being harmed in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's report was requested four years ago by Congress, the
Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Congress has directed the EPA to screen compounds for hormonal
effects, and Tuesday the agency praised the council's report,
especially its endorsement of screening and its call for additional
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important report,'' said J. Charles Fox, an
assistant administrator at the EPA. ``It is very consistent with
the research agenda we have developed and in fact the report
endorses many of the recommendations that we have developed to deal
with the potential threat to health and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The report elicited mixed reactions from scientists, ranging
from praise by those who were concerned about the compounds to
withering criticism from skeptics of the endocrine disrupter
hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed and I'm pleased,'' said Dr. Theo Colborn, a senior
program scientist at the World Wildlife Fund and whose book, ``Our
Endangered Future,'' helped make ``endocrine disrupters'' a
national issue. She said she was delighted that the expert panel
did not dismiss suspicions about endocrine disrupters and that it
agreed with her that at high doses, the chemicals can injure people
and animals. With the evidence at hand, she said, it is wise to
follow the precautionary principle: limit exposure as much as
possible while research continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a growing field,'' Dr. Colborn said. ``Just because we
don't have the evidence does not mean there are no effects.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Dr. Elizabeth Whelan, president of the American
Council on Science and Health, said she was dismayed by the report.
The endocrine disrupter hypothesis, she said, ``has never been
grounded in any reality.'' It is easy to call for more research in
the absence of evidence of danger, she said. But, she added, that
does not help people who need to know if they should, or should
not, be worried about the food they eat, the water they drink, the
air they breathe, and the plastics they use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am now convinced that one of the major problems is that
scientists are unwilling to use the four-letter word, `safe.''' Dr.
Whelan said. The council is mostly financed by foundations but also
receives some of its money from industry groups.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members emphasized that they were a diverse group, and
said they had struggled to write a report that all could endorse.
``It is signed off by the most ardent advocates as well as the most
ardent objectors,'' of the endocrine-disrupter hypothesis, Knobil
said.
</P>
<P>
   In chapter after chapter, the report examines suspicions about
the chemicals, and evidence for the suspicions. In the process, it
raises questions about virtually every aspect of the field,
starting with the description of the chemicals themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Knobil explained that even when high doses of the chemicals
elicited adverse health effects, it was never clear that the
effects were due to endocrine hormone disruptions. DDT, for example
thinned the eggshells of birds. ``What is the endocrinologic basis
of eggshell thinning?'' Dr. Knobil asked. ``No one has come up with
one yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know the mechanism, you can't ascribe the effect
to endocrine disruption,'' Knobil said. The group decided to call
the chemicals ``hormonally active agents,'' instead. They defined
such chemicals as any that had hormonal effects in a laboratory
test.
</P>
<P>
   A problem that plagued the group was how to deal with questions
of exposure level. In general, the chemicals are present in the
environment in minuscule quantities whereas the known effects
occurred at high concentrations. Moreover, the human body is
virtually awash in a sea of naturally occurring hormonally active
agents that are present in much greater amounts than the chemicals
in question. These range from hormones made by the body, like
estrogen and testosterone, to hormones in pills, like birth control
pills, to hormone-like substances in plants that people eat.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that chemicals like pesticides and chemicals in
plastics interact with these much more abundant hormones in the
body, but no one can say for sure, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some quantitative assessments of these interactions,''
Knobil said, ``and then we need to come to informed and intelligent
conclusions about what the risks are.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties in getting a handle on the risks posed by the
chemicals extended from epidemiology to basic biochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   The chapter of the report on ``Screening and Monitoring'' began:
``There are no generally accepted, validated methods to screen for
or monitor exposure to chemicals that could cause adverse hormonal
activity _ largely because of the complexity of the endocrine
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The chapter on ``Neurological Effects'' states in its
introduction that some scientists proposed that the chemicals act
on fetuses and cause neurological damage. But, the group wrote:
``In humans, particularly, a number of difficulties are associated
with the investigation'' of neurological effects, ``including the
recognition that such effects may be quite subtle, and the possibly
long delay between exposure and outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most often cited concerns about the chemicals is that
they are causing epidemics of breast cancer and male reproductive
system problems, including hypospadia, in which the urethra opens
at the bottom rather than the top of the penis, undescended testes,
and lowered sperm counts.
</P>
<P>
   The panel wrote that studies to date did not support an
association between exposure to the chemicals and breast cancer in
women or hypospadia, or undescended testes in men. The sperm data,
the group concluded, were ``controversial.'' The panel members
wrote in that they had not agreed among themselves about whether
sperm counts really were declining.
</P>
<P>
   If the public really does want to get definitive answers to the
questions of whether endocrine disrupters are a major public health
threat, the studies that would be necessary could last for decades
and require huge investments from the federal government. Is it the
best way to spend resources?
</P>
<P>
   That is not a question for his group, Knobil said. That, he
said, ``is a matter for policy-makers to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   The report can be obtained from the Academy at
www.nationalacademies.org. Printed copies of the report may be
obtained from the National Academy Press, 2101 Constitution Ave.
NW, Washington, 20418.

 Don Pipes belongs in a hall of fame for city managers  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Don Pipes worked in the private sector, he'd be a cinch for
induction into any business hall of fame you'd care to mention.
</P>
<P>
   When news of his plans to retire next month appeared on the
front page Friday, however, it seemed safe to say relatively few
readers outside Johnson County were familiar with either his name
or his game. If so, this probably suited Pipes just fine. During
his generation-long stint as Overland Park's city manager, he's
never sought the limelight. Nor has he gotten much of it.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly nine years since The Kansas City Star implemented
its computerized library, there have been 47,826 mentions of
Overland Park. In all of those stories about his city, Pipes' name
has appeared only 208 times. That is a remarkable lack of public
exposure, considering Pipes' role as primary steward of Overland
Park's explosive growth as both a city and a local economic force.
</P>
<P>
   He's not leaving his job as Overland Park's city manager
unheralded, though. This is the third staff column in the past
three days paying tribute to his service. Media effusions of this
magnitude usually are reserved for someone whose career has made
him a household name.
</P>
<P>
   If Pipes had been running a publicly held company instead of a
city, he'd probably have become one of Wall Street's darlings long
ago. During his tenure at the operational helm, Pipes has seen his
city's population more than triple, while his budget has soared
nearly 15,000 percent. That's plenty enough to have made Overland
Park a leading growth stock if it were traded on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pipes has taken a singular pride in the fiscal
fitness reflected by the city's triple-A bond rating. Only a
handful of U.S. cities carry this gold-plated credit cachet, which,
in the public realm, does make Overland Park something of a Wall
Street darling.
</P>
<P>
   Pipes' monument is a city that works better than most. Some may
downplay Overland Park's reputation for excellence because it
doesn't have to deal with the urban challenges that confront older
cities. Examples would include providing medical facilities,
operating extensive public transit systems and maintaining costly
social service operations to meet the needs of the poor,
disadvantaged and elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The implication of such analysis is that absent such challenges,
managing an urban government that runs as responsively as Overland
Park's is something of a no-brainer. Just because the challenges
have been different, however, doesn't mean they've been less
difficult. Overland Park's most remarkable success has been
managing growth so as to avoid the crushing tax burden and
deteriorating service capability that often come with huge
population growth.
</P>
<P>
   During Pipes' tenure, Overland Park has managed this mostly by
making itself a mecca for shoppers. Ever-growing sales tax revenue
from residents and nonresidents help finance rising operating costs
while tamping the need for tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   Pipes has never gotten the credit and recognition he deserves
for a couple of reasons: his self-effacing manner and his low-key
management style. So, before he officially departs, let the record
show that Pipes should be considered hall-of-fame material wherever
city administrators gather.

SENATE REPUBLICANS WIN UPPER HAND IN FARM AID BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Locked in what one senator called a compassion
competition, Republicans and Democrats struggled Tuesday over
sending billions of dollars of emergency aid to American farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats littered the rhetorical landscape of the Senate with
images of dust bowl days and the great Depression, but they lost an
attempt to add a $10.8 billion package of emergency aid to the
annual agriculture spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tossed that proposal aside in favor of their own $7
billion emergency package, which they would finance by dipping into
next year's projected budget surplus. They showed through
procedural maneuvers late Tuesday that they had the votes to pass
it, probably on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're competing to show our compassion,'' said Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas. ``It's a political bidding contest here. You're
seeing figures made up on both sides of the aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore came to the Capitol to argue the
Democrats' case for more aid, saying conditions were ripe for ``the
worst crisis our farmers have ever experienced,'' and that
Republicans were ``pretending that this tremendous suffering out in
farm country is not taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said ``a
silent death in rural America'' was killing off farms and
destroying farmers' livelihoods. He said that 2,000 farmers in his
state had given up tilling the soil in the past year and that their
farms now lay fallow, creating scenes ``the likes of which we have
not seen since the great Depression.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gramm questioned just how grim the plight of American
farmers is today. He said the Senate was proposing ``spending vast
sums of money when we have no documentation of the magnitude of the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of evidence that farmers are hurting.
International markets for their goods have shrunk, particularly in
Asia, and prices for everything from corn to hogs have plummeted
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But pain and politics have little to do with heat and drought,
despite the designation of both parties' aid packages as
``emergency'' assistance, which allows them to toss aside the
spending rules and take the money out of next year's
much-anticipated budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   There is an argument over how deep the suffering is. Net farm
income will fall less than 1 percent this year, from $44.1 billion
in 1998 to $43.8 billion after this fall's harvest, the Agriculture
Department estimates. That includes more than $12 billion of direct
federal payments to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the economic pain may be self-inflicted. Despite the
drought in many parts of the country, American farmers are growing
far more grain than they can sell, which helps drive prices down.
Nearly a billion bushels of wheat, half the American harvest, will
find no market this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were having a hard time giving it away,'' said Tom Buis, a
vice president of the National Farmers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a brief speech just off the Senate floor, fueled a
competition between the political parties to see who could appear
more generous to farmers _ some of whom work the soil of Iowa, the
scene of the first presidential caucuses next winter _ as he chided
Senate Republicans for their farm policies and fiscal programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have the biggest surpluses in the history of the
world,'' he said, ``and that bunch in control in there is trying to
blow it all on a risky tax scheme while the whole farm sector of
our economy is on the verge of absolute bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   The sponsor of the Republican aid package, Sen. Thad Cochran of
Mississippi, agreed in an interview that ``overproduction, not just
here but all over the world'' is part of what is plaguing American
farmers. Nonetheless, he said, the need for aid exists.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $7 billion in the Cochran bill, $5.6 billion would come
in the form of direct payments to farmers under the system
Republicans created in 1996 to replace the farm-subsidy system long
controlled by Democrats. Much of the rest would come in subsidies
aimed at livestock and dairy farmers, soybean and oilseed producers
and growers of peanuts and beet sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran suggested that the need was not as urgent as the
Democrats argued, and that the aid could wait until the next fiscal
year begins on Oct. 1. ``We're not going to know exactly how much
some farmers lost until after the harvest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And farmers are still spending some of the $6 billion that
Congress lashed together as part of a last-minute $21 billion
emergency spending bill in October.
</P>
<P>
   If the emergency package wins the Senate's approval, the House
would have to consider similar legislation. ``I would be very
supportive of it,'' said Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, chairman of
the House Agriculture Committee. ``Seven billion dollars _ you
can't sneeze at that.''

OFF-BEAT MIXTURE OF CLUELESS GIRLS, `DICK' WATERGATE FARCE WORKS
WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title character of ``Dick'' is not the anatomical part one
might expect in Hollywood's summer of bad-taste humor. It's about
President Richard M. Nixon, and the movie is a highly original,
often hilarious, what-if farce about Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Its heroines are Betsy (Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene (Michelle
Williams) _ two incredibly ditzy, 15-year-old girls who stumble
upon (since Betsy lives in the Watergate Apartments), and
inadvertently blow the whistle on, the famous burglary on June 2,
1972.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, while their class is touring the White House, they
recognize G. Gordon Liddy (Harry Shearer) from the night before,
and soon find themselves being interrogated by Nixon himself (Dan
Hedaya), who, unsure what they know, makes them the official
presidential dog-walkers.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie has these pre-Valley Girl innocents
stumbling into one Watergate situation after another without having
any idea what is really going on, uncovering enemies lists,
conspiring with Woodward and Bernstein, fiddling with the
presidential tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity for the film calls it ``Clueless'' meets ``All the
President's Men,'' which, for once, is pretty accurate. And in the
hands of director Andrew Fleming (``The Craft''), the off-beat
mixture works _ though its comic nuances definitely demand a
knowledge of Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it's an extended Second City or ``Saturday Night
Live''-style political skit _ Woodward (Will Ferrell) and Bernstein
(Bruce McCulloch) are complete buffoons, and the President's Men
are mostly goofy caricatures played by well-known sketch and
stand-up comics.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Hedaya gives a real performance. It's a complete
burlesque, of course, but he actually looks like Nixon, and as
exaggerated and absurdist as his portrayal is, it feels curiously
more authentic than most movie recreations, including the
celebrated Anthony Hopkins version.
</P>
<P>
   Even more priceless are Williams and Dunst as the pair of
unknowing subversives _ particularly Dunst, who keeps stealing
movie after movie (``Wag the Dog,'' last month's ``Drop Dead
Gorgeous''). Here, she gives such a sustained and charming
performance of both endearing innocence and soaring shallowness
that it's a small masterpiece of comedy acting.
</P>
<P>
   Dick. Directed by Andrew Fleming. Written by Fleming &AMP; Sheryl
Longin. Cast: Kirsten Dunst, Michelle Williams, Dave Foley, Teri
Garr, Dan Hedaya, Saul Rubinek. Columbia. 90 minutes. Rated PG-13

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a level at which there are few second chances in
the U.S. military, Gen. Joseph Ralston has been not only redeemed
but resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   When an affair 13 years in the past blocked his promotion to the
country's top military job two summers ago, the general never
complained, associates say, and if he looked back at all, certainly
never let anyone catch him at it. Instead, he made his new boss
look good and kept putting his hand up for sensitive assignments.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States made the mistake of bombing the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade last May, it was Ralston who accompanied
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on a midnight visit to the
ambassador's residence here. When Washington planned to attack a
pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in retaliation for the terrorist
bombings of two American embassies in Africa, again it was Ralston
who flew to Pakistan to deliver the explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1997, he withdrew his name from consideration as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff a week after the Air Force
was intensely criticized for forcing a female pilot to leave the
service for lying about an illicit relationship. While his friends
were all saying how sorry they were to see a brilliant career
short-circuited by scandal, he stayed on for a second term as vice
chairman, working 18 hour days. He spoke for the Pentagon at high
level policy meetings, directed the purchase of new weapons systems
and equipment, coordinated with military commanders around the
world. And he went out of his way to make his boss, Gen. Henry
Shelton, the new chairman, look good.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will literally go the extra mile to shore up a relationship
even when it meant going half-way around the world to New
Zealand,'' said Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his constancy in a changed environment has been rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Two wars, two years and a major funding infusion later, Ralston
is again considered a crucial member of the inner circle on
national security policy. Last week, he was named as the Pentagon's
choice to replace Gen. Wesley Clark as supreme commander of NATO
forces in Europe. And some at the Pentagon and in Congress even say
he may be back on track for the chairman's job.
</P>
<P>
   When his name was first raised as the Pentagon's choice for
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the case of 1st Lt. Kelly
Flinn, the first female pilot of a B-52 bomber, had particularly
outraged a number of women in Congress: How come he gets the
ultimate promotion after his affair, they asked, and she gets to
explore new career opportunities?
</P>
<P>
   The general withdrew his name, friends said, and never gave
himself time to reflect. ``He didn't miss a beat,'' said a senior
administration official who works with him almost daily. ``When I
tried to express sympathy for him and his situation, which had to
have been infuriating, he'd basically say, ``It's no big deal,
let's get on with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, of course, the Flinn case has faded from view. The
commander-in-chief, President Clinton, has himself survived a sex
scandal that divided and then wearied the country, causing several
members of Congress to suggest that, post-impeachment, they feel
more than two years older than they did back when Lt. Flinn was
Topic A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the environment has settled down a bit and I think it
has,'' said Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the
Armed Services Committee. ``We're able to look more objectively at
the whole person, the context and the texture of events rather than
drawing these complicated human events with broad brush strokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralston's affair, with a civilian employee of the the CIA,
apparently began during a separation from his wife, though in 1988
divorce papers his wife said the relationship had continued after
the couple reconciled and eventually caused their breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that there was a consensual affair when he was
separated from his wife should not disqualify him from even serving
as chairman of the Joint Chiefs,'' Levin said. Asked if that seemed
likely, he answered, ``He's surely qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family now say that no one was more surprised by the
choice assignment _ and the latest extension of his 34-year career
_ than Ralston himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had already bought a house in Alaska'' where he expected to
retire on March 1 of next year, said his daughter, Paige Ralston,
deputy press secretary to Rep. J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the
speaker of the House. ``My stepmother had already bought the
furniture and picked out the curtains.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is ready to do what the secretary and the president want
him to do,'' said his father-in-law, retired Gen. Russell
Dougherty, a former commander of the Strategic Air Command, whose
daughter is Ralston's second wife. ``You don't get excited about
these things. You do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   He still has critics, especially among loyalists to Clark. Some
of them suggested that the current NATO commander, who sometimes
disagreed with his superiors but won NATO's air war against
Yugoslavia, is being replaced with a go-along, get-along type.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the military wing of the old boys' network had simply
been waiting for things to calm down so they could restore
Ralston's standing without much of a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's the greatest guy since Patton, but we ought to at
least acknowledge that they're still winking at this and continuing
a double standard,'' said Tod Ensign, director of Citizen Soldier,
a military watchdog group in New York. ``In this post-impeachment
environment,'' he said, Defense Secretary William Cohen and Shelton
``probably feel now, `What can the White House say? Who's going to
really complain?'''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Font, a Boston lawyer with a number of clients in the
military, said that just last May, a low-ranking male client of his
had been sent to Leavenworth and served four months in prison for a
consensual affair with a civilian.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little question that the heat has gone out of the
debate now; Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, promised to ``work diligently to get his nomination
through.'' And Ralston's congressional allies expect an easy
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who complained about a double
standard when Ralston's promotion was announced two years ago,
said, ``I'd like to see Kelly Flinn have a comeback,'' but added
that she did not plan to make an issue of his past affair at this
point. Like many of the core group of women in Congress who
supported Lt. Flinn, Ms. Maloney also was a strong defender of
Clinton during the impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, who runs the Center for
Defense Information, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, said:
``I would like to believe this is at least a slight easing in the
harsh line the Pentagon has always taken.'' Bumpers spoke on
Clinton's behalf on the Senate floor during the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   But the general's fans at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and at
the White House said his improved standing also has everything to
do with his own performance. Ralston, 55, could not have known he
would get another shot at the top job when he just kept showing up
for work at 5:30 every morning after withdrawing his name from
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ralston grew up outside Louisville, the youngest of four
children born to a tobacco farmer and an X-ray technician. ``He
came from a poor family in Kentucky and it was all up to him,''
said Ms. Ralston, his daughter. But somehow, he never considered
himself poor, or no worse off than most other folks he knew, and
the family eventually sent three children to college.
</P>
<P>
   Miami University of Ohio was an intimidating place for him in
the fall of 1961, and he has often told the story of the kind
stranger in a military uniform who helped him figure out his class
schedule on one of his first days on campus. The man pointed out
that he had Tuesday and Thursday afternoons free for Air Force
ROTC, so he signed up, and began his military career. (He also met
his second wife, Dede, through ROTC. He knew her on campus, where
she was involved in the women's program then known as ``Angel
Flights,'' and they reconnected after his divorce.)
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1965, he became a fighter pilot, flying 147
combat missions, most of them over North Vietnam. At one point in
the summer of 1968, when the Air Force was losing planes at a
particularly alarming rate, he flew five combat missions over Hanoi
in three days.
</P>
<P>
   When he came home, he seemed most interested in repairing the
mistakes made in Vietnam and helping the military become more
combat ready, first as a squadron commander, then a wing commander,
and then head of the Alaskan Command. Finally, in 1995, he was
named the top fighter pilot commander in the Air Force, becoming
the head of the Air Combat Command at Langley Air Force Base in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   During his first term as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, his
boss, Gen. John Shalikashvili, recommended him as the next
chairman. ``He's just a remarkable individual for the knowledge and
the judgment he brings to the job,'' Shalikashvili said.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, when Cohen and Shelton sat down to figure
out how to replace half a dozen senior military officers whose
terms were up next summer, they again thought of Ralston and
quickly realized he was the man they wanted to succeed Clark.
</P>
<P>
   They got the enthusiastic support of the White House. And they
felt so strongly about Ralston, in fact, that they advanced the
retirement of Clark by two months to make sure Ralston would be his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   (Under law, Ralston has to assume another command within 60 days
after his term as vice chairman ends at the end of February, or
face automatic retirement.)
</P>
<P>
   Even now, those close to him seem afraid to drop the slightest
hint that he might feel vindicated. ``He doesn't have the job
yet,'' said Ms. Ralston, his daughter. ``It's still early.''

STOCKS MIXED AMID CONCERN OVER VALUATIONS; INTERNET ISSUES TUMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were mixed Tuesday, but traders said
that investors remained extremely skittish about high valuations
and the future direction of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are very nervous right now, and rightly so,'' said
Bill Allyn, head of listed trading at Jeffries &AMP; Co. ``We have been
talking about valuations for months, and now it is finally hitting
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks, the epicenter of speculative activity for much
of the year, took another hard hit Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com's Internet index fell 20.96, or 3.9 percent, to
519.07, pulled down by stocks like America Online, Yahoo and CMGI.
The index has fallen nearly 35 percent since it peaked April 12.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rate worries pulled down the NASDAQ composite index,
which fell for the fourth straight session. Big declines in Unum
Provident, the insurance company, and Charles Schwab, the big
discount brokerage house, dragged down the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-index, and small stocks slumped. But the Dow Jones industrial
average managed to move up, largely on strength in Hewlett-Packard
and Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just an isolated day,'' said Bob Gasser, head of
U.S. equity trading at J.P. Morgan Securities. ``It is a lot
tougher for the market to deal with rising interest rates than with
good corporate earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasser and other analysts said the market was likely to remain
in a highly unsettled state until at least Friday, when July
employment data are scheduled to be released.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board, which meets Aug. 24 to debate whether
it should raise short-term interest rates, are likely to pay close
attention to that report.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday's close, the Dow Jones industrial average had risen
31.35, or 0.3 percent, to 10,677.31. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index closed at 1322.18, down 5.87, or 0.4 percent. The NASDAQ
composite lost 35.66, or 1.4 percent, to 2587.97. And the Russell
2000 index of small-company stocks fell 6.35, or 1.4 percent, to
436.28.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of business quickened a bit from Monday but still
remained fairly subdued. Trading volume on the New York Stock
Exchange was 734.9 million shares. On the NASDAQ market, just over
1 billion shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Tuesday's activity was focused on Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day a number of Internet shares rallied on reports
that Yahoo was in negotiations to buy Excite(AT)Home. But those
rumors were quashed by Excite president George Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, which dipped lower on the initial reports, fell further
later. The stock closed at 125 3/8, down 6 15/16. The stock has
lost nearly half its market value since early April.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of Internet brokerage firms, which have also been beaten
up recently, were battered again Tuesday after Bill Burnham, an
Internet analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, issued a report
saying the companies might see their first-ever decline in trading
volume in the third quarter because of weakness in the Internet
stocks their companies favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see growth in negative territory is significant, but not
earth-shattering,'' Burnham said. ``I was surprised the stocks sold
off as much as they did'' after the report was released.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, the largest online brokerage firm, fell 4 11/16 Tuesday,
to 37 1/2. Etrade fell 4 5/16, to 24 11/16; Knight/Trimark Group
lost 4 7/32, to 37 1/2, And Ameritrade Holding dropped 2 3/4, to 21
1/4.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, the world's largest Internet service, continued
its slump, with the stock falling for the fourth straight session,
shedding 4 1/16, to 88 13/16. Since April 6, when it peaked at 175
1/2, the stock has fallen nearly 50 percent. And CMGI, the Internet
venture capital company, fell 6 7/16 Tuesday, to 81 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news from this summer's selling of Internet shares is
that the bears will be hard-pressed to still call this a bubble
market,'' said Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson
Lufkin Jenrette. ``At this point, the easy money appears to have
been made in Internet stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on these stocks extended to new issues.
</P>
<P>
   Four new Internet offerings were priced Tuesday:
1-800-Flowers.com, Quotesmith.com, BigStar Entertainment and
Splitrock Services Inc. All closed below their initial offered
price.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Unum Provident fell 15 5/16, or 30 percent, to 36
3/8, after the company, one of the nation's largest disability
insurers, said that second-quarter earnings fell because of costs
associated with the June merger that created it.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm was the biggest loser on the NASDAQ, falling 12 1/2 to
140. The stock slid after Motorola said it will make semiconductors
for phones to compete with Qualcomm.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow stocks, Johnson &AMP; Johnson gained 2 1/4, to 94 9/16
after an analyst at J.P. Morgan upgraded his recommendation on the
stock to ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble gained 3 9/16, to 93 11/16. And Hewlett-Packard
rose 3 3/4, to 108 1/2.

HOUSE RENEWS ECONOMIC TIES WITH VIETNAM FOR ANOTHER YEAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Texas)   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Tuesday renewed limited economic ties
with Vietnam for another year, a week after Washington and Hanoi
reached a tentative trade accord that brings Vietnam a step closer
to full trading privileges with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 297-130 to endorse President Clinton's waiver of a
1974 law, and allows American companies doing business with Vietnam
to receive limited government benefits like loans and guarantees
from the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is not eligible for broader trade privileges, such as
lower taxes on Vietnamese goods shipped to the United States, until
Congress approves a bilateral trade pact. After three years of
negotiations, the two countries reached an agreement in principle
last week that could be presented to lawmakers later this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Trade between the two countries is relatively small. Vietnam
ships about $650-million worth of goods to the United States each
year; American companies send about $350 million in products to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's outcome was widely expected, and was viewed by
supporters as a stepping stone in the path of improved relations
between the United States and its erstwhile enemy. Clinton capped
these efforts by lifting the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam in 1994
and establishing diplomatic relations with Hanoi in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators drew on many of the same arguments they wielded last
week when the House renewed full trading privileges with China.
That vote was 260 to 170.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of broadening commercial ties with Vietnam, and
granting the waiver Tuesday, argued that engaging Vietnam gives
Washington more leverage on nettlesome issues like improving human
rights and resolving the remaining cases of missing American
servicemen in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans must realize conclusively that the war with Vietnam
is over,'' said Rep. Douglas Bereuter, R-Neb. ``Emotional scars
remain with many Americans. But it's time to get on with our
bilateral relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics contended that Vietnam has not cooperated fully in
accounting for GI's missing in action, persecutes its citizens for
their religious beliefs and hampers the emigration of opponents of
the communist government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average citizen in Vietnam must still pay $1,000 in bribes
_ three times an annual salary _ for access to U.S. immigration
programs,'' said Rep. Loretta Sanchez, a Democrat whose district in
Orange County California has one of the largest concentrations of
Vietnamese people in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's debate paled in contrast to last week's fight over
trade benefits with China, but it still evoked powerful emotions
from many veterans. Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, who served seven
years in a Vietnamese prison after his Air Force jet was shot down,
urged rejection of the waiver.
</P>
<P>
   But many supporters said they relied on the advice of Douglas
(Pete) Peterson, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam and a former
Democratic congressman from Florida. Peterson, a former fighter
pilot who spent six years in a Hanoi prison, flew to Washington
this week to vigorously lobby his former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers voted on a waiver to the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to
the 1974 Trade Act, which requires annual renewal of trading rights
for countries that restrict emigration.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's vote gives momentum to the accord the United States
and Vietnam initialed last week. Vietnam began adopting more
free-market practices in the mid-1980s, but has been hit hard by
the Asian financial crisis.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With foreign investment and exports plummeting, Hanoi is eager
to take advantage of the trade boon that the recent agreement
offers. Lawmakers said Tuesday that the pact would lower tariffs to
American goods, protect intellectual property rights and ease
restrictions on American companies access to telecommunications
markets.

CLINTON LISTENS TO SUCCESS STORIES TOLD BY FORMER WELFARE
RECIPIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ President Clinton listened on Tuesday to more than a
dozen former welfare recipients recount their life-changing
experiences working for companies ranging from a CVS drugstore to
the Bank of America. And he heard their employers praise them as
highly reliable workers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton joined the workers in celebrating a continued decline in
the nation's welfare rolls and their transition to new-found
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were exhilarated by the stories that these people told,''
Clinton said after hearing from the former welfare recipients and
their employers for 90 minutes. ``We were gratified by the
enlightened self-interest of the employers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came here to address a forum of the Welfare to Work
Partnership, a private group formed by hundreds of companies
committed to hiring welfare recipients. And he sounded a note of
vindication as he reported: ``The welfare rolls have been cut in
half. They're at their lowest level in 32 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The president reversed a half-century of social welfare policy
on Aug. 22, 1996, when he signed a landmark welfare bill,
eliminating the federal guarantee of cash assistance for the
nation's poorest children. Liberal Democrats predicted disaster,
saying that thousands of children would be sleeping on grates in
Chicago and other big cities.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton said on Tuesday, many of the people who left
welfare have jobs _ not dead-end jobs, but positions with health
insurance and opportunities to win promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people on welfare fell from 14.1 million in
January 1993, when Clinton took office, to 12.2 million in August
1996, and then to 7.3 million in March of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's event was a cross between a revival meeting, a
television talk show and a political rally, and Clinton, normally
so voluble, listened intently as welfare recipients told inspiring
stories of the financial rewards and psychological satisfactions
they had found in work.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said the job was not done. He urged Congress to pour
billions of additional dollars into child care, housing,
transportation and other programs to help poor people get and keep
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Congress shows little inclination to grant the request. Indeed,
some House Republicans want to take back some of the $4 billion in
federal welfare money that the states have received but not yet
spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a big mistake,'' Clinton said, asserting, ``In
every state, there are still people who could move from welfare to
work if they had more training, if they had transportation, if they
had child care.''
</P>
<P>
   The former welfare recipients who spoke on Tuesday work for
Xerox, the United Parcel Service, CVS drugstores, the Bank of
America and several small businesses. The employers all said the
welfare recipients had made excellent employees.
</P>
<P>
   One woman told Clinton that she took a bus, a subway and another
bus to get to work each day at a UPS package-handling center in
Philadelphia. Another said she had been hired as a cashier and
received several promotions at a retail clothing store in Boston.
Another woman told the president that she had succeeded in her job
with the Bank of America in Texas because she had received many
forms of assistance, including child care, from the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Edmond English, a senior executive of TJX Cos., the parent
company of the retailers TJMaxx and Marshalls, said that his stores
had a 90 percent retention rate for welfare recipients they hired,
and that 20 percent of those people had been promoted.
</P>
<P>
   An executive of CVS said the drugstore chain had hired 4,000
welfare recipients in the last three years and that the retention
rate for them was 70 percent, which he called ``way off the
charts.''
</P>
<P>
   But the employers acknowledged that people still on welfare
might be more difficult to employ because they had fewer skills,
less work experience and more problems, like drug abuse or mental
impairments, than the people already hired.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there was one ``piece of troubling news in this
whole happy scenario'': a surprisingly large drop in the number of
low-income people receiving food stamps and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think clearly what has happened is, a lot of people moved
from welfare to work, they're delighted to be at work, and they
literally don't know that they're still eligible for this
assistance,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In a telling comment, Clinton seemed to minimize the bruising
battles within his administration and within the Democratic Party
over the welfare bill that he signed three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he said on Tuesday, ``a big bipartisan majority, big
majorities of both parties and both houses, reached across the
divide to pass this welfare reform bill.'' In fact, on the final
vote, House Democrats were evenly divided, 98 to 98, and in the
Senate, 21 of the 46 Democrats opposed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton glossed over that history on Tuesday as he paid tribute
to the people who, he said, had ``the courage to stand up and say,
`I'm going to change my life''' by moving from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, at another event, the president announced that
the government would provide $55 million to help low-income people
in nine states, mostly in the Middle West, to pay their electricity
bills or buy cooling equipment.

PEDIATRICIANS WARN OF EFFECTS OF TV ON CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH

<TEXT>
<P>
   Children under 2 years old should not watch television, older
children should not have television sets in their bedrooms, and
pediatricians should have parents fill out a ``media history,''
along with a medical history, on office visits, according to
recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that television viewing can affect the mental, social and
physical health of young people, the academy for the first time has
laid out a plan for how pediatricians and parents can deal with
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``As pediatricians, we are taking all the research concerns into
account, and trying to raise the bar a bit, as suggestions for
optimal parenting,'' said Dr. Marjorie Hogan, the lead author of
the report, which appears in the August issue of Pediatrics
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   No reliable research has been done on how television viewing
affects children younger than 2, Dr. Hogan said. But the Academy
based its recommendations for such children on knowledge of what
babies need for proper brain development _ notably close-up
interaction with older people _ and the common-sense notion that,
if they are watching television, babies are not getting those other
essential stimuli.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in movies and television has been linked to violent
behavior in young people in studies by the American Medical
Association, the American Psychological Association, the American
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the National
Institute of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   So while the academy may appear to be venturing into
sociological territory with little direct connection to medical
health issues, the study's authors say the influence of mass media
is a major public health concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, media violence,'' said Dr. Miriam Baron,
chairwoman of the academy's committee on public education, which
wrote the policy. ``A bullet in the body is a physical health
issue. Children who spend a lot of time in front of the TV set tend
to gain weight; obesity is a physical health issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Academy is distributing to its members a sample ``media
history'' checklist for their young patients. It includes questions
about movies, video and computer games, music videos and the
Internet, as well as about the radio and books.
</P>
<P>
   Also available to the 55,000 members are brochures explaining
the positive and negative influences that media can have on
children, with suggestions about how to guide families toward
positive uses, including critical discussion on what they watch. To
encourage such talk, the Academy suggests that televisions and
computers not be kept in children's bedrooms but in common rooms,
where parents can monitor and participate in children's use of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The policy's main purpose, the authors said, is to encourage
pediatricians and their patients to learn about and discuss the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents interviewed Tuesday agreed that television's
influence was a proper concern for pediatricians, but that it was
unrealistic to set arbitrary limits, and unnecessary for doctors to
intervene unless a child already had social or emotional problems
that might be related to media exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the theory, but practically I think it's not very
doable,'' said Lari Mills of Nashville, Tenn., who has an
8-month-old baby as well as a 7-year-old and a 9-year-old. ``The
little one is often around the TV when the older ones are watching,
but he's not really watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Valerie Barney said her 2-year-old son watches
``Barney'' and ``The Teletubbies'' on PBS, and she sees no harm in
it as long as an adult is watching with him. ``He interacts very
well with the TV,'' she said. ``He sees someone fall down, he falls
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Teletubbies,'' a British import on PBS featuring a group of
cooing, brightly-colored creatures who babble baby talk, is the
only show on American television specifically made for children
under the age of 3. It was developed by an educational television
producer and a speech pathologist; nonetheless, many pediatricians
see little merit in it for very young viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't put it on in order to attract a younger and younger
audience,'' said John Wilson, senior vice president for programming
for PBS. ``But we know from research that there is an audience of
children under 2 watching television, for better or for worse, and
at least we have something on the air that is developmentally
appropriate for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Himself the parent of a 4 1/2-year-old son and a 9-month-old
daughter, Wilson said many families where both parents work might
be helped by ``taking this information to whoever is watching their
child during the day, and letting them know they should find
something else to do besides watch TV.``
</P>
<P>
   Brown Johnson, senior vice president for Nick Jr., the preschool
programming segments of the children's network Nickelodeon, said
she favored any policy that encouraged parents to spend time with
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television or videos will be used in some form, to give
parents a break to make dinner or whatever, so I'm not sure it's
realistic to say no television ever,'' she said. ``But if the AAP
has to make this kind of a declaration to have people really sit up
and listen, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy spent more than two years developing the latest
policy statement, which was approved by its board of directors in
May, but it has been involved in research and communications about
media influences on children for much longer. In 1990, it issued a
recommendation that older children not watch more than one to two
hours of ``quality'' television per day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1997, it began a ``Media Matters'' campaign to educate
pediatricians and the public about how media can influence
children, positively as well as negatively. For example, studies
have show that programs about the effects of substance abuse or
tobacco can influence adolescent behavior for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is clear that media use can have an effect on
children's overall health _ physical, mental, emotional,'' said
Vicky Rideout of the Kaiser Family Foundation in Menlo Park,
Calif., which has done studies on these subjects. ``To my knowledge
this is the first time such a clear blueprint has been laid out for
a pro-active role on the part of individual doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs, a nonprofit research group in Washington, D.C., agreed
that the delineating of specific recommendations for pediatricians
to give parents was a new step for the pediatric group, despite its
decade-old interest in the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a drive by health professionals to view
certain social problems as public health problems,'' he said,
noting also the Centers for Disease Control's recent efforts to
treat gun use as a public health issue.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It does make me a little nervous, people with
scientific credentials getting involved in social science issues,
but there is a lot of very good social science that watching TV
does have some potential to cause harm to kids, and people need to
realize what harm it might be doing to their child. It's not a bad
thing for health professionals to remind parents that they need to
be aware of the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're worried about what your kid eats, you should worry
about what your kid's watching.''

 &HT;    Armed patient shot in Atlanta hospital
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and David Pendered
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As four victims of last week's shooting massacre lay
in their beds Tuesday morning at Grady Memorial Hospital, a
security guard shot an armed man during a confrontation in a lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The guard, a retired Atlanta police officer, shot Kenneth Gay,
46, of Atlanta three times in the stomach. Gay died at 2:15 p.m.
after several hours on the operating table, police said. Just
before 10 a.m., Gay refused to walk through metal detectors leading
to the psychiatric ward on the hospital's 13th floor. Gay's mother,
Beulah Harrison, had insisted he be evaluated by a psychiatrist
after several emotional outbursts and ramblings that police were
out to ``get him,'' said Gay's nephew Kornelius Ringfield.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Gay pulled a pistol out of the duffel bag he was
carrying and headed downstairs in an elevator. Hospital employees
called security, and the guard, whom police and Grady officials
would not identify, met Gay outside the pharmacy on the hospital's
ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   Gay pulled his 9 mm handgun from his bag and pointed it at the
security guard, who was dressed in his Atlanta police uniform,
police said. The gun was unloaded, police said later.
</P>
<P>
   Gay's sister, Bonita Senior, was standing near her brother in
the lobby when she saw him reach for his bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he went for his bag, I ran for my life,'' Senior said.
``I knew what he was going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   While several pharmacy customers dove for cover, some shielding
elderly customers with their bodies, hospital chaplains raced
upstairs to make sure victims of Mark O. Barton's rampage last week
were insulated from news of the chaos unfolding a few floors below.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, 44, a chemist turned day trader, killed nine people
Thursday in two Atlanta office buildings. Twelve others were
wounded in the shooting spree, including the four still being
treated at Grady.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sure the police were out to get him,'' Ringfield said.
``That's why he took his gun to the hospital. My grandmother and my
auntie insisted he go to the hospital. because he's been having
problems. They told him to leave the gun behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said no. He said he knew the police would be there waiting
for him and he wanted to protect himself.''
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, Atlanta police and hospital security guards
escorted about a dozen people from the pharmacy. Some were crying;
others were dazed and frightened. There was disbelief that a
shooting could happen inside a hospital, especially so soon after
Barton's murderous rampage, the worst the state has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you're safe in a hospital,'' said Anne Landers, a
medical technician in Grady's first-floor lab. ``That's what I
thought. These days, no one is safe anywhere in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Grady issued the following statement: ''The Grady Health System
is sorrowed by today's tragic event, as our sole purpose is to help
those in need. We wish the family of Kenneth Gay our deepest sorrow
and our deepest sympathies.''
</P>
<P>
   While officers closed the pharmacy and blocked it off with
yellow ``crime scene'' tape, Grady officials diverted patients to
another pharmacy, which normally handles only senior citizens.
About 50 patients were sitting and standing around an hour after
the shooting, waiting for prescriptions to be filled. A custodian
brought in a large floor fan to keep the area comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital President Edward Renford said employees who were at the
scene and upset could go home once police had cleared them to
leave. Pharmacists remained on the job, filling prescriptions once
the facility reopened shortly at 2 p.m. Grady has several metal
detectors, including one at the street entrance to the emergency
room and on the 13th floor.
</P>
<P>
   The facility also maintains a security force. Qualifications
include a high school diploma, or equivalency degree, and one
year's experience at a security officer. Not all Grady guards carry
pistols. Those who do typically have been qualified through their
police background, as was the Grady guard who shot Gay. Grady does
not require its guards to be certified by the Police Officers
Standards and Training Council.
</P>
<P>
   Police training notwithstanding, Robert White, 42, of Atlanta,
who was in the pharmacy, said recent crimes in the city have
prompted him to expect mayhem. White said he and many others in the
pharmacy stayed relatively calm during the confrontation, partly
because shootings seem so commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become just a matter of knowing what to do,'' White said.
``After the events of last week, everyone was very calm. It was
scary, but nobody was screaming. We were sitting ducks and could
have been picked off. But we just got down and protected the older
folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Simmons was also in the pharmacy, a routine stop on an
otherwise ordinary morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard the shots, I threw myself down on the floor,''
Simmons said. ``After what happened with that Barton guy, I thought
someone had gone crazy in the hospital too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is on edge in this city.''

HOUSE VOTES TO CUT $2 BILLION FROM CLINTON FOREIGN AID PLAN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A $12.6 billion foreign aid bill was passed by the
House on Tuesday but faces a White House veto threat over its deep
spending cuts and anti-abortion language.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of debate, the House took nearly $2 billion out
of President Clinton's request for the coming year. The State
Department called the spending provided in the measure ``grossly
inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   The final vote was 385-35.
</P>
<P>
   The bill withholds $500 million the administration sought for
help in carrying out the latest Middle East peace accords, reached
last year at the Wye River plantation in Maryland. It also cut a
$200 million program for interest-free loans to the world's poorest
nations from the president's request.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also contains an amendment cutting off funds for any
foreign group that performs abortions or advocates liberalizing its
country's abortion laws. The Senate's foreign aid bill, passed last
month, does not include the anti-abortion language.
</P>
<P>
   The two foreign aid bills must now be reconciled in a
House-Senate conference. Despite the fact that most House Democrats
voted for the spending bill, many say they will oppose it in the
final form unless some of the cuts are restored.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign aid bill serves primarily as a vehicle for financing
American allies and American aims overseas and occasionally as a
means of questioning or quarreling with the White House and its
conduct of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, like the Senate's, which was passed June 30,
contains $2.88 billion in military and economic aid for Israel, $2
billion for Egypt and $325 million for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It made significant cuts in the White House's budget requests
for the Peace Corps, the Agency for International Development, the
Export-Import Bank, economic development funds for North Korea and
peacekeeping operations. It provided $725 million for the
independent states of the former Soviet Union, but that was $307
million less than the president sought, and half the aid to Russia
would be contingent on Moscow's ending its cooperation with Iran on
nuclear power and ballistic missile programs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill contains $626.6 million for the World Bank and its
subsidiaries. The House cut $200 million by withholding the sum
from the World Bank's International Development Association, which
provides loans without interest to the least-developed nations of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the House bill includes $7.4 billion in economic aid,
$3.6 billion for military assistance, $1.1 billion for various
international agencies and $596 million for export aid.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the House also adopted an amendment to the bill that
cut off money for recruiting and transporting Latin American
military officers to the Army's School of the Americas in Fort
Benning, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, which surprised even the amendment's supporters, was
an unusual act for the Republican-controlled Congress. It struck at
an institution long criticized by the left for the conduct of some
of its graduates, whose ranks include Manuel Noriega, the deposed
dictator of Panama; the late Roberto D'Aubuisson, a prominent
politician and reputed death-squad commander in El Salvador; and
other unsavory exponents of the Cold War in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate retained the financing for the School of the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   A separate spending bill to provide funds for the State
Department, which is scheduled to come to the House floor later
this week, will raise the issue of whether the United States should
pay the $1 billion in dues that it owes the United Nations.

SPORTS COLUMN: DARRYL CASTS A BIG SHADOW IN GOTHAM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ga.,)   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ In New York, we have quite a baseball season going. By
definition, there cannot be a dull day from now into October.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball waited patiently while the Knicks hunkered down longer
than expected, and even the Women's World Cup of soccer
commandeered attention into early July. Now everything else is just
going to have to watch as the soap operas unfold in the Bronx and
in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees may or may not have a taut division race but they
have something just as compelling _ a certified Darryl Watch, of
which New York has had its share over the past two decades. The man
is going to Columbus to resume the spring training that he
personally interrupted with his foolish drive on the wild side.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry loomed over last night's proceedings at the Stadium,
as the Yankees were trying to distance themselves from the Blue
Jays. David Cone, who pitched a perfect game only 16 days earlier,
was working for the Yankees. He, like Strawberry, has seen fire and
rain on both sides of the Triboro Bridge, and now both New York
franchises are throbbing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, by having lurched into first place in the past week,
are guaranteed to be volatile for the rest of this season. They
have already had a strange year, with the inherent dysfunction in
the Doubleday-Wilpon ownership seeping to the surface. The mixed
messages produced one of the cheesier New York baseball moves of
recent memory, the scuttling of three Mets coaches, just to scare
everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Totally independent of that panic move, the Mets found their
form, encouraging management to make some trades that announced the
club would not settle for a mere wild-card position.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are quite likely to hang in there until they play the
Braves six times in the last two weeks of the season, which will be
the ultimate opportunity as well as the ultimate challenge for the
increasingly Ahab-like manager, Bobby Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine became the only man in North America and the entire
Caribbean to resent the ebullient Sammy Sosa, grumping when his own
organization honored Senor Sunshine one night in front of thousands
of extra Dominican fans. He should only hope the Mets don't have
something planned for Mark McGwire in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees don't have to recognize visiting superstars. They
regularly make history in their own ball park, what with perfect
games now arriving at a rate of one per season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year they won 125 games, but Joe Torre, the convalescent
manager, was saying last night that they do not have to win 125
this time. They can _ and should, Torre suggested _ add
substantially to their overall record of two world championships
and two playoff appearances in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   It is not totally by coincidence that Strawberry was present
during all four of those seasons. He is part of this season, too,
in absentia. Wednesday there will be a Straw-size press conference
in Columbus, as a sizable press corps follows him on yet another
comeback trail.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Straw Man can keep himself from appearing at Yankee
Stadium by the end of this month, the deadline for fixing rosters
for the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The very presence of Darryl in the dugout forces opposing
managers to rearrange their late-inning pitching choices _ or maybe
even their roster moves. The Mets probably brought in Chuck McElroy
on trading deadline just to pitch to Darryl deep in October.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe we are ``kind of jumping the gun a bit,'' as Chili
Davis suggested last night after watching first Ricky Ledee and
then Shane Spencer take questions about the inevitable return of
Darryl to the left-field land rush. Then somebody asked Davis if he
anticipated Strawberry taking any designated-hitter swings from
him.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who was highly supportive of Strawberry in his brush with
colon cancer and then his slip-up this spring, said: ``The one
thing nobody says about Darryl is that he has to take this in
stride. He's got the opportunity to come back, but he's got to
remember that not everybody gets the chances he has.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Darryl understands how he is blessed,'' Davis added.
``George has been on his side. He's had the strength to come back
from cancer. And he is overcoming his other problems. Guys are
proud of the way he's coming back, but he's got to take his time.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Darryl has almost four weeks. Then it will be
September, baseball-race time in New York. The Jets and the Giants
should learn their plays. Their time will come. Right now we have a
baseball season in New York. &QL;

   Smith still hobbles from turf toe
</P>
<P>
   By Matt Winkeljohn
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Chuck Smith missed his seventh and eighth
consecutive practices at Falcons training camp as a sprained right
big toe continues to stick out like a sore thumb.
</P>
<P>
   He might not practice the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Given the nature of the injury and the fact that Smith is a
seven-year veteran who knows the defensive system, there is no need
to rush him back. If the turf toe doesn't heal properly, the
problem could last the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials said last Friday after Smith's injury that if
they had a game two days later, he couldn't have played.
</P>
<P>
   He jogged lightly Monday, and again Tuesday. Mostly, he rides an
exercise bike during practice, or walks. He has little, if any,
limp. Pushing hard off the right foot will be the telltale test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on getting some movement (with the toe),'' Smith
said. ``It was bent all the way back, and everything was stretched,
but it's not a Deion Sanders kind of deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The strained ligaments are not as serious as those suffered last
season by Sanders, the Dallas cornerback who missed the final third
of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   He had to have offseason surgery, and it's not certain when
Sanders will play again, but Smith insists he'll play again soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do whatever I have to do to get out there for real games,
whether I have to cut it off,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 260-pound Smith had 82 tackles and 8 1/2 sacks
last season after totaling career highs of 94 and 12 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, offseason acquisition Pellom McDaniels (6-3,
297) has been getting work in Smith's starting spot on the right
side. He had 116 tackles and 7 1/2 sacks with the Chiefs, where he
started 14 games in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Also, first-round draft choice Patrick Kerney (6-5, 273) has
been getting work at both ends.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was not alone on the sidelines Tuesday as wide receiver
Jammi German (strained groin), rookie wide receiver Eric Harris
(tight back), rookie tight end Reggie Kelly (sprained left ankle),
and rookie center Todd McClure (knee) were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Team doctor Andrew Bishop is waiting for swelling to go down in
McClure's right knee. McClure is thought to have suffered a
season-ending torn anterior cruciate ligament Friday.

SPORTS COLUMN: DARRYL CASTS A BIG SHADOW IN GOTHAM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ga.,)   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In New York, we have quite a baseball season going.
By definition, there cannot be a dull day from now into October.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball waited patiently while the Knicks hunkered down longer
than expected, and even the Women's World Cup of soccer
commandeered attention into early July. Now everything else is just
going to have to watch as the soap operas unfold in the Bronx and
in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees may or may not have a taut division race but they
have something just as compelling _ a certified Darryl Watch, of
which New York has had its share over the past two decades. The man
is going to Columbus to resume the spring training that he
personally interrupted with his foolish drive on the wild side.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry loomed over last night's proceedings at the Stadium,
as the Yankees were trying to distance themselves from the Blue
Jays. David Cone, who pitched a perfect game only 16 days earlier,
was working for the Yankees. He, like Strawberry, has seen fire and
rain on both sides of the Triboro Bridge, and now both New York
franchises are throbbing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, by having lurched into first place in the past week,
are guaranteed to be volatile for the rest of this season. They
have already had a strange year, with the inherent dysfunction in
the Doubleday-Wilpon ownership seeping to the surface. The mixed
messages produced one of the cheesier New York baseball moves of
recent memory, the scuttling of three Mets coaches, just to scare
everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Totally independent of that panic move, the Mets found their
form, encouraging management to make some trades that announced the
club would not settle for a mere wild-card position.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are quite likely to hang in there until they play the
Braves six times in the last two weeks of the season, which will be
the ultimate opportunity as well as the ultimate challenge for the
increasingly Ahab-like manager, Bobby Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine became the only man in North America and the entire
Caribbean to resent the ebullient Sammy Sosa, grumping when his own
organization honored Senor Sunshine one night in front of thousands
of extra Dominican fans. He should only hope the Mets don't have
something planned for Mark McGwire in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees don't have to recognize visiting superstars. They
regularly make history in their own ball park, what with perfect
games now arriving at a rate of one per season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year they won 125 games, but Joe Torre, the convalescent
manager, was saying last night that they do not have to win 125
this time. They can _ and should, Torre suggested _ add
substantially to their overall record of two world championships
and two playoff appearances in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   It is not totally by coincidence that Strawberry was present
during all four of those seasons. He is part of this season, too,
in absentia. Wednesday there will be a Straw-size press conference
in Columbus, as a sizable press corps follows him on yet another
comeback trail.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Straw Man can keep himself from appearing at Yankee
Stadium by the end of this month, the deadline for fixing rosters
for the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The very presence of Darryl in the dugout forces opposing
managers to rearrange their late-inning pitching choices _ or maybe
even their roster moves. The Mets probably brought in Chuck McElroy
on trading deadline just to pitch to Darryl deep in October.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe we are ``kind of jumping the gun a bit,'' as Chili
Davis suggested last night after watching first Ricky Ledee and
then Shane Spencer take questions about the inevitable return of
Darryl to the left-field land rush. Then somebody asked Davis if he
anticipated Strawberry taking any designated-hitter swings from
him.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who was highly supportive of Strawberry in his brush with
colon cancer and then his slip-up this spring, said: ``The one
thing nobody says about Darryl is that he has to take this in
stride. He's got the opportunity to come back, but he's got to
remember that not everybody gets the chances he has.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Darryl understands how he is blessed,'' Davis added.
``George has been on his side. He's had the strength to come back
from cancer. And he is overcoming his other problems. Guys are
proud of the way he's coming back, but he's got to take his time.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Darryl has almost four weeks. Then it will be
September, baseball-race time in New York. The Jets and the Giants
should learn their plays. Their time will come. Right now we have a
baseball season in New York. &QL;

HIGH NUMBER OF HEPATITIS A CASES ALARMS TEXAS COUNTY
</HEADLINE>
 
(RESENDING to FIX garble) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hepatitis A is plaguing Eastland County, Texas and some panicked
residents have been forced to drive hundreds of miles for shots
because local doctors have run out.
</P>
<P>
   With 70 cases since April _ including one rare death attributed
to the virus _ the rural county of 19,200, about 100 miles west of
Fort Worth, has an infection rate as high as some poor border
towns, said Brad Walsh, regional epidemiologist for the Texas
Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 70 cases now, which is a lot for a county that
usually has one to three a year,'' Walsh said. ``That makes it one
of the highest incidence counties in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest outbreak occurred in April and May, and Walsh said
its origin remains unclear. But more recent cases, linked to a
day-care center and two restaurants, have raised the level of
concern.
</P>
<P>
   About three weeks ago, seven adults and seven children
associated with an Eastland day-care center came down with the
virus, Walsh said. Then this week and last, health officials
announced that two area restaurants each had a worker with the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, health-care providers have been flooded with calls
from people who fear they were exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious residents have been forced to get on waiting lists for
vaccines or, for those already exposed, immune globulin or ``IG''
shots. Phones at local doctors' offices are so busy that state
health officials have resorted to communicating with them by fax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 200 calls yesterday,'' said Brenda Bailey, a
nutritionist with Eastland County health services. ``All residents
calling, `Oh, I ate at the Sonic.' People are just terrified in
this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis A is a viral infection of the liver whose flu-like
symptoms include nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and in some
cases fever and jaundice. The symptoms can last for several weeks
and can result in serious weight loss and dehydration, according to
the health department.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is spread by inadequate hand-washing after using the
restroom or changing an infected baby's diaper.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak in Eastland is blamed for the death of a
60-year-old who had other medical problems. But fatalities are
considered rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, if you're otherwise healthy, it's not dangerous,''
Walsh said. ``It's just miserable for a couple weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   That is small comfort to hundreds of residents who fear they
have been exposed and have had trouble getting the IG shot, which
is effective only if administered within 14 days of exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on the 12th page of the waiting list on Monday to get
in there to get the IG _ if they received it on time and if they
had enough,'' said Marilyn Gonce, 45, a homemaker who lives just
outside Eastland.
</P>
<P>
   Gonce and her husband were eager to get the IG shot after
hearing last week that a worker at Sonic Drive-In in Eastland had
the virus.
</P>
<P>
   State officials urged anyone who had eaten there from July 21
through July 25 to get the injection. The Gonces had eaten at Sonic
twice during that period. Health officials issued the same warning
Monday for anyone who ate at the Smokestack Restaurant in Thurber
on July 25 or 26.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to get an appointment with a local doctor, and worried
that the 14-day window would close, the Gonces called friends
around the state and asked them to call doctors' offices in their
areas to see if the IG shots were available.
</P>
<P>
   They were prepared to drive 51/2 hours to Amarillo until they
located a doctor in Garland who could help them. They made the trip
_ 31/2 hours each way _ and received their shots Monday with two
days to spare.
</P>
<P>
   Eastland County Judge Brad Stephenson said the shot shortage is
being addressed. The county administered 260 IG shots Friday and
ordered 350 doses of the vaccine to be distributed this week, he
said. In addition, the health department has obtained 600 doses of
the pediatric vaccine, 100 doses of the adult vaccine and 200 doses
of IG.
</P>
<P>
   ``All efforts are being made to provide vaccine or IG to anyone
who wants it,'' Stephenson said.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreaks have been front-page news in a county whose two
biggest claims to fame occurred in the late 1920s: A violent bank
robbery by a man in a Santa suit, and a horned toad that supposedly
emerged alive after 31 years in a time capsule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We much prefer to talk about those two things,'' said Russ
Thomason, president of the Eastland Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson said some residents are unduly alarmed about the
outbreak, noting that the Sonic restaurant received such high marks
in a recent state health inspection that it is unlikely that the
infected worker would have transmitted the virus to any customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fears are running high,'' he said. ``Some of it's justifiable
but some of it's really not.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomason, an attorney who once worked as a registered nurse,
said the outbreaks probably have made area restaurants extra
vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seen out every day in public eating at one or more
restaurants,'' he said ``Now we probably have some of the safest
restaurants in the state.''

<P>
   Burger King is making a bold new statement in the burger wars:
lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-food giant's old advertising strategy featuring
flame-broiled burgers in commercials set to trendy music is being
replaced with humorous spots that poke fun at the lengths to which
the chain will go to guarantee customer satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials, which are scheduled to appear on network
television in various time slots beginning Sunday, are meant to
extend Burger King's ``Have It Your Way'' slogan beyond the promise
of customized Whoppers to the total fast-food dining experience.
And the campaign is just one element of a comprehensive strategy to
enhance the overall Burger King brand image.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we step back to what our objective to all of this is, it
clearly is to establish a stronger emotional bond with our
customers,'' said Rob Calderin, vice president for marketing in the
United States. ``That took a comprehensive look at our entire
system.''
</P>
<P>
   What resulted was a plan for a system-wide makeover that
included everything from a new corporate logo and product packaging
to restaurant renovations and even some tweaking to the chain's
cooking system. Those changes are being rolled out over time, but
customers will immediately notice the self-deprecating commercials
that still focus on taste and custom-made burgers but suggest a
broader eagerness to please.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials are courtesy of Ammirati Puris Lintas, New York,
part of the Interpublic Group , which also created the long-running
campaign that Burger King Corp. is replacing. The old ads for the
Miami-based division of Diageo PLC, were set to trendy classics
like ``Wild Thing'' and ``That's the Way I Like It.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new tongue-in-cheek vignettes, even food snobs who
steer clear of take-out drive-thrus are likely to crack a smile at
the unabashed display of Burger King's less corporate side. It
seems there was also a practical reason for scrapping the old
campaign, which ``romanced the food'' and featured more than 300
songs from the 1950s through the 1980s. ``We were running out of
musical styles and about to head into polka,'' said Rob Feakins,
co-creative director at Ammirati Puris Lintas.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the new spots, entitled ``Truck,'' a Burger King
worker dispenses burgers door-to-door from an ice cream-style truck
as a mob of customers anxiously wait curbside for their turn to
order. That does not please the competition _ ice cream vendors who
use their trucks to corner the Burger King guy and drive him out of
the neighborhood. ``Dead end, Whopper boy,'' one says as the group
threatens to pummel the driver with various flavors of ice cream
bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Burger King can stand for taking food, but not ourselves,
very seriously, then this form of self-deprecating humor is
absolutely on target,'' said Jim Watkins, the chain's senior vice
president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign is a departure from Burger King's three-year
food and music campaign. And while the commercials retain the
``when you have it your way, it just tastes better'' tagline, the
overall campaign is intended to focus on customer service as much
as french fries.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King added the new element after seeing a study that
concluded that in recent years fast-food chains had become
functional in their approach and price-driven rather than competing
on franchise brand differentiation. Some of the spots though, use a
light touch to remind consumers that food remains the focus.
</P>
<P>
   In a spot entitled ``Patch,'' for instance, two men are engaged
in a Whopper craving contest in which the contestant who can resist
his desire for the burger longest wins. After the loser breaks
down, he asks how the winner held out. The champ rolls up his
sleeve to disclose a Whopper patch similar to a nicotine
anti-smoking patch. ``Until there's a patch, there's only one real
cure for a Whopper craving _ a mouth-watering Whopper,'' the
voice-over says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the general-market commercials Ammirati Puris
Lintas created, two other agencies added commercials specifically
for ethnic markets. Bromley Aguilar &AMP; Associates, which is owned by
the MacManus Group created spots aimed at Hispanic consumers while
Uniworld Group Inc. created commercials aimed at black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In a spot entitled ``Backyard Barbecue'' from Uniworld, a young
customer orders a Whopper and the cashier asks, ``And how would you
like our dads to fix that?'' Responding to the customer's obvious
confusion, she explains: ``Who knows about backyard barbecue better
than your dad, right? Back there, we've got a whole crew of
flame-broiling fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   The dads, including one sporting a ``kiss the cook'' apron, are
bickering over who makes the best burger. The stunned customer
discovers that one of them is his father. ``Until fathers
everywhere agree,'' the voice-over says, ``you'll agree that there
is nothing like the great taste of the Whopper.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the commercials, seek to create ``an emotional tie
between the brand and the consumer,'' said Rita Young, management
supervisor at Uniworld.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the campaign, Burger King is making systemwide upgrades
intended to persuade consumers to bypass the competitors' parking
lots and drive-thru window lanes. Some changes are subtle.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the company is bringing out a new logo, which will
be used in all advertising, merchandising, uniforms and store
signs. The traditional logo displaying the Burger King name in red
between a yellow bun, was modernized, in part by making the bun
smaller and rounder to give the impression of the burger bursting
out from within it. The logo also introduces a new color element, a
blue crescent, surrounding the bun.
</P>
<P>
   The company's more than 8,000 domestic restaurants will also be
spruced up. In a systemwide upgrade that will take several years to
complete, Burger King is adding bolder colors, like cobalt blue to
accent bright yellow and red in the interior and exterior of its
outlets. At drive-thru lanes, where half of the chain's sales are
generated, an electronic order-confirmation screen will be added
and a help button will allow customers to summon curbside
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   To increase order accuracy, new clear bags will replace paper by
the spring of next year. A newly designed cooking area will
highlight Burger King's flame-broiling method by providing
customers a full view of the process. And to further speed service,
the chain is designating separate areas for order taking, food
pick-up and dispensing of soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, to increase efficiency, Burger King is switching
from an assembly line process in kitchens to one in which a single
worker makes a burger from start to finish. The changes come a year
after Burger King's rival, McDonald's, rolled out a new cooking
system it called ``Made for You.'' That system also customizes
burgers and promises the hottest, fastest food in the industry.
Burger King, of course, insists that its tweaking has nothing to do
with the changes from the folks behind the Big Mac.

   Even last month's record-setting temperatures couldn't melt a
major special effect of the new Broadway play ``Voices in the
Dark.'' Nevertheless, when the thriller opens on Thursday, at least
one man will be as white-knuckled as the heroine, portrayed by
Judith Ivey, who is menaced in her snowbound Adirondack retreat by
a mysterious caller.
</P>
<P>
   For Gregory Meeh, the action on the Longacre stage begins and
ends with the snow that has to fall steadily for two hours of real
time outside the cabin's picture windows. ``I just hope it doesn't
come down in clumps or stick to the scrim,'' Meeh said recently, as
he kicked around several piles of the white stuff backstage. One
thing was clear: the mounds weren't dissolving into puddles. This
snow is made of thin plastic shavings.
</P>
<P>
   Meeh, whose field is special effects, has orchestrated inclement
weather for a number of Broadway productions, including the
downpours in ``The Lonesome West'' and ``Twelfth Night'' and the
pea-soup fog in ``An Inspector Calls.'' But the unrelenting
blizzard that maroons Ms. Ivey's character in John Pielmeier's play
has forced him to come up with a new way of creating airborne
flakes.
</P>
<P>
   The popular high-tech method these days involves soapsuds and
blowers, Meeh said, but the machinery is too loud. Old-school
snow-making is essentially paper confetti that is manually sifted
through mesh, but the results are often unconvincing. ``Believe it
or not, you can hear the paper flakes hitting the ground,'' Meeh
said. ``We couldn't have that happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   This is because the silent, inexorable snowfall is essential to
the chilling atmosphere that Pielmeier, who also wrote the play
``Agnes of God,'' is trying to create. For example, Ms. Ivey's Lil,
a radio call-in therapist eager to repair her own fractured
marriage, is ridiculously unprepared for the murderous weather.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for Lil, Ms. Ivey said, ``I thought I would be spending
a romantic weekend with my husband, so I brought a lot of lingerie
and no snowshoes.''
</P>
<P>
   The director, Christopher Ashley, likens the storm to another
character. ``It has different moods,'' he said. ``Sometimes it's
pretty, sometimes it's hostile. It's the symphony against which the
play unfolds.''
</P>
<P>
   To make it snow continually, Meeh and an assistant built steel
cylinders that are packed with the plastic shavings made by a
Christmas display company in Chicago. Special-effects economy note
to producers: at $60 for 25 pounds of ``snow,'' a two-hour blizzard
costs about $120, and the flakes can be re-used until they get
dirty, Meeh said. The six cylinders are suspended above the set's
windows, out of sight of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Meeh, 50, who lives on the farm in New Hampshire where he grew
up, said he liked to recreate the natural elements onstage. ``I
prefer quiet effects,'' he said. Still, he has done his share of
pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Peony Pavilion,'' the Chinese opera at Lincoln Center
Festival '99, he worked out a scene in which funeral dolls, on
platforms above a goldfish pond, went up in flames. In ``The
Lonesome West,'' he rigged a stove to explode. His most surreal
creation may have been for the 1997 ceremonies that marked the
return of British Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
   Meeh made sure the flags fluttered in the wind _ even though
they were flying inside an arena.

HOLBROOKE'S POSTING TO U.N. PROGRESSES  
(DW)

 (ATTN: Iowa, Ohio, Miss., Ky., Germany)   By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 14-month struggle of Richard Holbrooke to win
confirmation as chief American delegate to the United Nations
appeared near a successful conclusion Tuesday when the last senator
to block the nomination suggested he might allow a final vote
before the Senate begins its summer recess this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker, Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said through a
spokeswoman that he had made progress with the White House in
resolving the fate of a State Department employee who was moved
from her job at the United Nations after acknowledging a variety of
contacts with members of Congress and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Although the case is unrelated to Holbrooke, Grassley has said
he would block a final Senate vote on Holbrooke's nomination until
he is assured that the State Department employee, Linda S.
Shenwick, is treated fairly. The State Department has insisted that
Ms. Shenwick was insubordinate, and that her transfer to Washington
had nothing to do with sharing information with government
officials and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley's spokeswoman, Jill Kozeny, said: ``His concerns about
how this whistle-blower is being treated have been addressed in
part. There has been movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The tussle over Ms. Shenwick is the cause of the latest and
apparently final delay in the confirmation of Holbrooke, the former
American ambassador to Germany and the architect of the 1995 peace
settlement that ended the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kozeny and a lawyer representing Ms. Shenwick, Victoria
Toensing, would not comment on details of the negotiations between
the White House and Grassley. A White House official overseeing the
negotiations, Steve Ricchetti, did not return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But an administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it appeared that the State Department was willing
to make some concessions over Ms. Shenwick in exchange for a Senate
vote on Holbrooke, who is expected to be confirmed overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley had been one of four Republican senators to block a
final vote on Holbrooke's nomination through use of a senatorial
privilege known as a ``hold.'' Congressional officials say the
other senators _ Trent Lott of Mississippi, Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky and George Voinovich of Ohio _ have lifted their holds
over the last two weeks.

TRUE TALE OF DOOMED GOLD SHIP RIVALS FICTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the SS Central America crashed 8,000 feet to the floor of
the Atlantic Ocean, 200 miles off the coast of North Carolina in
September 1857, she took 428 passengers and crew and 21 tons of
gold with her.
</P>
<P>
   If you think it takes fiction to produce a truly entertaining
beach read, crack the spine of Gary Kinder's ``Ship of Gold in the
Deep Blue Sea,'' a true account of the worst peacetime disaster in
American maritime history and of the scientific adventurer who
reclaims the ship from the bottom of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The tale is sure to change your mind about nonfiction _ if not
in the last terrifying hours on the sinking ship, then when Tommy
Thompson finally sees the first sonar images of the distinctive
side-paddle wheels lying on the sea bottom, deeper than anyone had
ever explored.
</P>
<P>
   Kinder's record of the California gold rush is enjoyable
history, but his story of Thompson's epic quest to find the ship
and recover her treasures is pure adventure.
</P>
<P>
   This carefully documented story relies on hundreds of newspaper
accounts, diaries, histories, ship logs, interviews with survivors
and time aboard Thompson's discovery ship, shadowing the project
Thompson so carefully guarded.
</P>
<P>
   It is a story of gold fever vs. giddy scientific pursuit, the
development of side-scan sonar and deep-diving robots, ocean-floor
navigation grids and underwater photography that makes fire bricks,
lumps of coal, knots in wood planks and even tubeworms look like
gold bricks and coins.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Thompson's team spends 115 days hovering over,
protecting and exploring the wrong ship while one rival treasure
hunter circles the shipwreck site like a shark, and another bursts
right through the restricted area surrounding the dive site, openly
defying a federal judge's restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific technicalities and legal and financial details slow
this book in places, but they also underscore just what a huge
undertaking it is to explore the bottom of the deep ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could prepare for a thousand contingencies at sea, but the
sea had a thousand and one ways to beat you,'' the author observes.
</P>
<P>
   For a pictorial chronicle of the discovery of the Central
America, try Thompson's companion book, ``America's Lost Treasure''
(Atlantic Monthly Press, $39.95).

HOUSE DEBATES OFFICE SAFETY ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Vote in House expected this evening.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Does an office worker whose wrists are crippled by
repetitve stress injuries rate the same on-the-job safety
protection as a coal miner or steelworker? That's the question that
split Congress into two warring camps.
</P>
<P>
   As the industrial era yielded to the information age, painful
repetitive stress injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome have led
secretaries, computer programmers, and other employees of the new
economy to seek the federal protection of occupational safety
rules.
</P>
<P>
   But many in the nation's business community say that office
workers and other service and manufacturing employees don't face
the same risks as those employed in heavy industrial labor. The
National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups
have opposed a proposed federal rule that would require
ergonomically designed workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the battle reached the US Congress as the House debated
a bill that would temporarily block the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration from implementing the proposed ergonomic
regulations until the National Academy of Sciences completes a
study on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much controversy on the cause of these injuries,''
said Rep. Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska. ``Until we know
more facts about the various factors that cause repetitive stress
injuries . . . we are only guessing at the best way to protect
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, said that
OSHA's foes are trying to defeat the rules by delaying. ``This is
another scheme to prevent OSHA from doing its job,'' she said.
``Ergonomic guidelines are good for business and good for
productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to move with the times,'' said Frank Kane, an OSHA
spokesman. ``The world changes so the jobs change, which also means
the work-related injuries change. All we're trying to do is provide
fair protection for these workers.''
</P>
<P>
   OSHA supporters say there is already enough medical evidence to
link non-ergonomic working environments to musculoskeletal
injuries, which are caused by repetitive mechanical stress such as
typing or hammering, and that the regulation could save employers a
bundle. Musculoskeletal injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or
tendonitis, account for a third of lost workdays and cost employers
$20 billion annually in workers' compensation fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who have been literally debilitated by such
injuries,'' said Peg Seminario, director of occupational safety and
health for AFL-CIO. ``Some people can't perform everyday tasks like
brushing their hair, driving a car, or opening a can without
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, the first of its kind by OSHA, would set broad
workplace standards, such as requiring employers to provide typists
with adjustable chairs and keyboard wrist supports to minimize
injury risks. The proposed rules would also require employees to
develop an OSHA-approved ergonomics programs that suit their
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, recently conducted a study of companies who have
implemented an ergonomics program of their own. The study found
that some companies such as Red Wing Shoes in Minnesota and
California newspaper the Fresno Bee had cut medical and temporary
disability costs by nearly 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But OSHA critics argue that mandated standards would drive up
costs, particularly for companies in which few employees suffer
from such injuries. They want to delay implementation until more
scientific evidence is available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't know the exact causation of some of these
injuries,'' said Patrick Cleary, the vice president of human
resources for the National Association of Manufacturers. ``I don't
want to spend money on this program until I know exactly how many
keystrokes, how many turns of the screw will cause some of these
health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders said that they feared the rules would spur a
flood of dubious lawsuits, filed by employees who could claim their
injuries are work-related when they could have been caused at home.
And OSHA's foes also pointed at recent statistics that showed the
incidents of repetitive stress injuries declining in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   But Kane said that despite decreasing figures, the number of
workdays missed because of such injuries are still very high.
Carpal tunnel syndrome accounted for more days away from work on
average than any other injury, including fractures or amputation,
according to OSHA.

PANEL ORDERS GOVERNMENT TO PAY $16 MILLION FOR FILM OF KENNEDY
ASSASSINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to correct date in 4th graf to Nov. 22 sted 23)  (sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A divided federal arbitration panel announced on
Tuesday that the government must pay the heirs of Abraham Zapruder
$16 million for his film of President John F. Kennedy's
assassination, the highest price ever paid for a historical
American artifact.
</P>
<P>
   The award, which cannot be appealed, was about halfway between
the $30 million sought by the Zapruder family and the $1 million
offered by the Justice Department as compensation for the
quarter-inch-wide, six-foot long strip of film that experts said
was too fragile to safely run through a projector.
</P>
<P>
   The government acquired Zapruder's 26-second film last year
under a federal law that requires all records of the Kennedy
assassination to be transferred to the National Archives for
preservation, research and other noncommercial purposes. The
government had acknowledged that the Zapruder family was entitled
to fair reimbursement as owners of private property taken by the
government for public use.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, two of the panel's three members, Arlin M. Adams and
Kenneth R. Feinberg, wrote in their majority decision that the film
made by Zapruder, as the Kennedy motorocade rolled through Dallas
on Nov. 22, 1963, was ``a unique historical item of unprecedented
worth.'' A third member of the panel, Walter E. Dellinger,
dissented. He said that the price set by the majority ``was simply
too large an amount in light of the evidence in the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellinger said that an award of $3 million to $5 million would
have been more realistic. He said that since the Zapruder family
already controls the licensing of images on the film, the only
issue was the value of the original film strip as a collectible
object.
</P>
<P>
   Dellinger said that there have been no documented sales of any
other historically significant original film strips, a finding
which he said, ``strongly suggests that a camera original
ordinarily has little independent value.''
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's majority said that they were persuaded that the
film was immensely valuable by experts hired by lawyers for the
Zapruder family who testified at a two-day hearing in May. The
experts, former employees of auction houses like Sotheby's and
Christie's, said that the film was a one-of-a-kind historical
relic.
</P>
<P>
   The majority decision concluded that the film's worth was
further enhanced by the soaring prices commanded for Kennedy
historical memorabilia in recent years, like the Louis XVI desk on
which President Kennedy signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963,
which sold at auction in 1996 for $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The majority said it was also guided by the astronomical prices
paid recently for other historically unique artifacts, like the
$30.8 million paid in 1994 by Bill Gates, the co-founder and
chairman of Microsoft, for the Leonardo da Vinci Codex, a rare
notebook containing more than 300 illustrations and scientific
writings by the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Zapruder, a Dallas dress manufacturer, died of cancer in 1970 at
the age of 66.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued on Tuesday by a family company, LMH, the
Zapruder family said, ``We believer the result reached by the
arbitration panel is fair and reasonable.'' The statement said the
family was pursuing a permanent arrangement to transfer licensing
rights to the film, which the family retained, to a public
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. Bennett, a lawyer for the family, said on Tuesday that
he was pleased by the decision. ``The family and the government
agreed that arbitration was the most dignified way to satisfy the
constitutional requirement of just compensation,'' he said. ``This
approach assured that the National Archives will possess the film
for the benefit of all the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   David W. Ogden, acting assistant attorney general for the
Justice Department's Civil Division, offered no assessment of the
amount of the award. He said in a statement, ``The resolution of
these issues insures that this evidence of one of the most tragic
events in American history will be protected for scholarly and
research uses.''
</P>
<P>
   The award was a clear-cut victory for the Zapruder family. The
government offered to pay the family $3 million before the
arbitration proceedings began, rejecting the Zapruder's proposal to
settle for $18.5 million, said several people who followed the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The final award was much closer to the family's settlement
figure. The family will be awarded an interest payment, which some
lawyers said would increase the final award amount to about $17
million. But the family must pay taxes and lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the price for the film is the most ever paid for an
historical American artifact. An original print of the Declaration
of Independence sold for more than $2 million, a manuscript of
President Abraham Lincoln's ``House Divided'' speech opposing
slavery sold for $1.5 million and President Dwight D. Eisenhower's
D-Day order sending allied troops into Europe during World War II
sold for $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The government faces a similar case in a legal challenge in
Federal District Court in Washington by the estate of former
President Richard M. Nixon, which is seeking to collect $35 million
in compensation and $175 million in compounded interest for tapes,
photos, films and documents the government seized after he left
office on Aug. 9, 1974. The government contends the estate is
entitled to nothing.

 &HT;    Mass killings reverse falling murder rate
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just 17 days apart, two men with four guns shot 15
people dead in the city of Atlanta, where for the past three years
homicides had been on a steady decline.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The mass killings unleashed by Cyrano Marks on July 12 and Mark
Barton on Thursday pushed the city's homicide rate above that for
the same period last year, from 83 homicides January through July
1998, to 92 homicides through this July, Atlanta police say.
</P>
<P>
   The city's 24 killings also turned last month into the most
violent July since 1990 when 26 people were killed in Atlanta, said
police spokesman John Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to explain or prevent the actions of one
individual. That's the frightening aspect of crime,'' Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no one could predict that Marks, 39, who hoped to
become a professional chef, would wake up one morning before sunup
and kill his girlfriend, her sister and four of his girlfriend's
six children. Marks, who also shot and killed himself, was
considered a father figure to his youngest victims, who called him
``stepdad.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton, 44, was a Boy Scout leader who was seen horsing around
with his son and a young neighbor in the parking lot of his Henry
County apartment complex the same night he killed his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The next day he killed his two children, and the day after that,
he shot and killed nine people in two office complexes in Buckhead,
the heart of Atlanta's business district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worry about the murder rate,'' said Atlanta police Maj.
Mickey Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the real tragedy is the people who are left behind to deal
with these acts. We (as police) can have all the studies on
homicides and all the meetings with community groups we want, but
how do you prevent this kind of thing?''

   WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION PLANS AN INITIAL OFFERING
</P>
<P>
   World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, the company that
promotes and stages the most popular wrestling events, including
Wrestlemania, plans to raise up to $175 million by selling a
minority stake in the company in an initial public offering. The
company, which produces television shows like ``W.W.F. Smackdown,''
has cashed in on the public's taste for increasingly outrageous
competitions. Wrestling dominates the rankings of cable television
shows, and those high ratings have produced stellar financial
results.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS END MIXED WITH THE DOW UP
</P>

of national contracts with all auto makers in September. The union
holds such votes every three years at all the auto factories it
represents, just in case union leaders need to call a national
strike if talks break down. A strike this year seems unlikely, most
labor and auto officials say.

CELTICS GET DOWN TO BUSINESS, TRADE MERCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Ron Mercer will be in Denver this morning. He will
take a physical. He will sign a six-year contract extension with
the Nuggets, who are now bankrolled by a billionaire owner. And
then, finally, the 6-foot-7-inch guard will exhale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can go to Denver and not worry about trade rumors every
year,'' Mercer said Tuesday. ``From Day One in Boston, it seemed
like I was always being talked about in a trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the talk became official. Mercer, Popeye Jones, and
Dwayne Schintzius were traded from the Celtics to the Nuggets for
power forward Danny Fortson, former Celtic Eric Williams, reserve
guard Eric Washington, a conditional first-round draft pick, and $3
million. The deal means that Celtics coach and president Rick
Pitino has now traded his first two draft picks, Mercer and
Chauncey Billups, both of whom now play in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Add the team's signing of point guard Wayne Turner and you will
see that the Celtics were busy Tuesday. And they may get busier.
Indiana Pacers president Donnie Walsh confirmed that the teams have
had conversations about a trade. The Pacers would like to acquire
Antoine Walker; the Celtics would most likely be looking for
6-foot-11-inch forward Dale Davis and draft picks in return.
</P>
<P>
   One of the snags in such a deal would be Walker's contract. He
is scheduled to make $9 million next season, but if the Celtics
were to trade him, the most the new player could make is $5.25
million. Davis, 30, will make $4.9 million next season. But the
Pacers would have to be creative to fit Walker under their cap.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Pitino and general manager Chris Wallace are excited
about the deal they were able to make with the Nuggets, especially
since it was no secret that Mercer had to be traded. The Celtics
are also excited about the pick they received, 2001 being the
earliest they can use it. All picks are protected, meaning that the
Celtics can't use it if it's in the top five in '01, top three in
'02, or No. 1 in '03. And if they haven't exercised the pick by
'04, they will be required to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino explained why Mercer could no longer be a part of the
Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never come close to the numbers Ron wanted,'' Pitino
said. ``If I could come close, I would consider hanging on. It was
a situation where we could never have signed Ron Mercer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer's agent, Tevester Scott, was asked exactly how much the
Celtics offered Mercer when they met with him last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get into specifics,'' Scott said, ``but they totally
disrespected his ability as a basketball player with the money they
offered him. There are guys on the bench who make more money than
they were offering.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said he was pleased that Mercer is heading to Denver, but
added, ``The Celtics blew some very good deals. I can tell you
there were a lot of teams that wanted Ron.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer said he understood that he was the team's easiest
bargaining chip. So the Celtics dangled him as they sought a
rebounder. They found the rugged Fortson, a 6-7, 260-pounder who
averaged 11.6 rebounds last season. He was available because he
wanted to start and the Nuggets didn't see that role for him next
season. When Raef LaFrentz was injured, Fortson took over at center
and became the NBA's fourth-best rebounder. But general manager Dan
Issel now projects a starting lineup of Antonio McDyess, LaFrentz,
Mercer, Billups, and recently signed point guard Nick Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the trade,'' Fortson said. ``It will be a better
situation for me than in Denver. I'll have the opportunity to play
a little more and show what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   If Walker is not dealt, the Celtics see Fortson at power
forward, Walker at small forward (a position he favors), and Vitaly
Potapenko at center. Paul Pierce will switch to shooting guard.
``We are convinced, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Paul can play
shooting guard,'' Pitino said. The coach said Pierce has
dramatically improved his ballhandling.
</P>
<P>
   Fortson was asked if he sees himself as an Eastern Conference
type of player.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' he said. ``It's a rough and tough conference
and I think I'm suited for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Issel agreed, but added that the new NBA rules could hurt a
physical player such as Fortson.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer and Billups being reunited is not the only coincidence in
the trade. There is also the return of 6-8 forward Williams, who
was traded by Boston in August 1997 to the Nuggets. At the time,
Pitino said Williams couldn't play for him because of his poor work
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have my head together at the time,'' Williams said.
``I've matured. Coach Pitino said he wasn't going to stand for
anyone slacking off and he was true to his word, man. I'm in the
weight room so much now, guys on the Nuggets used to compete with
me and see if they could beat my records.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams had the lowest body fat on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to be back,'' he said. ``I found my niche in Boston.
And, hey man, the duo is back. I'm about to call my boy now and
tell him the news.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was referring to Walker, one of his best friends when
the two played together in the 1996-97 season. Williams didn't have
good times in Denver, blowing out a knee his first season there and
playing poorly _ 7.2 points per game _ last season. He did receive
a $30 million contract, $3 million of which will be paid by the
Nuggets' new owners.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets are excited about Mercer, who averaged 17 points
last season, playing with them in their new arena. And Mercer is
partially excited about leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss the fans in Boston,'' he said. ``Let me tell you
why: They get on you when you do something wrong, but they
appreciate a good play. I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not the only one happy today. Fortson and Williams are
happy about the opportunity to play. The Celtics are happy that
they got a rebounder. And the Nuggets are happy that they have
their first pure shooting guard since the days of Walter Davis and
Fat Lever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you something else,'' Williams said. ``People in
Boston are going to like Eric Washington. He's a great defensive
player, he runs and he shoots the three. That's everything Coach
Pitino wants.''

TO SPRINGER, POSSIBLE RUN FOR SENATE IS NO JOKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (mk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ If it were an episode of ``The Jerry Springer
Show,'' it might be titled ``Freak Show Hosts With Burning
Passions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics has always been my passion,'' admitted Springer, the
former mayor of this city who went on to create one of the most
popular and raucously vulgar of television's confrontational
entertainment shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the midst of the craziness of the show _ and that's
all it is, crazy _ my passion has always been politics,'' he said
as he insisted that he was giving serious attention to a proposal
that he run for the U.S. Senate from Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Springer's fellow Democrats have begun wincing at the
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think that his contributions to American culture and
what he has brought before the nation typifies the Democratic
Party,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the
Senate Democratic Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   An old Springer ally, Tim Burke, the Hamilton County Democratic
chairman, proposed Springer's nomination, arguing that Springer,
now ubiquitously famous, could crack the general indifference of
voters and prod hordes of couch potatoes to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be an outside-the-box kind of candidate,'' Burke
said, equating Springer with Jesse Ventura, the
wrestler-elected-governor-of-Minnesota who has stunned professional
politicians wary of populist waves rocking the party boats.
</P>
<P>
   While other Democrats hoot and groan at the idea of a Springer
candidacy, Burke has set off the political equivalent of one of
those scathing, how-dare-he, chair-tossing tableaux about low-life
dysfunction that makes the Springer show avidly watched across
America and in 40 other nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was Howard Stern busy?'' the state's Republican chairman, Bob
Bennett, asked as he merrily proposed alternative candidates for
the Democrats, including Dennis Rodman, the body-pierced basketball
contrarian, and Tanya Harding, the wayward ice skater.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, many Democrats sound appalled at the idea of a
Springer candidacy in the face of the party's weakness in the polls
on family-value issues. They judge the considerable talk here about
Springer _ much of it outraged, initially at least _ as mainly a
desperate measure of the Ohio party's hard times and dearth of
strong candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohio's a tragedy,'' said one party strategist who noted that
Springer would probably be ostracized by the rest of the ticket.
``But here's a toxic guy who has 100 percent name recognition. A
complete self-funder and the ultimate political long ball. It's all
so weird that, who knows, maybe something strange happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, who will seek re-election next year,
has stayed silent on the issue amid the Democrats' search for a
challenger. The Ohio Democratic chairman, David Leland, is
painfully noncommittal, saying a Springer candidacy would have to
rise above the TV show's controversy and get back to the real
issues that he saw Springer master in his years as a political
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's talking about it,'' Leland said wearily. ``And I'm
hearing three basic reactions: One, it's terrible, he shouldn't
run. Two, it's terrible, he shouldn't run because he's going to
win. Three, it's a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly squelching the tease, Springer notes that he ``would have
a lot to lose, including millions of dollars'' if he quit his show.
But he said he had never quite shed his candidate's instincts, even
as his TV role shifted from sober anchor to a kind of
Mephistophelian moderator of humanity's baser instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to start from scratch,'' mused Springer, promising an
answer by Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The left-of-center Springer, who is based in Chicago but keeps
his eye on Ohio by way of Burke, had a rich career in Cincinnati as
a five-term city councilman and a two-term mayor, and as an
award-winning television news anchor and political commentator.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst crisis of his political life, Councilman Springer
became a laughingstock in 1974 when he was discovered to have
patronized a prostitute's massage parlor and blithely paid with a
personal check.
</P>
<P>
   He went before the public with an apology, submitted his
resignation, and then ran anew and regained his seat, persevering
as the people's choice with enough strength to become mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being mayor was the best experience I ever had,'' Springer,
55, said with a rueful tinge, describing his current lucrative
calling to global fame as ``just a job.''
</P>
<P>
   He ran for governor in 1982, failing in the Democratic primary
but attracting the attention of television producers who understood
the symbiosis between political candidacy and television celebrity.
That symbiosis now is at the heart of the proposed resurrection of
candidate Springer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly wouldn't be a run for ego,'' he said. ``It really
would be a pure decision, walking away from money and fame, from
all the Jer-ee! Jer-ee! But if their attention can be held _ long
enough for me to say, `Know what? You can also make your lives
better' _ that may be where I can make a contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   The tattoo of inflamed public commentary over such a possibility
was summarized in a local letter to the editor: ``Gotta be a
joke.'' Springer said he initially agreed, until he tracked a
Cleveland call-in show that netted 1,100 calls in a heated few
hours of unscientific polling. ``I led DeWine 57 to 43,'' Springer
said with more pride than surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, who knows?'' said this proven specialist in the public's
fecklessness. ``Next week we'll be talking about something else.''

 &HT;    Perez calls length of suspension `ridiculous'
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Braves catcher Eddie Perez was slapped with a
four-game suspension Tuesday and fined $1,000 by the National
League for his part in a brawl last Friday against the Phillies.
Braves manager Bobby Cox was suspended for two games and fined an
undisclosed amount for coming onto the field during the fight after
he'd already been ejected from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said Tuesday afternoon he would probably not appeal his
suspension and Perez said he probably would appeal his. Their
decisions were not finalized until after the game. If Cox accepts
his, he will miss the last two games of the Pittsburgh series _
today and Thursday. He can be at the ballpark, just not on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Perez would be allowed to play until his appeal is heard by
National League president Leonard Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's too many games,'' Perez said. ``Nobody from (the
Phillies) gets suspended or fined. That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident began when Phillies pitcher Paul Byrd hit Perez in
his first at-bat on Friday night. He had hit Perez the Sunday
before in Philadelphia. John Smoltz hit Alex Arias in the next
half-inning and was immediately ejected by home-plate umpire Jerry
Meals.
</P>
<P>
   When Byrd followed Arias to the plate, he was greeted by an
angry Perez, who ignored Byrd's comments that he didn't hit Perez
on purpose, shoved him and hit him in the face with his glove. Then
benches cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz was fined $2,500 for getting ejected. That Smoltz was not
suspended would seem to indicate the National League backed his
opinion that Meals should have warned him first. Perez said he will
not be paid for the four games he misses.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cox doesn't plan to appeal his suspension, that doesn't
mean he agrees with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you have to do something,'' he said. ``I don't know.
To me, you should judge things with common sense. I don't think
it's the same thing as coming back and sitting on the bench in
disguise. I went out there with the team to keep the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The last Brave to be suspended was Andres Galarraga last year
after he charged Dodgers pitcher Darren Dreifort on Aug. 22. He
served his suspension Sept. 2-5.
</P>
<P>
   To top it all, Perez broke his nose when he tried to break up a
double play at second base during Friday night's game. But he said
it won't stop him from playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a chance to play and now I get suspended and miss four
games,'' Perez said. ``All I want to do is play. I'm frustrated.''

TRIAL BEGINS FOR DEFENDANT IN BRUTAL SLAYING OF HOMOSEXUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID FIRESTONE  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKFORD, Ala. _ Five months after Billy Jack Gaither's charred
and battered body was found by a creek near here, prosecutors
Tuesday told a jury of a hate-inspired conspiracy to murder him on
the part of two construction workers who they said were enraged by
Gaither's homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Jack Gaither was a homosexual, and that is the only
reason they killed him,'' said Fred Thompson, the local district
attorney, in the opening statement of the capital murder trial of
Charles Monroe Butler Jr., one of the two men.
</P>
<P>
   The other man, Steven Eric Mullins, pleaded guilty in June to
the Feb. 19 killing of Gaither, a 39-year-old factory worker who
lived in nearby Sylacauga. Butler was expected to accept a similar
plea agreement, but on Monday he rejected an offer of life without
parole, and his trial began Tuesday before a jury of six men and
six women.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Mullins killed Gaither but accused Butler of
being a willing accomplice who helped to burn Gaither's body.
Butler's lawyer told the jury his client knew nothing of Mullins'
plans, and was forced to help by the larger and stronger Mullins.
</P>
<P>
   Both men had already admitted to police that Gaither was killed
because he was gay, and had made an overture toward Butler in a
Sylacauga bar. As in the slaying of Matthew Shepard case in
Wyoming, Gaither's murder became a national symbol of anti-gay
violence, made especially poignant by his closeted life in a small
Southern town where even his parents did not know of his
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   But trial testimony revealed new details of the savage nature of
the murder, and of Gaither's desperate attempts to resist. Jurors
shook their heads in revulsion when shown large color photographs
of his body, the abdomen of which had been reduced to ashes by the
flaming tires placed on him after his head was crushed by an axe
handle.
</P>
<P>
   In a taped statement given to police in February and played for
the jury, Butler, 21, said the three men had been in the bar
together when Gaither made an overture to him, apparently in the
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started talking, you know, queer stuff, you know, and I
just didn't want no part of it,'' he said. Butler said he then
began kicking Gaither to the ground but left to use the bathroom
when Gaither struggled to his feet. Mullins then began beating
Gaither, according to the statement, punching him, slashing his
throat, and stuffing him into the trunk of Gaither's car.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting next to Butler, Mullins then drove the car to his house,
where both men got some tires, kerosene and matches, Butler said.
Then they drove to a trash dump, he said, and Mullins took the
tires from the trunk and set them afire with the kerosene. They
assumed Gaither was either dead or unconscious, but he surprised
them by suddenly rising from the trunk and pushing Mullins into the
creek. Butler said he was frightened and ran away, while Gaither
tried desperately to start the car. But Mullins had the keys, and
when he emerged from the creek he pulled Gaither out of the front
seat and beat him to death with an axe handle, Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   He said they jointly threw Gaither's lifeless body onto the
fire, and later burned the car.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's lawyer, Billy Hill Jr., did not dispute Butler's
earlier statement, but took pains to note throughout the day that
his client never admitted doing the actual killing. He noted that
Mullins is 25 years old, 6-foot-1 and 200 pounds, while Butler is
21, 5-foot-3 and 120 pounds, suggesting that the older man had
strongarmed his client into participating.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Mullins, who is likely to receive a sentence of life
without parole as a result of his plea, Butler faces the death
penalty if convicted of the top count of murder. Although Hill said
he hoped to have his client declared not guilty, he seemed to be
trying to guide the jury toward a lesser charge, as he did not try
to refute Butler's own admission that he accompanied Mullins
throughout the incident. Once Mullins testifies, he said, jurors
will learn how little his client had to do with the murder.
Gaither.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client didn't kill Billy Jack Gaither, he didn't kidnap
him, he didn't know of a plot to kill him,'' Hill said. ``He wasn't
required to put his life in danger by trying to stop Mullins.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaither's family sat quietly behind the defense table during the
day, his elderly parents occasionally looking downward during the
more gruesome testimony. His father, Marion Gaither, said during a
break that he held Butler equally responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have gotten out of the car and stopped it anytime he
wanted to,'' he said, standing outside the courthouse that is the
only sizable structure in the tiny county seat of 500 about 60
miles southeast of Birmingham. ``He could have told someone what
was happening, but he didn't. It was his choice.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, though, that he hoped neither man would be executed,
preferring they live out their lives in prison.

   Gunshot wounds cost the nation $2.3 billion in medical treatment
each year, and almost half that sum is paid for with taxpayers'
dollars, a study by a group of economists has found.
</P>
<P>
   The study, being reported on Wednesday in The Journal of the
American Medical Association, used data collected in 1994 to
calculate the expense of treating the 134,445 gunshot wounds
reported during that year. The total did not take into account
other costs, like those of mental health treatment for victims or
lost days of work.
</P>
<P>
   Because the study was so large, said the paper's chief author,
Dr. Philip J. Cook of Duke University, it gives the clearest
picture to date of both the financial impact of firearms violence
and of who is paying the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because almost half of the cost is paid for by the
government,'' Cook said, ``it is clear that even though many people
feel that gun violence is essentially someone else's problem, it is
really everybody's problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jens O. Ludwig of Georgetown University, a co-author of the
report, said it suggested that programs to curb firearm violence
might be worth the expense, by reducing costs in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   In their study, the researchers drew information from 10 large
databanks, including hospital stay and discharge figures, outcomes
of emergency room treatment, and reports on the cause and outcome
of the most expensive of gunshot damage: spinal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost of a gunshot wound that brings the victim to a
hospital is $14,600 for emergency care and $35,400 for lifetime
medical care resulting from the shooting, the study found. The
researchers established an annual total cost of $2.3 billion by
adding all the emergency care expense for 1994 to a figure, arrived
at by formula, reflecting that year's share of lifetime medical
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $2.3 billion in total annual medical costs, $1.1 billion,
or 48 percent, was paid by taxpayers through Medicaid, Medicare,
workers' compensation and other government programs, the
researchers said. About 33 percent was paid by the wounded
themselves or other people, and about 18 percent was paid by
private medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Wounds that resulted from assaults with firearms, as opposed to
accidents or suicide attempts, accounted for three-quarters of the
total cost, the study found. In addition, the data showed that
while only about 2 percent of gunshots resulted in spinal cord
injuries, such cases accounted for half the total cost of gunshot
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Because the study is the largest and most complete of its kind,
it is likely to figure in policy debates on gun violence in
America.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Paul Blackman, research coordinator of
the Institute for Legislative Action at the National Rifle
Association, said that although the cost identified in the study
might seem large, ``put in perspective it is only one-quarter of 1
percent of the nation's $950 billion medical costs, and in that way
seems less burdensome.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackman also said that others had estimated the portion of the
nation's gunshot medical bill paid by taxpayers to be much higher.
So the new, more detailed figures, he said, might lower concern
about how much of the burden the public is carrying.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, meanwhile, said he and his colleagues were now working on
an estimate of society's total costs, beyond just medical expenses,
attributable to gun violence.

GARBER SET TO TAKE REINS AS MLS COMMISSIONER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Garber, a 42-year-old who had been on the fast track toward
becoming a candidate for commissioner of the NFL, will replace Doug
Logan as Major League Soccer commissioner, the MLS will announce
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Garber joined the NFL in the late 1970s and helped develop the
NFL ``experience'' of interactive activities. He was a top
executive at NFL Properties until 1994, and has been senior vice
president and managing director of NFL International.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge coup for the MLS,'' a source said. ``(Garber)
walked away from a great job in a league which anyone in sports
management would kill to be involved in. He also turned down the
presidency of NHL Properties. He believes the MLS is a tremendous
product and he can grow it, he can take it from a 12-team league to
a 20-team league and find a way to capture the millions of youths
who play the game, all the new Americans, the Latinos, who enjoy
watching soccer. He believes this can be a compelling television
product if you spend money to produce it right.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he knows from experience that the product on the field is
the cornerstone of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Garber's strengths are his contacts with sponsors and television
networks, especially useful now, as contracts are being negotiated
for next season.
</P>
<P>
   But Garber, like Logan, has no previous experience in soccer and
will have to leave most of the soccer-related decisions to others
such as deputy commissioner Ivan Gazidis and, possibly, to Sunil
Gulati, who could return after being fired in February.
</P>
<P>
   The MLS front office had remained stable since the league
started play in 1996, until the dismissal of Gulati. Logan, hired
Nov. 21, 1995, had been especially effective in the first year of
the league, when an experienced figure was needed at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Logan, 56, had a wealth of experience that balanced the junior
executive stereotype of the MLS. He was a New York taxi driver
before serving in Vietnam in the 1960s and became a facilities
promoter, rock and roll promoter, minor league basketball
executive. He was born in Havana, where his grandfather owned a
baseball team, and delighted in working with the MLS' Hispanic
media and players, humorously challenging commissioners of other
sports leagues to match his gregariousness and versatility.
</P>
<P>
   But Logan was criticized for predicting attendance growth in the
second year of the MLS, as averages fell from 17,406 in 1996 to
14,619 in '97. Average attendance is 15,174 this season.
</P>
<P>
   And Logan had a contentious relationship with ESPN-TV, although
his spirited criticisms were appreciated by many.
</P>
<P>
   Logan had been named head of the delegation for the US national
team in the Confederations Cup in Mexico, but returned to New York
this week to discover he was unexpectedly about to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a sign of instability,'' a source said. ``They had
somebody to take his place and it's early enough so that he can
begin working on next year. The season ends so late, in November,
that if you made a change then it would have no impact and you
would have lost a year.''

SNOW, WYDEN TO FIELD PRESCRIPTION DRUG BILL 
</HEADLINE>
 - BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A bipartisan proposal to add prescription drug coverage for 39
million Americans on Medicare is expected to be unveiled in
Washington wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Senators Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) and Ron Wyden
(D-Ore), the plan would force insurers to sell drug coverage to all
seniors and disabled people on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, the only bipartisan prescription drug plan on
Capitol Hill so far, would help low-income seniors pay for the
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest effort by Washington policymakers to address
what is considered to be Medicare's biggest flaw _ its failure to
pay for prescription drugs. President Clinton, Senator Edward M.
Kennedy and Rep. Barney Frank have been among the most vocal
advocates of introducing drug coverage to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being bipartisan, the Snowe-Wyden proposal differs
from other proposals in several ways. Beneficiaries, unless they
are low-income, would have to pay for the coverage. They would also
have to shop among various insurance companies, which would set
their own premiums and benefit packages.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Kennedy proposal calls for all seniors to
receive $1,700 in drug benefits a year with a $200 deductible and a
20 percent copayment. The government would foot the bill, which
would cost anywhere from $20 billion to $30 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton plan has no deductible and would pay half of all
drug expenses, up to an initial annual limit of $1,000 each person
on their first $2,000 of drug bills. Beneficiaries under the
president's plan also would pay a $24 monthly premium, but
low-income seniors who earn less than $17,000 a year per person
would not have to pay a premium and would have all of their drug
expenses, up to $2,000 a year, covered.
</P>
<P>
   The Snowe-Wyden plan also calls for subsidies for low-income
seniors. Seniors with incomes of less than $12,360 each would pay
no premium for their coverage. Seniors who earn more would have
subsidies based on a sliding scale.
</P>
<P>
   A major perceived stumbling block to adding drug coverage is the
potentially enormous cost of having the benefit. Snowe and Wyden
are relying on anticipated federal budget surpluses, plus a hike in
tobacco taxes. Clinton has indicated he will also rely on budget
surpluses, while Frank, a Democrat, has proposed to draw money from
an existing estate tax that Republican lawmakers want to phase out.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Washington passes a drug benefit under Medicare is
unclear, but the flurry of legislative activity around the topic
indicates that prescription drug coverage has become a politically
hot subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress must take action to correct the lack of a
prescription drug benefit,'' said Snowe. ``It is a major gap in the
Medicare program and a major burden on America's seniors.''

PEDIATRICIANS WARN OF EFFECTS OF TV ON CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH

<TEXT>
<P>
   Children under 2 years old should not watch television, older
children should not have television sets in their bedrooms, and
pediatricians should have parents fill out a ``media history,''
along with a medical history, on office visits, according to
recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that television viewing can affect the mental, social and
physical health of young people, the academy for the first time has
laid out a plan for how pediatricians and parents can deal with
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``As pediatricians, we are taking all the research concerns into
account, and trying to raise the bar a bit, as suggestions for
optimal parenting,'' said Dr. Marjorie Hogan, the lead author of
the report, which appears in the August issue of Pediatrics
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   No reliable research has been done on how television viewing
affects children younger than 2, Dr. Hogan said. But the Academy
based its recommendations for such children on knowledge of what
babies need for proper brain development _ notably close-up
interaction with older people _ and the common-sense notion that,
if they are watching television, babies are not getting those other
essential stimuli.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in movies and television has been linked to violent
behavior in young people in studies by the American Medical
Association, the American Psychological Association, the American
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the National
Institute of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   So while the academy may appear to be venturing into
sociological territory with little direct connection to medical
health issues, the study's authors say the influence of mass media
is a major public health concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, media violence,'' said Dr. Miriam Baron,
chairwoman of the academy's committee on public education, which
wrote the policy. ``A bullet in the body is a physical health
issue. Children who spend a lot of time in front of the TV set tend
to gain weight; obesity is a physical health issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Academy is distributing to its members a sample ``media
history'' checklist for their young patients. It includes questions
about movies, video and computer games, music videos and the
Internet, as well as about the radio and books.
</P>
<P>
   Also available to the 55,000 members are brochures explaining
the positive and negative influences that media can have on
children, with suggestions about how to guide families toward
positive uses, including critical discussion on what they watch. To
encourage such talk, the Academy suggests that televisions and
computers not be kept in children's bedrooms but in common rooms,
where parents can monitor and participate in children's use of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The policy's main purpose, the authors said, is to encourage
pediatricians and their patients to learn about and discuss the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents interviewed Tuesday agreed that television's
influence was a proper concern for pediatricians, but that it was
unrealistic to set arbitrary limits, and unnecessary for doctors to
intervene unless a child already had social or emotional problems
that might be related to media exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the theory, but practically I think it's not very
doable,'' said Lari Mills of Nashville, Tenn., who has an
8-month-old baby as well as a 7-year-old and a 9-year-old. ``The
little one is often around the TV when the older ones are watching,
but he's not really watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Valerie Barney said her 2-year-old son watches
``Barney'' and ``The Teletubbies'' on PBS, and she sees no harm in
it as long as an adult is watching with him. ``He interacts very
well with the TV,'' she said. ``He sees someone fall down, he falls
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Teletubbies,'' a British import on PBS featuring a group of
cooing, brightly-colored creatures who babble baby talk, is the
only show on American television specifically made for children
under the age of 3. It was developed by an educational television
producer and a speech pathologist; nonetheless, many pediatricians
see little merit in it for very young viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't put it on in order to attract a younger and younger
audience,'' said John Wilson, senior vice president for programming
for PBS. ``But we know from research that there is an audience of
children under 2 watching television, for better or for worse, and
at least we have something on the air that is developmentally
appropriate for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Himself the parent of a 4 1/2-year-old son and a 9-month-old
daughter, Wilson said many families where both parents work might
be helped by ``taking this information to whoever is watching their
child during the day, and letting them know they should find
something else to do besides watch TV.``
</P>
<P>
   Brown Johnson, senior vice president for Nick Jr., the preschool
programming segments of the children's network Nickelodeon, said
she favored any policy that encouraged parents to spend time with
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television or videos will be used in some form, to give
parents a break to make dinner or whatever, so I'm not sure it's
realistic to say no television ever,'' she said. ``But if the AAP
has to make this kind of a declaration to have people really sit up
and listen, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy spent more than two years developing the latest
policy statement, which was approved by its board of directors in
May, but it has been involved in research and communications about
media influences on children for much longer. In 1990, it issued a
recommendation that older children not watch more than one to two
hours of ``quality'' television per day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1997, it began a ``Media Matters'' campaign to educate
pediatricians and the public about how media can influence
children, positively as well as negatively. For example, studies
have show that programs about the effects of substance abuse or
tobacco can influence adolescent behavior for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is clear that media use can have an effect on
children's overall health _ physical, mental, emotional,'' said
Vicky Rideout of the Kaiser Family Foundation in Menlo Park,
Calif., which has done studies on these subjects. ``To my knowledge
this is the first time such a clear blueprint has been laid out for
a pro-active role on the part of individual doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs, a nonprofit research group in Washington, D.C., agreed
that the delineating of specific recommendations for pediatricians
to give parents was a new step for the pediatric group, despite its
decade-old interest in the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a drive by health professionals to view
certain social problems as public health problems,'' he said,
noting also the Centers for Disease Control's recent efforts to
treat gun use as a public health issue.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It does make me a little nervous, people with
scientific credentials getting involved in social science issues,
but there is a lot of very good social science that watching TV
does have some potential to cause harm to kids, and people need to
realize what harm it might be doing to their child. It's not a bad
thing for health professionals to remind parents that they need to
be aware of the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're worried about what your kid eats, you should worry
about what your kid's watching.''

HOUSE AND SENATE REPUBLICANS WORK ON TAX CUT
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd Take is scheduled to by by 10 p.m. ET)  
(nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders struggled Tuesday to put
together a tax-cutting package acceptable to their members in both
the House and the Senate, and were moving toward a new approach to
reducing income tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders met through the day and late into the night behind
closed doors as they tried to reconcile the differing tax bills
passed in the last two weeks by the House and the Senate. The
Republicans said they were intent on completing work Tuesday night
and pushing the final version of their $792 billion tax-cut plan
through both chambers by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever bill emerges from Congress faces a veto by President
Clinton. He says the Republican plan would risk a return of federal
budget deficits, disproportionately favor the wealthy and leave too
little money for Medicare, the military, education and a variety of
other programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the immediate problem facing the Republicans on Tuesday
night was coming up with a package that would hold their own party
together.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, the leadership seemed ready to scrap the approaches
to income tax cuts contained in the House and Senate bills. The
House bill had called for a reduction in all income tax rates of 10
percent. The Senate bill had called for the lowest income tax rate
of 15 percent to be reduced to 14 percent, and for the new 14
percent bracket to be extended to higher income levels.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the House and Senate negotiators were considering an
approach that would reduce each of the income tax rates by 1
percentage point. The current 15 percent rate, for example, would
drop to 14 percent, while the 28 percent rate would fall to 27
percent and the top rate of 39.6 percent would become 38.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators tentatively agreed to phase out the inheritance
tax levied on large estates, a priority for many Republicans in the
House. And they were likely to agree on a reduction in the top rate
on capital gains to 15 percent from 20 percent, members of both
parties said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a package would win strong support from conservative
Republicans. But some of the provisions under consideration _
particularly the 1 percentage point reduction in all income tax
rates _ alienated some moderate Republicans in the Senate, raising
questions about whether the party would have enough votes to pass
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things aren't looking very good from our perspective, and our
understanding is that other moderates are having similar
problems,'' said Nicholas J. Graham, a spokesman for Sen. John H.
Chafee, a moderate Republican from Rhode Island who backs a smaller
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to several of the four Democrats who had voted for the
Republican bill in the Senate said they would also have trouble
with any new plan that reduced all income tax rates, since such an
approach would give a bigger tax cut to those in upper income
brackets than to those in lower brackets.

TRANSLATING A LANGUAGE OF ECSTASY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The slightly mad find their most eloquent spokesmen in the ranks
of the eminently sane. That, at least, is the subtext of a
remarkable new recording of Scriabin's music by Pierre Boulez and
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   On this Deutsche Grammophon CD, Boulez conducts ``The Poem of
Ecstasy,'' the Piano Concerto and ``Prometheus: The Poem of Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Music of sensual extravagance is subjected to minute examination
and emerges even more sensual and extravagant than before. Here is
indirect proof that Scriabin's ravings, like Messiaen's religious
deliriums, are founded not on raving or delirium but on
sophisticated and original grammars.
</P>
<P>
   After Scriabin's death in 1915, Soviet scholars worked hard to
decode what they felt was a systematic harmonic language on a par
with Schoenberg's. Messiaen's numerical orderings of rhythm, often
derived from Eastern music, are perhaps best described by an
arithmetician. Yet in both cases, the results float free of any
explanation of them. Experience the beauty; investigating the
method can come later.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has watched Boulez rehearse knows that he says little
but, using hands and eyes, conveys precise messages. His conducting
is a mysterious code all its own, but orchestra players understand
it perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Known earlier for a clinician's musicality, Boulez's
performances have in the last 10 years taken on a wonderful
humanity to go with the elegance and dignity. The bodily gestures
indicate rhythm, tempo and phrase length with a clarity that
comforts players in the midst of difficult music. Freed from the
anxiety of guesswork (the kind that, paradoxically, urged Bernstein
and Furtwangler performances to an edge-of-the-seat intensity),
orchestra musicians have perhaps more opportunity to respond within
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It is, after all, the musicians, not the conductor, who play
espressivo, and I think this conductor knows it.
</P>
<P>
   High trumpets drive Scriabin's orchestra, and the Chicago
Symphony has splendid ones. No ear-splitting self-aggrandizement
here. If for too many years the Chicago brass section has read its
admiring press notices and responded loudly to them, there is in
this recording almost a reverence before music and conductor.
Vulgarity becomes unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in spirit, ``The Poem of Ecstasy'' has a drunkenness about
it. Scriabin urged a friend to listen while ``looking into the eye
of the sun.'' Intended to celebrate the creator's sensations at the
moment of creation, these surging upward sequences sound as much
physical as spiritual, especially as the shuddering, exhausted,
almost postcoital treble figures fall away from peaks of activity.
</P>
<P>
   Creation was godlike in Scriabin's view, and his increasing
association of himself with godliness traced a descent (or was it
an ascent?) from everyday ideas of sanity. Interestingly, ``The
Poem of Ecstasy,'' written in Russia, had its premiere in New York,
a performance conducted by Modest Altschuler in 1908.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prometheus,'' with its elaborate piano part, comes two years
later and with many more ambitions attached. There are the bigness
of the orchestra and the wordless surge of choral singing at the
end. There is also color: a scheme to bathe the concert hall with
changing light patterns.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Prometheus,'' the breathing pattern of the cosmos is
traced; the material dematerialized to spirit. One wonders at the
grandness of the thinking and the myriad of detail. But I wonder
whether ``The Poem of Ecstasy'' is not the more immediate and
compelling work.
</P>
<P>
   Lost masterpieces of the repertory for piano and orchestra do
exist. One is Scriabin's F sharp minor Concerto; another, the
Franck ``Symphonic Variations.'' Maybe both pieces are too short
for the uses of a solo appearance and thus not career-friendly to
ambitious pianists. It is a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The concerto's dancing finale hops and skips in excitable
Scriabinesque fashion. The first movement dawdles exquisitely and
drips with ornament. The Andante is languid, quiet and dreamlike,
with a folkish tinge. A certain innocence suffuses this work by a
25-year-old. The sweet smell of corruption had yet to appear in his
musical life.
</P>
<P>
   Any pianist bored with the usual concerto repertory might give
both pieces a hard look. The Franck is moving, at times heroic; the
Scriabin, a charmer. For record buyers, previous contact with the
concerto and ``Prometheus'' has been most prominently provided by
Vladimir Ashkenazy, an often matter-of-fact virtuoso who plays
these pieces very well on Decca/London. Boulez's pianist, Anatol
Ugorski, is splendid: technically assured and musically affecting.
</P>
<P>
   Scriabin, decadent and delusional, and Messiaen, raptly
religious, are two very different souls who nevertheless share the
kind of unbridled and fearless emotionalism found rarely if at all
in other 20th-century music. Maybe Aretha Franklin or American
gospel music at its best comes close.
</P>
<P>
   As in science, this has been an era of musical exploration,
touched by coolness and control even in the extremes of its
pleasures and unhappinesses. In such an atmosphere the self-elected
god and the God-worshiper stand apart; self-possession
conspicuously deserts them. Or does it?
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, both men saw colors in music and established
systematic connections between tonalities or musical textures and
various shades of blue, red or yellow. Scriabin had a projection
machine in mind for ``Prometheus.'' It never worked properly, and
later attempts to modernize the concept have been interesting
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is best for us to imagine what the score means us to
see. That is perhaps what Messiaen achieves in his minute
descriptions of color combinations and patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The more important message, however, is that irrational beauty
is fleeting without workmanship. People who have never liked
Scriabin (and they are many) should listen to this extraordinary
recording. There is method in its madness.

</P>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Automakers dangled rebates in front of their customers
in July, and like fish to bait, buyers snapped up new cars and
trucks. That led to a brisk annual sales pace of 17 million
vehicles and kept the industry on track for a record-setting sales
year.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp., which was virtually shut down by a strike
in June and July last year, saw its sales jump 62.6 percent in July
compared with figures in the bleak period a year earlier. Car sales
jumped 68.2 percent, while sales of minivans, sport utility
vehicles and pickup trucks rose 57.2 percent. Part of the sales
increase was a result of generous rebates and discounted financing
deals that GM began offering July 15 on nearly every 1999 model.
The deals are good through September.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler sales rose 10.1 percent, with car sales plunging
14.6 percent while sales of sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks
and minivans increased 20.1 percent. Sales of its sport utility
vehicles rose 36 percent, and sales of the Jeep Grand Cherokee
jumped 62 percent after the company offered generous rebates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unquestionable that the industry is going to see a
record year,'' said James Holden, executive vice president for
sales and marketing at DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co.'s sales rose 1.4 percent in July compared with
figures in the period a year earlier, with car sales jumping 11.3
percent and sales of pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and
minivans dropping 4.8 percent. Figures exclude Volvo's car
operations, which Ford bought in March. During last year's strike,
GM had low truck stockpiles, so many buyers chose Ford trucks
instead. That artificially propped up Ford's truck sales last year,
making them hard to beat this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there are three major factors driving record
consumer demand in the U.S.,'' said Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice
president for marketing, sales and service. ``First, favorable
economic fundamentals. Second, prices for new cars and trucks have
been stable while incomes and household net wealth have increased.
Third, innovative products.''
</P>
<P>
   But the high level of rebates, which make cars cheaper for
consumers but less profitable for automakers, has worried some on
Wall Street along with auto analysts in Europe. Auto stocks plunged
last week after DaimlerChrysler reported that it spent more than
expected on incentives and cut into its second-quarter profits.
``Our stock price got slammed,'' Holden said. But he insisted that
whether incentives were offered to customers through rebates, cheap
lease deals, discounted financing rates or by forgoing price
increases, ``everybody's doing it in some fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   July's sales showed that the incentives are helping prop up the
market, analysts said. ``Pricing isn't great, but volume is,'' said
Nicholas Lobaccaro, an analyst at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the first quarter, for instance, DaimlerChrysler spent an
average of $1,284 a vehicle on rebates and other incentives, the
company's co-chairman, Robert Eaton, said last week. For the second
quarter, the company spent an average of $1,345. But by the end of
the second quarter, that figure had risen to $1,470, where Eaton
said he expected it to remain in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   GM refused to disclose how much it spent on incentives but
acknowledged that spending rose in the second quarter compared with
the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also refused to disclose per-vehicle incentive costs but
said that in the first quarter its total marketing costs in the
United States amounted to 10.9 percent of its gross revenue. In the
second quarter, marketing costs climbed slightly, to 11 percent of
gross revenue from 10.9 percent in the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   Each automaker blamed the others for high incentives and
insisted that it was spending less than its rivals. ``Our net price
retention has been higher than Ford or Chrysler,'' said Michael
DiGiovanni, executive director of GM's business decision support
center.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler disagrees. ``Our incentives for the Chrysler
brands are still significantly lower than our domestic competition
any way you cut it,'' said Holden, who added that by some
measurements Ford and GM incentives were $500 a vehicle higher than
his company's.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said that automakers had been unable to raise prices
and had even effectively lowered them by offering rebates because
there are more auto factories than demand for their products.
Despite the beginnings of a turnaround in Asia, ``it still is an
industry struggling with excess global capacity,'' said Diane
Swonk, chief economist at Bank One Corp. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said they were not too alarmed at the high level
of incentives because automakers are cutting costs enough to keep
their profits strong. ``Yes, incentives are higher than they've
ever been, but profitability per unit is higher than it has ever
been,'' said Wendy Beale Needham, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Other large automakers posted especially strong results.
Toyota's sales rose 13.8 percent; Honda's sales increased 7.9
percent, and Nissan Motor's sales jumped 14.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But a giant stumbled. GM's market share stalled again last
month, this time at 28.4 percent despite the company's generous
rebates. The results are particularly troubling because GM's
executives said they had been expecting better.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, GM chief financial officer J. Michael Losh
said the company's market share was poised to increase. It ended
the second quarter at 29.5 percent of the U.S. market, down 2.1
percentage points from the quarter a year earlier. But Losh noted
that the company's share had topped 30 percent in June. ``We expect
the share to continue to improve as we go through the balance of
the year,'' Losh said then.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it continued to slide.

A MONUMENTAL FILM SUDDENLY APPEARS BRIGHTER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frequently called one of the ``best films of all time,'' Jean
Renoir's ``Grand Illusion'' (``La Grande Illusion''), released in
1937, can be something of a surprise. Not that there is any
particular reason to dispute the ranking, but there is a
simplicity, if that's the word, and a kind of sprightly directness
that can be startling in a work deemed so towering.
</P>
<P>
   Or that is the impression one gets from a strikingly vivid,
newly subtitled restoration from Rialto Films now playing in
Manhattan. Renoir, the second son of the painter Pierre Auguste
Renoir and himself enshrined among the best directors ever, states
the objective in an introduction to a 1958 reissue of the film.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Grand Illusion' is a story about people like you or like
me caught in this horrible tragedy named war,'' he says in English.
He refers to the First World War, whose billing as the last of such
conflicts certainly served as an illusion. Renoir moves on to class
divisions and ethnic hatred. ``It is also a story about human
relationships,'' he says. ``Such a question is so important that if
we don't solve it, we will just have to say goodbye to our
beautiful world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, two French officers, Lt. Marechal (Jean Gabin) and
Capt. de Boeldieu (Pierre Fresnay), are taken prisoner behind
German lines. There to greet them with luncheon and all the gallant
panache he reserves for fellows of the officer class, regardless of
whose side they're on, is the man who shot down their plane, Capt.
von Rauffenstein, portrayed with riveting brio by Erich von
Stroheim.
</P>
<P>
   Monocles affixed, Von Rauffenstein and Boeldieu, played with a
perfect urbanity by Fresnay, bow slightly to each other. At table
the German says he knew a Count Boeldieu in Berlin before the war,
this Boeldieu's cousin. Formally, of course, the two remain
adversaries and deadly ones. Eventually von Rauffenstein will shoot
Boeldieu during an escape attempt and then attend him with much
regret on his deathbed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, attachments are forming on the other side of the
class divide. Marechal, portrayed by Gabin with a plain, warm
masculinity, is a working man with an officer's commission.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal, an officer played by Marcel Dalio, is the son of a
Jewish banking family in Paris and, later, when the French officers
are assigned to a prison camp, the recipient of packages of elegant
foods from home. He shares these with the others, regularly setting
out a spread that rivals civilian fare.
</P>
<P>
   Renoir's approach to Rosenthal's Jewishness in many ways defines
the film's greatness. In the late '30s, anti-Semitism was rampant
in France, and it is said by film historians that the director
wanted to antagonize the right by creating a sympathetic Jewish
character.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he saddles Rosenthal with a stereotypical
Jewish lineage, opening the character (and Renoir) to attack. But
Rosenthal, played knowingly by Dalio, who was Jewish and often had
Jewish roles, stands the test. Late in the film, the prisoners are
transferred to a castle commanded by von Rauffenstein. Having been
shot down himself, the captain is now confined to his famous back
and neck brace. (His white gloves, sometimes mistaken for a symbol
of class, are actually to protect his burned hands.)
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in large part to Rosenthal's bravery and cleverness, he
and Marechal escape and make a run for the Swiss border. On the way
Rosenthal falters and they quarrel. ``I never could stomach Jews,''
Marechal cries. ``A bit late to realize that,'' the distraught
Rosenthal yells back. It is a heartbreaking moment between two men
who have risked much together. Marechal walks away but then returns
to Rosenthal, who sits sobbing and defiant, and gently pulls him to
his feet. They sheepishly console each other and trudge on.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazis hated the movie (Joseph Goebbels declared it ``cinema
enemy No. 1'') and not only because of its positive view of
Rosenthal. They also detested Stroheim, who was not born, as many
supposed, into Prussian nobility but to a Jewish hatter in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, after the Second World War, a reissue of the film also
upset the French. In ``Grand Illusion'' the Germans aren't so bad
at all: they allow Rosenthal and others their provisions from home
and, though they routinely shoot escapees, they're reasonable about
the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some scenes cut,'' said Lenny Borger, a translator
who subtitled the new version of the film. ``The good Hun and all
that. A Communist critic objected that this wasn't a film to
release after Auschwitz and the German occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics and audiences have always liked the film, which
seemed to have views and positions enough for everybody.
``Right-wing critics liked it, left-wing critics liked it, but you
wouldn't think they were watching the same film,'' Borger said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1937 ``Grand Illusion'' was already a period piece about
another war and era. ``We must not forget that in 1914 there was no
Hitler,'' Renoir says in his prelude to the film's 1958 release.
``It was almost a war of gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the arena of class distinctions the film takes on the air of
a fraternity house, with gangs of men consorting and cheerily
grousing, jauntily digging an escape tunnel like rascally
schoolboys being naughty after lights out, bursting into song, and
even staging a musical.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, social divisions are sharply drawn between the
aristocracy and, as von Rauffenstein archly puts it to Boeldieu,
``happy gifts of the French Revolution'' like Marechal and
Rosenthal. In its mixture of classes, ``Grand Illusion'' was a
challenge for Borger, an American who lives in Paris and subtitles
many films. ``As soon as they open their mouths, they type
themselves socially,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand Illusion'' is beautifully written and the characters
usually speak slowly. There are times, however, when one
interpretation would make more sense to an English-speaking
audience than another. ``Marechal's French is extremely working
class, which is virtually untranslatable,'' Borger said. ``You have
to adapt or you lose the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while after World War II, ``Grand Illusion'' itself was if
not lost, then unaccounted for. When the Nazis invaded Paris, the
original camera negative of the film (the one that went through the
camera) was confiscated and sent to the Reichsfilmarchiv in Berlin.
In 1945, the Russians took possession of the negative and kept it
for years.
</P>
<P>
   As is common, however, other film elements cropped up elsewhere.
Where the 1946 release came from is unknown. Renoir put together
his 1958 version from a variety of materials, including another
negative turned up by an American Army captain.
</P>
<P>
   The film at Lincoln Plaza is made from the original negative,
which the Russians, it seems, had returned it to the French in the
mid-60s without anyone realizing what was in the film cans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks pretty pristine,'' said Bruce Goldstein, president of
Rialto and programming director of Film Forum, who oversaw the
restoration with Canal Plus, a French cable network. That sort of
quality is most unusual.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, prints of films were often made directly from
camera negatives _ so often, in fact, that the process wore out the
originals and they were destroyed. ``For a film of this stature to
have a camera negative exist is unique,'' he said.

A MAJORITY OVER 45 SAY SEX LIVES ARE JUST FINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new survey finds that more than half of Americans
45 or over say they are satisfied with their sex lives, but that
sexual activity and contentment diminish with age, largely because
of declining health and the loss of partners.
</P>
<P>
   The survey shows a ``partner gap'' that grows as people age:
While 84 percent of the men and 78 percent of the women in the
45-to-59 age group have sexual partners, only 58 percent of the men
and just 21 percent of the women 75 or older do.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted among Americans 45 and older for AARP,
formerly the American Association of Retired Persons. AARP
officials declared that it shattered many of the stereotypes of
aging and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest myth out there is that old people don't have sex,
aren't interested in sex,'' said Hugh Delehanty, editor in chief of
Modern Maturity, the group's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the survey found, two-thirds of those with partners
reported that they were satisfied with their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the men and women 45 to 59 reported having sexual
intercourse about once a week or more. In the 60-to-74 age group,
that dropped to 31 percent of the men and 24 percent of the women.
And among those 75 or older, where the partner gap is biggest, it
dropped to 19 percent of the men and 7 percent of the women.
</P>
<P>
   Still, among those who did have partners, more than a fourth of
the oldest respondents _ 75 and up _ reported having sexual
intercourse once a week.
</P>
<P>
   For many women, sex lives end when their husbands die, but, the
research suggested, this may change as the baby boomers age. The
survey found that baby boomers were significantly more accepting of
sex outside marriage, which ``may portend less acceptance of
abstinence among today's midlife men and women as they age and lose
their partners,'' the researchers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Sex in general tended to be more important to men than to women,
the researchers said, but those gender differences were more marked
among the respondents over 60 than among the boomers. Among women
75 or over, 36 percent said they ``would be quite happy never
having sex again''; just 5 percent of the men in this age group
reported feeling that way.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of the women in the 75-and-up group said
they had experienced no sexual kissing or hugging in the previous
six months, and more than half said they no longer had sexual
thoughts. Still, only 12 percent agreed with the statement ``Sex is
only for younger people.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 26 percent of the men acknowledged being completely or
moderately impotent, but that percentage rose significantly with
age. Thirty-nine percent of the men 60 to 74 reported that they
were moderately or completely impotent; 57 percent of the men 75 or
older said they were, including 38 percent who said they were
completely impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of treatments for sexual dysfunction is
growing, only a minority of those suffering from impotence said
they were seeking help. Forty-one percent said they had sought
treatment from a medical professional, and 25 percent said they had
used drugs or treatments to enhance performance, including 15
percent who said they had used Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted by mail in March by National Family
Opinion Research Inc. and was based on questionnaires completed by
a representative sample of 1,384. The overall findings had a margin
of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points,
although the sampling error was bigger for age and gender
subgroups.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that while sex is important to older Americans,
a good relationship is even more so. Nine in 10 of both men and
women said a good relationship with a spouse or another partner was
important to their quality of life, while 67 percent of the men and
57 percent of the women said a satisfying sexual relationship was.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that contrary to the notion that youth
equals sexual appeal, a majority of men who have partners find them
physically attractive, and that the percentage increases with age.
</P>
<P>
   AARP officials released their poll today with a clear appeal to
the aging baby boomers, unveiling the latest issue of Modern
Maturity, which features a photograph of 52-year-old Susan Sarandon
under this headline: ``Great Sex. What's Age Got to Do With It?''

<P>
   Children under 2 years old should not watch television, older
children should not have television sets in their bedrooms, and
pediatricians should have parents fill out a ``media history,''
along with a medical history, on office visits, according to
recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that television viewing can affect the mental, social and
physical health of young people, the academy for the first time has
laid out a plan for how pediatricians and parents can deal with
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``As pediatricians, we are taking all the research concerns into
account, and trying to raise the bar a bit, as suggestions for
optimal parenting,'' said Dr. Marjorie Hogan, the lead author of
the report, which appears in the August issue of Pediatrics
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   No reliable research has been done on how television viewing
affects children younger than 2, Dr. Hogan said. But the Academy
based its recommendations for such children on knowledge of what
babies need for proper brain development _ notably close-up
interaction with older people _ and the common-sense notion that,
if they are watching television, babies are not getting those other
essential stimuli.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in movies and television has been linked to violent
behavior in young people in studies by the American Medical
Association, the American Psychological Association, the American
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the National
Institute of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   So while the academy may appear to be venturing into
sociological territory with little direct connection to medical
health issues, the study's authors say the influence of mass media
is a major public health concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, media violence,'' said Dr. Miriam Baron,
chairwoman of the academy's committee on public education, which
wrote the policy. ``A bullet in the body is a physical health
issue. Children who spend a lot of time in front of the TV set tend
to gain weight; obesity is a physical health issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Academy is distributing to its members a sample ``media
history'' checklist for their young patients. It includes questions
about movies, video and computer games, music videos and the
Internet, as well as about the radio and books.
</P>
<P>
   Also available to the 55,000 members are brochures explaining
the positive and negative influences that media can have on
children, with suggestions about how to guide families toward
positive uses, including critical discussion on what they watch. To
encourage such talk, the Academy suggests that televisions and
computers not be kept in children's bedrooms but in common rooms,
where parents can monitor and participate in children's use of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The policy's main purpose, the authors said, is to encourage
pediatricians and their patients to learn about and discuss the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents interviewed Tuesday agreed that television's
influence was a proper concern for pediatricians, but that it was
unrealistic to set arbitrary limits, and unnecessary for doctors to
intervene unless a child already had social or emotional problems
that might be related to media exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the theory, but practically I think it's not very
doable,'' said Lari Mills of Nashville, Tenn., who has an
8-month-old baby as well as a 7-year-old and a 9-year-old. ``The
little one is often around the TV when the older ones are watching,
but he's not really watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Valerie Barney said her 2-year-old son watches
``Barney'' and ``The Teletubbies'' on PBS, and she sees no harm in
it as long as an adult is watching with him. ``He interacts very
well with the TV,'' she said. ``He sees someone fall down, he falls
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Teletubbies,'' a British import on PBS featuring a group of
cooing, brightly-colored creatures who babble baby talk, is the
only show on American television specifically made for children
under the age of 3. It was developed by an educational television
producer and a speech pathologist; nonetheless, many pediatricians
see little merit in it for very young viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't put it on in order to attract a younger and younger
audience,'' said John Wilson, senior vice president for programming
for PBS. ``But we know from research that there is an audience of
children under 2 watching television, for better or for worse, and
at least we have something on the air that is developmentally
appropriate for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Himself the parent of a 4 1/2-year-old son and a 9-month-old
daughter, Wilson said many families where both parents work might
be helped by ``taking this information to whoever is watching their
child during the day, and letting them know they should find
something else to do besides watch TV.``
</P>
<P>
   Brown Johnson, senior vice president for Nick Jr., the preschool
programming segments of the children's network Nickelodeon, said
she favored any policy that encouraged parents to spend time with
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television or videos will be used in some form, to give
parents a break to make dinner or whatever, so I'm not sure it's
realistic to say no television ever,'' she said. ``But if the AAP
has to make this kind of a declaration to have people really sit up
and listen, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy spent more than two years developing the latest
policy statement, which was approved by its board of directors in
May, but it has been involved in research and communications about
media influences on children for much longer. In 1990, it issued a
recommendation that older children not watch more than one to two
hours of ``quality'' television per day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1997, it began a ``Media Matters'' campaign to educate
pediatricians and the public about how media can influence
children, positively as well as negatively. For example, studies
have show that programs about the effects of substance abuse or
tobacco can influence adolescent behavior for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is clear that media use can have an effect on
children's overall health _ physical, mental, emotional,'' said
Vicky Rideout of the Kaiser Family Foundation in Menlo Park,
Calif., which has done studies on these subjects. ``To my knowledge
this is the first time such a clear blueprint has been laid out for
a pro-active role on the part of individual doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs, a nonprofit research group in Washington, D.C., agreed
that the delineating of specific recommendations for pediatricians
to give parents was a new step for the pediatric group, despite its
decade-old interest in the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a drive by health professionals to view
certain social problems as public health problems,'' he said,
noting also the Centers for Disease Control's recent efforts to
treat gun use as a public health issue.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It does make me a little nervous, people with
scientific credentials getting involved in social science issues,
but there is a lot of very good social science that watching TV
does have some potential to cause harm to kids, and people need to
realize what harm it might be doing to their child. It's not a bad
thing for health professionals to remind parents that they need to
be aware of the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're worried about what your kid eats, you should worry
about what your kid's watching.''

UAW TO SEEK STRIKE VOTE AUG. 17 AT ALL FORD PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Seeking to reassure its members that it is taking a
hard line in labor talks, the United Automobile Workers union plans
to hold strike authorization votes at all Ford Motor Co. factories
on Aug. 17, in preparation for the Sept. 14 expiration of national
contracts with all automakers here.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW holds such votes every three years at all the auto
factories it represents, just in case union leaders need to call a
national strike if negotiators fail to conclude new national
contracts. A strike this year seems unlikely, most labor and auto
officials here say.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unusual for the union to hold all of its strike
authorization votes at an automaker on a single day, and it is
particularly unusual for this symbolic show of union displeasure to
occur at Ford, which has long had the best labor relations in the
industry. Though similar votes are planned at all General Motors
factories and most DaimlerChrysler factories, local union leaders
at these automakers have been asked to hold them as close as
possible to Aug. 17 but not necessarily on that day, union
officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   The unhappiness with Ford reflects anger at the company as well
as divisions within the union itself. The UAW is split over the
extent to which it should try to block Ford from spinning off its
auto parts operations, as GM did. The union's national leadership
is showing more interest in a compromise than the union officials
dealing directly with Ford, who favor taking a hard line. Ford's
auto parts workers and their factory-level union leaders worry that
a separate company would someday try to pay lower wages.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant to raise workers' expectations that the union can
block a spinoff, the national leadership has presented the strike
authorization votes Aug. 17 as a way to show support for the entire
negotiating agenda at Ford, which also includes issues like job
security and prescription drug benefits. But lower-level officials
at Ford factories have presented the votes as a way to protest the
planned spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   Ford executives say they will be put at a competitive
disadvantage if they cannot spin off the auto parts unit, which is
called Visteon Automotive Systems. GM spun off its auto parts unit,
Delphi Automotive Systems, in May, and Delphi has already had some
success in winning contracts from other automakers that had
previously been leery of buying parts from a GM subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The disposal of Delphi allows GM to concentrate its investments
on new vehicle models and may eventually give GM access to
lower-cost parts. Delphi, which continues to sell most of its
output to GM, is likely to hire future workers at much lower wages,
although workers originally hired by GM have been promised that
they will keep their current wages, at least for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of auto parts workers, unionized or not,
typically earn much less than auto assembly workers. Only Ford has
a contract that requires it to pay parts workers as much as
assembly workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has been in negotiations to acquire Lear Corp., one of the
nation's largest seat manufacturers, people close to the talks have
said. By combining Lear with Visteon, Ford could create an auto
parts giant with enough revenue to invest in the design of new auto
parts and the construction of new factories.
</P>
<P>
   GM is likely to benefit from the increasingly thorny issues at
Ford. That is because UAW president Stephen Yokich says he will
negotiate a pact first with whichever automaker is most ready to
reach a deal, and will then demand that the other automakers accept
the same terms. DaimlerChrysler is unlikely to be chosen first
because the union is not entirely comfortable with the company's
new German leaders.

 Talk Not Cheap on S.F. Cells  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Bay Area residents already pay the highest prices for gasoline,
homes and even milk. Now it seems those of us who use our cell
phones a lot pay more than people in most other major cities.
<P>
   A new national survey ranks San Francisco among the most
expensive places to have a wireless phone and found that customers
here who buy the largest ``buckets'' of minutes pay some of the
highest rates in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco consumers who use between 600 and 1,500 minutes of
talk time per month pay an average of $117.27, according to Econ
One Research, a Los Angeles economic research firm. Only heavy cell
phone users in Los Angeles and Boston pay more _ $120.69 and
$117.32, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   And those who talk the most pay the most. The survey found that
users who buy 1,500 minutes per month pay an average of $170.61 _
the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   With rampant competition among the Bay Area's five major
wireless carriers, consumers may be confused about why we pay so
much for service. The answer is that we're willing to fork over the
dough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets in California tend to be populated by people who
are more mobile, so there's a higher demand for mobile service,''
said Charles Mahla, a senior economist with Econ One. Because
demand is so high, Mahla said, wireless carriers can charge a
premium for service.
</P>
<P>
   And the high rates don't just apply to heavy users. Econ One
also ranked wireless service among more-typical users _ those who
buy between 30 minutes and 600 minutes per month.
</P>
<P>
   Most customers use between 300 to 400 minutes per month,
according to industry statistics, and even those users pay higher
rates. San Franciscans pay an average of $47.48 per month _ the
fourth-highest amount in the nation. Customers in Los Angeles,
Boston and Detroit pay more, while wireless users in Sacramento pay
the cheapest rates of the 14 cities surveyed _ $40.58 per month.
</P>
<P>
   While no one disputes that rates here are high, some industry
experts faulted the study for failing to differentiate between
plans that offer a single, flat rate without long-distance charges.
</P>
<P>
   Many wireless carriers, such as Sprint PCS and GTE Wireless,
sell customers buckets of minutes that can be used anytime,
anyplace. Jeffrey Goldberg, senior editor of a Web site that tracks
wireless carriers, said it's important to make a distinction
between flat-rate plans and regular plans when comparing prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flat-rate plans give you a lot more value for the dollar,''
said Goldberg of Point.com.
</P>
<P>
   So while $170 per month for 1,500 minutes may seem high, that
plan may actually include free long-distance, which would make it
more valuable, Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   And while San Francisco's prices may seem high, wireless prices
have actually been falling during over  &LR; the past few years. The
introduction of digital phones and personal communications services
(PCS) has brought about a dramatic drop in per-minute rates.
</P>
<P>
   On average, rates today are about half 50 percent  &LR; of what they
were just four years ago, according to the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   And rates continue are continuing  &LR; to fall, though at a slower
pace, said Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Still, San Francisco will probably always pay slightly higher
prices than other cities because of the region's topography,
density and demand.
</P>
<P>
   With so much hilly terrain, cellular carriers must build more
wireless towers than in some  &LR; other, flatter areas. And with so
many people trying to use their cell phones at the same time,
carriers must make sure their systems can handle the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Building out cell sites to handle the usage costs money, and the
carriers pass those costs along to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some some cities cost less to serve because they're flat,''
Goldberg said. ``That's not going to change in San Francisco unless
you flatten the city.''
</P>
<P>
   And wireless carriers say higher prices in San Francisco are a
reflection of the cost of living here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area is a little more expensive for just about
everything, so it probably falls in line with wireless prices as
well,'' said Erin Eggleton, a spokeswoman for Cellular One. ``But
what you see if you look over time is that prices have gone down
dramatically, especially now that we have five carriers in the
market.''

A PLEA OF GUILTY IN OLYMPIC SCANDAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Utah businessman pleaded guilty Tuesday in federal court to a
misdemeanor tax violation in the first criminal case to result from
the investigation into whether vote buying was involved in Salt
Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   David E. Simmons, 41, the former chairman and chief executive of
Keystone Communications, appeared before U.S. Magistrate Ronald N.
Boyce in Salt Lake City. He admitted helping the son of an
influential International Olympic Committee member, Kim Un-Yong of
South Korea, obtain lawful permanent resident status by providing a
fraudulent job at Simmons' communications company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I included in a tax return for Keystone Communications salary
for a relative and I knew it false,'' Simmons said. ``The purported
salary was not genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   The name of Kim's son was not disclosed by the Justice
Department, but an ethics report filed last winter by the Salt Lake
Olympic Committee said Simmons helped set up the job for Kim's son,
John Kim.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake City bid committee used a highly organized
gift-giving campaign to court IOC members who would vote on the
site of the Winter Games. The inducements included money, gifts,
junkets, tuition payments and reimbursement for shopping sprees.
Salt Lake City was awarded the Games, which it had been seeking
since 1966, in a June 1995 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake City scandal has led to the expulsion or
resignation of 10 members of the International Olympic Committee
and undermined the committee's credibility. The committee has
recently taken steps that it said would reform the site-selection
process.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Simmons said he entered a series of bogus
contracts and created phony invoices to hide the fact that the IOC
member's son was being paid by the Salt Lake City bid committee.
Simmons said that the goal was to enhance Salt Lake City's Olympic
prospects and that he was urged to make the arrangement by the bid
committee president at the time, Thomas K. Welch.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our efforts to assist Kim, and to receive reimbursement for
his salary costs, we complied with the requests of Kim, Kim's
attorneys and Welch that resulted in incorrect and misleading
statements and agreements,'' Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Welch's lawyer, Tom Schaffer, denied that Welch was involved
with the scheme. ``Nobody was telling somebody to falsify a tax
return,'' Schaffer said in a telephone interview. He also said that
neither he nor Welch had spoken with government investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Kim family also disputed Simmons allegations in
a statement, though he said he had not seen the plea agreement.
``Reports of the facts supporting that plea, however, appear to be
inconsistent with statements attributed to Mr. Simmons in prior
official reports,'' said the lawyer, Howard Graff.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Un-Yong, a member of the IOC's ruling executive board and
president of an international confederation of Olympic sports, has
denied any wrongdoing in the Salt Lake City scandal. He was issued
a severe warning by the IOC but was not expelled from the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake Organizing Committee also tried to distance itself
from the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have stated over the past six months, we are a different
organization with a different mission from the former bid
committee,'' the committee said in a statement. ``We have
cooperated in this investigation and await its complete
resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The tax charge that Simmons pleaded guilty to carries a maximum
penalty of one year in prison and a $10,000 fine. Information filed
with the charge said Simmons caused Keystone Communications to
submit a 1992 tax return that falsely deducted John Kim's salary as
a business expense. Simmons agreed to cooperate with the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Myron Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman, called Tuesday's
charge ``the first arising out of an ongoing investigation,'' which
began last December and now includes investigators from the Justice
Department, FBI, IRS and Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme began in the summer of 1990 with an agreement between
Simmons and an officer of the Olympic bid committee, according to
court papers filed by the Justice Department, which did not
identify the principals. Simmons, however, said the deal was
arranged by Welch, the bid committee's president until 1997, when
he resigned in the wake of spouse-abuse charges.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons also named both Kims. John Kim was hired as manager for
Asian operations by Keystone in 1990 at a salary of $50,000, which
was raised to $70,383 in 1992.

 Whole Earth Mum About Theft of PC With Members' Credit Card Data  &HT;     By Tom Stein

A personal computer containing credit card information for
thousands of members of the Well online service apparently has been
stolen.
<P>
   Whole Earth Networks Inc., a Vancouver, Wash., Internet service
provider, said in a statement that there was a ``physical breach''
at its branch office in San Francisco and that a computer carrying
credit card information was removed from the premises.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,700 of the Well's 7,000 members use Whole Earth's
services to log on to the Internet. The credit card numbers were
used to bill these members on a monthly basis. Credit card
information for non-Well accounts was on the computer as well.
</P>
<P>
   Whole Earth stressed that the computer was physically taken from
the office and that the break-in was not the result of online
hacking. The company said that the credit card information was
encrypted and that so far no fraudulent activity has been reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not received any reports from any customer that their
credit card has actually been compromised,'' the company said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   News of the theft first leaked out on one of the Well's online
message boards.
</P>
<P>
   Some Well members last week received telephone calls from their
banks informing them of the incident. They then shared that
information online with other Well members.
</P>
<P>
   Whole Earth had contacted its credit card processors before
informing its customers. The banks, in turn, contacted some
customers directly.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Williams, executive director of the Well, said members are
concerned about the incident but are not overreacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some concerned customers, but this is not generating
the kind of concern we get when one of our e-mail servers go
down,'' she said. ``To our members, everything else in the world
pales in comparison to losing their e-mail connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Ross, vice president of development at Salon.com, which
owns the The  &LR; Well, said customers who are worried can have new
credit cards issued to them.
</P>
<P>
   Whole Earth has not provided any details about the theft,
specifically when it occurred and whether there are any suspects.
Surprisingly, the company has not reported the incident to San
Francisco police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think its unusual that if someone broke into the
building and stole something, the company would not report it, at
least for the sake of insurance,'' said DeWayne Tully, a spokesman
for the San Francisco Police Department. ``Sounds like this is
something the company is trying to take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Whole Earth declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he was unaware that Whole Earth did not contact the
police. ``This may be an issue we raise with them, but how Whole
Earth handles a situation that happens on their property is up to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, customers can sign up for a package that includes
membership to the Well and ISP service from Whole Earth. But
Williams said that arrangement will be discontinued at the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
   She said that decision is unrelated to the theft, but added that
she is sorry the relationship is ending on a downbeat note.

   ``My children used to tease me,'' Evelyn Hannon said the other
day from her office in Toronto. ```Digitally deficient,' they
called me. Well, not anymore, ha-ha-ha.''
</P>
<P>
   To see why she allows herself this little chuckle, call up her
Web site, www.journeywoman.com. A lot of women are now traveling
alone _ for business, pleasure and, increasingly, a combination of
the two.
</P>
<P>
   And while some airlines and a few other corporate services have
put up Web sites to appeal to female travelers, Ms. Hannon is way
out front with Journeywoman, a Web site and electronic magazine
that went on line two years ago and now is able to attract major
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is clogged with commercial hype and bald-faced
hucksterism. But one of its sturdier glories is that a determined
low-budget entrepreneur like Ms. Hannon can emerge as a significant
force by taking a singularly good idea and applying intelligence,
diligence and focus to make it work. As an exercise in comparison,
peruse Journeywoman, and then call up one of the few other online
sites for female travelers. Not to pick on Delta Air Lines, which
at least is making an effort in the field, but compare
Journeywoman.com to Delta's Executive Woman's Travel Network site
at www.delta-air.com/womenexecs. Not even a close call, right?
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 travelers from the United States, Canada and many
other nations have visited Journeywoman since it went on line. They
are attracted to its clear organization and no-nonsense
female-centered travel tips, consumer news, feature articles and
even classified ads. Enough of them are regular visitors that the
Indigo Books chain in Canada, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, a bank, a
couple of national tourist boards and an insurance company are
among its advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Feature articles in the current issue include one on how to deal
with medical problems while traveling abroad. Another has the
headline: ``Ms. Biz: Her Culturally Correct Food Facts.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a related Web site, www.HERmail.com, that allows female
travelers to seek advice one-on-one from other women in Ms.
Hannon's worldwide network of correspondents. ``For example,
someone might write, `I'm going to Tokyo and I have three business
meetings, but I'm really not sure what's appropriate to wear.'''
Ms. Hannon said. ``Well, one of our businesswomen in Japan will
reply with the correct information.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hannon, 59, has been traveling extensively since she was
divorced in the early 1980s. ``I'd come home and have notebooks
filled with tidbits of information from women I met while
traveling, including the growing numbers of businesswomen,'' she
recalled. She also collected names, addresses and phone numbers
that over the years helped her to build a network of hundreds of
women who traveled frequently and like to help one another out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I began, I wasn't thinking about making money at all.
Women are networkers, and that's what I was doing,'' she said.
After a while, she thought about organizing her network better. ''I
sent letters to about 100 women I had met around the world and
asked them to send me their best travel tips and travel stories. I
also asked them to forward my letter to other women travelers they
knew. I kind of collected this stuff, thinking maybe it would be a
book someday. But within a month, I was inundated with responses.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, she put out a printed newsletter, Journeywoman, with
the hope that it might become profitable someday. The first issue
had 20 pages _ no color _ and was mailed to 2,000 women. Within a
year, it had a circulation of 6,000 and was losing more money with
each issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting requests for subscriptions from places like Hong
Kong and Paris,'' she said. ''I wasn't making any money. In fact,
it was costing me a fortune for postage.''
</P>
<P>
   So, though she had no computer skills, she decided to take
Journeywoman on line. ''I thought, why not just take a chance and
step into the abyss. No one else was doing it, and I thought it
just might work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is profitable already. ``As soon as advertisers began seeing
that this was actually a juicy niche market, they came on,'' Ms.
Hannon said, adding: ``The basic idea just came from a female
thing. Women love to network with each other, and it was a matter
of harnessing that energy for travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Side Trips
</P>
<P>
   Frequent travelers who forget to check for hidden charges in
car-rental agreements can find annoying surprises at the return
counter. On Monday, at the Tampa, Fla., airport, a bill presented
after returning a car to the Avis Rent a Car counter included a 10
percent surcharge for a ``concession recovery fee,'' as well as a
surcharge of $2.05 a day for something listed as ``battery/tire''
and another 35 cents a day for ``vehicle license fee recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attempts to call the Avis customer-service ``800''
number listed on the bill for an explanation of these charges
proved fruitless because the line was always busy. Imagine, though,
a restaurant that tacked a surcharge onto your bill to help the
proprietors recover their expenses for paying rent and buying pots
and pans.

GROW A BUSINESS/PETER SINTON 
</HEADLINE>
 A BUSINESS _ SF CHRON   Resources for Starting a Web Firm 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: A friend and I are starting a service-based Web business. My
partner is a computer science major and knows all about building a
site. I am a business major but need information on legal issues
and getting advertisers to sponsor our site. I would appreciate any
advice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: We shopped your questions around the business-book circuit, and
Glenn E. Weadock, author of ``Small Business Networking for
Dummies'' (IDG Books), came up with a list of favorite books and
Web sites for ``Web-preneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   You might need some caffeine to get through all these titles:
``Building Successful Internet Businesses'' (Elderbrock and
Borwankar, IDG), ``Customers.com: How to Create a Profitable
Business Strategy for the Internet and Beyond'' (Seybold and
Marshak, Times Books), ``Cyberlaw: The Law of the Internet''
(Rosenoer, Springer/Verlag) and ``Software Development: A Legal
Guide'' (Fishman, Nolo Press).
</P>
<P>
   For online information, Weadock likes www.americanexpress. com.
(Go to ``Small Business Exchange.'') Also, check out
www.fastcompany.com and www.wired.com; both have lots of
information for emerging Web businesses. And of course, you can do
look up phrases such a ``small business'' and ``web-based'' on
search engines such as &LR;   &LR; www.av.com, www.go2net.com and
www.alltheweb.com.
</P>
<P>
   One nifty site for legal information is Mountain View's FindLaw,
which has a huge subject index and free legal library. Check out
the small-business section at www.findlaw.com.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe more important than anything you may read, Weadock notes,
is advice from people already in the game. E-mail any Web-preneurs
you learn about in cyberspace and politely ask their advice. Many
will be too busy to respond, but some certainly will. Go to a local
chamber of commerce meeting, and see if anyone in your local area
has already gone through what you're going through. You may even
find someone who might be interested in advertising on your site.
</P>
<P>
   One last bit of advice: Keep the day job, if you have one, at
least for a while. Startups need cash but seldom generate much
right away. You can decide when to shift over from moonlighting to
full-time work on your new venture when you feel it is generating
enough cash.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Marketing Mission
</P>
<P>
   Q: My passion is travel and culture, and I just quit my job as
an attorney to start a business importing the best quality,
high-end teak furniture from Indonesia. I have lined up a sum that
I think is adequate to fill two containers with quality goods. I've
got a customs broker and CPA, opened a business account and applied
for a seller's permit, had business cards printed, reserved a Web
site and am trying to join the San Francisco Furniture Mart. I even
read the Harmonized Schedule of Tariffs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the rather obvious problem: Who will buy my product? I
don't have the money to put into a storefront. I would like either
to rent space from an established furniture retailer or to consign
single items to higher-end shops. How do I contact these people and
get them to look at my product?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; A: Before taking a trip to Java, you might want to do a little
dialing for dealers. To find potential buyers for your teak
furniture, ``Guerrilla Marketing'' author Jay Levinson suggests
checking out retailers listed under the ``furniture'' heading in
local Yellow Page directories and phoning those that seem like a
potentially good match.
</P>
<P>
   Tell them that you have a furniture line that fits their
identity and that they can offer exclusively in their area. Be
prepared to meet with them, show them photographs and, best of all,
display your teak furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson says these retailers usually have a steady stream of
customers, a mailing list, a reputation and a desire to constantly
offer new lines to their clientele. But he stresses that
exclusivity is very important to many of them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're very motivated, you can offer to run a newspaper or
local magazine ad featuring your line of furniture and mentioning
their name. With an offer of free advertising like this, Levinson
says it will be hard for any retailer to resist carrying your line
so long as it is priced right.

A MOVEMENT MADE IN TAIWAN: MAKE TAIWAN THE 51ST STATE

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Even with all the various versions of ``state''
being bandied about in Taiwan these days, it still comes as a
surprise to hear someone actually talk about statehood. As in,
American statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Yet David Chou comes right out and says it: Taiwan should become
the 51st state of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chou is not joking. He has a plan. It may never work, but just
try telling Chou that. He has been working on it for years.
</P>
<P>
   Chou set up the 51 Club in 1994 to promote his idea. He admitted
51 members. But to him it is not a gimmick. It is a cause. With all
the confusing explanations that Taiwan's government puts forth
about whether it is part of China or something separate, Chou's
unusual proposal is refreshingly straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were a state, our most serious problem _ security _
would be solved,'' said Chou, 49, who looks and sounds considerably
more normal than his proposal might suggest. ``The current
government can't solve it; neither can the opposition. But
statehood can.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has been drowning in political debate since July 9, when
President Lee Teng-hui caused an uproar by saying that from now on
talks with China should be held on the basis of equal states, in a
``special state-to-state relationship.'' Beijing immediately
denounced Lee for trying to thwart China's reunification with the
island, while opinion polls in Taiwan show cautious support for
Lee's statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special state-to-state relations, yes, as a U.S. state,'' Chou
said. ``That's the only state we should want to be, the state of
Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Face facts, Chou says. Taiwan would not exist without the United
States. Ever since 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists
retreated to Taiwan after losing China's civil war to Mao Zedong's
Communists, they have survived by American protection, American
trade and the education of countless Taiwan students in American
universities.
</P>
<P>
   Chou argues that most people here, if given a choice, would
prefer to be American.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in Taiwan are embarrassed to say so,'' Chou
said, whispering conspiratorially. ``The government will never say
so. But it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Chou seems to fancy himself a visionary. He studied law in the
United States, but ended up as a businessman in the toy industry.
He seems fiercely committed to the idea of American statehood, but
is a bit weak on how to organize.
</P>
<P>
   He needs money, he acknowledges. So in July he set up a
foundation called the FormUSA Foundation _ a play on Taiwan's
earlier name, Formosa. So far, it has 18 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Communist Party started with 12,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Will it take as many decades to achieve his goal as it did for
Communist leaders to achieve theirs?
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely, Chou said, but exactly how long depends on Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the PLA has to do is lob a few missiles over, and people
will be swarming to us,'' he said, referring to the People's
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Chou lived and worked in New York, Pennsylvania and California
over a period of 10 years, and he fell in love with what he sees as
a reliable legal system and an open-minded society. His 6-year-old
son was born in the United States, and Chou has big plans for him,
as a naval officer and perhaps one day as commander of the U.S.
Pacific Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that his son has an American passport, giving the
family a measure of security while Chou carries a Taiwan passport
himself, has nothing to do with his efforts to try to get similar
security for his 23 million fellow citizens on Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of Taiwanese have reservations about this,'' he
said. ``They may worry that they'll lose their culture. But I tell
them, you can still eat rice, no one will force you to eat
hamburgers.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 23, when Richard Bush, an American special envoy, came
to Taiwan to meet Lee, Chou organized a tiny demonstration outside
the office that represents U.S. interests here and presented a
petition addressed to President Clinton and leading members of
Congress. It was accepted by Susan Stahl, an American official who
promised to forward it to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   More mainstream Taiwan residents, in random questioning, see the
idea as little more than a bad joke. The Government has yet to
dignify it with a comment. Chou said he thought the Taiwan press
has largely ignored him because it is controlled by the local
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet The China Times, a leading Taiwan newspaper, took him on
with an editorial on July 25, titled ``Who Wants a 51st State?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States allowed far-away Taiwan to become a 51st
state, a lot of small undeveloped African countries would have done
it long ago,'' the editorial said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of Chou's supporters, David Shu, said that, like many young
people here, he used to think that the island should declare formal
independence, since it has been effectively separate from China for
50 years. But he reasoned that if independence is not feasible,
what with China hovering so close by, American statehood is
second-best.
</P>
<P>
   When he tries to sell the idea to friends, Shu said, he compares
Taiwan to a pretty young woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is like a gangster,'' Shu said. ``The United States is
like a policeman. Every time the gangster tries to take the girl in
his arms, she has to call the policeman to come save her.
</P>

 _ SF CHRON   Intuit Aims at Online Services for Small Business 
 &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Intuit Inc., the Mountain View company best known for its Quicken
and TurboTax finance software for consumers, is redefining itself
as an electronic financial services provider and is targeting small
business as its largest and fastest-growing market.
<P>
   ``We're making a radical transformation from producing
shrink-wrapped products for the desktop PC to delivering products
on the Web,'' said Intuit chief executive Bill Harris. The
company's aim is to provide all the online connections consumers
and companies need to conduct their financial affairs _ and take a
lot of hassle out of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit has a good jump on the competition. Its software already
handles close to one-third of tax returns handled by computer, and
its QuickBooks accounting software has a whopping 85 percent share
of the small-business market, according to PC Data.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company is expanding vigorously into payroll services.
In May, it paid $200 million for Computing Resources Inc., a Reno
company that specializes in payroll services for small businesses.
Other services that could be linked in the future include employee
pension, medical, workers' compensation, insurance and other
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The aim, said Harris, is to create ``a seamless connected
system'' between businesses and their employees, financial
institutions, customers, suppliers and government agencies, and to
free managers from a sea of paper and storm of data entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't get into small business because they like
bookkeeping,'' said Intuit founder and Chairman Scott Cook.
``That's the last thing they want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we can do is take the administrative hassle out of their
lives, so they can do what they want to, like being a contractor,
caterer or consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other e-commerce products, financial services can be
ordered and fulfilled electronically. ``These products are
fundamentally all about bits of information,'' said Cook. ``You
don't have to touch or feel it or try it on. You don't need
warehouses or have to ship stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In a market filled with plenty of e-finance companies and
information sites, Intuit is trying to position itself as a partner
to many of them rather than as a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it has established links with more than 100
financial institutions, including American Express, Bank of America
and Wells Fargo, and is working on both paying and presenting bills
online.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has links with 600 financial instutions, but its Money
99 Personal &AMP; Business software and online services are aimed at
helping individuals and sole proprietors manage their personal and
business functions together.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft and other Internet portals have plenty of
information for businesses, Intuit's Harris notes that they also
cover sports, weather and horoscopes and do not have Intuit's
business depth.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Quicken.com Web site, which ranks right behind
Yahoo as the most popular finance site on the Internet, gets close
to 200 million page views per month and is designed to offer
consumers and businesses a full menu of financial information and
referrals to companies offering insurance, mortgages and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   Some new companies like San Francisco's E-Benefits offer
Web-based insurance quotes for business and a free human resources
management system online. But Intuit is not particularly worried.
``Lots of competitors do one thing,'' said Cook. ``But they don't
connect everything.''
</P>
<P>
   They also don't have millions of businesses already using its
products and looking for new things to plug in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intuit's Quicken and QuickBooks customer base and name
recognition give it a major advantage in launching payroll and
other services,'' said Forrester Research senior analyst Brook
Newcomb.
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 percent of Intuit's $240 million in quarterly revenues
now comes from the consumer market, while 80 percent is split
between tax and small-business products.
</P>
<P>
   The small-business market has the greatest potential. According
to Intuit, there are 22 million small U.S. businesses with 20 or
fewer employees. About 12 million of them have a PC, and half of
these use accounting software. Intuit claims 5.5 million business
users of Quicken and QuickBooks. Its main competitors, Peachtree
and MYOB (short for Mind Your Own Business) place a distant second
and third place, respectively, in business accounting software.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit has similar designs on the electronic payroll services
market. It notes that nearly 40 percent of small-business owners
have been penalized by the IRS for filing late or inaccurate
payroll data. The average penalty is $845.
</P>
<P>
   That penalty is about what Intuit charges a small business for
its automated payroll services, including automatic deposit of
paychecks for employees.
</P>
<P>
   Only 14 percent of U.S. small businesses use outside payroll
services firms today, and e-commerce analyst Newcomb figures that
with its recent acquisition of Computing Resources, Intuit will be
able to offer such services at perhaps half what competitors like
PayChex charge.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a possible price advantage, Quicken customers can
cut administrative costs by not having to re-enter payroll
information that is already in the accounting program. Newcom
figures this could be a major advantage since ``the more times you
retype information the greater the chance of clerical error.''
</P>
<P>
   QuickBooks Online Payroll currently has more than 10,000 of
Intuit's accounting customers and it is processing close to $17
million of payroll a week.
</P>
<P>
   One user is Socratic Technologies. The San Francisco research
firm has linked the payroll service to its QuickBooks accounting
software and uses it to make semimonthly automatic deposits to its
24 employees as well as withhold and pay appropriate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   For $91.50 a month, including all deposit fees, Socratic
administration director Ron Treleven said the service is a bargain.
Although it is hard to figure exactly how much time and money it
saves, he said it does a lot more and is less cumbersome than the
previous system, which involved phoning Wells Fargo Bank and
punching a bunch of numbers into the telephone key pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company doesn't have to worry about lost checks and
employees on the road don't have to worry about their paychecks
being deposited,'' Trevelen added. ``And if there's a problem,
Intuit takes responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Business consultant Tina H. Anderson of Burlingame also is a fan
of Intuit's online payroll services.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of options from printing out the checks or
having them sent electronically,'' she said. ``The great advantage
is you don't have to re-key the data into your accounting and
payroll programs.
</P>
<P>
   She notes, though, that if your business has a complex payroll
such as one that needs to track compensation and tax payments
separately for officers, sales people and union employees, you
might need a more sophisticated payroll program, like those offered
by Automatic Data Processing and PayChex.

COMMENTARY: THE BOY CAN'T HELP IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pierce and Demi and Liam were there. And Quentin and Salman and
Spike and Amber. I never actually saw any of them. I had to content
myself with glimpses of Kevin Bacon's pouffy hair and Madonna's
pouffy biceps.
</P>
<P>
   Descend with me to the seventh circle of buzz, the ground zero
of zing, the hub of hip, the Sodom of synergy. Beneath the Statue
of Liberty the masses, the tired and unhumble, yearning to be chic,
huddled at Tina Brown's Talk party. In the glow of Chinese
lanterns, here was the perfect Gotham froth _ the maitre d' of the
Four Seasons and the window dresser for Barneys and the publicist
for Kevin Costner and the toupee for Andrew Stein.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Latifah was at the microphone chanting, pausing only to
wonder whether the Miramax chief and Talk sugar daddy Harvey
Weinstein pronounced his name ``steen'' or ``stine.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, of course, a rigid caste system. An elderly man in a
wheelchair was turned back after he mistakenly rolled down the
gangplank toward a ferryboat reserved for celebrities and nicknamed
the ``star barge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The man in the wheelchair does not belong here,'' hissed a
Talk sherpa, banishing him to the hoi polloi ferry even as he
unfastened the chain for Diane von Furstenberg and Barry Diller.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Brown was glowing. She had aced her first test. Everybody
was talking about Talk. (Though the cover, laid out so that George
W. appears to be leering at Gwyneth Paltrow's squished cleavage
while Hillary gazes up, away from the actress' bondage lingerie, is
jarring.)
</P>
<P>
   The first lady unburdened herself in an interview with the
adoring journalist Lucinda Franks, working for the adoring
Weinstein. (Gwyneth, Tina and Hillary are the rough-hewn mogul's
treasured troika of blond Miramax princesses.) Ms. Franks is
married to Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, who
is Rudolph Giuliani's old rival.
</P>
<P>
   Fans and foes of Mrs. Clinton were left reeling by her
contention that the president's chronic philandering was caused by
``abuse'' he suffered as a little boy when his mother and
grandmother battled over him.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Clinton's mother recalled the custody fight over
Bill that erupted with her mother, after Virginia married the
hard-partying Roger Clinton. At one point, grandma even burned ma's
white leather jacket.
</P>
<P>
   In a political climate that cherishes dissension, there is such
rare unanimity of revulsion at Mrs. Clinton's interview that she is
now trying to slink away from it.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is fed up with the creepy dynamics of this warped
marriage. We have lost all hope of getting any shred of
authenticity from either Bill or Hillary _unless it's the
authenticity of the deluded. They have chosen tactics over truth
with such consistency that it's impossible to accept anything they
say.
</P>
<P>
   Many liberals were rooting for Hillary to run for the Senate as
a payback for all the alley cat had done. She had been publicly
stoic through bruising betrayals.
</P>
<P>
   But once again, she has taken on a contradictory image with
dizzying speed. Comparing herself to Jesus and her husband to the
betraying Peter, Hillary says he has a ``weakness,'' like a gambler
or alcoholic. ``Everybody,'' she says, ``has some dysfunction in
their families.''
</P>
<P>
   He's scarred, she says, by two women who adored him and who are
not here to offer rebuttal. After talking about how hard it is for
a guy to be yanked between female relatives, Hillary recreates that
very situation, forcing Clinton to choose between defending his
mother and grandmother and agreeing with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   She is right that the president has fine qualities. But how many
people have to be smeared to get him off the hook? The Talk
interview is like that old saw about the guy who would run over his
own grandmother to help his career.
</P>
<P>
   Her interview is also chilling in its casual acknowledgment of
Clinton's infidelities. Hillary Clinton joined in efforts to
dismiss as mendacious tarts all the women who claimed, truthfully,
to have been involved with her husband. But now she concedes, oh,
yeah, the boy's a mess.
</P>
<P>
   For the Clintons, talk is always cheap.

   If they can pass the final bill this week, House Speaker Dennis
Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi plan
to sit on the legislation until after Congress returns from its
summer vacation in September and then send it to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the two Republicans are under some pressure from their own
members to adopt a less confrontational strategy, and to seek
negotiations with the White House before forcing a showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that forcing the issue now ``would likely lead to a
hardening of positions that could imperil any possible negotiated
agreement later in the fall,'' Sen. Olympia Snowe, a moderate
Republican from Maine, urged Lott in a letter Tuesday to seek a
cooling-off period over the next month followed by talks with the
White House.

BRIDGING A CHASM IN THE MODERN CANON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 David Schiff is a composer on the faculty of Reed College in
Portland, Ore.  
 By DAVID SCHIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although he is best known as Stravinsky's Boswell, collaborator
and aide-de-camp, Robert Craft, along with Leonard Bernstein and
John Cage, has been one of the main shapers of American musical
taste in the second half of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he met Stravinsky in 1948, Craft decided that
Stravinsky and Schoenberg, living in separate worlds just a few
miles from each other in Los Angeles, had more in common than
anyone had imagined. While most musicians of the time felt that
they had to choose sides, Craft championed both masters as the
supreme composers of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Craft attained worldwide fame in the mid-1950s with his set of
the complete works of Schoenberg's disciple Anton Webern, an album
that soon became as essential to an intellectual's library as a
copy of Joyce's ``Ulysses.'' Craft also recorded almost all the
works of Schoenberg, Berg and Varese as well as select works of
older music by Gesualdo, Monteverdi and Bach, and he was actively
involved in all of Stravinsky's recordings for Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Craft's recordings from the '50s and early '60s closed the gap
between Stravinsky and the Second Viennese School. After
Schoenberg's death in 1951, under Craft's guidance, Stravinsky
embraced the music of his greatest rival.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Craft's recordings of the Viennese composers were made
during time left over at Stravinsky's recording sessions. When you
listen to some of those recordings side by side _ say, Schoenberg's
Serenade (Op. 24) and Stravinsky's ``Agon'' _ you can hear the
impact of Schoenbergian moments on Stravinsky, like asteroids
hitting a planet.
</P>
<P>
   While abetting Stravinsky's move toward Schoenberg, though,
Craft also made Schoenberg's music sound more Stravinskian.
Schoenberg's works, recorded by the same musicians and in the same
dry ambiance used for Stravinsky's, took on the brittle sonority we
associate with Stravinsky's music. This subtle inflection may have
resulted from limited time, but Craft underplayed the nostalgic and
sentimental sides of the music, aspects that Stravinsky, too,
continued to find unpalatable.
</P>
<P>
   What those performances may have lacked in technical polish and
Central European style, however, they more than made up for in
visceral excitement. Craft gave the music a punch that enlivened
its Weltschmerz.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Craft has re-recorded most of Stravinsky's
music, and he has now also completed three volumes of Schoenberg's
music for the Koch label. These interpretations retain the bite of
the pioneering efforts but are much more refined in execution. They
show that Craft is a maestro to reckon with.
</P>
<P>
   All the works on the latest CD, ``The Music of Arnold
Schoenberg, Vol. 3'' (Koch International Classics 3-7463-2 HI),
demonstrate that Schoenberg was Stravinsky's equal as an
orchestrator, even though his sensibility was completely different.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky's orchestration sounds magically normal, capturing
the essential character of each instrument. Schoenberg, in
comparison, puts instruments on steroids, stretching ranges and
colors. In weak performances the music can sound garish and
miscalculated, but Craft and his musicians vindicate Schoenberg's
orchestral instincts.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber Symphony (Op. 9), composed in 1906, compresses the
demands of a Strauss tone poem or a Mahler symphony onto 15
hard-working players: a string quintet and 10 winds. Under Craft's
guidance, the 20th-Century Classics Ensemble, drawn from New York's
finest musicians, gives the work the warm glow of a Mozart wind
serenade while bringing out its visionary thrust.
</P>
<P>
   Craft is particularly successful in defining the dramatic high
points of the work's unusual form, which places a scherzo and slow
movements inside a large sonata design.
</P>
<P>
   The Orchestral Songs (Op. 22) were a favorite of Stravinsky, but
are rarely performed, perhaps because much of the voice part lies
extremely low for a mezzo-soprano who must also sing high A flats.
But these songs represent the high point in Schoenberg's orchestral
experimentation. Composed during World War I, they are an
Expressionist manifesto at a time of world crisis. Each song
redefines the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first, ``Seraphita,'' depicts a union of the artist and the
spiritual realm at the height of a storm. The mystical voice
appears in an endlessly varied melody warbled by six clarinets,
while 24 screeching violins and a battalion of growling low brasses
evoke the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The second song, as delicate as the first is aggressive, creates
an orchestral halo, with four flutes and three clarinets scored
above the lowest register of the singer, who sounds like a medium
making contact with the other side. The third song frames the voice
with five flutes above and a quartet of bass clarinets and a
quintet of cellos below.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing song, a setting of Rainer Maria Rilke's
``Vorgefuhle'' (``Premonitions''), the poet compares himself to a
flag whose flutterings are the first sign of a coming storm. The
orchestra, normal in instrumentation but novel in sound, hints at
the approaching disaster, then explodes in visionary fury. Craft,
the Philharmonia Orchestra of London and the mezzo-soprano
Catherine Wyn-Rogers give the songs a prophetic intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The Variations for Orchestra (Op. 31) were Schoenberg's first
orchestral work composed according to the 12-tone system. The
orchestral innovations equal the harmonic ones and are easier to
grasp. The work synthesizes Schoenberg's experiments with large and
small ensembles. The variations alternate between full orchestra
and changing configurations drawn from the larger body.
</P>
<P>
   In their sensual extremes the Variations, played here by the
Philharmonia, seem to mirror the ``Cabaret'' era of Berlin, where
Furtwangler gave the premiere in 1928. An exotic waltz episode with
the theme in harp, mandolin and celesta sounds like a striptease;
an ethereal variation in the highest registers of the orchestra
suggests the haze of funny cigarettes, and a raucous ostinato
variation with xylophone recalls Gershwin's contemporary ``American
in Paris'' in its evocation of a traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   Against these vignettes of modern depravity, Schoenberg sounds
the notes that spell out B-A-C-H in German. Like a preacher of
doom. Craft's new rendition sustains the crucial balance between
the work's traditional roots in the music of Bach and Brahms, and
its wildly phosphorescent sonorities.
</P>
<P>
   The clash of old and new will offend purists in Schoenberg
orchestrations of Bach, written in 1922 and 1928. They use all the
resources of the modern orchestra, including percussion, without
any concessions to ``authentic'' Baroque sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The five-voice ``St. Anne'' Fugue, which Craft presents here
without its equally elaborate prelude, is analytic in its exposure
of Bach's contrapuntal design and Stokowskian in its uninhibited
orchestral splendor.
</P>
<P>
   There are three fugal subjects, and Schoenberg gives the first
to woodwinds, the second to strings and the third to brasses,
simulating an organist gradual pulling all the stops. But what
organ, or Baroque orchestra, has this many stops? The fugue is an
homage to the Trinity, and Schoenberg knew that his task as
orchestrator, transcending the merely historical, was to make a
joyful noise before the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   Craft and the Philharmonia perfectly capture the ecstatic
devotion of both composer and arranger, and they prove that
Schoenberg was just as adept at Neo-Classicism as was the composer
of ``Pulcinella.''

FAA SAYS RUNWAY INCIDENTS WILL BE TOP PRIORITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   D/FW AIRPORT _ Potentially deadly runway incursions _ in which
an aircraft moves onto a runway into the path of another aircraft
taking off or landing _ continue to be a serious problem across the
nation despite a Federal Aviation Administration program to curtail
such incidents, a U.S. Transportation Department report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1972, 11 runway incursion accidents have killed 719 people
and destroyed 20 aircraft, according to the audit report by the
Transportation Department's inspector general's office.
</P>
<P>
   This decade alone, 45 people have died in such accidents, and
the National Transportation Safety Board has included runway
incursions on its ``most wanted'' list of transportation safety
improvements since 1990, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the inspector general's report, FAA Administrator
Jane Garvey last week ordered that the runway safety program be the
agency's top priority, even above aviation security, FAA spokesman
John Clabes said.
</P>
<P>
   At Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, five runway incursions have
occurred this year as of July 31, matching the total for all of
last year, said Jo Ellen Casilio, assistant air traffic manager for
the FAA's Southwest Region in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The two most recent incidents were blamed on controller errors
and occurred during ``on the job training of controllers,'' Casilio
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the FAA will send a special ``runway incursion
action team'' to D/FW Airport in mid-September to review the
incidents and make recommendations for preventing them in the
future, Jeff Griffith, the FAA's program director for air-traffic
operations, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Such teams are part of the FAA's runway safety program, and have
visited 16 other airports this year, Griffith said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent D/FW incursions occurred July 23 and 24,
involving airliners that were inadvertently cleared by air traffic
controllers _ who were training _ to cross a runway upon which
other airliners were landing, Casilio said.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident, the two aircraft were never closer than 4,400
feet, and in the other, the closest they came was 6,000 feet, so
they were not in danger of colliding, Casilio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation where it's against the regulations, because
two planes aren't supposed to be on the same runway at the same
time,'' she said. ``Because of that, we take it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Although neither incident resulted in an accident, one of the
most deadly runway incursion accidents of this decade came from a
similar controller error.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four people died Feb. 1, 1991, at Los Angeles
International Airport when a USAir jet landed on top of a Skywest
Airlines commuter plane that had been inadvertently cleared onto
the same runway into the path of the USAir plane.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots are responsible for 56 percent of runway incursions, FAA
statistics show, including one May 28 at D/FW in which a Northwest
Airlines jet landed on the same runway an American Airlines jet was
waiting to take off from. The Northwest pilot landed on the wrong
runway, touching down just 600 feet past the American jet, FAA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most important safety issues today,'' said
Matt Hampton, program director for FAA research and acquisitions at
the inspector general's office. ``Most people think of mid-air
collisions when they think of airport accidents, but runway
incursions are deadly, too, and are high on the NTSB's hit list.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA agreed with the inspector general's criticisms and
recommendations, and is moving more quickly to implement
improvements, Clabes said. The FAA began a runway safety program in
1995, which was upgraded after similar criticism from the inspector
general's office in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency has not followed through on most of the actions
it planned for the program since February 1998, and it is
``unlikely the FAA will achieve its goal of reducing runway
incursions by 15 percent by the year 2000 and mitigate the risk of
a tragic runway accident,'' the inspector general's report said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the runway program is now in high gear, the FAA's
Griffith said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the administration's runway safety agenda, the FAA
has put together a ``joint safety analysis team'' to look at each
runway incursion, analyze the data to look at causes, and then take
that information and make changes that would eliminate those
particular causes, Griffith said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though D/FW was in fifth-place among U.S. airports for
runway incursions during 1998, the airport led the nation for such
incidents during three of the past six years, records show.
</P>
<P>
   And runway incursions might continue to be a problem at D/FW
until the airport builds a taxiway around the airport's perimeter,
officials said. Now, aircraft landing on outer runways must cross
other active runways to reach the airline terminals, which are in
the middle of the field.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was just that situation that brought about the two incursions
last month, Casilio said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, on July 23, the controller asked the pilot of a
landing jet to complete his landing short of a taxiway that is more
than two-thirds of the way down the runway, then cleared another
aircraft to cross the runway at that taxiway.
</P>
<P>
   But the controller didn't hear the pilot reply that he could not
land short of that taxiway, Casilio said. Because of safety
concerns, pilots have the option of refusing a request to land
short of a taxiway, and are allowed to use the entire runway at
D/FW if they want to, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second incident, July 24, the controller cleared an
aircraft to cross a runway, but as with the case at Los Angeles
when the USAir plane landed on top of the commuter plane, the
controller was mixed up as to which plane he was talking to,
records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just looking at the wrong aircraft'' when he issued the
command to cross the runway, Casilio said of the controller.
</P>
<P>
   Curbing runway incursions is particularly difficult for the FAA
because the agency has direct control over only its personnel _ the
air traffic controllers _ but not over pilots or other airport
workers, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These incidents can't be prevented fully by air traffic
control,'' he said. ``Everybody has to work together to prevent
incursions. D/FW has a tremendous amount of traffic, seven runways,
and lots of potential for incursions.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Architects who consider themselves artists are
understandably delighted when their work is featured in museums,
but Richard Meier, the designer of the Getty Center in Los Angeles,
has special reason to feel honored.
</P>
<P>
   The Musee du Jeu de Paume in Paris has chosen Meier, an
American, as the subject of its first-ever architectural
exhibition. And in doing so, it has set out to reinforce the notion
that architecture is art.
</P>
<P>
   True, for Paris, this is not exactly a revolutionary idea.
Parisians, and indeed foreigners, have long regarded this city as
an exquisite urban sculpture. When the government began a daring
program of Grands Travaux, or Great Works, in the 1980s, it invited
``artistic'' architects to participate in design competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Parisians in turn judged the results primarily for their
esthetic worth _ and they remembered the names of the architects
responsible for both the good and the bad.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the French are not accustomed to studying buildings
through photographs, drawings and models. So ``Richard Meier
Architect,'' which runs through Sept. 26, is something of an
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, architectural shows held in the Georges Pompidou
Center have drawn mainly specialists. But with a new Cite de
l'Architecture being planned for Paris in 2002, the Jeu de Paume,
on the Place de la Concorde, is a good place to gauge general
interest in architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The show opened on July 13, and the public response has been
encouraging. Architects and architectural students were to be
expected to stop by, but museum officials said many people were
visiting out of sheer curiosity and then lingering as the show
caught their attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like models,'' Meier had predicted with a mischievous
smile.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is certainly people friendly. Three
naturally-lighted upper galleries display detailed models of 24 of
Meier's buildings. The first room presents his corporate and
public-sector projects, including a stunning representation of a
proposal (ultimately rejected) for a Madison Square Garden site
redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   The plan envisioned three high-rise office blocks, which would
have been Meier's first-ever skyscrapers. The second gallery is
dedicated to the Getty Center, and the last is given over to the
private houses that first won him recognition and to the museums
that have absorbed much of his attention in the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen many of these models for years,'' said Meier,
64, a tall, white-haired New Yorker, showing a visitor around the
exhibition, ``and of course I have never seen them together like
this. They have been scattered around. What I like is that it is
work done over 35 years, but it holds together, as if it had been
organized for an exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he was inevitably asked, is this an exhibition of art?
</P>
<P>
   ``Architects think that architecture is an art,'' he said, ``but
nothing here was meant to be a work to be shown in a museum. No one
is saying any one drawing is a work of art. It is part of the
making of a work of architecture. And understanding this can lead
to understanding the art of architecture. Even better, it may lead
people to see the buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Paris has only one of Meier's works, the headquarters of Canal
Plus, a French cable network. It's a dazzling white glass-fronted
building on the Seine, and the channel has organized guided tours
of it to coincide with the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   To study his other works, visitors must travel to the
Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Italy and, of course, the United
States. On the other hand, this show, which has been organized by
the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, is itself going to
travel, first around Europe and finally to Los Angeles, probably in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether or not it is art, the exhibition is a
comprehensive retrospective, using photographs, drawings and
models. And the fact that it is not arranged chronologically
underlines the consistency of Meier's classically modernist vision
of architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New Jersey and educated at Cornell University, he found
his early influences (apart from Bernini, Boromini and Bramante) in
Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Louis Khan, Alvar Aalto and
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and he has never turned away from them.
For him, postmodernism was no temptation: he dismissed it as
``meaningless pastiche.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, beginning with the Smith House built in Darien,
Conn., in the late 1960s, Meier's work has had a distinct
signature. He was soon known as ``the white architect'' for the
whiteness of most of his buildings, and, while years later he was
chosen as the architect of the Getty Center on condition that it
should not be white, white remains his preferred color.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whiteness is for me the clearest way of expressing the
difference between what is natural and what is man-made,'' he
explains in an audio-tape commentary that visitors to the Jeu de
Paume can carry while seeing the show, ``and at the same time it
reflects and refracts all the colors of nature which are changing
around you through the day and through the seasons. Whiteness
delineates most clearly the planer surfaces and linear surfaces,
the difference between opacity and transparency.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But whiteness, he notes, is also an instrument through which to
achieve his principal objectives of light and space. In his memoir,
``Building the Getty,'' he wrote, ``I have always been preoccupied
with the filtration and reflection of natural light, with
chiaroscuro effects and with the way in which a building becomes
animated through the movement of the subject in space.''
</P>
<P>
   This preoccupation is amply illustrated by the models in the
exhibition, not only in his early houses but notably in his
museums, starting with the Museum of Decorative Arts in Frankfurt,
Germany, where his main challenge was to build a large modern
extension to a small 18th-century museum.
</P>
<P>
   The answer he found was transparency, which enabled the new to
complement the old. With the High Museum in Atlanta, built almost
simultaneously in the early 1980s, he paid tribute to Frank Lloyd
Wright's Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum by building a ramp around an
atrium splashed with natural light.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can never be enough light,'' he likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   In several cases, Meier has also used light to help his abstract
modernist forms fit into neighborhoods with strong, established
personalities. Thus, with the Museum of Contemporary Art in
Barcelona, Spain, a huge glass facade enables the white rectangular
building not to clash with the 16th-century convent it looks onto.
</P>
<P>
   In Ulm, Germany, where Meier was commissioned to build an
Exhibition and Assembly Building beside the city's Gothic
cathedral, he designed large windows and skylights so that the
cathedral's tall spire is ever visible from inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   One of his current projects has involved relating to an entirely
different urban environment. Three years ago, Meier was chosen to
build the Church of the Year 2000 for the Vatican. Rather than
allowing him to come to terms with the Roman architecture that he
so admires, however, the church _ his first church _ is being built
in the working-class district of Tor Tre Teste on a small plot
surrounded by characterless 17-story apartment blocs, as a symbol,
he said, ``of the Vatican's coming to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me that this church had to create a sense of
enclosure, a spiritual place,'' he explained, ``but at the same
time it had to be part of the neighborhood. And so the design is
not only internalized but also looks up and out. The roof is glass
and the sky is around you. It is a place of inward meditation, but
also outward thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundations of the $8 million church have only just been
laid, with plans for completion before the end of 2000, but a model
reveals a striking design. On one side of the church are three
precast concrete shells, between which natural light will pour into
the atrium below during the day and artificial light will be cast
upward toward the apartment blocks at night.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the central exhibit in the Jeu de Paume is inevitably the
28-foot-long model of the $1 billion Getty Center, easily the
largest of the 250 or so models built by Meier's own model shop
during the 14 years of construction of the center (a dozen models
of details are also in the show).
</P>
<P>
   Built of wood and still the color of wood (whiteness never
ceased to be an issue in Meier's discussions with the Getty
management), it offers a panoramic view that only a helicopter
could provide, showing the relationship of the complex to the
hillside and offering an insight into the variety of buildings that
compose the center.
</P>
<P>
   But the model is also detailed enough to show the five-foot-wide
peripheral gardens that were required to discourage visitors from
peering into homes in nearby Brentwood.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Getty Center can be considered a vast art
installation is, of course, a moot point. But Meier, who painted in
an Abstract Expressionist style in the late 1950s until he felt
that he had to choose between painting and architecture, can
nonetheless now claim to have exhibited in the Jeu de Paume as a
traditional artist.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate space in the museum, he is presenting a selection
of his collages, which, he said, ``have very little to do with
architecture.'' They are, however, a product of his endless travels
as an architect.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I fly, I carry a box of material with me, and this is the
result,'' he said proudly. ``They are personal notes of a visual
nature.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- State Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien is planning a major
overhaul of the beleaguered Abandoned Property Division after a
probe this year revealed poor record-keeping, lax rules, and a
system in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, to be unveiled wednesday, would end the aggressive
policies instituted under former treasurer Joseph D. Malone to
convert abandoned property into cash for the state's general fund.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the treasury would focus on returning millions of
dollars in dormant assets to rightful owners, while making the
process less burdensome for banks and other businesses that house
abandoned property.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's legislation calls for installation of a $1.1 million
computer network with tighter security and better data-keeping to
replace the current inadequate system that does not easily match
heirs with their property. The plan requires converting incomplete
and antiquated data into usable information, those familiar with
the process say.
</P>
<P>
   If the state dramatically improves its efforts to track down
property owners, it could limit the role of so-called ``bounty
hunters,'' who scan lists of assets and help owners collect them,
for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   In a major concession to financial institutions that hold the
bulk of abandoned property, such as old stock certificates and
passbook savings accounts, the legislation would limit
state-sponsored audits of their books in search of assets to nine
years, rather than reaching back 13 years as Malone did.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say Malone worked aggressively to seize abandoned
assets, much of which he eventually transferred to the state's
general fund without diligently seeking owners, in order to boast
in campaign literature about returning money to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Thomas Barker, senior director of regulatory policy
for the Massachusetts Hospital Association and a member of the task
force that drafted the new bill, ``We think what the treasurer has
done with this task-force process is to give very clear guidance
for what's expected, what kinds of property constitutes abandoned
property, and what auditors are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force, established in April, is made up of industry
leaders and Beacon Hill officials, who were stung by reports that
outside bounty hunters had abused the treasury, allegedly stealing
nearly $9 million in unpaid state checks. Two former treasury
employees and two alleged outside accomplices await indictment in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Unpaid Check Fund and Abandoned Property are separate
accounts within the treasury, they are linked in key ways and both
have been marred by poor management.
</P>
<P>
   Unpaid checks _ those issued by state agencies that go uncashed
_ are turned over to the Abandoned Property Division after two
years. Some of the same ``bounty hunters'' that scan the Unpaid
Check list hoping to find money they can return to heirs for a fee
also troll the Abandoned Property List, looking to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   After news broke of alleged theft and poor controls at the
Unpaid Check Fund, reports surfaced of shoddy record keeping in the
Abandoned Property Division. Investigators said much of the $100
million in abandoned property in the account during fiscal 1998 had
no ownership attached to them, and the state had made little effort
to locate the rightful heirs due to staff cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses began to step forward to complain about the way the
state had contracted with and encouraged outside auditors to sweep
abandoned property out of vaults and accounts. The contracts for
those auditors will expire next June, and the treasury is
considering using its own staffers to take over or supplement the
work of the outside firms, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Groups such as Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the
Massachusetts Hospital Association, and the Massachusetts Bankers
Association have railed against the private auditors, who sought to
examine more than a decade's worth of records to find items that
could be considered abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The industries, including retailers, which issue store credits
that often go uncashed, said the practice was abusive and that
consumers would find it difficult to collect their property once it
was in state custody.
</P>
<P>
   Their fears turned out to be true.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst and most publicized case, valuables _ gold, silver,
family treasures _ were actually dumped in a vault in the
treasurer's State House office, a practice O'Brien did not know
about until just after she took office in January when Attorney
General Thomas F. Reilly launched an investigation tracing back
many years of alleged fraud and abuse by so-called heir finders.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Tuesday night, O'Brien confirmed she planned to overhaul
the Abandoned Property Division, which during fiscal 1999 peaked at
about $80 million in assets once belonging to some 38,000 people.
Of that, more than half, or as much as $50 million, in unclaimed
property will be dumped into the state's general fund before the
end of the summer because the treasury could not find its owners.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said the legislation is a compromise between business
and state interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We inherited a system that was neither business friendly nor
did it work to ensure that the rightful owners of property had it
returned to them,'' O'Brien said. ``We inherited a system that was
executed in a haphazard fashion and increased revenue to the
Commonwealth. While (that) is certainly a significant goal, it
frankly isn't the purpose of the abandoned property system.''
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses did not comply with the law requiring them to
turn over abandoned assets to the state, O'Brien said. Officials
said only about 3 percent of firms followed the regulations
mandating any asset that is inactive for three years be transferred
to state custody.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien plans to establish a six-month amnesty period during
which time firms can hand over property without paying the 12
percent penalty usually levied when assets are turned in late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the recommendations are extremely positive,'' said
Kevin Kiley of the Massachusetts Bankers Association, whose members
have among the highest compliance rates.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien is also eliminating business-to-business credit accounts
from the definition of abandoned property as long as a relationship
still exists between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses will also be allowed to appeal audits, and contest
whether assets are actually abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Private-sector interests on the task force did not get
everything they had hoped for in the legislation. For example, they
wanted private auditors to reach back only six years in their
audits.
</P>
<P>
   And, while the intent of the new regulations could limit the
amount of property heir finders have to work with, the bill does
not outlaw their right to seek a set 10 percent fee for their
services.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said she is hopeful the bill will pass before the
Legislature recesses in November.

 David Schiff is a composer on the faculty of Reed College in
Portland, Ore.  
 By DAVID SCHIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut'' has arrived just in time to
illuminate the music of Arnold Schoenberg, the focus of the Bard
Music Festival over the next two weekends. For its 10th season, the
festival at Bard College, in Annandale-on Hudson, N.Y., is bringing
all its accustomed interdisciplinary tools to bear on a composer
who, nearly 50 years after his death, remains the most
angst-inspiring emblem of musical modernism.
</P>
<P>
   Between concerts, the world's leading Schoenberg scholars will
discuss the cultural, historical and political aspects of the
music.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from the schedule, though, is any consideration of
Schoenberg's obsessive theme: sex. This omission may be a missed
opportunity in marketing the music and in understanding it as well.
Aside from its box office appeal _ and Bard may well be
angst-ridden on that issue _ eroticism is the key to Schoenberg's
music and to the Viennese culture from which it emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's film is based on a story by Schoenberg's Viennese
contemporary Arthur Schnitzler, and its disturbing mixture of
prurience and puritanism resonates with many of Schoenberg's works.
Like the film, Schoenberg's opera ``Moses und Aron'' climaxes in an
anti-orgy, a clockwork ritual of joyless sex.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick and Schoenberg, two misanthropic moralists, try to turn
pornography on its head, using sexual explicitness to attack a
culture of hedonism.
</P>
<P>
   In his classic study, ``Fin-de-Siecle Vienna,'' the historian
Carl Schorske (who will speak at Bard) explored the importance of
erotic speculation in Viennese culture in general and in
Schoenberg's work in particular, though Schoenberg's sexual notions
may have been even weirder and more devious than Schorske claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenberg's contemporaries _ writers like Schnitzler, Karl
Kraus and Frank Wedekind, and painters like Gustav Klimt, Oskar
Kokoschka and Egon Schiele _ believed that sexual frankness would
overcome the hypocrisy that surrounded them. They dared to present
sex without fig leaves (or computer-generated shadows), but their
ideas about sex, and particularly about women, were not necessarily
enlightened.
</P>
<P>
   Today Freud is criticized for being unscientific and
antifeminine. But Schoenberg's circle found Freud too scientific
and insufficiently aware of the spiritual dimension of sexual
difference, a lapse that makes his anti-feminism seem timid.
Schoenberg derived his sexual ideas from two master misogynists,
August Strindberg and Otto Weininger.
</P>
<P>
   Weininger's book ``Sex and Character,'' a crackpot blend of
pseudo-Darwinian racism, Wagnerian anti-Semitism and Schopenhauer,
was the sacred text of what passed for sexual honesty in old
Vienna. Unreadable today, it was taken dead seriously by
Schoenberg, Freud and the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.
</P>
<P>
   Weininger saw men and women as virtually different species.
Women were instinctual, irrational and retrogressive, from the
molten core of Venus. But men were not from Mars. They alone were
capable of ethical and spiritual development. They alone were
equipped to receive a divine inspiration, or ``Einfall,'' that was
the basis of great art.
</P>
<P>
   Genius was not available to women or to feminized men, a
category that for Weininger included homosexuals and Jews. Such
half-men could never achieve the spiritual heights of gentile
geniuses like Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   Of Jewish descent and homosexual leanings himself, Weininger
committed suicide in 1903, at 23, in an enshrined Beethoven abode
in Vienna, turning his philosophy from theory to practice. Eight
years later, Schoenberg cited Weininger as a model thinker in the
preface to his ``Harmonielehre.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenberg's view of the sexes resembles Weininger's, but with a
distinctive twist. Schoenberg was obsessed with infidelity. He
returned again and again to the theme of lovers' triangles, usually
two men vying for a woman.
</P>
<P>
   He based his early masterpiece, the string sextet ``Verklarte
Nacht,'' of 1899, on a poem by Richard Dehmel in which a woman
confesses to the man she loves that she is carrying the child of
another. The man, no hypocritical Victorian, compassionately
accepts the child as his own.
</P>
<P>
   The music, like Weininger's ``Sex and Character,'' is divided
into halves, the first portraying the woman; the second, the man.
The first evokes the woman's despair, self-hatred and irrational
drive for motherhood, which lead her to a humiliating but fruitful
sexual union. In the second half, the man ``speaks,'' and what a
catch he turns out to be: solid as a rock and godlike in his powers
of forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The music graphically portrays the sexual act with echoes of
Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde,'' but it is no celebration of eros,
for sex here is an act of self-degradation. Both the poem and the
music idealize asexual propagation, the transfiguration of the
sexual into the spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   But something crucial is missing. ``Verklarte Nacht'' does not
find musical representation for the child's biological father, a
seductive immoralist very different from the godlike hero of the
poem. The whole poem is set in motion by the action of this second,
hidden male character, who is far from the Weiningerian ideal.
</P>
<P>
   That other man is implicitly sensual, superficial and unethical.
Hidden in ``Verklarte Nacht,'' this figure becomes increasingly
important in Schoenberg's later music, emerging as the treacherous
Aron, who distorts God's laws and permits that act of national
infidelity, the worship of the golden calf.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Verklarte Nacht,'' in 1903, Schoenberg composed his tone
poem ``Pelleas und Melisande,'' again based on a triangular love
story. Schoenberg's symphonic version of Maeterlinck's play differs
significantly from Debussy's opera. In the opera, Golaud, the
cuckolded husband, is a brutal monster, done in by his own need to
control events, while Melisande embodies a wise, if tragic,
passivity.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Schoenberg's tone poem, Golaud is the tragic hero, as
indicated by a theme derived from Brahms' ``Tragic Overture.'' He
is undone by his unscrupulous wife, tagged with a curling,
snakelike motif, and, once again, that Other Man: his half-brother,
Pelleas, whose boyish musical motif sounds like the theme from
``The Flintstones.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the premiere of the tone poem, life imitated art. In
1907, Schoenberg's wife, Mathilde, ran off with a young painter,
Richard Gerstl, whom Schoenberg had invited into his house.
Mathilde soon returned, and Gerstl committed suicide (an act the
Viennese immediately likened to Weininger's sensational demise).
</P>
<P>
   With the Gerstl affair, Schoenberg, like Tom Cruise's character
in ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' had seen the abyss of sexual betrayal and
would never be the same. His music now broke all ties with the past
and leapt into the free fall of atonality.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a commonplace to blame the Gerstl affair for
atonality. But Schoenberg's harmonies had already been evolving
away from tonality. The affair may have confirmed that he was on
the right path in finding an idiom that could express psychological
reality, at least as understood in turn-of-the-century Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Although his harmonic language was new, Schoenberg was still
telling the same story. In 1909 he began work on a Weiningerian
pair of operas, the feminine monodrama ``Erwartung'' and the
masculine nightmare ``Die Gluckliche Hand.'' These two works
intensify the depiction of sexual difference, for they seem to
emanate from the unconscious desires of their protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Erwartung,'' a woman reveals that she has murdered her
lover, in a rambling, free-associative monologue that sounds like a
transcribed analytic session. (The libretto was written by Marie
Pappenheim, a doctor who studied with Freud, and whose sister,
Bertha, known as Anna O., was one of Freud's most famous case
studies.) The music is appropriately feminine in the Weiningerian
sense: tingling and spasmodic, sensual, without structure or
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenberg found ``Die Gluckliche Hand'' much harder to write.
There are three characters: Man, Woman and Gentleman. The Man is a
genius who creates a perfect gem with a single blow of a hammer,
but like Golaud and Schoenberg himself, he is betrayed by the
faithless Woman and her sleek boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The music, while still atonal, is clearer in its forms and
rhythms than ``Erwartung'' yet weaker in its impact. Schoenberg had
not yet received the crucial Einfall that would give atonal music a
coherent structure, the 12-tone method.
</P>
<P>
   Though notorious as embodiments of musical Expressionism,
``Erwartung'' and ``Die Gluckliche Hand'' have seemed unsatisfying,
naive and oddly dated ever since their premieres. To put it in the
language of sexual frankness, these two operas are monuments to
castration anxiety. The good Dr. Freud would have seen that
Schoenberg's genius hero is the author of his own undoing,
constantly recreating the conditions for infidelity through a
crippling notion of ethical purity.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Schoenberg's impossible, inflated ideal of masculinity,
like Weininger's, seems to invert the anti-Semitic stereotype of
the Jew as a rootless, shiftless half-man. The Man unconsciously
fears that others will see the Jew behind the mask of genius.
</P>
<P>
   Was Schoenberg aware that his Weininger-inspired dualism was
constantly leading him to the same dead end? The evidence is
contradictory. In 1910 and 1911, feeling old (as he approached 40)
and threatened by the radicalism of his students Webern and Berg,
Schoenberg virtually ceased composing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1912, his creative drive returned but in two opposite
directions. He began to imagine an adaption of Strindberg's play
``Jacob Wrestling,'' which would portray modern man's return to
God. This project eventually became the vast cantata ``Die
Jakobsleiter,'' which, like ``Moses und Aron,'' Schoenberg never
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he received a commission to write music for the
recitation of a group of poems entitled ``Pierrot Lunaire.'' He
dropped everything else, because he desperately needed money and
the project promised to have popular appeal. In his diary,
Schoenberg forgave himself in characteristically obscure style for
his temporary lapse from idealism: ``It seems that my fate will
protect me from even such a small artistic sin, for if I don't have
the courage to turn down an offer of money which I need very much,
then nothing will come from the affair. So that I can remain pure
and only have a sin of thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The little artistic sin turned out to be Schoenberg's most
outrageously modern and influential composition. Leaping from his
``bad,'' Aronic side, ``Pierrot Lunaire'' overthrew all the moral
and psychologial precepts Schoenberg had held dear.
</P>
<P>
   It is a portrait of an artist of a very different kind from the
hero of ``Die Gluckliche Hand.'' Pierrot is a sacriligious
sensualist, a dandy, a sentimental modernist, an exhibitionist, a
sadist. Weininger would term him a feminized man, but Pierrot does
not read Schopenhauer or Weininger, preferring Baudelaire and
Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenberg's music, too, draws from a new set of influences: not
those solid German geniuses Wagner and Brahms but the modernists
Debussy and Strauss, particularly the Wildean Strauss of
``Salome.'' And in its wicked parodies, occult mysteries and
contrapuntal games, the music seems inspired by its own perversity.
Male and female, sacred and profane, and good and evil all merge in
this moonlit vaudeville show.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Pierrot Lunaire'' was a diabolical Einfall, and Schoenberg
never returned to its embrace of sexual ambiguity. Just as
Kubrick's film ends with a reaffirmation of marital fidelity,
Schoenberg turned to religion as the answer to sexual anarchy.
Indeed, he soon seemed to be on speaking terms with the Creator,
and claimed _ half-jokingly, perhaps _ that his music followed the
directions set by the Supreme Commander.
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual realm was, after all, Schoenberg's rightful
domain, in the Weiningerian scheme of things, and the proof of his
genius was the arrival in 1921 of his most potent inspiration, the
idea of 12-tone composition.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1930, Schoenberg summed up his mature world view in two
more operas, one comic and one serious but both restating the theme
of sexual treachery. In ``Von Heute auf Morgen,'' a married couple
is almost seduced into a wife-swapping party by a pair of swingers.
``Moses und Aron'' clothes the same theme in biblical garb, and the
orgy actually takes places, complete with naked virgins (and naked
hunks) and animal sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their musical charms, there is something silly at the
core of both operas, and it can't all be blamed on Weininger. Their
opposition of ethical genius and decadent depravity comes from the
preachy world of silent movies.
</P>
<P>
   The more Schoenberg returned to his obsessive theme, the more
schematic it became, climaxing in the fake philosophical conundrum
of ``Moses und Aron'' where Truth, in the character of Moses, is
opposed, in the character of Aron, to Art itself.
</P>
<P>
   The opera denies its own sensual reality, its own considerable
powers of seduction. But the pathos of ``Moses und Aron'' comes
from its historical context, the disaster of the Nazi era, which
Schoenberg had foreseen as early as 1923. Reacting to a series of
anti-Semitic incidents Schoenberg wrote then: ``I have at last
learned the lesson that has been forced upon me during this year,
and I shall never forget it. It is that I am not a German, not a
European, indeed perhaps scarcely even a human being (at least, the
Europeans prefer the worst of their race to me), but I am a Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, the world that had created Schoenberg came to an end,
replaced by a realm of spiritual infidelity unprecedented in human
history. Exiled to the paradise of Los Angeles, Schoenberg did all
he could to help friends and relatives trapped in Europe, and
though disoriented by his new cultural surroundings, he continued
to compose music of ever greater mastery and emotional intensity.
The subject was no longer sex or theological abstraction but human
suffering and Jewish national identity.
</P>
<P>
   History offered Schoenberg another diabolical Einfall, and again
he was ready. ``A Survivor From Warsaw,'' of 1947, remains the most
soul-gripping musical mirror of the darkest moment of the century.

SINGING OF A SOUTH AFRICAN RACE UPROOTED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ There is still one victim of apartheid
that until now has remained unsung: doo-wop.
</P>
<P>
   That is not meant facetiously. Normally, it might be offensive
to lightly link the AK-47 rattle of racial liberation with the
patent-leather tap of rhythms bopped out under a street lamp, but
``Kat and the Kings,'' the South African musical now in previews at
the Cort Theater on Broadway, where it is to open on Aug. 19, does
not trivialize the suffering of the people it portrays. It is, like
their lives, bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   It is apartheid faced not with a fist in the air and the corpse
of a schoolgirl at your feet, but with a shrug and a sigh and a wry
joke muttered as you coolly put the flame to another cigarette. And
then sing another rock-and-roll number.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, particularly African-Americans, may be startled by
it. Not just because they will learn some of the nuances of
apartheid, which was never a simple black-white issue, but because
they will discover there is a whole race of people in distant South
Africa who have worshiped them from afar for 100 years: the
so-called coloreds.
</P>
<P>
   Race relations are deeply complex here. When the now-dead
apartheid state was at its height, black Africans were officially
divided into 10 tribes. People of mixed race (also born in Africa,
and often also black-skinned, but only sometimes called black) were
categorized as ``Cape Colored,'' ``Cape Malay'' and sometimes
``Other Asian.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is enough to know that these coloreds were treated as
nonwhites, usually speak Afrikaans, the old low Dutch of the Boers,
and, like many black Americans, consider themselves the sons of
slaves. But they are the sons of slaves from Malaysia as well as
from Africa, and the sons of the Khoisan peoples _ rudely known as
Hottentots and Bushmen _ who inhabited the southern end of this
continent long before whites or blacks ever arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1600s, coloreds rather than black Africans have formed
the bulk of the workers and poor people of Cape Town, which is also
known as the Mother City here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kat and the Kings,'' which opened in Cape Town in 1995, is the
story of a group of young colored singers in the late 1950s and
their struggle for recognition. It is also the story of District
Six, the fabled colored section that was both the dicey slum and
warm heart of Cape Town until 1966, when it was declared an area
henceforth reserved for whites, emptied and bulldozed.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the musical describes the life of one old
shoeshine man, Kat Diamond, who reminisces about the a cappella
group he put together and named after his brand of cigarettes, the
Cavalla Kings. In part, ``Kat and the Kings'' is based on the real
life of Salie Daniels, a singer and actor whose feline blue-green
eyes earned him the nickname Kat as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, who created the role of the shoeshine man and hoped to
reprise it on Broadway, had to leave the show several months ago
because of bone cancer. He died on July 27. Before he slipped into
unconsciousness, said David Kramer, the show's director and
co-author, Daniels had finally received the statuette he won
earlier this year for his performance in the 1998 London run of the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kat and the Kings'' garnered two Olivier Awards on the West
End, for best new musical and for best actor, which was given to
the cast as a whole. The current cast includes Terry Hector, as the
older Kat who reminisces, and the five-member Kings: Jody J.
Abrahams, Loukmaan Adams, Junaid Booysen, Alistair Izobell and Kim
Louis, the female singer.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels' real group, the Rockets, had a brief rise to stardom in
the 1950s, releasing 12 records before breaking up and scattering
at about the same time as their neighborhood was suffering the same
fate. Every place they practiced _ the echoing shower stalls of the
public baths, the sidewalk outside the Westminster Restaurant, the
bandstand of the Tafelberg Hotel, even their own living rooms _ is
now gone.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just their homes that apartheid stole. Their
careers, too, were reduced to rubble. In those days, the national
radio network allotted 12 minutes a week to ``colored music.'' In
``Kat and the Kings,'' their female singer falls for their white
manager, so they fear arrest under the Immorality Act, which
forbade interracial sex. (The love affair is a bit of poetic
license, but the Rockets actually had a white songwriter and music
instructor, a woman named Eugene Bleulah.)
</P>
<P>
   In the musical, when they hit the big time _ playing Claridge's
Hotel in Durban _ the Kings have to work as bellhops during the
day, tipping their hats with a ``dankie, baas'' (``thanks, boss'').
That, too, really happened to Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Americans will hear the echoes of Jim Crow. In fact, they may be
surprised at how many echoes of 1950s America they recognize. The
songs, by Kramer and Taliep Petersen, are all original, but
deliberately derivative: ``Lonely Girl,'' ``Oo Wee Bay Bee,''
``Stupid Boy'' and even ``Mavis From Bishop Lavis'' (a Cape Town
suburb) all could conceivably have been written in America,
especially now that Kramer has changed the lines that were in
Afrikaans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kat and the Kings'' is the sixth musical that Kramer and
Petersen have created together, all involving the history of
colored South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the curtain opens on their current show, the
audience will find itself staring at a pastiche of 1950s labels.
American icons like Vitalis and Coca-Cola are next to local ones
like Jungle Oats and Ocean Fresh Frikkies Fish Sticks. Slipped in
among them is a sign only South Africans can read but older
Americans might recognize: Slegs Nie-Blankes (which is Afrikaans
for Non-Whites Only).
</P>
<P>
   Through the South African filter, Americans will recognize the
Kings, too: Ballie, the goofus with the big Afro; Bingo, the
toughie in the porkpie hat; Magoo, the rich kid who lives uphill in
Walmer Estates with the other super-coloreds and is as irritating
as Steve Urkel but tolerated because he can sing like Frankie Lymon
_ and his sister is gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   So who is there to thank for this cultural cross-pollination?
Why, the United States Navy, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``District Six was only a 15-minute walk from the harbor,''
Petersen, a singer-songwriter with a low, gentle voice, explained
after one of the show's recent return performances at the
University of Cape Town's Baxter Theater. ``The sailors would come
up to let their hair down, and to score. They would bring their
records _ the Platters, Fats Domino, the Ink Spots, the Coasters,
the Drifters. We'd clone them _ to the T. We'd take the album
covers, and go to a shop called British Tailors. We'd say,
`Schiffman, this is what we want.' The best black cloth was called
Diamond Black, and my people, the Malays, are great, great tailors
_ they could cut it exactly the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, who reminisced in the same theater lobby in June, also
recalled borrowing records from the sailors. Sharply dressed in a
houndstooth jacket, he moved stiffly but at 59 still had the good
looks, catlike eyes and cocky smile that could convince anyone he
had been an idol of teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our own Nat King Cole, our own Frank Sinatra, our own
Elvis, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis,'' he said. ``If you shut
your eyes, I promise you, you'd think it was them.''
</P>
<P>
   This fascination with things American didn't start in the 1950s.
For the last century, the biggest event in colored areas _ really
the biggest annual event in Cape Town _ has been the New Year's
``Coon Carnival.'' (There have been periodic attempts to rename the
festival, but they always fail.) Thousands of members of ``coon
troupes'' put on blackface and Dixieland boaters, pick up their
banjos and trumpets and march through the streets to a stadium
where they conduct three days of singing contests. The troupe that
Petersen's father led, the Darktown Strutters, was 900 strong.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition dates from the 1800s, when the Christy Minstrels,
the American group, toured here, capturing the public fancy. The
defining Coon Carnival song is ``Dar Kom die Alabama,'' about a
real Confederate raider, the Alabama, that anchored near Cape Town
for repairs before sailing out to fight off two Union frigates.
</P>
<P>
   Colored South Africans, even more so than black South Africans,
still pay close attention to African-American trends. ``Everybody
wants to be Boyz II Men,''said Petersen. The Cape Flats gangs wear
red and blue Bloods and Crips bandannas. The rumor that Tupac
Shakur is as alive as Elvis is strong here, too.
</P>
<P>
   As Daniels used to sing in the opening number, ``There was no
one to touch us _ doing our American thing.''

   _ Developing technology that uses information from ground-based

THE WEAK CASE AGAINST WEN HO LEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee, the scientist who has been painted as a spy who
betrayed his country to the Chinese Communists, has raised
questions about that accusation that deserve answers. In a ``60
Minutes'' broadcast Sunday night, Lee, a US citizen born in Taiwan,
cast doubt on the conclusions of a report by the House Select
Committee chaired by Republican Christopher Cox of California.
</P>
<P>
   To date there is no evidence that Lee committed espionage. He
did violate security regulations at the Los Alamos laboratory, and
his appearance on ``60 Minutes'' allowed him to make the case that
as the only Asian-American working in the X Division, or weapons
sector, at Los Alamos, he has been singled out and scapegoated.
</P>
<P>
   It is important for national security, for federal laboratories
such as Los Alamos, and for public perceptions that some clarity be
brought to the spy scare.
</P>
<P>
   Lee does not deny that he downloaded classified nuclear codes
from a secure computer in the lab to an unsecured computer in the
lab. He maintains that he took precautions to make access to the
downloaded material virtually impossible for anyone but himself.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was foolish to be so cavalier with classified material, and
the authorities at Los Alamos had a right to fire him for his
foolishness. But if it is true, as he charges, that many other
weapons scientists did the same thing, then they, too, should be
fired, or Lee should be reinstated. There should be no favoritism
and no scapegoating in the lab's enforcement of security
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, managers at Los Alamos, officials in the
executive branch, and members of Congress owe it to Lee and the
American public to clear up the accumulating mystifications about
the espionage allegations.
</P>
<P>
   A Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board chaired by former
Republican senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire summarized the
exaggerations of the Cox report by saying: ``Possible damage has
been minted as probable disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, inference and hypothesizing are the only grounds for
believing that Beijing obtained US nuclear secrets by means of
espionage. A RAND Corporation military analyst who testified before
the Cox committee, James Mulvernon, has said: ``The US is no more
at threat now than before this alleged espionage. It is only half
the battle to steal technology. China has not fielded any weapon _
and does not appear to be planning to _ that has any technology
said to be stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   The original reason for believing that China had benefited from
nuclear espionage was a stack of papers given to US officials in an
Asian embassy by someone who walked in off the street _ and whom US
intelligence later identified as a double agent sent by Chinese
intelligence. Everything in the planted documents was available
from unclassified sources except for drawings of an advanced,
miniaturized US nuclear warhead, the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   Working by pure deduction, some counterintelligence officials
came to the conclusion that since Wen Ho Lee worked on the W-88 and
had contacts with Chinese scientists, he would be the likeliest
suspect for a posited case of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the US intelligence community has come up with no
satisfactory explanation of why Beijing might have wanted to inform
American authorities that China possessed drawings of the W-88. One
possibility is that the Chinese wanted to alert US intelligence to
lax nuclear weapons security so Washington would clamp down and
prevent third countries such as India from acquiring advanced
missile designs. The double agent could also have been used to send
a message of deterrence: that if provoked, China could spend the
lavish sums required to develop and deploy its own multiple-warhead
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Also unknown is the means by which Beijing obtained the W-88
drawings. They were not necessarily handed to Chinese agents by Wen
Ho Lee or any other scientist at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Scapegoating Wen Ho Lee without evidence of espionage and
deterring foreigners and foreign-born citizens from working at Los
Alamos or other federal labs can only harm American science and
traduce the American tradition of fairness.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Burger King is making a bold new statement in the burger wars:
lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-food giant's old advertising strategy featuring
flame-broiled burgers in commercials set to trendy music is being
replaced with humorous spots that poke fun at the lengths to which
the chain will go to guarantee customer satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials, which are scheduled to appear on network
television in various time slots beginning Sunday, are meant to
extend Burger King's ``Have It Your Way'' slogan beyond the promise
of customized Whoppers to the total fast-food dining experience.
And the campaign is just one element of a comprehensive strategy to
enhance the overall Burger King brand image.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we step back to what our objective to all of this is, it
clearly is to establish a stronger emotional bond with our
customers,'' said Rob Calderin, vice president for marketing in the
United States. ``That took a comprehensive look at our entire
system.''
</P>
<P>
   What resulted was a plan for a system-wide makeover that
included everything from a new corporate logo and product packaging
to restaurant renovations and even some tweaking to the chain's
cooking system. Those changes are being rolled out over time, but
customers will immediately notice the self-deprecating commercials
that still focus on taste and custom-made burgers but suggest a
broader eagerness to please.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials are courtesy of Ammirati Puris Lintas, New York,
part of the Interpublic Group , which also created the long-running
campaign that Burger King Corp. is replacing. The old ads for the
Miami-based division of Diageo PLC, were set to trendy classics
like ``Wild Thing'' and ``That's the Way I Like It.''
</P>
<P>
   With the new tongue-in-cheek vignettes, even food snobs who
steer clear of take-out drive-thrus are likely to crack a smile at
the unabashed display of Burger King's less corporate side. It
seems there was also a practical reason for scrapping the old
campaign, which ``romanced the food'' and featured more than 300
songs from the 1950s through the 1980s. ``We were running out of
musical styles and about to head into polka,'' said Rob Feakins,
co-creative director at Ammirati Puris Lintas.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the new spots, entitled ``Truck,'' a Burger King
worker dispenses burgers door-to-door from an ice cream-style truck
as a mob of customers anxiously wait curbside for their turn to
order. That does not please the competition _ ice cream vendors who
use their trucks to corner the Burger King guy and drive him out of
the neighborhood. ``Dead end, Whopper boy,'' one says as the group
threatens to pummel the driver with various flavors of ice cream
bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Burger King can stand for taking food, but not ourselves,
very seriously, then this form of self-deprecating humor is
absolutely on target,'' said Jim Watkins, the chain's senior vice
president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign is a departure from Burger King's three-year
food and music campaign. And while the commercials retain the
``when you have it your way, it just tastes better'' tagline, the
overall campaign is intended to focus on customer service as much
as french fries.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King added the new element after seeing a study that
concluded that in recent years fast-food chains had become
functional in their approach and price-driven rather than competing
on franchise brand differentiation. Some of the spots though, use a
light touch to remind consumers that food remains the focus.
</P>
<P>
   In a spot entitled ``Patch,'' for instance, two men are engaged
in a Whopper craving contest in which the contestant who can resist
his desire for the burger longest wins. After the loser breaks
down, he asks how the winner held out. The champ rolls up his
sleeve to disclose a Whopper patch similar to a nicotine
anti-smoking patch. ``Until there's a patch, there's only one real
cure for a Whopper craving _ a mouth-watering Whopper,'' the
voice-over says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the general-market commercials Ammirati Puris
Lintas created, two other agencies added commercials specifically
for ethnic markets. Bromley Aguilar &AMP; Associates, which is owned by
the MacManus Group created spots aimed at Hispanic consumers while
Uniworld Group Inc. created commercials aimed at black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In a spot entitled ``Backyard Barbecue'' from Uniworld, a young
customer orders a Whopper and the cashier asks, ``And how would you
like our dads to fix that?'' Responding to the customer's obvious
confusion, she explains: ``Who knows about backyard barbecue better
than your dad, right? Back there, we've got a whole crew of
flame-broiling fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   The dads, including one sporting a ``kiss the cook'' apron, are
bickering over who makes the best burger. The stunned customer
discovers that one of them is his father. ``Until fathers
everywhere agree,'' the voice-over says, ``you'll agree that there
is nothing like the great taste of the Whopper.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the commercials, seek to create ``an emotional tie
between the brand and the consumer,'' said Rita Young, management
supervisor at Uniworld.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the campaign, Burger King is making systemwide upgrades
intended to persuade consumers to bypass the competitors' parking
lots and drive-thru window lanes. Some changes are subtle.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the company is bringing out a new logo, which will
be used in all advertising, merchandising, uniforms and store
signs. The traditional logo displaying the Burger King name in red
between a yellow bun, was modernized, in part by making the bun
smaller and rounder to give the impression of the burger bursting
out from within it. The logo also introduces a new color element, a
blue crescent, surrounding the bun.
</P>
<P>
   The company's more than 8,000 domestic restaurants will also be
spruced up. In a systemwide upgrade that will take several years to
complete, Burger King is adding bolder colors, like cobalt blue to
accent bright yellow and red in the interior and exterior of its
outlets. At drive-thru lanes, where half of the chain's sales are
generated, an electronic order-confirmation screen will be added
and a help button will allow customers to summon curbside
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   To increase order accuracy, new clear bags will replace paper by
the spring of next year. A newly designed cooking area will
highlight Burger King's flame-broiling method by providing
customers a full view of the process. And to further speed service,
the chain is designating separate areas for order taking, food
pick-up and dispensing of soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, to increase efficiency, Burger King is switching
from an assembly line process in kitchens to one in which a single
worker makes a burger from start to finish. The changes come a year
after Burger King's rival, McDonald's, rolled out a new cooking
system it called ``Made for You.'' That system also customizes
burgers and promises the hottest, fastest food in the industry.
Burger King, of course, insists that its tweaking has nothing to do
with the changes from the folks behind the Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to transform the brand across the U.S. and then
beyond,'' said Kim Miller, a Burger King spokeswoman.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Locked in what one senator called a compassion
competition, Republicans and Democrats struggled Tuesday over
sending billions of dollars of emergency aid to American farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats littered the rhetorical landscape of the Senate with
images of dust bowl days and the great Depression, but they lost an
attempt to add a $10.8 billion package of emergency aid to the
annual agriculture spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tossed that proposal aside in favor of their own $7
billion emergency package, which they would finance by dipping into
next year's projected budget surplus. They showed through
procedural maneuvers late Tuesday that they had the votes to pass
it, probably on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're competing to show our compassion,'' said Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas. ``It's a political bidding contest here. You're
seeing figures made up on both sides of the aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore came to the Capitol to argue the
Democrats' case for more aid, saying conditions were ripe for ``the
worst crisis our farmers have ever experienced,'' and that
Republicans were ``pretending that this tremendous suffering out in
farm country is not taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said ``a
silent death in rural America'' was killing off farms and
destroying farmers' livelihoods. He said that 2,000 farmers in his
state had given up tilling the soil in the past year and that their
farms now lay fallow, creating scenes ``the likes of which we have
not seen since the great Depression.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gramm questioned just how grim the plight of American
farmers is today. He said the Senate was proposing ``spending vast
sums of money when we have no documentation of the magnitude of the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of evidence that farmers are hurting.
International markets for their goods have shrunk, particularly in
Asia, and prices for everything from corn to hogs have plummeted
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But pain and politics have little to do with heat and drought,
despite the designation of both parties' aid packages as
``emergency'' assistance, which allows them to toss aside the
spending rules and take the money out of next year's
much-anticipated budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   There is an argument over how deep the suffering is. Net farm
income will fall less than 1 percent this year, from $44.1 billion
in 1998 to $43.8 billion after this fall's harvest, the Agriculture
Department estimates. That includes more than $12 billion of direct
federal payments to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the economic pain may be self-inflicted. Despite the
drought in many parts of the country, American farmers are growing
far more grain than they can sell, which helps drive prices down.
Nearly a billion bushels of wheat, half the American harvest, will
find no market this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were having a hard time giving it away,'' said Tom Buis, a
vice president of the National Farmers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a brief speech just off the Senate floor, fueled a
competition between the political parties to see who could appear
more generous to farmers _ some of whom work the soil of Iowa, the
scene of the first presidential caucuses next winter _ as he chided
Senate Republicans for their farm policies and fiscal programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have the biggest surpluses in the history of the
world,'' he said, ``and that bunch in control in there is trying to
blow it all on a risky tax scheme while the whole farm sector of
our economy is on the verge of absolute bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   The sponsor of the Republican aid package, Sen. Thad Cochran of
Mississippi, agreed in an interview that ``overproduction, not just
here but all over the world'' is part of what is plaguing American
farmers. Nonetheless, he said, the need for aid exists.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $7 billion in the Cochran bill, $5.6 billion would come
in the form of direct payments to farmers under the system
Republicans created in 1996 to replace the farm-subsidy system long
controlled by Democrats. Much of the rest would come in subsidies
aimed at livestock and dairy farmers, soybean and oilseed producers
and growers of peanuts and beet sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran suggested that the need was not as urgent as the
Democrats argued, and that the aid could wait until the next fiscal
year begins on Oct. 1. ``We're not going to know exactly how much
some farmers lost until after the harvest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And farmers are still spending some of the $6 billion that
Congress lashed together as part of a last-minute $21 billion
emergency spending bill in October.
</P>
<P>
   If the emergency package wins the Senate's approval, the House
would have to consider similar legislation. ``I would be very
supportive of it,'' said Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, chairman of
the House Agriculture Committee. ``Seven billion dollars _ you
can't sneeze at that.''

HOUSE AND SENATE REPUBLICANS WORK ON TAX CUT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeats with both takes, adds art note)  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders struggled Tuesday to put
together a tax-cutting package acceptable to their members in both
the House and the Senate, and were moving toward a new approach to
reducing income tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders met through the day and late into the night behind
closed doors as they tried to reconcile the differing tax bills
passed in the last two weeks by the House and the Senate. The
Republicans said they were intent on completing work Tuesday night
and pushing the final version of their $792 billion tax-cut plan
through both chambers by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever bill emerges from Congress faces a veto by President
Clinton. He says the Republican plan would risk a return of federal
budget deficits, disproportionately favor the wealthy and leave too
little money for Medicare, the military, education and a variety of
other programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the immediate problem facing the Republicans on Tuesday
night was coming up with a package that would hold their own party
together.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, the leadership seemed ready to scrap the approaches
to income tax cuts contained in the House and Senate bills. The
House bill had called for a reduction in all income tax rates of 10
percent. The Senate bill had called for the lowest income tax rate
of 15 percent to be reduced to 14 percent, and for the new 14
percent bracket to be extended to higher income levels.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the House and Senate negotiators were considering an
approach that would reduce each of the income tax rates by 1
percentage point. The current 15 percent rate, for example, would
drop to 14 percent, while the 28 percent rate would fall to 27
percent and the top rate of 39.6 percent would become 38.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators tentatively agreed to phase out the inheritance
tax levied on large estates, a priority for many Republicans in the
House. And they were likely to agree on a reduction in the top rate
on capital gains to 15 percent from 20 percent, members of both
parties said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a package would win strong support from conservative
Republicans. But some of the provisions under consideration _
particularly the 1 percentage point reduction in all income tax
rates _ alienated some moderate Republicans in the Senate, raising
questions about whether the party would have enough votes to pass
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things aren't looking very good from our perspective, and our
understanding is that other moderates are having similar
problems,'' said Nicholas J. Graham, a spokesman for Sen. John H.
Chafee, a moderate Republican from Rhode Island who backs a smaller
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to several of the four Democrats who had voted for the
Republican bill in the Senate said they would also have trouble
with any new plan that reduced all income tax rates, since such an
approach would give a bigger tax cut to those in upper income
brackets than to those in lower brackets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If they can pass the final bill this week, House Speaker Dennis
Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi plan
to sit on the legislation until after Congress returns from its
summer vacation in September and then send it to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the two Republicans are under some pressure from their own
members to adopt a less confrontational strategy, and to seek
negotiations with the White House before forcing a showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that forcing the issue now ``would likely lead to a
hardening of positions that could imperil any possible negotiated
agreement later in the fall,'' Sen. Olympia Snowe, a moderate
Republican from Maine, urged Lott in a letter Tuesday to seek a
cooling-off period over the next month followed by talks with the
White House.

EXPERTS CALL FOR IMPROVED LABELING ON SUGAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A coalition of leading health experts and organizations,
concerned about the climbing rates of obesity and the rising level
of sugar consumption in the United States, asked the Food and Drug
Administration Tuesday to require that food labels provide more
information about added sugar. The group also asked the agency to
set a recommended daily intake for added sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavy consumption of added sugars is contributing to soaring
obesity rates,'' said Dr. Michael Jacobson, executive director of
the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer health
advocacy group based in Washington, at a news conference to
announce the petition.
</P>
<P>
   Food labels already list total sugars, but they do not tell the
consumer which sugar is naturally occurring and which is from an
added ingredient like honey, corn syrup, fructose, white sugar,
brown sugar, fruit juice concentrate and molasses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the label changes, the petition asks the FDA to
adopt the Agriculture Department's figure of 10 teaspoons of added
sugar a day as the maximum recommended intake for a person who can
maintain a healthy weight eating 2,000 calories a day. The average
American consumes 20 teaspoons of added sugar a day.
</P>
<P>
   There are 10 teaspoons of added sugar in a 12-ounce soft drink.
A regular McDonald's shake contains 12 teaspoons of added sugar,
and an 8-ounce container of low-fat, fruit-flavored yogurt contains
7 teaspoons of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the petition, the National Soft Drink Association
said in a news release that ``the human body does not distinguish
between added sugars and naturally occurring sugars,'' making it
unnecessary to distinguish between them on a food label.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marion Nestle, chairwoman of the Department of Nutrition and
Food Studies at New York University, agrees that there is no
difference chemically, but she said ``that misses the point because
fruit juices, for example, have phytochemicals, vitamins, minerals
and fiber while added sugar provides empty calories.''
Phytochemicals may help reduce the risk of some chronic diseases.
Dr. Nestle was among those who signed the petition.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, consumption of sugars and other caloric sweeteners
has risen 28 percent in the United States; more than half come from
soft drinks, baked goods and fruit drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Health professionals say these sweeteners are crowding out
important nutrients like fruits, vegetables, whole grains and dairy
products. In the 1970s children consumed twice as much milk as soft
drinks; today they consume twice as many soft drinks as milk.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no scientific studies linking the increase in
sugar consumption to the increase in obesity, researchers believe
there is a connection. Consumption levels of fat, protein and
alcohol have remained roughly constant for the last 20 years,
according to Department of Agriculture surveys. But Americans are
consuming more calories. In 1977-78 the average American ate 1,854
calories a day; in 1994-96, calorie consumption had risen to 2002.
Between the late 1970s and the early 1990s the percentage of
overweight children rose to 14 from 8 percent, adolescents to 12
from 6 percent and adults to 35 from 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The petition was signed by 39 health organizations, including
the American Public Health Association and the Cornell University
Medical College Nutrition Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration said it would have no comment
until it had reviewed the petition.

UMPIRES FILE CHARGES OVER THEIR LOST JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the umpires' lawyers were tossing every variety of unfair
labor practice charges at Major League Baseball and its two
leagues, real umpires talked Tuesday about the real ramifications
of their mass resignation strategy that led to an unexpected
result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it did cross your mind,'' said Terry Tata, a 27-year
National League umpire, when asked if he realized when he signed a
letter of resignation that it could be accepted. ``But it was a
ploy to try to get them to the table.`
</P>
<P>
   The ploy backfired, resulting in the loss of jobs for 22 umpires
_ Tata and 12 of his NL colleagues and nine in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he blamed Major League Baseball for accepting his
resignation or himself for engaging in a ploy that backfired, Tata
said he blamed baseball for its effort over the last 9 or 10 months
``to try to chip away at us and try to undermine us to put us in
this precarious position.''
</P>
<P>
   Tata and six other umpires appeared at a midtown news
conference, during which lawyers for the Major League Umpires
Association detailed charges they had filed earlier in the day with
the New York regional office of the National Labor Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Silverman, the regional director, said his office would
need four to six weeks to investigate the charges and determine if
they have merit. As part of the investigation, the union has asked
the board to interview many umpires individually.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman said the union did not ask the NLRB to seek an
injunction in federal court that would bar the leagues from letting
the 22 umpires go Sept. 2, which is the effective date of their
resignations. The union can make that request at any time, but if
it did, no action could be taken in time to save the umpires' jobs
as of Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Among its page and a half of charges, the union alleged that the
leagues ``illegally discharged'' the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have put 22 people out on the street,'' Susan Davis, a
lawyer representing the union, said at the news conference,
portraying the leagues' action as ``an attempt to punish the very
supporters of the union who have stood firm.'' She contended that
the mass resignation was concerted action that is protected by
labor law.
</P>
<P>
   Top baseball officials, in a statement, said the charges had no
merit and disclosed that the leagues Tuesday filed a grievance
against the union under the arbitration provision of the labor
agreement. Baseball contends that the ``mass resignation scheme''
violated the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four of the union's 66 members either did not resign or
resigned but then rescinded their resignations. The umpires present
at the news conference, led by Jerry Crawford of the NL, the union
president, represented the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saddened for my two partners, Tom Hallion and Billy
Hohn,'' Tata said. ``Where do they go at age 45? How do they start
a new career. What do they do for a livelihood? That's the part
that bothers me.`
</P>
<P>
   Hohn, an NL umpire for 11 years, said he feels betrayed by the
dissident umpires, Major League Baseball and the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be terminated the way I was terminated, to never answer my
question, `Why?''' he said. ``How should I feel? Where do I go from
here? This isn't like a corporation where I can go sell my services
to another corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rapuano, in response to a question, said he didn't consider
himself lucky to have retained his job. ``I feel I should be on the
list also,'' he said. ``It was totally unfair and unjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Marsh, who will also continue to work after Sept. 2, said
the job loss ``is one of the most distracting things I've ever gone
through,'' adding: ``These are the hardest games I've ever worked
in my life. You're thinking about this and preoccupied with this
all the time. What about these young guys? They just hired some of
these young guys. Now they turn around and fire them. It's
devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   But the umpires were not fired; they signed letters of
resignation and the leagues accepted some, based on the number of
minor league umpires they hired, baseball officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The union, in its complaint to the NLRB, charged that the
leagues terminated the umpires even though they rescinded their
resignations. The umpires took that action last Tuesday after the
union filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. The
new umpires, however, had been hired the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   The union charged that the leagues threatened umpires with the
loss of their jobs or loss of their benefits ``because they engaged
in protected concerted activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Richie Phillips, the union's lawyer and chief negotiator, said
he was told of ``a great deal of infighting'' between officials
from the commissioner's office and the National League when the
league was determining which 13 umpires to let go.
</P>
<P>
   Never happened, said a baseball official.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richie wasn't there,'' said Rob Manfred, executive vice
president for labor relations. ``That's absolutely false. There was
one list prepared. It was prepared by Len Coleman and the National
League staff. There was no negotiation back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, the NL president, was also the subject of talk Tuesday.
Two lawyers connected to baseball said they heard that Coleman had
twice threatened to resign during the selection process. Manfred
said that report, too, was false.

BABY ASTEROID POSES THREAT YEARS HENCE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The camer-shy asteroid visited last week by a U.S.
spacecraft is divulging some of its secrets: It may be related to a
well-known, larger space rock orbiting beyond Mars, and the smaller
asteroid's orbital changes may make it a threat to Earth in a few
thousand years, scientists said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said the spacecraft Deep Space 1 flew within 16
miles of the asteroid Braille on Thursday and managed to record
important data on its nature, even though the craft missed taking
close-up pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The craft's infrared spectroscope, an instrument that breaks
down white light into its component colors, looked at light
reflected from the asteroid and returned clues about its mineral
composition. Braille's readings indicate its composition is very
close to that of the giant asteroid Vesta, which has a surface that
is rare for asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   Vesta was only the fourth asteroid discovered when it was
sighted in 1807. It and a few tiny asteroids near it have surfaces
that indicate they were subjected to volcanic activity and
tremendous heat, rare among the thousands of rocky bodies that
orbit in a belt between Mars and Jupiter, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Braille, which orbits in a different part of the solar
system, seems to have a surface of the same material, based upon
comparisons of their spectral signatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remarkably close match,'' Dr. Larry Soderblom of the
U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Ariz., said Tuesday at a
briefing at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
``There is a very high probability that they have the same
composition,'' said Soderblom, the lead scientist on the
spectrometer experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eileen Ryan, an asteroid expert at the New Mexico Highlands
University in Las Vegas, said this meant Braille could be a piece
broken off of Vesta or that both bodies were once part of a larger,
parent object that broke apart early in the solar system's history.
</P>
<P>
   Vesta, which is 310 miles in diameter, has a giant hole punched
in one side that scientists believe is the result of a massive
collision that threw chunks of it in all directions. About 6
percent of meteorites recovered on Earth have a composition similar
to Vesta's, and they, and possibly now Braille, could be debris
from this collision, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   It is probable that Braille achieved such speed that it was
booted out of the asteroid belt and into a different orbit, a
near-Earth orbit, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert M. Nelson, chief project scientist for Deep Space 1,
said the results were so unexpected that they almost made up for
the spacecraft's missing close-up pictures of Braille. ``These are
astounding results, very exciting,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marc D. Rayman, chief mission engineer, said the spacecraft,
which navigates itself, missed getting pictures of Braille as it
sped by at 35,000 mph because of the asteroid's small size, odd
shape, a poor sun angle and limitations in the camera. The
spacecraft found Braille to be a peanut-shaped object 1.3 miles
long and 0.6 miles wide, the smallest interplanetary body ever
approached by a spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The asteroid was in total shadow, the sun was below and
because of its angle of rotation, the camera was fooled into
thinking there was nothing there,'' Rayman said. The craft found
the asteroid 15 minutes after the close pass.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Space 1, launched last October, fulfilled its primary
mission of testing and verifying 12 technologies that will be used
on future, low-cost space missions, Rayman said. The current
mission is scheduled to end in September.

 &HT;    Pirates' Benson silences Braves
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The Braves could have used an easy game Tuesday
night, and might have expected it against the Pittsburgh Pirates,
who are fourth in the NL Central and had lost five of their first
six meetings with the Braves this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates had lost 11 times in the past 11 games to the
Braves' ``Fab Four'' pitchers dating to April 7, 1998. They'd never
beaten Kevin Millwood in three career tries. But this time they had
rookie pitcher Kris Benson going on the mound, and he got the best
of a pitching matchup that for much of the game mimicked the
Braves' situation in the standings _ tight.
</P>
<P>
   A Braves lineup that had scored 20 runs in its past two games
managed only one off Benson in eight innings and lost 7-1. The loss
knocked the Braves out of a tie for first in the NL East, pending
the outcome of Tuesday's Mets-Brewers game.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood gave up only four hits, but all were home runs. After
allowing only one home run in the month of July, Millwood's first
start of August featured a career-high four _ one each by Kevin
Young, Al Martin, Brian Giles and Warren Morris. He lost the duel
to his fellow 24-year-old, right-handed, Southern counterpart, who
was his polar opposite on the hype scale.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood was an 11th-round pick out of Bessemer City, N.C., who
toiled away in the minor leagues for years before catching some
front office attention. Benson, a Kennesaw native, was the first
pick of the 1996 draft out of Clemson, and the Pirates couldn't get
him through the minor leagues fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who has 40 fewer major-league starts than Millwood, was
coming off his first major-league complete game in a 5-1 win over
the Mets. The four starts before that, he'd gone 1-3 with a 10.52
ERA. The more recent version of Benson is the one who met the
Braves on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves managed only a couple of hits by Bret Boone and a
couple of walks off Benson in the first five innings, which they
converted to a 1-0 lead on an RBI double by Boone in the third
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, who twice has carried no-hitters into the seventh
inning this season, kept the Pirates off base for the first four
innings before he gave up a home run to Young to lead off the
fifth. It would be a harbinger of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   He set down three in a row but then did the same thing with two
out into the sixth inning, hanging a breaking ball to Martin for a
2-1 Pirates lead.

PANEL ORDERS GOVERNMENT TO PAY $16 MILLION FOR FILM OF KENNEDY
ASSASSINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Deletes last graf starting: The government faces, etc., because
cases are not similar) (sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A divided federal arbitration panel announced on
Tuesday that the government must pay the heirs of Abraham Zapruder
$16 million for his film of President John F. Kennedy's
assassination, the highest price ever paid for a historical
American artifact.
</P>
<P>
   The award, which cannot be appealed, was about halfway between
the $30 million sought by the Zapruder family and the $1 million
offered by the Justice Department as compensation for the
quarter-inch-wide, six-foot long strip of film that experts said
was too fragile to safely run through a projector.
</P>
<P>
   The government acquired Zapruder's 26-second film last year
under a federal law that requires all records of the Kennedy
assassination to be transferred to the National Archives for
preservation, research and other noncommercial purposes. The
government had acknowledged that the Zapruder family was entitled
to fair reimbursement as owners of private property taken by the
government for public use.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, two of the panel's three members, Arlin M. Adams and
Kenneth R. Feinberg, wrote in their majority decision that the film
made by Zapruder, as the Kennedy motorocade rolled through Dallas
on Nov. 22, 1963, was ``a unique historical item of unprecedented
worth.'' A third member of the panel, Walter E. Dellinger,
dissented. He said that the price set by the majority ``was simply
too large an amount in light of the evidence in the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellinger said that an award of $3 million to $5 million would
have been more realistic. He said that since the Zapruder family
already controls the licensing of images on the film, the only
issue was the value of the original film strip as a collectible
object.
</P>
<P>
   Dellinger said that there have been no documented sales of any
other historically significant original film strips, a finding
which he said, ``strongly suggests that a camera original
ordinarily has little independent value.''
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's majority said that they were persuaded that the
film was immensely valuable by experts hired by lawyers for the
Zapruder family who testified at a two-day hearing in May. The
experts, former employees of auction houses like Sotheby's and
Christie's, said that the film was a one-of-a-kind historical
relic.
</P>
<P>
   The majority decision concluded that the film's worth was
further enhanced by the soaring prices commanded for Kennedy
historical memorabilia in recent years, like the Louis XVI desk on
which President Kennedy signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963,
which sold at auction in 1996 for $1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The majority said it was also guided by the astronomical prices
paid recently for other historically unique artifacts, like the
$30.8 million paid in 1994 by Bill Gates, the co-founder and
chairman of Microsoft, for the Leonardo da Vinci Codex, a rare
notebook containing more than 300 illustrations and scientific
writings by the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Zapruder, a Dallas dress manufacturer, died of cancer in 1970 at
the age of 66.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued on Tuesday by a family company, LMH, the
Zapruder family said, ``We believer the result reached by the
arbitration panel is fair and reasonable.'' The statement said the
family was pursuing a permanent arrangement to transfer licensing
rights to the film, which the family retained, to a public
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. Bennett, a lawyer for the family, said on Tuesday that
he was pleased by the decision. ``The family and the government
agreed that arbitration was the most dignified way to satisfy the
constitutional requirement of just compensation,'' he said. ``This
approach assured that the National Archives will possess the film
for the benefit of all the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   David W. Ogden, acting assistant attorney general for the
Justice Department's Civil Division, offered no assessment of the
amount of the award. He said in a statement, ``The resolution of
these issues insures that this evidence of one of the most tragic
events in American history will be protected for scholarly and
research uses.''
</P>
<P>
   The award was a clear-cut victory for the Zapruder family. The
government offered to pay the family $3 million before the
arbitration proceedings began, rejecting the Zapruder's proposal to
settle for $18.5 million, said several people who followed the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The final award was much closer to the family's settlement
figure. The family will be awarded an interest payment, which some
lawyers said would increase the final award amount to about $17
million. But the family must pay taxes and lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the price for the film is the most ever paid for an
historical American artifact. An original print of the Declaration
of Independence sold for more than $2 million, a manuscript of
President Abraham Lincoln's ``House Divided'' speech opposing
slavery sold for $1.5 million and President Dwight D. Eisenhower's
D-Day order sending allied troops into Europe during World War II
sold for $200,000.

 &HT;    Texas cuts welfare cases but lags in jobs program
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Only about one-fourth of Texans who were on the
welfare rolls last year worked or were training for a job, a rate
that placed Texas near the bottom among the states, according to
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   But because Texas trimmed its welfare caseload by nearly a
fourth between 1995 and 1997 _ one of the best records among the
states _ it cleared a key federal welfare-to-work hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1996 federal welfare reform law, anyone who qualified
for welfare benefits got them. But under the new rules, the federal
government gives each state a fixed amount of welfare money,
regardless of how many people qualify for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   States have some flexibility in how they use their federal
dollars, but their welfare plans must include time limits and work
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago on Tuesday, President Clinton touted the welfare
reform law as a success, noting that there are fewer people on
welfare now than at any time in the last 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that welfare recipients are either working or in
training, the federal government sets ``work participation'' rates
that every state must meet in order to avoid a cut in its share of
federal money. The rate, 30 percent for 1998, will go up 5 percent
every year until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Texas's 25 percent mark in 1998 fell short. But the ultimate
goal of welfare reform is to get people off the rolls and into
solid jobs, so the federal government allows states to use their
caseload reduction as a credit against the participation rate.
Because Texas cut its rolls by almost 25 percent, it had to meet
only a 5 percent participation rate.
</P>
<P>
   After factoring in shrinking welfare rolls, all 50 states met
the federal standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy that Texas met the target. But we're even happier
that Texas is among the highest ranking states in reducing rolls,''
said Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, that's our primary goal: to move people off of
welfare and into work and self-sufficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, noted that only one-third of the states
needed the caseload reduction credit to make the grade, and that
many states have both cut their welfare rolls and achieved high
work participation rates.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Bresette, a welfare expert at the Center for Public
Policy Priorities in Austin, said statistics such as the ones
released this week raise questions rather than answer them.
Bresette said it's too soon to judge the success of welfare reform
in Texas or anywhere else, particularly because the American
economy is so strong.

   ``My children used to tease me,'' Evelyn Hannon said the other
day from her office in Toronto. ```Digitally deficient,' they
called me. Well, not anymore, ha-ha-ha.''
</P>
<P>
   To see why she allows herself this little chuckle, call up her
Web site, www.journeywoman.com. A lot of women are now traveling
alone _ for business, pleasure and, increasingly, a combination of
the two.
</P>
<P>
   And while some airlines and a few other corporate services have
put up Web sites to appeal to female travelers, Ms. Hannon is way
out front with Journeywoman, a Web site and electronic magazine
that went on line two years ago and now is able to attract major
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is clogged with commercial hype and bald-faced
hucksterism. But one of its sturdier glories is that a determined
low-budget entrepreneur like Ms. Hannon can emerge as a significant
force by taking a singularly good idea and applying intelligence,
diligence and focus to make it work. As an exercise in comparison,
peruse Journeywoman, and then call up one of the few other online
sites for female travelers. Not to pick on Delta Air Lines, which
at least is making an effort in the field, but compare
Journeywoman.com to Delta's Executive Woman's Travel Network site
at www.delta-air.com/womenexecs. Not even a close call, right?
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 travelers from the United States, Canada and many
other nations have visited Journeywoman since it went on line. They
are attracted to its clear organization and no-nonsense
female-centered travel tips, consumer news, feature articles and
even classified ads. Enough of them are regular visitors that the
Indigo Books chain in Canada, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, a bank, a
couple of national tourist boards and an insurance company are
among its advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Feature articles in the current issue include one on how to deal
with medical problems while traveling abroad. Another has the
headline: ``Ms. Biz: Her Culturally Correct Food Facts.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a related Web site, www.HERmail.net, that allows female
travelers to seek advice one-on-one from other women in Ms.
Hannon's worldwide network of correspondents. ``For example,
someone might write, `I'm going to Tokyo and I have three business
meetings, but I'm really not sure what's appropriate to wear.'''
Ms. Hannon said. ``Well, one of our businesswomen in Japan will
reply with the correct information.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hannon, 59, has been traveling extensively since she was
divorced in the early 1980s. ``I'd come home and have notebooks
filled with tidbits of information from women I met while
traveling, including the growing numbers of businesswomen,'' she
recalled. She also collected names, addresses and phone numbers
that over the years helped her to build a network of hundreds of
women who traveled frequently and like to help one another out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I began, I wasn't thinking about making money at all.
Women are networkers, and that's what I was doing,'' she said.
After a while, she thought about organizing her network better. ''I
sent letters to about 100 women I had met around the world and
asked them to send me their best travel tips and travel stories. I
also asked them to forward my letter to other women travelers they
knew. I kind of collected this stuff, thinking maybe it would be a
book someday. But within a month, I was inundated with responses.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, she put out a printed newsletter, Journeywoman, with
the hope that it might become profitable someday. The first issue
had 20 pages _ no color _ and was mailed to 2,000 women. Within a
year, it had a circulation of 6,000 and was losing more money with
each issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting requests for subscriptions from places like Hong
Kong and Paris,'' she said. ''I wasn't making any money. In fact,
it was costing me a fortune for postage.''
</P>
<P>
   So, though she had no computer skills, she decided to take
Journeywoman on line. ''I thought, why not just take a chance and
step into the abyss. No one else was doing it, and I thought it
just might work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is profitable already. ``As soon as advertisers began seeing
that this was actually a juicy niche market, they came on,'' Ms.
Hannon said, adding: ``The basic idea just came from a female
thing. Women love to network with each other, and it was a matter
of harnessing that energy for travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Side Trips
</P>
<P>
   Frequent travelers who forget to check for hidden charges in
car-rental agreements can find annoying surprises at the return
counter. On Monday, at the Tampa, Fla., airport, a bill presented
after returning a car to the Avis Rent a Car counter included a 10
percent surcharge for a ``concession recovery fee,'' as well as a
surcharge of $2.05 a day for something listed as ``battery/tire''
and another 35 cents a day for ``vehicle license fee recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attempts to call the Avis customer-service ``800''
number listed on the bill for an explanation of these charges
proved fruitless because the line was always busy. Imagine, though,
a restaurant that tacked a surcharge onto your bill to help the
proprietors recover their expenses for paying rent and buying pots
and pans.

traveling, including the growing numbers of businesswomen,'' she
recalled. She also collected names, addresses and phone numbers
that over the years helped her to build a network of hundreds of
women who traveled frequently and like to help one another out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I began, I wasn't thinking about making money at all.
Women are networkers, and that's what I was doing,'' she said.
After a while, she thought about organizing her network better. ''I
sent letters to about 100 women I had met around the world and
asked them to send me their best travel tips and travel stories. I
also asked them to forward my letter to other women travelers they
knew. I kind of collected this stuff, thinking maybe it would be a
book someday. But within a month, I was inundated with responses.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, she put out a printed newsletter, Journeywoman, with
the hope that it might become profitable someday. The first issue
had 20 pages _ no color _ and was mailed to 2,000 women. Within a
year, it had a circulation of 6,000 and was losing more money with
each issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting requests for subscriptions from places like Hong
Kong and Paris,'' she said. ''I wasn't making any money. In fact,
it was costing me a fortune for postage.''
</P>
<P>
   So, though she had no computer skills, she decided to take
Journeywoman on line. ''I thought, why not just take a chance and
step into the abyss. No one else was doing it, and I thought it
just might work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is profitable already. ``As soon as advertisers began seeing
that this was actually a juicy niche market, they came on,'' Ms.
Hannon said, adding: ``The basic idea just came from a female
thing. Women love to network with each other, and it was a matter
of harnessing that energy for travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Side Trips
</P>
<P>
   Frequent travelers who forget to check for hidden charges in
car-rental agreements can find annoying surprises at the return
counter. On Monday, at the Tampa, Fla., airport, a bill presented
after returning a car to the Avis Rent a Car counter included a 10
percent surcharge for a ``concession recovery fee,'' as well as a
surcharge of $2.05 a day for something listed as ``battery/tire''
and another 35 cents a day for ``vehicle license fee recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attempts to call the Avis customer-service ``800''
number listed on the bill for an explanation of these charges
proved fruitless because the line was always busy. Imagine, though,
a restaurant that tacked a surcharge onto your bill to help the
proprietors recover their expenses for paying rent and buying pots
and pans.

WHERE SOME SEE RUSTING FACTORIES, GOVERNMENT SEES SOURCE OF SOLAR
ENERGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., Conn., N.J., N.Y., Mass.)   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department has a new idea for what to do
with derelict, polluted urban industrial properties that no one
wants to pay to clean up: cover them with solar panels.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson will unveil the first step in a
project to use solar panels at polluted sites to make much-needed
electricity without disturbing buried contaminants, on Wednesday in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The department, the city and the local electric utility,
Commonwealth Edison, will announce that they have induced a solar
panel manufacturer to set up shop on a 17-acre former dump site.
The city and utility have promised to buy $8 million worth of solar
panels, some of which, department officials say, will cover
derelict sites and feed energy into the local electric grid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going from the worst old stuff to the best clean stuff,''
Richardson said in a telephone interview. ``It's a win-win for
everyone, because it addresses job creation, air quality and
contaminated sites.''
</P>
<P>
   The panels produce electricity with no pollution. Chicago plans
to use some of its cells to light parks, municipal buildings and
transit stations.
</P>
<P>
   Panels installed on contaminated sites can be trucked away and
set up elsewhere if a better use is found for the land, officials
involved in the project said.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department is discussing similar projects in Los
Angeles, Stamford, Conn., Washington and other cities. It is also
working with the Regional Plan Association in New York to look for
suitable sites in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. And it is
involved in a study of whether a closed landfill in a treeless area
of Babylon, N.Y., would be a good place for windmills.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago site is on North Sacramento Avenue, on the West
Side, and was used for years for demolition material and other
debris. The city closed down the operator, Sacramento Crushing, in
1996 because of environmental violations, and eventually seized the
property and spent $9 million in the last 18 months on cleanup. The
city has cleaned up a building on the site and is giving the solar
manufacturer, Spire Corp., of Bedford, Mass., a low lease rate on
5,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all sorts of benefits for operating there, from tax
advantages to rent advantages to labor cost advantages,'' said
Spire president and chief executive Roger Little.
</P>
<P>
   Little said of the site, ``it's not like a toxic waste site, but
it's probably something you don't want to build a nursery school
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental laws generally require a cleanup before the land
can be re-used, which sometimes dooms such sites to abandonment,
but Energy Department officials say they are confident that
environmental regulators will allow re-use for solar energy
production if the use does not disturb the contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reicher, the assistant secretary for renewable energy, said
that in places where the soil was contaminated with toxic chemicals
_ which is true in hundreds of thousands of acres of
``brownfields'' in cities around the country _ installing racks of
solar panels did not require digging in the dirt. Once erected, the
panels require minimal human intervention, he said, ``just a worker
with a roll of paper towel and some Windex once a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Solar panels would be a good use for sites in the Superfund
waste cleanup program, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, department officials say, putting solar cells in
urban settings bypasses bottlenecks in the power distribution
system by generating supplemental electricity where it is needed.
Utilities generally do not build big generators in urban centers,
partly because of pollution and because few people want to live
near a power plant.
</P>
<P>
   Spire's main business is building equipment for factories that
assemble solar panels. Little said 140 factories in 42 countries
use his company's machines. The Chicago plant, which Spire will
own, can produce one megawatt a year of panels if operated one
shift a day, but can make three megawatts if operated around the
clock, he said; if it does, it will employ 100 people. It builds
2-foot by 4-foot panels, each of which produces 50 watts in full
sunlight, enough to run a single 50-watt lightbulb. A typical
installation would be 60 panels, or 3 kilowatts, enough to run an
average house, he said, and would cost about $30,000, including the
equipment to convert the electricity to standard household voltage.
</P>
<P>
   The Reilly School, a Chicago elementary school, will have a
10-kilowatt array on its roof.
</P>
<P>
   While the installations are small (A conventional gas turbine or
coal-fired boiler's output is measured in the tens or hundreds of
megawatts), the solar systems have the benefit of producing peak
output at the same time as peak demand, since both are driven by
the hot summer sun. Little also pointed out that building his
assembly plant in an urban area minimizes transportation costs for
his panels, which are heavy and require careful handling.

A RACE IN CALIFORNIA LOOKS LESS CERTAIN 
THE FIRST STATE IS RUNNING SECOND 
TAKE THE MONEY AND NARROW THE FIELD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Del., N.H., Mass.)  (nk) 
 By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the death last month of Rep. George E. Brown Jr., the
Democrat who represented California's 42nd Congressional District
for almost three decades, Republicans figured that come the Sept.
21 special election to replace him, they would have a good shot at
reclaiming the district and, if successful, would strengthen their
narrow hold on the House. Brown had barely been able to fend off
some of his Republican challengers.
</P>
<P>
   But on second thought, Republican leaders say the district,
which includes San Bernardino and surrounding cities just east of
Los Angeles, may not be such an easy target.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as more Hispanic residents have moved in,
Democratic registration has climbed above 50 percent. Republican
registration has slipped below 35 percent, reduced in part by the
closing of some local military bases, traditional wellsprings of
Republican strength.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican with the most promise to succeed Brown, state
Sen. Jim Brulte, a legislative power in Sacramento, ruminated a bit
about getting into the race. But in the end he backed out, to the
deep disappointment of national party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They had assiduously courted him, figuring that if he could win
the special election, he would be well positioned next year to win
a full two-year term. No other Republican candidate of his
political stature has indicated a desire to get into the September
contest, in which Republicans, Democrats and independents will
compete together, with a Nov. 16 runoff if no one gets a majority.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes what looks like worse news for Republicans, and bad
news for the couple of Democrats and an independent in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's wife, Marta Macias Brown, has scheduled a news
conference Wednesday in San Bernardino at which she is expected to
announce her candidacy. If so, she will start out as a prohibitive
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Widows who seek to succeed their husbands in the House usually
win.
</P>
<P>
   The problem after that will be the 2000 election. Though widows
usually win special elections, they usually lose the next time
around.
</P>
<P>
   The First State Is Running Second
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Delaware passed a law mandating that its presidential
primaries be held four days after New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation primary, the two states have been feuding.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire view is that the Granite State has always been
accorded the honor of going first by at least seven days and no
other state should crowd in.
</P>
<P>
   The view from Delaware, known as the First State, is that no
state should have a lock on primary scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   For Election 2000, New Hampshire has urged all candidates to
pledge to avoid the Delaware primary _ under pain of punishment by
New Hampshire voters. Threats along that line in earlier elections
had only moderate success. But this time around, more and more
candidates are taking the pledge not to campaign in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   So on Monday Delaware Republicans canceled their primary and
began planning to hold caucuses or perhaps a state convention, a
switch permitted under the state's election laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``To continue with a primary that almost every major candidate
in both parties is boycotting accomplishes very little,'' said
Basil Battaglia, the state party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware Democrats, who refused Republican entreaties to rewrite
the primary law so the feud with New Hampshire could be defused,
say they will not be intimidated by New Hampshire. They intend to
hold a primary four days after New Hampshire votes _ with candidate
participation, they hope, but without it if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Money And Narrow the Field
</P>
<P>
   It is an old political ploy for incumbents: Raise enough money
early enough and possible challengers will think twice before
taking you on.
</P>
<P>
   Which probably helps explain why Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., who got a bit of a re-election scare back in 1994 from a
well-financed candidate, has been raising money for more than a
year for his seventh re-election bid, in 2000 _ even though no
challenger is yet in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy reported on Monday that so far he has pulled in almost
$2.5 million, much of it in Massachusetts, but much from other
states, too, a measure as much as anything of the national stature
he has achieved by pushing a broad spread of social and economic
issues.
</P>
<P>
   If the money ploy works, Kennedy will be more than just
home-free. He will be free to travel all over the country, using
his huge fund-raising and crowd-drawing ability to help raise
campaign cash and support for Democratic senators, or Democratic
candidates running for the Senate, who face strong Republican
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   This being politics, what goes around comes around. Those
Kennedy helps today will be those who help him tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The system works the same way at the state level, of course,
which helps explain why Gov. Gray Davis of California, a Democrat
who has been in office seven months and does not face re-election
for three more years, reported on Monday that he had already packed
his campaign kitty with more than $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials in the state say that in his first six months
in office, Davis collected more money and held more fund-raising
events than any other newly elected governor in California history.
</P>
<P>
   Such prodigious raising of campaign cash may very well drive off
all potential challengers, or it may enable Gray to build up a
hugely handy reservoir of good will with fellow Democrats. But, in
the meantime, he is catching a lot of flak.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and some public interest groups say Gray runs the
risk of becoming too cozy with special interests who are major
donors. Democrats say they wish he would spend as much time in
Sacramento pushing the party's stalled legislative agenda as he
does scouring the state for money.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's response to the Republicans is that he is his own
man. His response to Democrats is that he does what he does only to
help the party.

TEKELEC PROFITS STAY IN DOLDRUMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. _ Telecommunications equipment supplier
Tekelec, whose stock plunged this year because of earnings
disappointments, is expected to issue a downbeat profit report.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus of five brokers surveyed by First Call projects a
50 percent fall in second-quarter earnings to 7 cents a share for
Tekelec, which produces switching equipment for transferring data
across networks and diagnostic tools to improve network
performance. In the year-ago quarter, the Calabasas-based firm
reported earnings of $8.4 million, or 14 cents a share, on sales of
$42.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tekelec closed Tuesday at $9.75 a share, down 56 percent from
its 1999 high of $22.50 in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   The issue plunged in early February after fourth-quarter
earnings fell short of Wall Street estimates, dropping from $20 to
$10.50 in less than three weeks. At the time, the company blamed
the shortfall on several sales that had not gone through as
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Shares were pounded again in mid-March after Tekelec warned it
would miss first-quarter estimates because of lower-than-expected
sales of switching and diagnostic products.
</P>
<P>
   The issue bottomed out at $6.75 on April 9 but then began
rebounding. The subsequent announcement of a 70 percent decline in
earnings to $1.6 million, or 3 cents a share, had no effect on the
stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Stock in Tekelec, which planned to report earnings after the
market closed Wednesday, has been traded in the $10-to-$11 range in
recent weeks. The company's last major announcement came in
mid-April, when it disclosed it would buy Texas-based IEX Corp.,
which produces hardware and software packages for telecom
companies, for $163 million.

NEW YORK LEGISLATURE STARTS TO PASS BUDGET PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Four months overdue, the Legislature on Tuesday
night began passing a $73.3 billion state budget that was incubated
in partisan anger and hatched in weary compromise. It provides
large increases in aid to schools and child care for the poor, and
makes none of the cuts originally sought by Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly and the state Senate passed the first of the 11
huge spending bills comprising the budget on Tuesday evening, but
it appeared that they would not beat the midnight deadline to avert
tying the record for tardiness, set two years ago. As of Tuesday,
the budget was 125 days late, one shy of the record. State law
requires approval of the budget before April 1, the start of the
fiscal year, but New York has violated that law 15 years in a row,
a record of frustration not approached by any other state.
</P>
<P>
   The budget mostly split the difference between the proposals
made early this year by Pataki, a Republican, and Assembly Speaker
Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and the final product resembled the
middle ground taken by the Senate Republican Majority Leader Joseph
Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   The three leaders also agreed Tuesday to allow financially
troubled Nassau County to impose a 1 percent tax on real estate
sales over the next 18 months, as Democrats dropped their demand
that the county's finances be overseen by a state control board. In
an unrelated matter that had been linked to the Nassau deal in
negotiations, lawmakers also agreed to renew a property tax break
that will save the owners of 280,000 New York City co-ops and
condominiums an average of $580 a year, a provision that expired a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   This year's state budget process was conducted in the long
shadow cast last year, when the Legislature passed a budget with
little input from the governor only to see him veto $1.6 billion in
spending items, most of them sought by the Democrats. For months,
Silver insisted that the governor promise not to veto items this
year, while Pataki refused to get involved in the budget
negotiations. Real progress began only in mid-June, when the
governor joined the talks, and he eventually agreed not to make
broad use of vetoes, in return for limits on the overall size of
the budget.
</P>
<P>
   The brittle relationship between Silver and Pataki helped drag
out the process. Between calling each other names and accusing each
other of leading the state to ruin, each man and his aides
contended that the other could not be trusted. It did not help
matters that under a new law that raised legislators' salaries,
their paychecks were withheld for as long as the budget was late.
In the end Tuesday, everyone involved expressed something closer to
grim satisfaction than elation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to negotiate in good faith,'' Bruno said. ``You have
to have the will to do a budget, and in my mind the will hasn't
been there until these last several weeks.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The strong economy has made it possible, for the third year in a
row, for the state to raise spending significantly, even while
cutting taxes. But this year's spending plan is more cautious than
the last two, which were approved as Pataki ran for re-election.
State lawmakers are being less aggressive this year than in the
last two years on both spending and tax cuts, in part because the
state is still absorbing the commitments made in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki achieved one of his major goals for the year, an
agreement not to spend the $1.8 billion surplus accumulated in the
last fiscal year, which will be saved to help the state pay for tax
cuts that will take effect next year. New York, which had just a
few hundred million dollars' cash reserve at the beginning of 1998,
now has nearly $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor clearly did not reach his other main objective,
to keep the increase in spending within the rate of inflation, now
under 2 percent. Overall spending is projected to grow by 3.8
percent, though the true number is likely to be smaller because
lawmakers routinely overestimate the costs of programs. The state's
general fund, the part generated by state taxes and fees that is
most closely watched by independent fiscal analysts, is projected
to grow by 2.4 percent, to $37.4 billion, and it would be higher if
not for some accounting maneuvers that moved some spending out of
the general fund.

THOMAS TO BUY CONTROL OF CBA WITH EYE TOWARD NBA LINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Isiah Thomas agreed Tuesday to buy control of the Continental
Basketball Association for $10 million. He hopes to expand it from
nine teams and turn it into the minor league of the National
Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan succeeds, it will give the NBA a farm system where
it can nurture the increasing number of teen-age players entering
the league if commissioner David Stern imposes a minimum age to
play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all wrestling with how to satisfy the young players
coming into the league,'' said Thomas, the former Detroit Piston
All-Star, during a conference call. ``Baseball and hockey have
always had an answer with their minor leagues. Now we have to deal
with how to develop them into the players they can become.''
</P>
<P>
   In discussions with the National Basketball Players Association,
the NBA has proposed setting an age limit of 20. If the CBA were
the official minor league, it could be the alternative for placing
18- and 19-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems the players association has with setting
an age limit is telling these players that if you can't play in the
NBA, you can't play anywhere else,'' said NBA deputy commissioner
Russ Granik. ``If there's a minor league, there would be a place
for 18- and 19-year-olds to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Granik said the league's conversations with Thomas had
been preliminary, and Granik said he was uncertain whether the NBA
would establish a minor league. ``We let Isiah know that we want to
continue our relationship with the CBA, and we're open to
discussing other things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The CBA has been the NBA's official development league since
1980, providing a source of mostly second-tier players. But there
have been exceptions, like John Starks and Anthony Mason, who
became stars with the New York Knicks. Since 1978, there have been
514 CBA player call-ups to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   If the CBA evolves into the NBA's minor league, it could develop
the basketball abilities of players who choose not to enter
college, and might help them prepare psychologically and
financially to cope with playing in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recommend that anyone not go to school,'' said Thomas,
who left Indiana University early. ``This league would hopefully
use a lot of programs with kids to continue their education.''
</P>
<P>
   But an NBA-sanctioned minor league that would welcome teen-age
players might hurt the efforts of colleges to attract and keep
players. A National Collegiate Athletic Association working group
that studied freshman eligibility for male basketball players
recently recommended pegging scholarships to each college's
graduation rate and awarding only four new scholarships a year. But
it stopped short of recommending a return to freshman
ineligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Renfro, an NCAA spokesman, said there had been talk within
the organization about the CBA becoming the NBA's minor league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say it would be a problem because it would diminish the
talent pool for college basketball,'' he said. ``But others say it
wouldn't be such a bad thing because we would start recruiting
prospects who are more interested in education than in playing
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas will have to run the CBA, regardless of its relationship
with the NBA His other goals include increasing revenue, expanding
domestically and possibly internationally and making unspecified
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was approached last January by CBA commissioner Gary
Hunter about buying an expansion franchise in Detroit. Within 15
minutes, Hunter said, Thomas asked, ``What if I bought the whole
league?''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' vision was originally trained on buying an NBA
franchise; he was rebuffed in a bid to buy majority control of the
Toronto Raptors in 1997, when he was the team's executive vice
president and general manager. Now, he said, he doesn't have the
money to buy an NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next ground to pursue was the minor leagues,'' he said. He
looked at baseball and Arena Football League teams before settling
on the CBA.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' acquisition will change the CBA structure from one in
which about 40 individuals own the nine teams to a single entity
that will control virtually every aspect of the league from player
negotiations to marketing. The soon-to-be former owners will take
management positions.
</P>
<P>
   The single-entity structure is used by the Women's NBA and Major
League Soccer, which has team investors but is centrally
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he would remain as a studio analyst for NBC's NBA
broadcasts. ``There's no conflict,'' he said. ``I'm not coaching or
being a GM.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Markey, an NBC Sports spokesman, said, ``His involvement in
the CBA will not have an impact on what viewers expect from him
regarding the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether NBC would re-examine Thomas' role if the CBA
becomes the NBA's minor league, Markey said, ``We'll cross that
bridge when we come to it.''  &QL;

HOUSE APPROVES BILL RESTRICTING ONLINE LIQUOR SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House overwhelmingly passed a bill Tuesday that
would restrict online liquor sales, overriding objections from
California lawmakers that the proposal favored liquor wholesalers
over small wineries and breweries trying to broaden their reach
through electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed 310-112, would allow state attorneys
general to go to federal court to prosecute out-of-state companies
that violate state restrictions on alcohol sales. Similar
legislation has already passed the Senate, attached to an
appropriation bill.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposal was largely intended to reduce the
availability of alcohol to minors shopping online, the issue became
much broader, pitting large liquor distributors that often have
state-licensed monopolies against budding small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Though the White House has generally opposed any new regulations
on electronic commerce, it has not yet voiced an official position
on the House or Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   States can regulate the import and sale of liquor within their
borders, and almost every state prohibits or limits the direct
shipment of alcohol from out of state to residents or unlicensed
sellers. But attorneys general have been reluctant to take action
against growing mail-order and online sales because there was no
effective way for them to prosecute out-of-state companies.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressively opposing the bill were representatives from
California and other areas with wineries and breweries that are
often unable to distribute their products through traditional
wholesalers licensed by states.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 1,600 small wineries in the country, vying
for limited shelf space in traditional retail outlets. Many of the
vintners have gone online.
</P>
<P>
   Prohibiting online sales ``will restrict interstate commerce and
limit consumers' choice around the country,'' said Rep. Lois Capps,
D-Calif., who argued that the bill put unfair restrictions on
``law-abiding citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a bill to cut down on underage drinking, I'd vote
for it,'' Mrs. Capps said. ``But it's not. It's an attack on our
vintners.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., who sponsored the bill,
disputed that assertion, saying the proposal would affect only
illegal sales.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., the House
should extend the same power to attorneys general trying to enforce
their gun laws on out-of-state sellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to give attorneys general in our states the
ability to protect citizens from a $20 bottle of Cabernet, then
they ought to be able to protect them equally from AK-47s, Tec-9s
and other weapons of mass destruction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lofgren proposed two amendments to broaden the bill to gun
sales, but both were ruled non-germane.
</P>
<P>
   The House did approve an amendment by two Republicans, Reps.
Robert Goodlatte of Virginia and Christopher Cox of California,
specifying that the bill does not give states any authority to
impose new or discriminatory taxes on Internet liquor sales.

LEFT BEHIND SOARS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carol Nelson and her church friends made plans a month ago. They
will go to dinner around 8:30 tonight, then head over to Jesus
Chapel Discount Bookstore in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   There, they will stand in line, for hours if necessary, to be
among the first in the United States to buy a copy of ``Assassins''
and meet its main author, Jerry B. Jenkins, at a midnight book
signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assassins'' is the sixth book in the hugely popular ``Left
Behind'' series based on the evangelical Christian interpretation
of biblical end-time prophecies found in the Book of Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, a Gilbert mother who owns a business with her husband,
finished the fifth book in the ``Left Behind'' series within a week
of its February release. She is giving herself Thursday off to read
``Assassins''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably have it read before the end of the day,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   As readers snap up any and all books on the end times -
publishers are expected to release more than 100 apocalyptic titles
before 2000 - the ``Left
</P>
<P>
   Behind'' series stands ahead of the pack, according to
``Publishers Weekly,'' which tracks trends in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The series' five books have sold more than 8 million copies, and
the fifth book, ``Apollyon,'' reached No. 2 on the ``New York
Times''' bestseller list three weeks after its release.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, considering the ``Times'' only counts general market
sales for the list, and two-thirds of the book's sales were in
Christian retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assassins'' is the first Christian fiction novel ever to have
an initial printing of 1 million copies. And last weekend, after
hovering in the top 10, then the top 5, the book hit the No. 1 spot
on amazon.com's hot buys.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Chapel is the only store in the country opening to sell
the book at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, the earliest sales are allowed,
according to the publisher, Tyndale House. The store will open its
doors at 11 tonight, and Jenkins, who invited himself when he heard
a store in Arizona was having a midnight opening, will give a short
talk. The book retails for $22.99 but will be discounted to $12.99
for the midnight sale.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the cash registers ring up the first sales, Jenkins
will pull out his pen. He can sign 300 books an hour, and he plans
to stay as long as it takes, he says cheerfully, knowing full well
that Jesus Chapel has an unprecedented 3,000 copies in the store.
(His publicist, however, said he hopes Jenkins makes his plane at 9
a.m. Thursday. He has another signing from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. in
Plano, Texas.)
</P>
<P>
   The books are the work of a man who has authored numerous ones,
including a bestselling collaboration with Billy Graham on his
memoirs, and with pastor and prophecy expert Tim LaHaye, a retired
Southern Baptist minister and author of more than 40 non-fiction
books.
</P>
<P>
   LaHaye outlines the prophecies from an evangelical point of
view, and Jenkins uses that timeline to create the fiction that
chronicles the lives of those who are left behind for the seven
years of tribulation, the death and destruction that follows the
Rapture. In the Rapture, the true believers in Christ disappear
from Earth and go to heaven, which is how the first book opened.
</P>
<P>
   The world speculates: Extraterrestrials? Spontaneous human
combustion? A few people become Christians believing they have
witnessed the Rapture, and the series follows their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not speaking directly from God, and we realize that a
lot of this is up to interpretation,'' Jenkins said. ``We feel
strongly about the basics and that Christ is going to return,
people are going to disappear and what comes next is strong
judgments. Here's something we think is prophesied in the Bible,
and if it's true, you better be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins turns 50 in September and is living his dream as a
writer, he said, by getting the message of the gospel out to the
non-Christian world. The requirement for the Rapture is belief in
Jesus Christ as savior, which means a lot of good people are left
behind in the books, Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll hear from a Catholic reader who will say, `You're
meanspirited Protestants, and the Catholics are left behind,' ''
Jenkins said. ``The pope has disappeared, but an evangelical pastor
is one of the main characters. We're equal-opportunity Rapture
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, which is at &QL; 
www.leftbehind.com, gets 80,000 hits a day. People post messages
about becoming Christians or about sharing their faith more
confidently after reading the books because they say the book
explains Revelation more clearly. So far, Jenkins has gotten 2,000
letters from people who read the book and became Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins and LaHaye had offers from big Hollywood studios and
turned them down to preserve the integrity of the book. They were
asked - really - such things as, ``So, how important is the
Christian angle?'' and by another person, ``In the book, they all
vanish at once. For the movie, could it happen in stages?''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of July, they signed a movie deal with an independent
studio for
</P>
<P>
   ``Left Behind,'' coming to big screens everywhere in September
2000. The initial budget is $17.5 million, but could go twice that
high for nifty special effects, Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   He and LaHaye believe that the Rapture could happen any day now,
but not because 2000 is ready to roll around. The book is set in
the recent future, but neither dates nor the much-touted Y2K
computer glitch is mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   They believe that the biblical prophecies preceding the Rapture
have been fulfilled, Jenkins said. LaHaye had the book idea back in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly people are thinking apocalyptically, but the
Christian market knows the year 2000 has nothing to do with the
Rapture,'' Jenkins said. ``It's unlikely that God would be that
predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   At Jesus Chapel, they really don't know what to expect with the
midnight sale, Manager Ron Springer said, except these books have
surpassed all expectations in the market. Even the first book,
``Left Behind,'' released in 1996, is still a hot seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``No brand-new book sells 80 to 100 a month, and to have a book
4 years old do that? Nothing else compares,'' Springer said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry McCormick, owner of Christian Books &AMP; More in Mesa,
expects to sell 400 to 600 copies of ``Assassins'' in August alone.
And he expects to see a 66 percent increase in sales of the
previous books in the series . That doesn't count the free copies
of ``Left Behind'' he plans to give away to new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the history of Christian retailing, I'm not aware of any
new book that comes out on the market that has that kind of
potential,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are six more books to come, to be released at a rate of
two per year. After his whirlwind book tour, Jenkins will hole up
in Colorado Springs, Colo., to finish ``The Indwelling: The Beast
Takes Possession.'' It's due at the publisher in mid-October, and
its release is scheduled for February 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Which means, that after Thursday, Nelson and her friends will
have to wait patiently for another six months. In the meantime,
numerous readers continue to write Jenkins and ask, ``Can't you
write any faster?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Yes,'' he tells them, ``but you &UR; wouldn't like the results.''

RICHARD OLNEY, 71, WRITER ON FRENCH COOKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)   (bl)  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Olney, one of the first food writers to introduce the
simple joys of French country cooking to American readers, was
found dead Tuesday at his home at Sollies-Toucas in Provence. He
was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Kermit Lynch, a California wine merchant who spends part of the
year in a house near Olney's, said in a telephone interview that
the writer's gardner found him in bed Tuesday morning. Lynch said
Olney had a bout of Lyme disease two years ago but had appeared
``in wonderful shape'' when the two of them last met about a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Olney lived alone in a simple hillside house in Sollies-Toucas,
northeast of the French port city of Toulon on the Mediterranean.
Surrounded by olive trees, the house centered on a kitchen with a
large fireplace, a stone sink and collections of books and
terrines. Olney slept in an ascetic little bed in an alcove off the
kitchen and ate in fair weather on a table set under a grape arbor
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation was based on a pair of early books _ the ``French
Menu Cookbook'' and ``Simple French Food,'' which appeared in the
early 1970s _ and on the Time-Life cookbook series, which he helped
to edit. He wrote more than 35 books on food and wine in all,
including an autobiography called ``Reflexions,'' which was in the
final editing process when he died.
</P>
<P>
   John T. Colby Jr., the publisher of Brick House Press, which is
producing the memoir, said it would be published in October.
</P>
<P>
   Olney's influence in the culinary profession was profound,
although he was not as well-known to the public as Julia Child or
Elizabeth David, the English cookery writer with whom he is often
compared. Yet his recipes, set out with clinical precision, were
within the capacity of any careful cook; they were simple and
direct, the polar opposites of the dauntingly complex formulas
typical of French nouvelle cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   He gave step-by-step instructions for time-consuming
preparations, like a boned, stuffed saddle of rabbit, but also for
everyday dishes like braised celery and mixed salads. Some of his
favorites passed into the repertories of thousands of home cooks,
like his unctuous potato gratin and his improbable-sounding chicken
cooked with 40 cloves of garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley Leigh, one of the leading young chefs in London, said
recently that ``no other writer combines so well technical
expertise and advice with good taste and discretion.'' His prose
was elegant if sometimes convoluted, and as Lynch said, ``You could
read his books as literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Olney's most important disciple was Alice Waters, who keeps a
jacket-less, food-stained copy of ``Simple French Food'' in the
kitchen of her celebrated restaurant, Chez Panisse, in Berkeley,
Calif. But many others also came under his influence, including
Deborah Madison, perhaps the country's leading vegetarian chef, and
Melissa Kelly, the chef at the Old Chatham Sheepherding Company Inn
at Old Chatham, N.Y., who often cooks his leg of lamb larded with
anchovies.
</P>
<P>
   It was Olney who introduced Ms. Waters to Ms. David, over a
three-hour lunch of white truffles, an extravaganza that neither
soon forgot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lived his life so consciously and purposefully,'' Ms.
Waters said in an interview Tuesday. ``When some people build a
stone wall, they think about it for weeks beforehand. Richard spoke
that way, wrote that way and cooked that way _ strict, demanding
but unpretentious. There are hundreds of great cooks, but not many
with his talent and aesthetic sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Trained as a painter at the Brooklyn Museum Art School, Olney
once spoke of working toward ``a sort of convergence of all the
senses, an awareness of food not only through touching but also
through smelling, hearing, seeing and tasting.''
</P>
<P>
   He was as interested in wine as in food, and he wrote books
about two of France's greatest viticultural treasures, Chateau
d'Yquem and the Domaine de la Romanee Conti. He introduced Lynch to
choice Rhone wines like the Bandol of Domaine Tempier, the Cornas
of Clape and the Hermitage of Chave, which Lynch, in turn, helped
popularize in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Marathon, Iowa, Olney attended the University of Iowa
for a time, then spent some time in Paris, financed by his father,
before heading for New York. While studying in Brooklyn, he waited
on tables at 17 Barrow Street, a small restaurant in Greenwich
Village. In 1951, at the age of 24, he left the United States for
France, and he never moved back.
</P>
<P>
   He ate his first meal in Paris at ``a glum little dining room''
in the 6th arrondissement. The rabbit was ordinary, but the mashed
potatoes, he recalled years later, were ``the best I had ever
eaten, pushed through a sieve, buttered and moistened with enough
of their hot cooking water to bring them to a supple, not quite
pourable consistency _ no milk, no cream, no beating. I had never
dreamed of mashing potatoes without milk, and, in Iowa, everyone
believed that the more you beat them, the better they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Olney had a notably prickly personality that grated on some
people, like Mrs. Child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he enjoyed being difficult,'' she said. ``But on the
other hand, he could be absolutely charming if you treated him like
the genius he considered himself to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Many saw Olney as a hermit, but Colby, the publisher, said he
kept in constant touch with friends and family in the United States
by fax. His was an old Puritan family, Colby said, that included
another Richard Olney who served as secretary of state under
President Grover Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Among his survivors were a brother, Byron, a doctor at the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., as well as two sisters and three other
brothers. To his great delight, one of Olney's nephews, John, went
into the wine business in California, working at Ridge Vineyards in
Cupertino.

EDITORIAL: A DUBIOUS CAMPAIGN RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 4:
</P>
<P>
   In a disappointing decision that could lead to new campaign
fund-raising abuses, a federal judge has cleared the Christian
Coalition of charges that it illegally helped several Republicans
in recent elections. Judge Joyce Hens Green of U.S. District Court
in Washington found that in distributing voter guides and mailings,
the coalition exercised free speech and did not violate limits on
campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling makes it all the more urgent for Congress to enact a
new set of reforms that curb the corrupting power of money in
elections while respecting the First Amendment. Indeed, Judge Green
almost seemed to be inviting Congress to act.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the Christian Coalition is plagued by leadership
and financial problems and may not be able to capitalize on Judge
Green's ruling. Earlier this year the organization lost its
tax-exempt status because of its blatant partisanship. Churches are
also increasingly resisting its repugnant contention that tax cuts,
school vouchers and conservative positions generally are a
Christian philosophy. In filing its original charges, the Federal
Election Commission rightly concluded that the coalition's ``voter
guides'' _ with issue analysis tilted in favor of Republicans _
were an illegal contribution totaling $1.4 million. The guides were
coordinated with the party's candidates, including President George
Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Green found that the Christian Coalition had violated the
law by closely coordinating with two candidates, Newt Gingrich and
Oliver North, but not with Bush and others. In that sense, her
decision was somewhat helpful. It upheld the principle that a
candidate cannot evade election laws simply by setting up an
outside group to raise money or by working closely with such a
group. But Judge Green too narrowly defined what constitutes
unacceptable coordination. In her view, an expenditure by an
outside group would be illegal only if the candidate's campaign was
directly involved in the content, timing or strategy of its
activities but not if there were more general collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, which is about to consider campaign finance reform,
can close the loophole opened by Judge Green's ruling without
violating the First Amendment. It can, for example, define improper
coordination between candidates and independent groups in a way
that includes broad cooperation on strategy and themes, even if
there is no specific coordination on a group's ads or voter guides.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Congress must pass campaign reform before the
elections heat up any further. In the House, the Shays-Meehan bill
is due to come up next month. It would extend longstanding Federal
campaign limits that apply only to candidates to political parties
as well. It would also apply these limits to the campaign ads,
though not voter guides, of independent groups, if they run within
60 days of an election. Its Senate companion, the McCain-Feingold
bill, is due to be debated in October.
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling, Judge Green cited the legitimate concern that
Congress, in its zeal to prevent corruption of the nation's
politics, cannot trifle with the First Amendment. But surely
Congress can limit flagrant campaign abuses without compromising
free-speech values. Money from special interests corrupts the
process whether contributed directly to a candidate, a political
party or a group, such as the Christian Coalition, that operates
independently in name only.
</P>
<P>
   The danger in Judge Green's decision is that it could encourage
campaigns to use other groups to raise and spend money on their
behalf. The decision should not be an excuse to give up on campaign
reform. It can actually strengthen the drive to pass such reforms
right away. &QL;

EXPANDING DVD CAPABILITIES TO BE A HOT TOPIC AT CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. _ Digital Versatile Discs, already packed
with features that one could only dream about just a few years ago,
could soon have more interactive features than NASA's Mission
Control has buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``DVD is not a revolution, it's an evolution in technology _ it
opens up a whole new avenue for entertainment media,'' said David
Obelcz, product manager of consumer software at mail order computer
retailer Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   Those avenues will be topic No. 1 at the DVD '99 Conference and
Technology Showcase, which runs Wednesday and Thursday at the
Universal Hilton Hotel &AMP; Towers.
</P>
<P>
   There is much that can still be done with DVDs, which reached
retail stores only a few years ago. But how, exactly, that will
shake out is the million-dollar question, said Garrett Smith, vice
president of digital mastering operations for Paramount Pictures,
who will moderate a panel exploring value-added DVD features such
as alternative endings and restorations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the curse and the beauty of DVD _ you can do so many
things with it,'' Smith said. ``It's a matter of what's practical
and where do you put your emphasis to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Should DVDs have multiple audio formats? Should they include Web
links for personal computer use? Should they meld with games based
on the characters in the movies? Those are all questions that DVD
makers _ and the market _ will decide in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, consumers are taking to the technology. Year-to-date
sales of DVD players soared to 1.4 million units compared with
321,000 during the same period in 1998, according to the Arlington,
Va.-based Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 8.4 million DVD software units were sold from Jan.
10 through July 25, vs. 3.2 million during the comparable year-ago
period, according to tracking service VideoScan.
</P>
<P>
   The software can be played on set-top DVD players and computer
DVD-ROM drives.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies such as Chatsworth-based distributor Image
Entertainment Inc. are well into plans to get the most out of the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the company, which recently expanded from
licensing titles to producing programming, have been ``noodling''
with ways to get 5.1-track Dolby Digital and DTS, and discrete
two-channel stereo sound onto one disc, said director of marketing
Garrett Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently shot a live concert with Peter Frampton in
the high-definition format for release on DVD. It also will be
available for high-definition broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The company also wants to produce DVDs of live concerts that
exploit the format's highly touted _ but rarely used _ multiangle
capabilities, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of consumer desktop and laptop computers sold by
Gateway come equipped with DVD-ROM drives, with which consumers can
access Web links and other features on DVD movies that they can't
with a set-top player, Obelcz said.
</P>
<P>
   He foresees, among other things, more interactive features
incorporated into DVD movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take that same DVD and put it in a computer and open
up a whole new arena of features that you can't have at a set-top
box,'' he said. ``The PC is one of the best environments in which
to put interactive material.''
</P>
<P>
   The Universal City conference is intended to give industry
insiders an opportunity to learn from one another, said Charles Van
Horn, executive vice president of the Princeton, N.J.-based
International Recording Media Association, which is co-producing
the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is get more of them aware of how to do
it, what can be done to add excitement to the product and just
share creative approaches that each is taking,'' Van Horn said.

COURT PANEL REVERSES VERDICTS IN REBELLION AT ATTICA PRISON
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal appeals court panel Tuesday overturned a $4
million award stemming from the bloody Attica prison rebellion in
1971, and chastised a lower court judge and the state of New York
for allowing a suit filed by 1,281 inmates to drag on for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The $4 million verdict was awarded to a former inmate in 1997
after an earlier trial established the facts of the brutality
against all the prisoners, and held that a former deputy warden was
liable for having overseen brutal reprisals after the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the appeals panel also overturned the finding of
liability against the deputy warden, saying that the trial judge's
handling of the case was so flawed that it violated the defendant's
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the three-judge panel, Chief Judge Ralph K. Winter
of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan accused the
state officials of doing all they could, with the acquiescence of
the lower court, ``to delay resolution'' of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strategy can no longer be tolerated,'' Winter wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Winter wrote that given the long history of the case, it should
now be given ``expedited treatment'' by the lower court, the U.S.
District Court in Buffalo, to reach a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruling drew an angry response Tuesday from a
lawyer for the 1,281 inmates who had originally filed the $2.8
billion class-action suit in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice continues to be denied to the Attica brothers,''
Elizabeth M. Fink, the lawyer, said, adding that she was
particularly upset because Winter, in reversing the earlier
verdicts, had indicated that he largely agreed with the inmates'
contentions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fink said state officials had engaged in stalling tactics in
court and refused to negotiate a settlement of the case ``when it
clearly should have been resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   State correctional officials had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, 1971, inmates at the Attica Correctional Facility,
30 miles east of Buffalo, took hostages and took control of parts
of the prison. After several days of negotiations that ultimately
failed, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller ordered the retaking of the D
Yard, an area controlled by prisoners. The bloodshed resulted in
the deaths of 10 hostages and 29 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   In the retaking of the D Yard, prisoners were forced to strip
naked, and run at least two gantlets across broken glass, while
being beaten by baton-wielding correction officers.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action suit was originally filed against Rockefeller,
who died in 1979, and various New York state police and correction
officials. The trial judge later ruled that the inmates had no
claim against Rockefeller's estate. In the 1992 trial, the jury
found only against the former deputy warden, Karl Pfeil.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Pfeil, Randy C. Rucinski, said Tuesday, ``We're
happy with the result.'' He said that Pfeil, who is now retired,
denies responsibility for the brutality.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel ruled that the 1992 liability finding against
Pfeil had to be overturned because the verdict sheet used by the
jury was confusing and did not establish that he was in fact liable
for the brutality against every inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Smith, the former inmate who had won the $4 million
verdict, said the ruling ``just makes me feel more energized.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, now 66 and a paralegal, was released from Attica in 1973
after serving time for robbing a dice game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to fight,'' he said. ``I don't have no choice but to
fight.''

GOING FOR THE IOWA STRAW  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One presidential candidate is criss-crossing Iowa in a hi-tech
bus, another has rented a $43,000 plot of land for a Texas-style
barbecue, and a third has signed up country crooner Crystal Gale.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, 8 of the 9 GOP aspirants will try to lock in enough
votes to win the Iowa straw poll - a vote that doesn't count in an
obscure spot on the map in a state that has just seven electoral
votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the quirky world of politics, it has become a vital
battleground.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 14 poll, an informal mid-summer election, was designed
to raise money for the Iowa Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Each voter must pony up $25, but most contenders will give their
supporters a free ride to the event, renting every bus in the state
to haul in an anticipated 10,000 to 20,000 people to
centrally-located Ames. Organizers are billing the poll, which four
years ago helped the party raise more than $350,000, as the largest
political event in the nation this year.
</P>
<P>
   To observers such as Richard Pious, a political scientist at
Columbia University, the poll is a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Some call it a beauty contest stacked in favor of the highest
bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would qualify the candidate to run a local school system's
bus service, or perhaps a taxi service,`` Pious said. ``It doesn't
have anything to do with public opinion, with sentiment within the
party, or with qualities needed for public service.``
</P>
<P>
   The poll, he said, doesn't even show how well a candidate can
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great con,`` he asserted, ``and my hat is off to the
bunco artists in Iowa who have pulled this off.``
</P>
<P>
   Despite that view, this year's poll looms large in the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the vote could deliver the death blow to any
candidate_ particularly former Vice President Dan Quayle or former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander_who fails to place in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle has struggled to repair his damaged image among Iowans,
and Alexander, reputed to have the most formidable organization on
the ground in Iowa, has also foundered in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quayle is a marked man,'' said Dennis Goldford, a political
scientist at Drake University, who added that Lamar Alexander is
also on the ropes going into the poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``First impressions are lasting _ they are branded to you,''
Goldford said. ``And Quayle still either looks like deer in the
headlights or he looks like this little kid saying `I'm grown up
now.`''
</P>
<P>
   While the GOP front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, is widely
expected to win the straw poll, many believe the voting offers one
of the few opportunities for his opponents to cast doubt on his
bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a strategic standpoint if they are going to stop this
train that is gaining speed the straw poll becomes a way to blow up
the tracks,'' Goldford said. ``If you can dust him up or put a
chink in the armor, all of a sudden he doesn't look so inevitable
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates are going to unprecedented lengths to avoid having
the wind sucked from their sails.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes and his wife are traveling the hustings in a bus
outfitted with digital cameras that can instantly pop out photos of
Forbes taken with supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is massing his big guns _ including his pollster and
media adviser _ to lay down a week-long barrage in Iowa just before
the poll.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush has spent tens of thousands of dollars on the event,
having bid $43,000 to rent a prime piece of property on which to
woo supporters at the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of land at the Iowa Hilton Coliseum at Iowa State
University will be celebrity-packed and melodious, according to
Bush spokesman Eric Woolson.
</P>
<P>
   Four rock and country bands will be twanging and thumping away.
</P>
<P>
   On display will be country-western standout Tracy Bird, former
Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach, and hot-shooting San
Antonio Spurs star Sean Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd will also get a chance to fall hook, line and sinker
for another celeb: Johnny Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny Morris is a championship bass fisherman, which is of
interest to a lot of folks in Iowa who are bass fisherpeople, as it
were,'' explained Woolson. ``It's an important event and you really
want it to be as much fun as possible so people will take an
afternoon out of their summer schedule to come and vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Alexander has arranged to have country music
star Crystal Gale and Miss Iowa, Jaclyn Solinger, rub elbows with
his supporters before they cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is also attempting to win the hearts of Iowans by
wearing out his shoeleather. In the weeks running up to the poll,
he will have visited 60 counties.
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokesman for Alexander, the candidate is working
the state the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the approach of working hard, going small town to
small town and earning the nomination rather than trying to buy
it,'' said Bo Harmon, Alexander's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The poll has also been a source of alleged scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Iowa Christian Coalition director Bobbie Gobel
accused Forbes of trying to buy the outcome by asking her to send
temp workers from her Midwestern employment agency to vote in the
poll.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes officials vehemently denied the report and Gobel, who
stood by her account, was later fired by the Christian coalition.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Elizabeth Dole suggested the antics of other
campaigns have reached absurd proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going bonkers over it, we're not bankrupting
ourselves, we're not going to go overboard,'' said Ari Fleisher,
Dole's spokesman. ` &UR; `Other campaigns have to because it could be
their last breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole went the bare-bones route, Fleisher said, paying only about
$4,000 for her space at the straw poll. She'll feed her followers,
but the only entertainment they'll enjoy will waft in from
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are most likely going to invite people for free food and to
listen to other people's music,'' Fleisher said. ``After all, music
carries.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole officials downplayed the importance of the poll, saying
they expect to come out alive but not on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all said and done we don't expect to come in first,
we don't expect to come in last,`` Fleisher said. ``We'll come in
somewhere in the middle and we'll advance to the next round.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of candidates have grumbled quietly that the straw poll
has taken on too much importance.
</P>
<P>
   One GOP candidate _ Arizona Sen. John McCain _ has flat out
refused to participate, a decision that is lauded by some political
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sensible nominating system,'' said Columbia University's
Pious, ``the Iowa straw poll would count for nothing.''

 Seminar explores causes and treatment of problem gambling  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CIY, Mo. _ Kansas City Mayor Pro Tem Alvin Brooks wants
to know how to save children and teen-agers from the abyss of
addictive gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it on the streets every day. They have dice in their
pockets. They're hooked,'' said Brooks, who is also president of
the Ad Hoc Group Against Crime, at a seminar Tuesday presented by
the Missouri Alliance to Curb Compulsive Gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The session, at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, was part
of the second annual observance of Responsible Gaming Education
Week, which runs through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Experts responded to Brooks that there were no scientific
answers yet to why people self-destruct with gambling. Nor is there
a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do know is the vast majority of Americans gamble
without adverse consequences,'' said Christine Reilly, executive
director of the Kansas City-based National Center for Responsible
Gaming. The center is spending around $7 million in casino industry
donations that today is financing the bulk of research under way in
this country on the causes and treatment of problem gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part, Reilly said, is sorting through the typical
gambling addict's multiple afflictions, including substance abuse
and depression, and then understanding their relationships and root
causes.
</P>
<P>
   Loretta Jasper agrees. One of about 60 persons in the audience
Tuesday, Jasper is coordinator of addiction and homeless services
at Comprehensive Mental Health Services Inc. in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   The real tragedy of any addiction, she said in an interview, is
that by the time its victims reach out for help, their situation is
usually out of control.
</P>
<P>
   But Jasper doesn't blame Missouri's riverboat casinos for the
problems faced by most of her patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, their gambling did not begin with the
boats,'' she said. And for some problem gamblers in Kansas City,
the boats are not the problem. Jasper said she also was treating
clients addicted to sports betting and playing the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Jaspr said, public education efforts are gaining
ground. ``People are becoming more aware'' of the telltale signs of
addiction in loved ones and where to get help, such as the
alliance's hot line, 1-888-BETSOFF (1-888-238-7633).
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong observance includes public service announcements on
television and radio and at the state's 15 casinos and 5,000 state
lottery ticket outlets. Lapel buttons, posters and other
information promote the state's counseling hot line and other
programs for problem gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Videotapes also are available for group showings, and
commemorative casino chips are being sold at some casinos, with
proceeds going to counseling and research efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Keith S. Whyte, executive director of the National Council on
Problem Gambling, said Missouri's alliance was unique and had
become a model for other states.
</P>
<P>
   It includes the state Department of Mental Health, the Missouri
Lottery, the Missouri Gaming Commission, the Missouri Riverboat
Gaming Association and the Missouri Council on Problem Gambling
Concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Mental Health offers free counseling in 31
cities and the hot line, financed in part by the casino industry,
staffed 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   A Gaming Commission program allows admitted problem gamblers to
voluntarily exclude themselves from the state's casinos, which
removes them from mailing lists and players clubs.
</P>
<P>
   If caught at a casino, excluded gamblers can be arrested for
trespassing and forced to forfeit casino chips, tokens and jackpot
winnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other state with this partnership between the
(casino) operators, the regulators, the counselors and the other
professionals,'' Whyte said.
</P>
<P>
   While the gambling disease touches fewer than 5 percent of
Americans at some time in their lives, Whyte said that still
amounted to millions of people _ many of whom live in states with
few or no public resources to help.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Missouri alliance had taken a crucial first step
toward widespread public education about the dangers of gambling,
especially among young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``More needs to be done,'' Whyte said. ``There needs to be
consistent and broad-based public awareness in health clinics and
the schools. You cannot make progress against an epidemic by only
treating the casualties.''

IT'S OFFICIAL _ SHE'S A SHE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CLAY THOMPSON   
 and JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Athlete, wife, mother and grandmother _ has been officially
declared a woman by the World Association of Veteran Athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's verdict comes as no surprise to Jager or her loved
ones. Even her neighbors knew it, those who jog with her and have
sent their children to her for swimming lessons in her backyard
pool for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it probably was a relief for her to get the matter
settled in a world court of review. And her friends in the Valley,
after getting over the initial shock, are still chucking over the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether she is indeed a she came up this week in
Newcastle, England, where Jager is competing _ quite successfully _
in WAVA's world championships. Jager, 56, is one of the Southwest's
best-known recreational athletes.
</P>
<P>
   After Jager set a record for women over 50 with a time of 13.5
seconds in the 100-meter dash, members of the Australian and New
Zealand teams complained that they believed she was really a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious, if you look at her, why the complaint was
lodged,'' Australian athlete Fred Turner told the North News and
Pictures Agency in Newcastle. The news service described Jager as
``heavily muscled.''
</P>
<P>
   WAVA officials held a news conference Tuesday and said tests had
concluded that Jager, a mother of two and grandmother of two more,
really, truly is a woman of the female gender, complete with all
the appropriate body parts, hormones and other physical
paraphernalia one would expect of such a female person.
</P>
<P>
   Torsten Carlius, WAVA president, told the ``Newcastle Evening
Chronicle,'' ``The protests questioning the gender of (Jager) has
been dealt with through medical examination that has proved her
gender as being female.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Jager was ``relieved'' that the matter was over and
``just wanted to finish competing in the games.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I have a lot of sympathy with the lady. The
situation is that she has been accused of something that was
untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   The story has attracted the attention of numerous media outlets
in both England and Scotland, and they apparently are having a
field day with it. The lead paragraph in one story said, ``The
oldies Olympics was thrown into chaos yesterday by a complaint that
an all-conquering woman athlete actually is a MAN.''
</P>
<P>
   Very funny, said Beau Chane, who lives across the street from
the Jagers. He said he was dumfounded when he heard about the
claim. He agreed with Turner that Jager is heavily muscled and that
she has tremendous upper body strength, ``but there is no doubt
that she's a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I jog with her,'' he added, ``and I've seen her in a dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is completely ridiculous. I watched her kids
grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Other neighbors say Jager, who frequently trains as early as 5
a.m., is so much more dedicated than her competitors that they may
naturally be envious of her successes. They do say that those who
meet her for the first time could be surprised by her rugged
features.
</P>
<P>
   But they also say she is quiet, subdued, demur and definitely
female.
</P>
<P>
   They threw out another hook: Europeans love to bash America,
they said, citing the furor of the French when they claimed Tour de
France winner Lance Armstrong was using steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Jager finished the games in convincing fashion. Just moments
after the news conference, Jager broke the 200-meter world record
for her age group with a time of 28.32 seconds. She has also won a
silver medal in the pole vault by clearing the bar at 1.9 meters.
</P>
<P>
   In a ``Republic'' story last year, Jager talked about her
determination, which was honed on a farm in Minnesota, where she
lived with her grandparents as a youngster. In previous meets, she
has competed in as many as six events in one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people aren't as crazy as I am,'' she said. ``When I was
50, I decided to make this dream happen. I think the second half of
my life is the best part, the chance to live out my dreams. This is
one way of achieving what I have the potential to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jager could not be reached for comment Tuesday but had told
British newspapers, ``People are trying to make trouble with these
ridiculous allegations. I am a mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no possibility that this is true. Somebody
must have it in for me. It's very unsportsmanlike. There is an
Australian woman I beat last year, and she must have a grudge
against me.``
</P>
<P>
   This is believed to be the first time that this question has
been raised regarding Jager. An announcement that the protest had
been rejected was broadcast over the public address system at the
games and drew applause from the large crowd, according to press
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Jager, her husband, Carl, or either of her two
children were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. team manager Sandy Pashkin said she was pleased that
Jager's ordeal was over:
</P>
<P>
   ``As the team manager, I am happy that the incident is behind
her and that she can continue to compete in the championships,
which is the reason why she is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Hedges, the track coach at Central High School who helps
train Jager, said he could have saved the boys across the pond a
lot of legwork if they would have called him first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they come up with stuff like this,'' he said.
``I'm shocked to hear about this from two standpoints. A _ this is
not a major Olympics competition, and B _ it's hard to believe
anyone would accuse her of anything. She's one of the most
dedicated athletes I know. But it's something you assume the
tabloids in London would be involved in.

HOUSE AND SENATE REPUBLICANS REACH AGREEMENT ON TAX CUT
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS with Republican s reaching agreement; NO pickup;
Combines takes.) 
 (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders in the House and Senate agreed
Tuesday night on a tax-cutting package that took a new approach to
reducing income tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders met in private through the day and late into the
night, trying to reconcile the differing tax bills passed in the
last two weeks by the House and the Senate. Republicans said they
were intent on pushing the final version of their $792 billion
tax-cut plan through both chambers by the end of the week, when
Congress begins a monthlong recess.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise that emerged Tuesday night faces a veto by
President Clinton. He says the Republican plan would risk a return
of federal budget deficits, disproportionately favor the wealthy
and leave too little money for Medicare, the military, education
and a variety of other programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the immediate problem facing the Republicans on Tuesday
night was coming up with a package that would hold their own party
together.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, the leadership scrapped the approaches to income tax
cuts contained in the House and Senate bills. The House bill had
called for a reduction in all income tax rates of 10 percent. The
Senate bill had called for the lowest income tax rate, 15 percent,
to be reduced to 14 percent, and for the new 14 percent bracket to
be extended to higher income levels.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the House and Senate negotiators decided on a reduction
of each income tax rate by 1 percentage point. The current 15
percent rate, for example, would drop to 14 percent, while the 28
percent rate would fall to 27 percent and the top rate of 39.6
percent would become 38.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators tentatively agreed to phase out the inheritance
tax levied on large estates, a priority for many Republicans in the
House. And they agreed on a reduction in the top rate on capital
gains to 18 percent from 20 percent, members of both parties said.
</P>
<P>
   While conservative Republicans will strongly support the
compromise plan, some of its provisions, particularly the 1
percentage point reduction in all income tax rates, alienated some
moderate Republicans in the Senate, raising questions about whether
the party would have enough votes to pass the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things aren't looking very good from our perspective, and our
understanding is that other moderates are having similar
problems,'' said Nicholas J. Graham, a spokesman for Sen. John H.
Chafee, a moderate Republican from Rhode Island who backs a smaller
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to several of the four Democrats who had voted for the
Republican bill in the Senate said they would also have trouble
with any new plan that reduced all income tax rates, because such
an approach would give a bigger tax cut to those in upper income
brackets than to those in lower brackets.
</P>
<P>
   If they can pass the final bill this week, House Speaker Dennis
Hastert of Illinois and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi plan to sit on the legislation until after Congress
returns from its summer vacation in September and then send it to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   They do not want him to use the summer recess to promote his
veto for nearly a month, when he could argue the Republicans failed
to reach a real compromise with Democrats that would protect Social
Security and Medicare, too.
</P>
<P>
   The two Republican leaders are under some pressure from their
own members to adopt a less confrontational strategy, and to seek
negotiations with the White House before forcing a showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that forcing the issue now ``would likely lead to a
hardening of positions that could imperil any possible negotiated
agreement later in the fall,'' Sen. Olympia Snowe, a moderate
Republican from Maine, urged Lott in a letter Tuesday to seek a
cooling-off period over the next month followed by talks with the
White House.

COWBOYS LINEBACKER GODFREY PUTS ANGER BEHIND HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Listen to linebacker Randall Godfrey and
he'll say, ``It's all good.''
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey, whom the Cowboys value enough on the field that they
moved him from strong-side linebacker to middle linebacker in an
effort to improve their defense, said he harbors no ill will toward
how the team valued him during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he believes that the Cowboys took advantage of his status
as a restricted free agent with an injured shoulder and gave him a
low contract tender of $429,000 after stating during the season
that they would likely tender him more than twice that amount
($935,000).
</P>
<P>
   And it's true that Godfrey was so offended that he sat out the
June minicamp and threatened to sit out training camp. The contract
tender was further evidence to him that the Cowboys would treat him
as they did Ken Norton, Darrin Smith, Dixon Edwards and Robert
Jones _ former Cowboys linebackers who left via free agency because
of the team's policy of not paying a premium salary to linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey eventually accepted the contract tender, largely because
as a restricted free agent he had no choice. A couple of
conversations with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who told him that a
policy change could be in order when Godfrey becomes an
unrestricted free agent after the season, helped ease his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, the acrimony is in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey toils daily in training camp at Midwestern State,
telling as much to everyone that will listen. He said all he's
concerned with is preparing for this season and learning as much as
he can about his new position.
</P>
<P>
   The more Godfrey talks, however, the more he sounds like a
player who remembers the past and is concentrating on the present
with an eye on the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put it all behind me,'' said Godfrey, who will be an
unrestricted free agent after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just worried about this season. If I'm here \Rnext year\S,
then I'll be very happy. But I learned it's a business. I had to
deal with business this off-season. I'll have to deal with business
next off-season. But I don't want to get that far ahead. I just
want to start this season off right and have a good year in the
middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the future looks bright because of the Cowboys'
decision to move him to the middle, said Godfrey's agent, Ben
Dogra. If Godfrey is as good in the middle as he and the Cowboys
think he can be, Dogra said his value will increase even more.
</P>
<P>
   Dogra points to a contract signed by New Orleans Saints
linebacker Mark Fields _ seven years for $25 million, including a
$7 million signing bonus _ as a comparable starting point. The
Cowboys have never paid a linebacker more than $750,000 in annual
base salary.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he agrees that a policy change could be in order for
Godfrey, who has amassed 295 career tackles since being picked in
the second round of the 1996 draft out of Georgia. He had 149 and
115 tackles in 1997 and 1998, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also acknowledged that the stakes could be a lot higher
the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has the kind of year that he wants to have and we think
he can have, then he'll have a higher market value,'' Jones said.
``But we think we will have a good chance to sign him. I know he
wants to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that Cowboys coaches want him here. They see
him as a potential mainstay in the middle of the Cowboys defense,
although he has played on the strong side the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys toyed with the idea of moving Godfrey to the middle
last season to take advantage of his speed, but the plans were
foiled when his potential replacement on the strong side (Broderick
Thomas) was injured. The signing of former Texas A&AMP;M star Quentin
Coryatt in the off-season facilitated the move for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   With Dexter Coakley on the weakside, the Cowboys believe their
linebacking corps is as fast as any in the league. But it all
starts with the 6-foot-2, 245-pound Godfrey, whom they consider
their best linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are always looking at a guy like Randall to be your middle
linebacker,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``He is a physical
guy with excellent speed and good instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Dave Campo agreed, saying, ``The middle
linebacker spot is perfect for him'' because it allows Godfrey to
roam from sideline to sideline and make tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey, who said he's close to recovering from a right shoulder
reconstruction in the off-season, said he prefers the middle as
well, especially in a Cowboys defense designed for the middle
linebacker to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played it my first two years in college,'' Godfrey said.
``The move is what I wanted. It's going to give me more of an
opportunity to do some good things and make some things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It might also give him a chance for some big-time pay(back)
after the season.

 &HT;    FBI halts flight to Turkey
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith and R. Robin McDonald
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ FBI agents and other police boarded a Delta Air Lines
flight bound for Istanbul, Turkey, on Tuesday evening and removed
five passengers for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   One passenger still was being detained late Tuesday night, said
Thomas Bush, acting special agent in charge of the FBI's Atlanta
office. Bush said the FBI acted because of a ``potential threat to
national security,'' but at a briefing about four hours after the
incident he said agents were satisfied the detained man was not
involved in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been able to associate this individual at this
time with any terrorist organization,'' Bush said. But he said
other issues were still unresolved, including the detained
passenger's identity.
</P>
<P>
   The flight took off about 10:20 p.m., about four hours late.
</P>
<P>
   CNN quoted a national security source in Washington as saying
that one of those taken off the plane for questioning was detained
``because of the suspicious nature in which he purchased his
ticket,'' namely by paying cash. Delta spokesman Dan Lewis said the
cost of an economy class ticket from Atlanta to Istanbul would be
$713 one way if purchased at the counter with cash on the same day
as the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had information of a national security nature and initiated
a security procedure at 6:10 p.m. on Flight 40,'' said FBI
spokeswoman Celestine Armstead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We removed five individuals for questioning. We are not
characterizing anyone as a terrorist or criminal at this time,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had received information that led us to take these steps.
We questioned all five,'' she said. ``Four were released at the
airport, and the fifth remains in custody.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonstop flight from Atlanta to Istanbul was fully loaded
with about 240 passengers and luggage and was about to leave the
gate when police intervened, Delta spokesman Dan Lewis said three
hours after the FBI intervention. By 9:30 p.m., passengers still
waited while every piece of luggage from Flight 40 was checked by
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, bomb-sniffing dogs and
airport police. Each piece of baggage had to be matched to a
passenger before being reloaded.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger taken into custody was a white male, about 6 feet
tall, who was placed in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers who were removed for questioning and released all
had been sitting near the man who was detained.
</P>
<P>
   They told Atlanta's ABC affiliate WSB-TV they were asked such
questions as why they were traveling to Turkey and whether they
have relatives in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's Armstead said the initial report came from the
agency's Valdosta office.
</P>
<P>
   A Valdosta Police Department spokesman said there was a
situation at the city's airport, near the Florida border about 200
miles south of Atlanta. He would not go into details and would not
say whether the two incidents were related.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would rather not talk about it right now,'' spokesman Nick
Lacey told The Associated Press. ``We have some sort of situation
there. But we're not going to talk about it until the situation is
under control.''

CHIVAS FACES GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD GONZALEZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Whenever a club soccer team based in Mexico
comes to the Rose Bowl to play the Galaxy, the home-field advantage
has remained true to form.
</P>
<P>
   That might well change tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the fact that Chivas Rayadas de Guadalajara, Mexico's
feverishly popular club team, is coming to town.
</P>
<P>
   Game time for the exhibition match, dubbed the inaugural Cruz M.
Bustamante Cup, is 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be interesting because they have a huge following, one
that has been with them for years and years,'' Galaxy general
manager Sergio Del Prado said.
</P>
<P>
   Many attribute the team's fan base to the fact it's the only
Mexican First Division team comprised solely of Mexican players.
While the competition has resorted to signing foreigners to
high-priced contracts, Chivas has spawned fan loyalty through
national pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel an obligation to our people to uphold tradition,''
said Salvador Martinez Garza, one of the team's primary owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel there's more than enough talent (in Mexico) to remain
highly competitive. We could resort to another strategy, but once
again, it's about tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   A winning tradition at that.
</P>
<P>
   Chivas has captured 10 championships in the Mexican First
Division, giving its supporters even more reason to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   But more than loyalty, it's about retaining an identity.
</P>
<P>
   When a company -- in this case, a sports franchise -- builds
successfully from within, a true sense of pride develops.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point is the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the O'Malley ownership, fans built a strong identity with
the team. A string of Rookie of the Year performers, a solid farm
system and the perpetual infield foursome of Garvey, Lopes, Russell
and Cey cemented the bond.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than aiming to resist industry change -- as the
O'Malley's often did successfully -- Fox gave in.
</P>
<P>
   Mega-million dollar trades came, longtime employees were
vanquished and the farm system was all but purged.
</P>
<P>
   In short, so was tradition.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of scenario many Chivas followers would dread if
it happened in Guadalajara.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't build a fan base better than that,'' Del Prado said.
``Winning brings fans, but winning with class and winning with
tradition, that brings lifelong fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say there's too much tradition and loyalty for dramatic
change to hit Chivas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will never change,'' said noted analyst Jaime Mota of
Univision, a Spanish-speaking television outlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it ever did change -- but I don't think it ever will -- I
want to be there to see it. When that first foreign player arrives
... the fans wouldn't let him into the stadium gates, let alone
near the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be quite a reception for him. Believe me, it's not
the kind of reception one would hope for.''

ANALYSIS: BUDGET BY FATIGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ When the New York Legislature began approving the
state budget Tuesday night, it ended months of partisan trench
warfare that could have readily been avoided in late winter. Back
then, well before the April 1 deadline, the path to the eventual
compromise was clear, and the leaders here knew it.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. George Pataki and his main rivals, the Democrats who
control the state Assembly, feared that if they arrived at an
on-time deal, they might be viewed as weak and ineffective.
Couldn't you have prodded harder, negotiated more fervently, stuck
it out longer, their allies would have demanded.
</P>
<P>
   For Pataki, the criticism might have come from business groups
seeking tax cuts and tight-fisted spending levels. The Assembly
Democrats might have been chastised by health care groups concerned
about forestalling cuts.
</P>
<P>
   So the two sides instead stonewalled and edged toward an
agreement at a maddening pace. In Albany's dysfunctional budget
traditions, there is little glory in making a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do a budget early, within weeks after it's proposed, well
then the advocates are saying, `Why didn't you stay and fight _ why
didn't you hold out?''' said Joseph Bruno, the upstate Republican
who is the Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno was among the most irked by the outcome, largely because
his budget proposal formed the template for the compromise _ a
proposal that he issued in March.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the Assembly Democrats wanted to spend $2
billion to $4 billion more than Pataki, a Republican who has been
eager to show that he is a fiscal conservative as he tries to
broaden his national reputation. The Senate Republicans, who are
the other power in the Albany triumvirate, sought a figure in the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pataki, the Senate Republicans wanted to retain old
spending reductions in Medicaid, the health care program for the
poor. Like the Assembly Democrats, the Senate Republicans rejected
new Medicaid cuts proposed by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Bruno told the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver,
that he could persuade Pataki not to veto the Assembly Democrats'
pet projects if Silver acceded to the Senate Republicans' lower
figure. After months of impasse, Silver did just that, and it
appears that Pataki will probably not use his veto pen, unlike last
year, when he carved more than $1 billion in Democratic programs
from the budget.
</P>
<P>
   The budget voted on Tuesday night increases spending by roughly
$1.1 billion over the governor's proposal, keeps the old Medicaid
cuts and includes no new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are where we were in March,'' Bruno said. ``And here we are
in August. And that is disheartening, it's exasperating, it's
frustrating, and we have to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno has often made such comments in recent years, yet he has
not found a way to make the birthing of the state budget less
tempestuous. He probably will not until the governor and lawmakers
sense that the voters are so angered by the 15 straight years of
late budgets that they are willing to oust incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bruno and Pataki forced a measure through the
Legislature that withholds the pay of lawmakers until a budget is
passed. If anything, that punishment only aggravated tensions, as
the Assembly Democrats were determined to show that they would not
surrender in return for getting paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, the pay issue was a disincentive to go along,''
maintained Assemblyman Joseph Lentol, a Brooklyn Democrat. ``It
only bred more animosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Like several lawmakers interviewed Tuesday night, Lentol seemed
puzzled when asked why the governor and Legislature could not have
reached the same agreement several months ago, as if a budget
without carping and delay was not fathomable. He attributed the
long standoff not to posturing but to deep differences between the
Republican governor and the Assembly Democrats that are difficult
to bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have grown farther apart philosophically,'' Lentol said.
</P>
<P>
   Lentol also uttered what is an article of faith around here: The
process is not pretty, but the final product is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday night, the combatants had decided they had done the
best they could. After a delay of more than four months, no one
could accuse Pataki and the Assembly Democrats (or the Senate
Republicans, for that matter) of an unwillingness to fight. And as
they began voting, it was apparent that fatigue, not a deadline,
was the prime motivator in ushering to a close the budget clash,
which tied the one in 1997 for the longest in state history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, the element of time brings people to resolution,''
said Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., a Brooklyn Democrat. ``People
say enough is enough.''

GOP NEGOTIATORS REACH AGREEMENT ON $792 BILLION TAX CUT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate GOP negotiators reached an
agreement Tuesday on the final details of a $792 billion tax cut
bill certain to trigger a veto showdown with President Clinton who
believes it would jeopardize Medicare reforms and future spending
on education and defense programs.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the full House and Senate later this week, the
measure would call for cutting each of the five income tax brackets
by one percentage point, eliminating the so-called ``marriage
penalty'' and lowering the personal capital gains rate by several
points from its 20 percent level.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, citing an eagerness to make their case to the
American people, all but invited Clinton to follow through on his
veto threat. They insisted that he will have to rethink his
position once taxpayers understand that the GOP bill provides
breaks for everything from education expenses to health care costs
for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe when people start realizing ... there's a lot of good
things in there, the president will change his mind,'' Senate
Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., told reporters during a break
in the painstaking negotiations aimed at resolving differences
between two separate House-and Senate-passed bills that would cut
taxes incrementally over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although some disagreements remained over several contentious
issues late Tuesday night, lawmakers said a final bill, which
amounts to the largest tax cut proposal since 1981, would include a
reduction in personal tax rate brackets for all Americans.
Conferees were reluctant to provide many details, but they said the
10 percent across-the-board rate reduction that had been the
centerpiece of the House-passed bill will be replaced by a modified
Senate proposal that would gradually lower each of the five tax
brackets by one percentage point. But, as called for in the House
bill, it would expand the lower brackets to include more earners.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest 15 percent bracket, for example, would be reduced
over time to 14 percent and the highest bracket of 39.6 percent
would fall to 38.6 percent. Republicans said the one percent
reduction would mean that lower-income earners would receive a
bigger break overall than higher-income earners.
</P>
<P>
   The final bill, according to Republican lawmakers, also will
include more than $112 billion in tax relief by phasing out estate
taxes and gradually raising the standard deduction for a married
couple until it is double the level now for single or individual
filers. The legislation would help married joint filers further by
widening the lowest bracket to include some income currently taxed
at 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The senators said the final legislation also includes a
reduction in the capital gains tax rate for individuals, but not
for corporations. In addition, limits on individual retirement
account contributions would be increased, and the self-employed
would be allowed to deduct the total cost of health insurance
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Tax credits would be offered for providing in-home care to
elderly relatives, and for the first time, taxpayers would get a
partial deduction for long-term care insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., pressed their negotiators to wrap up work
on the bill Tuesday night so that the House could vote on it
Thursday and the Senate on Friday. But if approved by both
GOP-controlled chambers, it would likely be September before it is
sent to Clinton to either sign into law or veto.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders want to delay sending the bill to the
White House and mount a nationwide campaign over the August
congressional recess aimed at convincing skeptical Americans about
the benefits of tax cuts, even though the bulk of the reductions
would not be fully implemented for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Recent public opinion polls indicate that most Americans believe
tax cuts should be put off for now in favor of shoring up the
Social Security and Medicare programs and spending more money on
defense, education and other domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told
reporters: ``We believe that the flow of public opinion is in our
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not forsake any hope that the president might sign that
bill in September,'' he said, adding that if Clinton does veto it,
``he'll find he's disappointed the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, joined by most Democrats and a handful of moderate
Republicans, is pushing for a smaller targeted tax cut of around
$300 billion over the next 10 years and gradual spending increases
of about $50 billion on Medicare, including a prescription drug
reimbursement plan, and some $600 billion on education, defense and
other programs that polls suggest Americans would likely support.
</P>
<P>
   The larger Republican tax cut plan, he has said repeatedly,
could end up shortchanging Social Security and Medicare, and lead
to new budget deficits if the projected surplus of nearly $2
trillion from Social Security taxes and $1 trillion in
discretionary funds fails to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   But conservative Republicans are holding fast to their belief
that a significant tax cut is necessary in order to prevent
Congress from ``squandering,'' the non-social security surplus, as
one Senate aide put it last week, ``on bigger and bigger
government.''
</P>
<P>
   They also insist that continued economic growth and anticipated
Social Security and Medicare reforms will work to contain costs
before baby boomers reach retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Although the negotiations between the two chambers included
Democrats, the minority has largely been cut out of the final talks
since both bills were written primarily by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the
House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters that it was
pointless for Democrats to even attend the meetings since the GOP
is determined to produce what he called ``a political statement''
rather than a compromise measure.
</P>
<P>
   He called it a futile effort since Clinton is prepared to use
his veto authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ... like having two Christmas lists and (selecting) the
best from both lists knowing that Santa's not coming,'' Rangel
joked as he described the effort by Republican Senate and House
conferees to meld their two separate tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to complaints from the Democrats, Republican leaders
were also having trouble Tuesday keeping moderate Republicans in
line behind a large tax cut bill. Some GOP moderates, for example,
were reluctant to back the House bill when it passed by a narrow
margin two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   These same moderates made it difficult for House and Senate
conferees to reach agreement Tuesday night because of their
insistence that any major tax cuts be tied to a reduction in the
national debt.

DWIGHT YOAKAM GIVES SINGING ROLE TOP BILLING FOR SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY RODGERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Dwight Yoakam is ready for a break after 12 grueling
months of directing and acting.
</P>
<P>
   So he does what comes naturally: immediately embarks on 10
grueling weeks of concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``About five out of every seven nights, we're doing it
(performing). We're spanking it,'' Yoakam says via cell phone while
driving the streets of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It's this kind of behavior that has earned Yoakam a reputation
as one of America's hardest-working artists.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, with the tour's opening show halfway across the
country only 48 hours away, Yoakam is shoehorning in an interview
while heading to a studio to polish songs for his pal Billy Bob
Thornton's new movie.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent critical acclaim for his acting in several
movies, Yoakam sounds like he's ready to give his role as hip
hillbilly singer top billing for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   He ostensibly is touring into September behind a greatest-hits
compilation that features three new songs, but Yoakam sees this
outing _ his first since 1996 _ as a chance to finally showcase his
fine 1998 effort, ``A Long Way Home.''
</P>
<P>
   `` A Long Way Home' was an album that I was very proud of and
that I felt very satisfied about having done. I think it was a
great album to finish the decade and, for me, the century. It
really is about (how) we are finding ourselves oftentimes, in the
midst of all that we have and do, a great distance from home.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam was so enthusiastic about the album's hit ``Things
Change'' that he directed three versions of the video.
</P>
<P>
   His cutting-edge music videos _ he's directed all of them since
1995 _ provide a short course in the eclectic allure that he's
concocted since moving to LA two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The soundtracks have a definite twang, and Yoakam's distinctive,
ringing vocals are all business. He's often wearing his trademark
skintight jeans and eye-concealing cowboy hat, but the female
characters look like they'd be more at home in a Sunset Strip
nightclub than at a rodeo. The offbeat camera angles suggest an eye
that's more Martin Scorsese than Norman Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam, 42, says he's reaching a new audience through a video
that grew out of his cover of Queen's ``Crazy Little Thing Called
Love,'' originally cut for a Gap TV ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole willingness to participate in that ad was based on
the Louis Prima swing campaign they had done about a year and a
half ago, where I thought that the GAP ... paid almost a
tributelike respect to the music by illustrating that music ... had
had a profound effect on culture and it influenced even fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gap originally wanted to use Yoakam's ``Honky Tonk Man,''
but later suggested the Queen tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `You know what? I love the song! I've been a fan
of that song ever since Freddie Mercury wrote it as a homage,
ironically ... to hillbilly cats of the late '50s and early '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam also seems tickled by another new cover of sorts on the
``Last Chance for a Thousand Years'' hits CD _ ``Thinking About
Leaving,'' by Rodney Crowell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a huge fan of Rodney's. I just felt when I
heard it, `I love this, I'd love to be able to tailor it because
it's a song about a road musician.' ... We got on the phone and he
said, `Man, knock yourself out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a delicious mix of images by two of country
music's contemporary songsmiths.
</P>
<P>
   Legendary outlaw Waylon Jennings contributed the last new song
on the hits disc, ``I'll Go Back to Her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He sent it to me, (saying) `You know, for some reason I just
heard you in my head with this song,' '' Yoakam recalls. ``And I
was so flattered that he thought about me. I respect Waylon also as
one of those singularly unique artists in his own genre.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Jennings, Yoakam is respected for demanding ``artistic
freedom and total autonomy'' in his work.
</P>
<P>
   After a short excursion to Nashville in the late '70s, Yoakam
fled the urban cowboy craze and set up shop in LA. Did turning his
back on the Nashville Establishment carry a price?
</P>
<P>
   ``All of life is a yin and a yang; it's all double-edged. I
think that I would not have become who I am as an individual and an
artist ... anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've often said that I was born in Kentucky, raised in Ohio
and then grew up in California. I was 20 when I arrived here.''
</P>
<P>
   That artistic growth has most recently taken him into acting and
directing.
</P>
<P>
   After much praise for his portrayal of the abusive Doyle
Hargraves in ``Sling Blade,'' as well as wide-ranging roles in
films such as ``The Newton Boys,'' ``When Trumpets Fade'' and ``The
Minus Man,'' Yoakam is directing a self-penned ``Gothic Western,''
``South of Heaven, West of Hell.``
</P>
<P>
   Principal photography has been wrapped up on the film, much of
which was shot in southern Arizona. A release in 2000 is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down in Tucson ... and Patagonia _ up on the Sharp's
Ranch. We were there for about seven weeks total. ... I really love
that area of the state. I find that high desert is just
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam, who stars as ``a marshal that is haunted by his past,''
is joined on screen by Thornton, Vince Vaughn, Paul Reubens and
both Peter and Bridget Fonda. (He's been dating Bridget Fonda since
last year.)
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar-winning Thornton is a cinematic mentor for Yoakam. The
two have formed a film production company and are trying to wrap up
deals with Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston to star in a Thornton
vehicle called ``Waking Up in Reno.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience with Billy on `Sling Blade' was really
enlightening in as much as you're watching a writer-actor-director
really do something that was more akin to what I was accustomed to
as a singer-songwriter. He's very insular. He created the material
and executed performances and did the work as a director. His
encouragement was kind of the final shove in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam eventually will write a novel based on his film for
Hyperion, as well as two other stories.
</P>
<P>
   With all these creative forces in motion, is there room in one
man for Dwight Yoakam the musician, filmmaker and writer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I guess you'll have to check back with me after the end
of the tour and when I finish the film. I'll decide whether there
is or not. The jury is still out on that, but I think so. I think
it's just a matter of balancing.'' &QL;

 UNLIKELY TARGETS IN CAYMANS BANK INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ In movies and in novels, off-shore tax havens
like the Cayman Islands are depicted as the refuge of drug dealers,
mobsters and others with millions they need to hide. But federal
investigators and others involved in the prosecution of a former
Cayman Islands banker said that some of the depositors were ``the
rank and file of the upper-middle class,'' people like doctors and
lawyers with six-figure annual incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The details about the depositors emerged after the former
banker, John Mathewson, drew a lenient sentence Monday for his role
in a money laundering case. As soon as he was arrested, Mathewson
gave investigators the computer records of his Cayman Islands bank,
and lawyers in the case provided more details Tuesday on some of
the bank's nearly 2,000 American depositors.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal lawyers have yet to exhaust the prosecutorial
possibilities in the case, the government has already collected $50
million in back taxes and penalties from some of the depositors.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Mathewson, Oscar Gonzalez, described the
depositors as ``doctors, lawyers, business people,'' looking for
places to hide their money and evade taxes.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, these people heard about Mathewson's
services through word-of-mouth or through advertisements at the
airport on the British colony's main island, Grand Cayman. They
usually came to his Guardian Bank and Trust Co. offices with a
letter of reference and enough cash to pay the hefty fees to set up
and maintain the non-interest-bearing accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cost you $8,000 just to shake Mathewson's hand,'' said a
prosecutor who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mathewson
charged a $3,000 annual fee and $5,000 to set up the dummy
corporations that masked the true ownership of the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   These depositors had plenty of banks to choose from. Grand
Cayman Island, only 27 miles long and one mile wide, has 590 banks
and 490 insurance companies registered there. A no-tax policy and
strong confidentiality laws have helped the Caymans become the
world's fifth-largest banking center.
</P>
<P>
   The colony's rise in banking came in the mid-1970s. The Caymans
figured prominently as a tax haven and money-laundering center for
drug dealers, insider traders and others engaged in illegal
activity who relied on the government's dogged determination to
protect confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the island's government entered into treaties with the
United States in which it agreed to shed that confidentiality if
there was convincing evidence that a bank client was engaged in
criminal activities, as opposed to a ``fiscal or tax issue.'' Cases
of tax evasion did not meet the Caymans' definition of criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Feldhaus, a partner with the Washington office of the
law firm of Fulbright &AMP; Jaworski who specializes in tax law and
off-shore banking, pointed out Tuesday that it is not against U.S.
law to have an off-shore bank account, trust account or mutual fund
in the Caymans or anywhere else that is sheltered from taxes. It is
just illegal not to report the account on tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very legitimate role for places like the Caymans
where people want the ability to operate in a regulatory-neutral
and tax-neutral atmosphere,'' he said, adding that Mathewson was
just ``a bad apple in the box.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the failure to report such accounts that is the main
violation in most of the two dozen prosecutions that have already
emerged because of Mathewson's cooperation, said John Carney, an
assistant U.S. attorney in New Jersey, and Eric Bernstein, who has
the same title in the Eastern District of New York.
</P>
<P>
   One typical case, according to investigators and court papers,
is that of Frederick Gipp, a Long Island golf pro, who deposited
$150,000 in money orders under the name of a Caymans-registered
``shelf'' corporation provided by Mathewson. Gipp pleaded guilty to
failing to report the existence of the account on his tax returns.
Mathewson's cooperation helped snare him.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Dr. Bartholomew D'Ascoli, a New Jersey orthopedic
surgeon who deposited $394,000 in a Guardian account. When
Mathewson provided information on these transactions, the doctor
pleaded guilty in 1998 of evading $118,000 in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One 1994 case that resulted in guilty pleas was resolved before
Mathewson's cooperation began, but he later helped fill out the
details. Seymour Gleeman, a former midlevel IBM executive, his son
and a paralegal pleaded guilty to tax evasion and to using insider
information to purchase stock options through their Guardian
account.
</P>
<P>
   Mathewson drew a sentence of five years of probation in U.S.
District Court here on Monday. He could have been sentenced to as
much as five years in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Cayman Islands government Tuesday applauded
the prosecution of Mathewson, and said the island's liquidation of
his bank four years ago underscored the government's ``intolerance
of fraudulent activity.'' The statement said that the island's
police had worked closely with American authorities to uncover
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials noted that in 1997 the Cayman liquidators
of Guardian Bank and Trust sought to block the use of the computer
tapes for prosecutions; U.S. courts rebuffed that effort.

CONDE NAST DEFEATED BY NASDAQ IN FIGHT OVER TIMES SQUARE SIGN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The great Times Square sign battle ended Monday
afternoon, when an arbitrator ruled that Nasdaq, the electronic
stock market, could erect the largest video screen in the world on
the new Conde Nast skyscraper in Times Square despite objections
from S.I. Newhouse Jr., the magazine publishing tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   After months of delays, Frank G. Zarb, chief executive of
Nasdaq's parent, can now get on with building the eight-story,
14,000-square-foot sign that will wrap around the cylinder that
forms the southeast corner of 4 Times Square, at Broadway and 43rd
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb is hoping that the $25 million sign, which is roughly the
size of three basketball courts, will give Nasdaq a dazzling public
profile at the so-called crossroads of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse, whose Conde Nast company publishes The New Yorker,
Vanity Fair, Allure and 14 other magazines, is moving into the
48-story office tower and did not want a huge blinking sign outside
his windows.
</P>
<P>
   He said the sign violated his lease with the developer, Douglas
Durst, because it would jut out five feet from the building,
creating a tunnel-like effect around some of his windows.
</P>
<P>
   But in a two-paragraph decision, an arbitrator ruled that the
sign could go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased,'' said Michael Jones, a senior vice president
at the National Association of Securities Dealers, which owns
Nasdaq. ``We're going to proceed with building the sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Durst declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be business as usual,'' said Maurie Perl, a spokeswoman
for Newhouse and Conde Nast. ``We'll move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq had invested an enormous amount in the sign, which will
be the largest LED _ light-emitting diode _ in the world and the
largest single sign of any kind in Times Square. The rent for the
sign will be more than $2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq plans to display stock quotes and financial information,
as well as sell space for new publicly traded companies, or the
products of companies listed on the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the lease, the dispute was sent to what the
lawyers described as a ``binding baseball arbitration,'' meaning
there would be a winner and a loser, no compromises. If Conde Nast
had won, Durst would have lost a major tenant and a large sum of
money.

PEDIATRICIANS WARN OF EFFECTS OF TV ON CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH

<TEXT>
<P>
   Children under 2 years old should not watch television, older
children should not have television sets in their bedrooms, and
pediatricians should have parents fill out a ``media history,''
along with a medical history, on office visits, according to
recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that television viewing can affect the mental, social and
physical health of young people, the academy for the first time has
laid out a plan for how pediatricians and parents can deal with
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``As pediatricians, we are taking all the research concerns into
account, and trying to raise the bar a bit, as suggestions for
optimal parenting,'' said Dr. Marjorie Hogan, the lead author of
the report. The report appears in the August issue of Pediatrics
magazine, published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   No reliable research has been done on how television viewing
affects children younger than 2, Dr. Hogan said. But the Academy
based its recommendations for such children on knowledge of what
babies need for proper brain development _ notably close-up
interaction with older people _ and the common-sense notion that,
if they are watching television, babies are not getting those other
essential stimuli.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in movies and television has been linked to violent
behavior in young people in studies by the American Medical
Association, the American Psychological Association, the American
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the National
Institute of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   So while the academy may appear to be venturing into
sociological territory with little direct connection to medical
health issues, the study's authors say the influence of mass media
is a major public health concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, media violence,'' said Dr. Miriam Bar-on,
chairwoman of the academy's committee on public education, which
wrote the policy. ``A bullet in the body is a physical health
issue. Children who spend a lot of time in front of the TV set tend
to gain weight; obesity is a physical health issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Academy is distributing to its members a sample ``media
history'' checklist for their young patients. It includes questions
about movies, video and computer games, music videos and the
Internet, as well as about the radio and books.
</P>
<P>
   Also available to the 55,000 members are brochures explaining
the positive and negative influences that media can have on
children, with suggestions about how to guide families toward
positive uses, including critical discussion on what they watch. To
encourage such talk, the Academy suggests that televisions and
computers not be kept in children's bedrooms but in common rooms,
where parents can monitor and participate in children's use of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The policy's main purpose, the authors said, is to encourage
pediatricians and their patients to learn about and discuss the
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents interviewed Tuesday agreed that television's
influence was a proper concern for pediatricians, but that it was
unrealistic to set arbitrary limits, and unnecessary for doctors to
intervene unless a child already had social or emotional problems
that might be related to media exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the theory, but practically I think it's not very
doable,'' said Lari Mills of Nashville, Tenn., who has an
8-month-old baby as well as a 7-year-old and a 9-year-old. ``The
little one is often around the TV when the older ones are watching,
but he's not really watching it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Valerie Barney said her 2-year-old son watches
``Barney'' and ``The Teletubbies'' on PBS, and she sees no harm in
it as long as an adult is watching with him. ``He interacts very
well with the TV,'' she said. ``He sees someone fall down, he falls
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Teletubbies,'' a British import on PBS featuring a group of
cooing, brightly-colored creatures who babble baby talk, is the
only show on American television specifically made for children
under the age of 3. It was developed by an educational television
producer and a speech pathologist; nonetheless, many pediatricians
see little merit in it for very young viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't put it on in order to attract a younger and younger
audience,'' said John Wilson, senior vice president for programming
for PBS. ``But we know from research that there is an audience of
children under 2 watching television, for better or for worse, and
at least we have something on the air that is developmentally
appropriate for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Himself the parent of a 4 1/2-year-old son and a 9-month-old
daughter, Wilson said many families where both parents work might
be helped by ``taking this information to whoever is watching their
child during the day, and letting them know they should find
something else to do besides watch TV.``
</P>
<P>
   Brown Johnson, senior vice president for Nick Jr., the preschool
programming segments of the children's network Nickelodeon, said
she favored any policy that encouraged parents to spend time with
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television or videos will be used in some form, to give
parents a break to make dinner or whatever, so I'm not sure it's
realistic to say no television ever,'' she said. ``But if the AAP
has to make this kind of a declaration to have people really sit up
and listen, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy spent more than two years developing the latest
policy statement, which was approved by its board of directors in
May, but it has been involved in research and communications about
media influences on children for much longer. In 1990, it issued a
recommendation that older children not watch more than one to two
hours of ``quality'' television per day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1997, it began a ``Media Matters'' campaign to educate
pediatricians and the public about how media can influence
children, positively as well as negatively. For example, studies
have show that programs about the effects of substance abuse or
tobacco can influence adolescent behavior for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is clear that media use can have an effect on
children's overall health _ physical, mental, emotional,'' said
Vicky Rideout of the Kaiser Family Foundation in Menlo Park,
Calif., which has done studies on these subjects. ``To my knowledge
this is the first time such a clear blueprint has been laid out for
a pro-active role on the part of individual doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs, a nonprofit research group in Washington, D.C., agreed
that the delineating of specific recommendations for pediatricians
to give parents was a new step for the pediatric group, despite its
decade-old interest in the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a drive by health professionals to view
certain social problems as public health problems,'' he said,
noting also the Centers for Disease Control's recent efforts to
treat gun use as a public health issue.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It does make me a little nervous, people with
scientific credentials getting involved in social science issues,
but there is a lot of very good social science that watching TV
does have some potential to cause harm to kids, and people need to
realize what harm it might be doing to their child. It's not a bad
thing for health professionals to remind parents that they need to
be aware of the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're worried about what your kid eats, you should worry
about what your kid's watching.''

GOLF DAY IS NO DAY OFF FOR COWBOYS' EKUBAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By EBENEZER EKUBAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
The Cowboys' top draft pick, Ebenezer Ekuban, is writing a
training-camp diary that will appear regularly in the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram until camp breaks Aug. 25.''
\Nsubheds:Sunday, Aug. 1 Just one practice. At night, we had a
Cowboys golf social, which was real nice. I ate some fried catfish,
mashed potatoes, ribs, the normal stuff. But I was tired.
<TEXT>
<P>
   I caught the first bus back to the dorms. \Nsubheds:Monday, Aug.
2 We were off today so we could attend the Cowboys' golf classic, I
think that's what they called it. It was held at Wichita Falls
Country Club. This was my first time ever to golf. I did all right,
except everybody was scrutinizing me because I wore jeans, a
T-shirt, wide receiver gloves instead of golf gloves and football
cleats.
</P>
<P>
   All the coaches and the trainers said, ``Eb, at least look good
if you don't know how to play.'' I guess I was supposed to wear a
collared-shirt, some linen or khaki pants, golf shoes, stuff like
that. But I didn't know any better. I never golfed before.
</P>
<P>
   I never knew golf took six hours to play. By the time I got to
the ninth hole, I was slicing the ball or missing it altogether. I
was so tired. It felt like a practice. But most of the time, I was
hitting it ... not always straight, but I was hitting it.
\Nsubheds:Tuesday, Aug. 3 Defensive tackle Darren Benson asked if
he could work out with me after practice. If somebody wants to work
out extra with me, I say come on. It keeps me motivated. Plus, I
can work on my technique stuff because I have somebody simulating
an offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Darren is really a great guy. From the very first day, he
greeted me with open arms. He tells me, ``Hey, rookie, you always
look like you're thinking about something. What are you thinking
about?''
</P>
<P>
   I am a rookie. Everything is new to me. So I guess I'm thinking
about all the stuff I need to learn.

TONY AYALA JR. ATTEMPTS TO REVIVE BOXING CAREER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ On a miserably hot day in June, Tony Ayala Jr. was
doing situps on a wobbly table. For a man trying to make good after
16 years of hard time, at least the hardscrabble setting for a
fairy-tale, Rocky Balboa-like comeback is in place.
</P>
<P>
   A musty haze hangs in the Zarzamora Street gym, a shoe box of a
building that hugs the gritty part of this city's East Side and
once served as a bingo hall.
</P>
<P>
   As Ayala grimaces with each situp, the noise around him
distracts his efforts to trim his waistline. There is the
rat-a-tat-tat of the jump rope, the swish of spit hitting a bucket,
the whining whirl of the big, dusty fan that sits in the window of
the sweatbox, and the grunts of the anonymous club fighters who
pound the heavy bag.
</P>
<P>
   The journeymen peek at the 36-year-old with the receding
hairline and the thick mustache and must wonder what it's like to
go to hell and back, to be a promising young fighter with
Tyson-like power and a $750,000 paycheck on the horizon one minute,
and Inmate No. 69765 the next.
</P>
<P>
   But today, Ayala is preparing for his first prize fight since
1982, against middleweight Manuel Esparza for a guaranteed purse of
$200,000 on Aug. 20 here in his hometown. This is the latest step
on the road back _ a journey that began with Ayala seriously
contemplating suicide _ to what he hopes will lead to the title
shot he blew when he was a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are stacked against him, as they would be for any
thirtysomething who has spent nearly half his life behind bars and
is now trying to compete in a young man's game. And frankly, not
many want to see him succeed. There is not a whole lot of sympathy
out there for convicted rapists.
</P>
<P>
   But the day Ayala lost it all was a lifetime ago, way before the
boozing, the heavy drug use, and the vicious behavior that led to
his 16-year stay in prison for sexual assault. Now, he just wants
another chance, another chance to prove to his hometown that he is
straight and clean, another chance at a title shot that was within
his grasp after he was undefeated in 22 pro fights, another chance
to love his wife, Lisa, whose own love for him wavered from
time-to-time but never dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived two lives,'' he said. ``My life as a boxer was pretty
honorable. But outside the ring, as you can tell, I was pretty
messed up. I had some serious problems that I didn't deal with, and
it cost me 16 years of my life. But God has blessed me with a
golden moment, a challenge. I'd be stupid not to take on this
challenge. I'm not going to blow this thing.'' \Nsubheds:DOWN FOR
THE COUNT Ayala seemed destined to become a fighter. His father,
and trainer, Tony Ayala Sr., worked two jobs _ he was an airplane
mechanic at Kelly Air Force Base and ran a hamburger joint _ so
that his boys could work on their boxing skills. The oldest Ayala
boy, Mike, 41, was a World Boxing Council super bantamweight
champion and made 19 title defenses. Sammy Ayala, 40, was once
ranked No. 7 in the world as a lightweight and junior welterweight.
Paulie Ayala, 32, had 18 amateur fights as a bantamweight, but had
to retire because of cuts on his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But Tony was considered the fiercest of the Ayala fighters.
After knocking down one opponent, Jose Luis Baltazar, he spit on
him because Baltazar insulted him before the fight. Ayala Jr. kept
beating another opponent, Robbie Epps, even after the referee had
stopped the fight because he believed Epps had insulted his father.
</P>
<P>
   From the time he began his professional career in 1980 until
1982, he was 22-0 with 19 knockouts. He became the mandatory
challenger for the WBA junior middleweight title held by Davey
Moore, in which he was guaranteed a purse of $750,000. There was
even talk of future fights with Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Duran,
Thomas Hearns and Marvin Hagler.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala's future appeared to be set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the way people looked at \RMike\S Tyson when he
first came up; there was an excitement about him, an electricity,''
said Don Elbaum, a longtime boxing historian who served as an
adviser for several fighters, including Moore. ``The Davey Moore
fight? That would have been over with in two or three rounds. And
Tony absolutely would have beaten Sugar Ray Leonard. Tony was a
brawler, but he was smart. He had a left hook that he could knock
out heavyweights with. Everyone was always fighting for his life
when they stepped in the ring with Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would be Ayala's life that was soon in peril.
</P>
<P>
   He was loaded on heroin and booze during the early morning hours
of New Year's Day 1983 when he returned to his West Patterson,
N.J., apartment after a night of arguing with his wife, Lisa Paez.
Once Paez was asleep, the 19-year-old Ayala broke into the house of
a female neighbor, tied her up and raped her. According to the
police report, at one time during the assault, Ayala asked the
woman if she wanted to have his baby.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala had already been on probation for assaulting a woman in
the ladies' room of a San Antonio drive-in theater four years
earlier. There would be no leniency for the sexual assault. He was
sentenced to 35 years in prison and would have to serve at least 15
before becoming eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Ayala camp has made any excuses for what he did.
Not his father. Not his wife, who had an on-again, off-again,
on-again relationship with him while he served prison time. Not
Ayala himself.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one can pity him because he was, he says, sexually
molested as a little boy by a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blamed myself for what happened,'' he said, ``I thought what
happened to me was because I was bad, fat, unlovable, or perhaps
even gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Or one can pity him because he hung with the wrong crowd and was
already smoking reefer by the time he was 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went from marijuana to heroin pretty quick,'' he said, ``I
was under the influence of that stuff all the time, even when I was
fighting. I fought three times just before I used heroin.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ayala refuses to make excuses. When pressed, however, he
serves up explanations:
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was a wild and crazy guy, but I never fantasized
about raping women,'' he said. ``I didn't get off on controlling
women or beating women up. I'm not into sadomasochist types of
relationships. That's not what I was about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did it happen? It happened because I realized that there
was a great deal of insecurities going on inside my head. I wanted
to be loved by someone who didn't know me, who didn't know I was a
prizefighter, who didn't know I had money. I wanted to be loved
because I was a person, because I was worth loving. It was insane,
crazy. I realize that. A lot of people ask, `Wasn't having your
wife enough?' Yes and no. I thought I'd fooled my wife into
marrying me.'' \Nsubheds:DOING TIME Rocky Balboa-like comeback?
Maybe. Maybe not. At the least, Ayala can say he met the man who
gave the character life in the five ``Rocky'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the prison movie, ``Lockup'', starring Sylvester
Stallone, was filmed at Rahway prison in New Jersey, where Ayala
did much of his 16 years. Ayala was on standby as an extra for the
movie in which Stallone's character exposes the warden for illegal
doings.
</P>
<P>
   But prison, of course, was anything but a fairy tale for Ayala.
And in the beginning, Ayala was determined not to have anything to
do with it. During a telephone conversation with his father,
nicknamed Big Tony, Ayala cried and wondered whether he could do so
much time in a place where he needed permission just to see birds
chirping.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Ayala begged for his father's blessing so that he could
kill himself. Big Tony granted it, then said he'd take his own life
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony had such a long stretch ahead of him, the demons were
still in his head,'' Big Tony said. ``I said, `What a cowardly way
to go.' I told him I would do the same thing. I said, `You
committed a terrible crime, and now you are paying for it, but you
are not the only one in this. Your family, your family name.' I
told him that I'd stand by him through the whole thing. After some
deep thinking, he said he had changed his mind and would do the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   On the advice of a friend, Ayala began therapy sessions with the
Trenton State Prison psychologist, Brian Raditz. From the
beginning, Ayala connected with Raditz. The two had a close
relationship with their fathers and an athletic background in
common. Raditz, 45, was a former amateur boxer and played college
football at Glassboro State College in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala took to the therapy sessions like he was training for a
fight. Scheduled for only once or twice a week, sometimes Ayala
found ways to get into Raditz's office four or five times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Ayala began confiding more and more in Raditz. According
to the police report, Ayala said the sex was consensual. But as the
therapy progressed, Ayala said he broke down and finally admitted
to the crime, recounting every horrible detail. He also confided in
Raditz about how ``a family friend'' sexually assaulted him for two
years while he was in elementary school. He told Raditz about the
drugs, and the booze, and the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really messed up having been sexually molested and I
guess that's why that when I got in the ring, there was a rage, and
outside the ring the rage still existed,'' Ayala said. ``I
recognized very early the happiness I could find through the use of
drugs. I progressively got worse as I got older and used more
drugs. When I smoked or got drunk or used heroin, life was OK. The
challenge outside the ring was to make more money to get more
quantities of drugs. Inside the ring, the challenge was to use my
manhood for my sense of honor. It's like, I'd beat you down or
you'd have to kill me so that I wouldn't impose my will on you.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the therapy sessions came the healing. And as the
months turned into the years, as the 1980s turned into the 1990s,
the itch to box stayed with Ayala. At Rahway State Prison in the
early 1990s, he often sparred with the heavyweights. His sparring
privileges were soon revoked, however, when, according to Raditz,
Ayala sent four men to the hospital with broken ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that happens,'' Raditz was told by prison administrators,
``we have to pay for police cars to follow the ambulance. It's not
cost effective.'' WHAT LIES AHEAD Now, on this hot, miserable day,
just minutes after his workout, Ayala is sitting on the back of his
shiny, blue pickup truck that his wife bought him shortly after his
release from prison last April.
</P>
<P>
   He's talking about how much things have changed since he was
gone: ``I'm still learning how to use a cell phone,'' he says, ``I
just know when it makes a sound, press the `send' button.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's talking about life as a registered sex offender: ``I've
had no problems with anyone since I've been back. The reception has
been pretty good. \RRegarding his registration as a sex offender\S
Hey, that's something I've got to deal with. But the state does not
have to worry about me. I'm not some sick guy that has to get off
by beating up on women.''
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, as he rubs the sweat from his brow, Ayala is talking
about freedom, and chasing a dream that ended that New Year's Day
some 16 years ago. For Ayala, it's not can he do it, but when. He
is expected to fight two or three more times as a 160-pound
middleweight after the Esparza fight. If things fall right, he'd
like to get down to 154 pounds to have a chance at WBA junior
middleweight champion David Reid, or International Boxing
Federation middleweight champion Fernando Vargas. There's even been
talk of a future fight with Oscar De La Hoya, who has talked of
moving up in weight class.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, boxing historian Bert Sugar submits that the biggest battle
Ayala must win is the battle against himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask yourself that when \RRaditz\S helped Tony with
his problems, did he also take the thorn out of his paw?'' Sugar
said. ``Is the one thing that made Tony so good and so angry not
there anymore? Now, that he is not a terror outside the ring, can
he be one in the ring? That's what we are all waiting to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala waits as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why fight? Pride, maybe,'' he said. ``I want to get with these
young bucks who think they are all of that. When I was fighting in
the 1980s, I ruled the junior middleweights. I have my health, my
body, and while it isn't what it once was, it's a lot better than I
thought. I've got a chance to do something historic, to redeem
myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do everything in my power to do just that.
Everything.''

PATIENCE KEY FOR MUSER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony Muser admits that, yes, sometimes, he has the urge to go
off. Just once, it might feel pretty good to put his fist through a
chalkboard or take a bat to a water cooler. Lord knows, he'd take
better cuts than Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   The first major-league managing job of Muser, now in his second
full season with the Kansas City Royals, is rife with what the
euphemistically inclined would refer to as challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Muser has been asked to work with a payroll that just might
cover a New York bar tab. Some of his players are so young they
belong in Omaha not for Triple-A ball, but to play in the College
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   As for the playoffs, the only wild-card talk you'll hear in the
Kansas City clubhouse is when a poker game breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, each time his players' inexperience or inability causes
Muser's eyes to narrow and the capillaries in his face to flush
with blood, he summons a deep breath and reminds himself to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience'' is the word Muser uses and it's one that has long
served him well.
</P>
<P>
   Muser, who grew up in Lakewood and is a longtime Los Alamitos
resident, coached in professional baseball more than 17 years and
interviewed for eight major-league managing jobs when Royals
general manager Herk Robinson called during the 1997 All-Star break
and asked if he'd like to replace Bob Boone for the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was somewhat in shock,'' said Muser, then a coach with the
Chicago Cubs who was twice passed over for their managerial job.
``You don't get a call like that very often.''
</P>
<P>
   What Muser walked into was an organization in transition. The
Royals had decided that, as a small-market club, they didn't have
the TV revenues to compete for premium free agents or keep their
own high-priced talent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, Kansas City has followed a course of
salary-dumping trades and letting most of their veteran free agents
walk away.
</P>
<P>
   They reduced this year's payroll to less than $24 million, fifth
lowest in the league. And after the recent trade of Kevin Appier
and the retirement earlier this season of Jeff King (who combined
for $8,8 million in salary), the 25 players now on the roster will
make slightly more than the $11.9 million the Orioles are paying
Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations were so low that the Royals put Hall of Fame
inductee George Brett on the cover of their media guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people said we'd be ugly to watch and we'd be the
worst team in baseball,'' Muser said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Royals are the kind of team one might expect from
the 52-year-old son on an ex-Marine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very militaristic,'' said first baseman Mike Sweeney.
``If you play hard, he'll be happy. Some managers you don't know
what to expect. All he expects is for you to give your heart and
soul to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   With an 11-4 victory over the Angels well in hand on Monday
night, Sweeney nearly toppled over the dugout railing trying to
catch a pop fly. An inning later, catcher Chad Kreuter's hard slide
kept Angels second baseman Andy Sheets from turning a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Muser has banned golf clubs from road trips, not allowed injured
players to travel and isn't afraid to use the bench as a motivator,
as he did with rookie of the year candidate Carlos Beltran early
this season when Beltran loafed after a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Muser, though, says he has only two rules: be on time and if
your body is between the chalked lines, your head better be, too.
Most importantly, he says, there are no exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to treat the 25th man as if he's as important
as the star,'' Muser said. ``It's very easy not to discipline the
star. There are times when you want to turn your head when you see
something you don't like, but there's 24 other guys who saw the
same thing you did and they're looking at you to see if you turn
your head.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be some people who don't like it, but I
think you gain respect when you treat everybody like they're the
best on the team. You've got to communicate to everybody why
they're important, no matter if it's a swing reliever, a backup
utility infielder.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this, of course, has translated into a winning season.
The Royals are 44-61 and find themselves in a familiar position
fourth place in the A.L. Central, 20 games behind Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   While young and inexperienced, the Royals are not without talent
particularly offensively, where their .290 batting average is
second in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran and another 22-year-old rookie, second baseman Carlos
Febles, have established themselves as every day players and
Sweeney, Jermaine Dye and third baseman Joe Randa have had breakout
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, a converted catcher, is batting .336 with 17 homers and
75 RBI, Randa is hitting .331 with 14 homers and was named the A.L.
Player of the Month in July, while Dye leads the Royals with 21
homers and 87 RBI and is batting .310 (He also leads A.L.
outfielders with 11 assists.) Add left fielder Johnny Damon and
left-handed pitcher Jose Rosado, a two-time All-Star, into the mix
and there is reason for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The good work has been undone by a lack of pitching,
particularly in the bullpen where the Royals have blown a
major-league leading 21 saves and have lost eight more games in
which the bullpen entered with the score tied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the standings and we're last or next to it and
we're well below .500, but doggone it, it's been a good season,''
Robinson said. ``Before the season, we decided that talking about
wins and losses wasn't the right thing to do. The one thing I asked
for is that Tony and the coaches put the players in an environment
where they're able to succeed. I hate to see players
underachieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was pleased enough at the All-Star break to extend
Muser's contract through the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   It may not pass for job security in New York or Los Angeles, but
it's fine for Kansas City and Los Alamitos, too. As Muser is quick
to remind, it's his 32nd consecutive one-year contract.

NEW USES HAVE INCREASED DEMAND FOR TELEPHONE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years I remembered a book I read in elementary school about
two kids who skipped out of school and lived in a cave. It was
called ``Hunter's Hideout.'' I loved that book, and kept an eye out
for it in used-book stores.
</P>
<P>
   I probably never would have found it without the Internet.
Monday it showed up on Bibliofind.com at a bookstore in Stony
Point, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Voila!
</P>
<P>
   This is not an amazing story. It is a common story to anyone who
has gone Net-shopping for the obscure.
</P>
<P>
   Another story: In Finland, the home of Nokia Corp. and the
world's No. 1 user of cell phones, the latest fad is sending
messages by using letters on the keypad. It is a kind of instant
e-mail, costing about 18 cents. Students have been caught using
cell phones to e-mail the answers during classroom tests.
</P>
<P>
   What the two stories have in common is the telephone. From
e-mail to cell phones to debit cards to the Net, new uses have
increased the demand for telephone time.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, US West handles 1.25 billion phone calls
per month. That's nearly double the number of calls handled three
years ago. The peak calling hour nationwide used to be 2 p.m., when
people were at work; it is now 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., when folks are at
home, online.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that every household had one phone line. By 1996,
11 percent of US West subscribers here had more than one. That's
now 20 percent, and would be higher except for the digital
subscriber line, which uses a connector to squeeze voice and data
onto one wire.
</P>
<P>
   The growth is also in business lines. Five years ago, says
forecast manager Chuck Hanson, GTE Northwest put in three business
voice lines for every data line. Those proportions are now
reversed. Data lines are now 25 percent of the installed base.
</P>
<P>
   Last year GTE Northwest, which serves much of the high-tech
suburbs of Seattle and Portland, Ore., expanded its overall
capacity by 13 percent, nearly double the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Some folks may wonder if we need all this capacity. I didn't
think I needed the cell phone I recently got. I don't use it much.
But the thing creeps up on you. Get one, and you will be calling
from the supermarket aisle: ``How about salmon tonight?'' With two
cell phones you'll be calling a lost partner at Seattle Mariner
games. The thing starts as a toy and becomes an essential tool of
teenager management.
</P>
<P>
   Control is offered by other technologies. For a century, the
phone rang, and you did not know who it was. In the 1970s I knew
folks that so hated unwanted calls that they told their friends to
let it ring once, hang up and call again. Then came the answering
machine. Now comes caller ID. In Washington state, 31 percent of US
West customers have caller ID, and can see the caller's name and
number before they answer.
</P>
<P>
   In response to this, some 12 percent of US West customers _ and
most telephone solicitors _ subscribe to ``line blocking.'' Caller
ID can't read the number of a blocked line. In response, most
Caller ID systems shunt such callers to a recording. Unblock your
line by hitting (star sign) 82, it says, or forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Line blocking is the digital equivalent of the unlisted number.
Some 28 percent of US West customers have unlisted numbers.
</P>
<P>
   All these changes are happening to a technology that's been
around since the 1880s. But what a difference. Transatlantic calls
have been ``around'' since American Telephone &AMP; Telegraph opened
service to London in 1927, at $75 in gold dollars (about $750 in
today's money) for the first three minutes. That cost is now 36
cents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927 AT&AMP;T's transatlantic line could handle one call at a
time and had to be booked in advance. In 1956 the company laid a
cable and triumphantly announced that its London circuit could
handle 36 calls at once. Now AT&AMP;T and its competitors can handle
millions.
</P>
<P>
   And all this change has not stopped. The telephone companies are
scrambling to update their webs of copper wire for the 21st
century. The cable companies are hoping to supplant them. The
wireless companies envision a future in which we ditch wires
entirely, and call each other via satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, AirTouch Cellular announced that it was offering
Internet service for cellular users.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what I'd need that for. But my great-grandparents
probably weren't sure what they needed a telephone for, either. It
took them a while to figure it out. Maybe they never figured it
out.
</P>
<P>
   But their kids did.

MAD SCRAMBLE FOR FINAL RYDER CUP SPOTS UNDER WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With our minds on match play, thanks to Monday's overhyped
exhibition between Tiger Woods and David Duval, this seems an
appropriate time to shift the spotlight toward the Ryder Cup, where
more significant matches will take place next month.
</P>
<P>
   Players interested in joining the U.S. team for those Sept.
23-26 matches have only two weeks left to meet minimum qualifying
standards or pique the interest of captain Ben Crenshaw, who will
make two at-large selections for the 12-member squad.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into tomorrow's opening round of the Buick Open, four
players are mathematical locks to make the U.S. team: Woods, Duval,
Payne Stewart and Davis Love III. In addition, Mark O'Meara, Hal
Sutton and Justin Leonard should be shoo-ins to compete against the
Europeans at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The final three automatic berths, as well as Crenshaw's at-large
picks, remain open to major changes between now and the final putt
at the PGA Championship (Aug. 12-15), the last tournament in which
points can be accumulated for 1999 Ryder Cup consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Among the primary contenders are Jim Furyk, Phil Mickelson, Jeff
Maggert, Steve Stricker, John Huston, Chris Perry, Tom Lehman,
Steve Pate, Fred Couples, Lee Janzen, Scott Hoch and Corey Pavin.
</P>
<P>
   Read between the lines of Crenshaw's comments and one thing
seems clear: He will value U.S. Open success highly when he makes
his at-large picks. The Country Club has hosted two Opens (1963,
1988) and favors control players rather than erratic, long bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My two picks will certainly reflect how well I think they can
play Brookline,'' Crenshaw said. ``That's a course where you need a
lot of local knowledge because of the small greens. It requires a
steady player who makes good decisions. It lends itself more to a
control player.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, your prototypical U.S. Open player.
</P>
<P>
   Among the potential invitees, that should be good news for
Janzen, a two-time Open champ, as well as Lehman, Pavin and
Mickelson. Less enthused about Crenshaw's stance should be Couples,
Pate, Huston and Perry. None of them have cracked the top 15 at the
Open since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Hoch could be a decent darkhorse. He has five top-10 finishes at
the Open this decade. Stricker (fifth) and Herron (sixth) are
coming off career-best Open efforts in June at Pinehurst (N.C.)
Resort and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw, however, has two weeks left in which to finalize his
decision. And one factor trumps the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to go by feel,'' said Crenshaw, an emotional sort.
``I can't do something I'm not capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   The smart money, however, is betting that Crenshaw feels good
about at-large picks with glittering U.S. Open records.
Spotlight on ...
Webb, Inkster formulating course to player of the year
</P>
<P>
   Ladies, start your calculators.
</P>
<P>
   The race is on to determine player-of-the-year honors on the
LPGA Tour, and it figures to be a numbers-cruncher between Karrie
Webb and Juli Inkster until the final round of the final
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of her victory in last week's du Maurier Classic, Webb
(291.29) picked up 60 points and zipped past Inkster (251) into
first place. With no majors remaining to produce double points,
Webb's move was timely because neither player can pick up more than
30 points for a victory at any remaining event.
</P>
<P>
   That is key for Inkster, who can earn the one remaining point
she needs for enshrinement in the LPGA Hall of Fame in one of three
ways: 1, win another tournament; 2, earn player of the year honors;
or 3, win the Vare Trophy, given to the player with the lowest
scoring average.
</P>
<P>
   Webb (68.97) also leads Inkster (69.63) in the scoring race,
meaning Inkster's best bet to earn enshrinement in 1999 might be to
win another tournament by the end of the season. Either that, or
stack together a bunch of runner-up finishes (worth 12 points
each).
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens, Inskter said she will cherish her
two major championships (U.S. Women's Open, LPGA Championship) more
than a player-of-the-year title. Even if falling short in the
standings means waiting until 2000 to resume her Hall of Fame
quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't get player of the year, that's fine with me,''
Inkster said. ``I'd much rather have the two majors. No one can
ever take those away.''
Chip shots Kuehne's debut
</P>
<P>
   Hank Kuehne, the reigning U.S. Amateur champion from SMU, will
make his professional debut on the PGA Tour at the Sprint
International (Aug. 19-22). Kuehne said he hopes to make enough
money in seven events to avoid a trip to qualifying school in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne, who can accept seven sponsor's exemptions during the
1999 season, already has been added to the field for the Air Canada
Championship (Sept. 2-5) and the B.C. Open (Sept. 16-19). In
addition, he has requested sponsor's exemptions at the Reno-Tahoe
Open, Westin Texas Open, Buick Challenge and National Car Rental
Classic at Walt Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne, 23, has not played a tour event since finishing as low
amateur at the U.S. Open because he followed a vacation to Spain
with laser eye surgery July 16 in Arlington.
Player for the ages
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Gary Player to get emotional this week if he
defends his title at the Lightpath Long Island Classic and becomes
the oldest winner in Senior PGA Tour history. Player, 63, figures
it's a foregone conclusion that he'll own the title. Eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age isn't a factor for me,'' Player said. ``I've never
questioned I would win again out here. I will win in my 70s. I do
1,000 situps a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Player, who turns 64 on Nov. 1, seeks to eclipse the mark of
Mike Fetchick, who won the 1985 Hilton Head Seniors Classic on his
63rd birthday.
Inside the numbers Aging gracefully By defending his title at this
week's Lightpath Long Island Classic, 63-year-old Gary Player would
become the oldest winner in Senior PGA Tour history. Below are the
top five: Golfer/Age/Event Mike Fetchick/63 years, 0 days/1985
Hilton Head Seniors Invitational Gary Player/62 years, 9 months, 22
days/1998 Long Island Classic Jimmy Powell/61 years, 8 months, 5
days/1996 Brickyard Crossing C'ship Bruce Crampton/61 years, 7
months, 20 days/1997 Cadillac NFL Classic Roberto De Vicenzo/61

METS TOP BREWERS TO RECLAIM FIRST PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ It was obvious how much this game meant to Bill
Pulsipher, who was pitching against the Mets for the first time
since they traded him to the Milwaukee Brewers a little over a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it meant a little more to his old team.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Robin Ventura and Orel Hershiser, the Mets reclaimed
first place from the Atlanta Braves in the National League East
with a 10-3 victory Tuesday night over Pulsipher and the Brewers at
County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The victory also gave the Mets the best record in New York: they
are 65-43, a .602 winning percentage, while the Yankees are 63-42,
.600.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura went 4-for-4 with three singles, a home run and three
RBIs. And the Mets also got seven and a third strong innings from
Hershiser (11-8) to pull a game ahead of the Braves, who lost at
Pittsburgh, 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to say which hurt Pulsipher more: his own porous
defense or Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet was the word that Mike Piazza used before the game to
describe Ventura's productivity over the years, as in, ``He's done
it very, very quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a self-promoter,'' said Piazza, who also helped out
with a three-run home run in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the way Ventura has played this season, everything he
has done has stood out.
</P>
<P>
   The steady defense at third base was expected: Ventura won five
Gold Gloves in the American League. So was quality output at the
plate. But it is doubtful that many expected this kind of offensive
season from the 32-year-old Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   In 106 games, Ventura _ who has never finished a season with a
batting average over .300 _ is hitting .304. In his last seven
games, Ventura has six homers and 12 RBIs. For the year, he leads
the club with 24 home runs and 88 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers project to 36 homers and 132 RBIs over a full
season. Ventura's career highs are 34 homers and 105 RBIs, both in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   This comes after the Mets signed him to a four-year, $32 million
deal following an injury-plagued 1997 in which he hit .262 and a
puzzling 1998 in which he needed to bat .337 over the season's
final month to finish at .263.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the left-handed-hitting Ventura blooped a
run-scoring single off the left-handed Pulsipher to highlight a
two-run first inning. Then he singled in a run in the third to give
the Mets a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers rallied for two runs in the third. Brian Banks'
lead-off homer was Milwaukee's first hit off Hershiser. Ron
Belliard followed with a single and was sacrificed to second by
Pulsipher. One out later, Hershiser tried something cute _ and it
cost him.
</P>
<P>
   He noticed that Belliard was not looking as he returned to
second after a pitch. And so Hershiser took one of Piazza's tosses
back to him, turned and lobbed the ball to Rey Ordonez at
shortstop. Hershiser was trying to set up the hidden ball trick,
but it caught Ordonez by surprise, too. The ball went into left
field, Belliard took third, Jeff Cirillo singled on an 0-2 pitch,
and the Mets' lead was down to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers gave the Mets the two runs back in the fourth
inning, however, even after Hershiser struck out trying to
sacrifice runners to second and third. Shawon Dunston and Ordonez
took off on a double steal, Banks, the catcher, threw the ball into
left field, and both runners scored for a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura made it 6-2 in the fifth with a two-out homer to finish
the scoring off Pulsipher (3-2). He gave up nine hits and six runs,
four of them earned, in his five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dunston singled in a run with two outs in the seventh for a 7-2
lead, and Piazza poked a three-run homer inside the right-field
foul pole, his 23rd off the season and fifth off Milwaukee pitching
this year, with two outs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   All Hershiser needed to do was complete two more innings, and
the Mets would have had their first complete game since Sept. 4 of
last year. Hershiser could get only one out in the eighth, however,
and Turk Wendell finished the eighth and Masato Yoshii, in his
first relief appearance of the season, pitched the ninth. And the
Mets were at 129 games and counting since their last complete game.
</P>
<P>
   But they were also back in first place. All by themselves.

EDITORIAL: REFORMING SPECIAL EDUCATION
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 4:
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Education threatened earlier this summer
to withhold more than $300 million in aid unless New York state
changed a funding formula that encouraged school districts to dump
as many children as possible into special education classes. The
formula gave districts extra money for putting children in special
education. But the dumping that resulted violated federal law. The
New York state Legislature has now changed the formula, giving
districts a financial incentive to begin mainstreaming the disabled
by putting them in general classes. This is a useful first step.
But more needs to be done to overhaul a special education system
that is both discriminatory and educationally unsound.
</P>
<P>
   First, in addition to incentives, Albany should devise penalties
for districts that persist in over-classifying children as
disabled. Second, the state should insure that the additional funds
are aimed at helping children with special needs who are returned
to the mainstream, and not diverted to other education purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The state Education Commissioner, Richard Mills, proposed
changes in the formula three years ago. The proposals went nowhere
at first, partly because legislators and school districts had a
heavy vested interest in the system as it stood, and partly because
parents feared that disabled children would suddenly be routed into
general classrooms without the necessary support services. The
federal government ended the impasse by demonstrating statistically
that New York was putting too many disabled students in special
education classes, and then threatening to withhold funding until
the problem was solved.
</P>
<P>
   The new formula should move more students into mainstream
classrooms. But it does not address federal reservations about
racial discrimination. Federal officials have already accused New
York City of shunting disproportionate numbers of black and Latino
children into special-education classes. Washington is also
scrutinizing the practice in some suburbs, where as many as one in
three black students are confined to dead-end classes that are
often held in separate buildings. Albany needs to identify where
these discriminatory assignment patterns exist, and take action
before the federal government returns with new sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The new funding formula is a solid improvement. But so far, the
measure is all carrot and no stick.

EDITORIAL: MRS. CLINTON'S REFLECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 4:
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky gave her side of the story. President Clinton
spoke for the grand jury's unfriendly video camera. Now, in a
puzzling interview with Talk magazine, Hillary Rodham Clinton has
provided her own view of her husband's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. That view is both highly forgiving and deeply ambiguous,
and it has sparked a lively and predictably partisan debate as to
whether Mrs. Clinton has damaged her campaign for the Senate. If
there has been damage, this is one case in which the first lady
cannot demonize the press. She had her say in the context of an
article that was both militantly laudatory and unanalytic.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, Mrs. Clinton describes the ``enormous pain,
enormous anger'' that most people could well imagine. She explains
that she has no plans to leave the president after his term ends,
that ``we just have a deep connection that transcends whatever
happens.'' Then she goes on to describe the president's dalliance
as the result of emotional abuse he suffered in a dysfunctional
family. In his case, she said, the problem started as a young child
when he was shifted between his mother and grandmother, trying to
please both. Moreover, she sees his tendency to stray as ``a
weakness,'' not an addiction, and concludes that overall, her
husband is ``a very, very good man.''
</P>
<P>
   The partisan division in the response to these remarks has run
something like this. Anti-Clinton forces contend that the first
lady has blundered politically by forcing people to consider a
marriage of which many citizens are heartily weary. Some even
characterize this as the mistake of a novice candidate. It is also
argued that blaming two deceased women for a bad home environment
is yet another unseemly attempt to absolve Clinton for his
irresponsible stewardship of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's supporters see her comments as the necessary
airing of a painful topic. In this view, she has strengthened
herself with a feminist constituency that saw her as overly passive
by pronouncing a public judgment on her husband. This was, in other
words, a mandatory exercise analogous to Vice President Gore's
denunciation of the president's conduct as ``inexcusable.''
According to this logic, Mrs. Clinton had to address the state of
her marriage sooner or later, and she was smart to pick a low-risk
environment.
</P>
<P>
   On the tactical question, we come down somewhere in the middle.
In political matters, Mrs. Clinton has sometimes misread the public
mood, but not for lack of thinking and planning. She probably did
not stumble into this subject matter as a consequence of feeling
too relaxed around her interviewer. Yet while not a novice in
campaigns, she is a newcomer to the candidate's role. So she made
the relatively common mistake of answering a difficult question in
a way that stirred up new curiosities instead of putting old ones
to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, her comments to Talk contained just enough
self-revelation to touch on a lot of lingering questions about the
Clintons' unusual partnership, about her views of family dynamics
and about the interplay of personality and leadership
responsibility. Such questions about a candidate's personal
qualities should not dominate a campaign, but neither are they out
of bounds as matters of public concern and prudent journalism when
voters are choosing a U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   In a contest involving two personalities as distinctive as Mrs.
Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the potential Republican
nominee, every citizen will have to reach a decision that balances
all aspects of a candidate's abilities, issues positions and
personal qualities. It is doubtful that Mrs. Clinton has done any
real damage to her candidacy with her comments, but she has
probably started a conversation that will progress by fits and
starts for months.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki and legislative leaders have
agreed on a plan that gives the courts new authority to force
mentally ill people to undergo treatment or face hospitalization
against their will.
</P>
<P>
   With the plan announced Tuesday, New York is now set to join
nearly 40 other states that have enacted similar laws after years
of concern over mental patients who have become violently unstable
after they are released from psychiatric institutions and are left
to take medication on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The situation has been of particular concern in New York state,
where the state has shut down many of its psychiatric hospitals and
placed tens of thousands of mentally ill people back into the
community, where they are supposed to receive additional medical
care from the state but often do not.
</P>
<P>
   Under current laws, involuntary commitment is limited to people
deemed by a judge to be a danger to themselves or others. But under
the agreed-upon legislation, medical experts or relatives can
petition the court to have a mentally ill person ordered to comply
with treatment or be temporarily hospitalized for up to 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and
Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, is expected to affect as
many as 4,000 people a year and will cost about $40 million for
additional counseling, medication and any other treatment a judge
might order. The bulk of that money, about $30 million, is included
in the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that I think is going to have a profound
impact on a quality of life of New Yorkers,'' Pataki said. ``We are
taking a very important step to show we care about the mentally
ill. We do believe in appropriate cases they can live in the
community. But in appropriate cases, they have to be compelled to
take their medicine or live under supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature came under intense pressure to enact the measure
this year, following two highly publicized cases in New York City
in which people were shoved in front of subway trains by former
mental patients. One victim, Kendra Webdale, died, and the other,
Edgar Rivera, had his legs severed.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said they wanted to prevent any more acts of violence
from being committed by mentally ill people who are not receiving
appropriate care. But critics note that if this new measure had
been law, it would not have saved Ms. Webdale. Rather than
resisting commitment, the defendant in the fatal shoving incident,
Andrew Goldstein, had tried repeatedly to get help before the
attack. He sought his own commitment, the critics note, but he was
turned away by what they describe as the state's inadequately
funded mental health system.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of involuntarily committing the mentally ill has come
under repeated attacks from civil liberties groups and some
advocates for the mentally ill, who say that it is misguided. The
critics argue that the public would be far better served if the
state spent more money to provide supervised housing and other
community-based services for the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was announced Tuesday morning during an emotional
ceremony that was attended by Democratic and Republican lawmakers
as well as Rivera and relatives of Kendra Webdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just glad that good has come from this,'' said Rivera,
who along with the Webdales has lobbied lawmakers to adopt the
measure, known as ``Kendra's Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Webdale's mother, Patricia, expressed similar relief and
gratitude. ``I thank Kendra,'' she said tearfully from a podium.
``I thank her for being the kind of person who would inspire our
family to stick together and go on to do something for other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal reached Tuesday came after Pataki and Democratic
legislators cleared the obstacles that had held up a final
agreement for months. A key one was whether the state should be
required to pay for counseling and other treatment that patients
need to undergo to avoid being involuntarily hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats wanted the state to pick up the costs. But Pataki
opposed that approach, saying the point of the proposed law was not
to provide additional services to mental patients but to get them
to comply with treatment that has already been prescribed. In the
end, the two sides reached a compromise that requires both the
state and local governments to pay for any additional costs. The
law is estimated to cost the state about $30 million per year, and
local government about half that much.
