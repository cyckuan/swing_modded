<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The president's lawyer, David Kendall, finally got
his chance to confront Kenneth Starr Thursday night, and he used
his entire hour not to defend the president's actions or his
veracity but to attack Starr and the conduct of his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall struck within his first minute of cross-examination,
criticizing Starr with engaging in ``overkill'' in his four-year
inquiry and for hiring ``an undisclosed number of private
investigators'' to gather evidence of presidential misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyer then spent the next 60 minutes in a
relentless assault on Starr's honesty, his prosecutorial tactics
and his ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two protagonists in Thursday's confrontation had
met several times before this year in closed hearings, this was the
first extended public exchange between the legal minds behind the
extraordinary political and constitutional drama that has
captivated Washington all year. And following the White House's
consistent strategy, Kendall immediately sought to make Starr _ not
the president _ the subject of debate.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall's aggressive and belligerent questioning shook the
generally calm demeanor of Starr, who had remained unruffled
throughout most of a very long day of interrogation by the House
Judiciary Committee. Starr grew tight-lipped and tense at times
under Kendall's ceaseless baiting, but he never completely lost his
practiced courtroom calm.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall devoted a large share of his time to accusations that
Starr and his deputies leaked grand jury material to the news
media. At the end of one long exchange, Kendall said, ``There has
been no case remotely similar to this in terms of the massive
leaking from the prosecutor's office, and I think we know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr stiffened and replied: ``I totally disagree with that.
That's an accusation and it's an unfair accusation. I completely
reject it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Starr drew blood as he began to suggest
that the White House, through a joint defense agreement with many
sympathetic witnesses, had access to much of the same grand jury
material that prosecutors had. He seemed about to say that the
president's lawyers and defenders might be responsible for some of
details in news articles about the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, unwilling to allow that charge to be heard by the
committee members, interrupted Starr and abruptly changed the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Starr repeatedly tried to inject at least the appearance of
civility into his grilling by calling his interrogator ``David.''
But Kendall would not be deterred from his long-sought chance to
dust up the president's nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall called Starr ``Ken'' once, early in their encounter. But
his contempt for the independent counsel and his entire enterprise
was evident in even that exchange and remained so throughout the
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall did not offer a single point in explanation or defense
of the main charges in Starr's impeachment report to Congress. He
did not answer the multiple accusations of perjury, obstruction of
justice or witness tampering that appear in Starr's 445-page
report. He did not try to explain Clinton's sworn denials of sexual
activity with Monica Lewinsky, nor did he try to defend the
president's involvement in helping Ms. Lewinsky find a job when she
was likely to be called as a witness in the Paula Corbin Jones
sexual misconduct lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Kendall mercilessly attacked Starr and the way he has run
his investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Starr had participated in virtually none of the
questioning of the scores of witnesses in the case. He demanded to
know when Starr had concluded that Clinton had not violated any law
in the firing of the White House travel office and the use of FBI
files. He assailed the treatment of witnesses in the case. He spent
nearly 20 minutes of his allotted hour accusing Starr of leaking
secret grand jury material to the media.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught clearly got under Starr's skin. The prosecutor was
obviously tired by his long day at the witness table and on several
occasions grew emphatic in his responses to Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   Starr at one point protested Kendall's insistence on making
Starr, not the president, the subject of the hearing. ``I thought
that what we were here today to discuss is a referral which we
believe contains substantial and credible information of potential
impeachable offenses by the president of the United States,'' Starr
said. He said that Kendall's inquiries had strayed far from the
``sober and serious purposes that I thought brought us here
together.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel grew testy when Kendall pressed him on
charges from one witness, Julie Hiatt Steele, who claimed to have
been aggressively questioned by agents from Starr's office about
her personal financial records and the adoption records of her
8-year-old son from Romania.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an enormous amount of misinformation and false
information that is being bandied about with respect to that
particular witness and the circumstances of questioning,'' Starr
said. He said defensively that some of her claims are ``utterly
without merit and utterly without foundation, utterly without
factual foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point Starr called Kendall's assertion that
prosecutors had tried to force Ms. Lewinsky to secretly record
conversations with the president a ``calumny.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking nearly an hour of constant pounding from Kendall,
Starr scored at least one solid blow. Kendall demanded to know
whether the independent counsel had hired private investigators to
look into Clinton's sex life in Arkansas before he became
president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr shot back, ``No, we have never hired Terry Lenzner,
David.'' He was referring to a well-known private investigator
hired by the president's lawyers to make inquiries about potential
witnesses in the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was delighted by Kendall's muscular
interrogation of Starr. Officials said that Starr appeared nervous,
evasive and defensive under the first hostile grilling he has
received this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the only opportunity we were going to get,'' one
senior White House official said Thursday night. ``Obviously issues
of the conduct of this investigation were relevant to it. He is
asking Congress to remove the president from office, so questions
of conflict, bias and illegal activity of his own are relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' encounter provoked laughter from the exhausted
audience and committee members on a couple of occasions. Kendall
began a question about the questioning of Ms. Lewinsky in January
by saying that she had been ``held'' at the Ritz-Carlton in
suburban Virginia by agents of the Office of Independent Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Starr interrupted and strenuously objected: ``That is false and
you know it to be false.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said he would rephrase the question. He began, ``During
her sojourn with your agents. . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Starr interrupted once again, ``Well, the Ritz-Carlton is a very
pleasant place to have a sojourn.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience, seemingly grateful for a break from the tension,
laughed.

TKACHUK REL ISHING LEAD ROLE  
 CAPTAIN'S FAST START MIRRORS COYOTES' OPENING RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - After nearly 20 years of mediocrity, including two
seasons in the Valley, the Coyotes are on the threshold of possibly
something spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Cup contenders? It's too early to tell. But you can't
argue with the results _ a 9-2-2 record, a nine-game unbeaten
streak, a first-place tie with the highly regarded Dallas Stars in
the Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to do this,'' Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk said.
``We're in a situation where this organization had to get off to a
good start, and we needed everyone doing their best.''
</P>
<P>
   A good start was just as critical for Tkachuk. Especially after
the commotion he caused with his contract dispute and holdout. He
became Public Enemy No. 1 and was portrayed by media and fans alike
as the poster child for greediness.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to take away his ``C.'' Even trade him. Or worse,
let him sit and not get a nickel. When he finally rejoined the team
after agreeing to a restructured deal worth $17 million over three
years, he was booed loudly in just about every game at America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   But look at him now.
</P>
<P>
   The boos have turned to cheers and the powerful left wing is
roaring with a nine-game point-scoring streak _ the longest in the
NHL. He's on pace for a 57-goal season with nine goals (and 15
points) through 13 games. He's also leading the league in
plus/minus ratings with a plus-15 and is tied for first with three
winning goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything that happened during the summer, yeah, I guess
it was important for me to get off to a quick start,'' Tkachuk
said. ``A lot of the focus was on me and a lot of eyes were on me.
To get paid the kind of money I'm getting paid, you've got to do
well. You get paid to score goals, but you've got to do other
things, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He's scoring. He's playing defense. He's hitting people. He's
camping out in front of the net, taking abuse. He's staying out of
the penalty box. And he's becoming a better leader, according to
just about everyone in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of pressure on him this year and it started in
his first game when he got booed every time he touched the puck,''
Coyotes assistant coach John Tortorella said. ``He knew the best
way to get that problem solved was to play the best he possibly
could for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times during his career, even last year, he played for
himself. I shouldn't say for himself. But not within the team
concept, let's put it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, 26, has gone the extra mile to help repair his public
image, in the locker room and on the street. He's been graciously
accommodating to the media. He donated $166,000 _ his fine for
holding out _ to charity. He also opened his doors to Daniel
Briere, inviting the rookie center to stay with him while
recovering from a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I have to prove, though, is winning,'' Tkachuk
said. ``That's the bottom line. You're measured on winning, your
team success. Not individual stats. I've scored 50 goals before. I
don't have to prove that.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1993-94 season, no one has scored more goals in the
NHL than Tkachuk. He has 216. Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr and
Washington's Peter Bondra are next with 213 each. But Tkachuk isn't
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nice, but the only way you get known is by winning,''
he said. ``If I'm wherever I am in that category, people probably
don't know because they only know you if you're a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   He's on his way, according to center Bob Corkum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith will always get his goals and always get his points, but
he's definitely come full circle as far as his leadership
qualities,'' Corkum said. ``He's the first guy here in the morning.
He's riding the bike. He's lifting weights. It's contagious. He's
even got ``me'' riding the bike now. And I don't like bikes unless
it has a motor on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk has been the motor for the during the record start. But
he has to keep the engine clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still a young guy and you've got to remember he's still
maturing,'' Tortorella said. ``It's got to get better and better as
the year goes on. When we start losing, that's going to be the true
test for Keith Tkachuk as the leader of this team. When we get into
a one- or two-game slide. It's pretty easy to be a leader when
you're winning.'' &QL;

STOTTLEMYRE ON WAY  
 PITCHER TO GET $32 MILLION FROM D-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO Gomez  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Diamondbacks jumped headfirst into the pool of
1999 free agents, snagging a front-line starting pitcher in Todd
Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, a hard-throwing right-hander, has agreed to a
four-year contract that will pay him $32 million to become a key
component of what is turning into an intriguing rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Managing general partner Jerry Colangelo, who was in New York
for another round of NBA labor talks, confirmed the signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've agreed to agree,'' Colangelo told the Associated Press.
``We have the formality of getting the contract completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre could not be reached at his Florida home.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who visited the Valley and Bank One Ballpark on
Tuesday, is expected to formally be introduced as a Diamondback
early next week, possibly Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre's signing will send a clear signal to Randy Johnson,
the other marquee free agent the club is attempting to entice into
a Diamondbacks uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The belief within the organization's hierarchy is that Johnson
wanted to see a serious commitment to winning sooner rather than
later before deciding where he would play. The Diamondbacks also
have been involved in negotiations with outfielder Bernie Williams.
Colangelo said those talks will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing precludes anything,'' he said. ``We're still looking
at all our options.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre's signing may very well be the indication Johnson
was waiting for. At the very least, it seems Johnson's decision,
expected to be announced before Thanksgiving, has been whittled
down to the Diamondbacks and Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always comes down to pitching,'' Dodgers General Manager
Kevin Malone said. ``Starting pitching and the bullpen are what's
most important. They've (the Diamondbacks) really improved
themselves. You can't take them for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who was a combined 14-13 with a 3.74 ERA for St.
Louis and Texas last season, was considered the next best available
free-agent starter after Kevin Brown and Johnson. His contract is
almost identical to the one Al Leiter signed with the New York Mets
several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   A cursory look at his career statistics may reveal a slightly
better than .500 pitcher (he's 123-110 in 332 career games, 300 of
them starts), but look beneath the numbers and Stottlemyre, 33,
brings a passion that is nearly unrivaled among starting pitchers
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great competitor,'' said Dave Duncan, who has been
Stottlemyre's pitching coach for most of the past four seasons.
``It was the reason we were interested in him coming back to St.
Louis. Every time he starts, you have a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the strike-shortened 1994 season,
Stottlemyre has won in double figures every season since 1990. He
has been an opening-day pitcher three times, including twice for
St. Louis in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre joins former teammate Andy Benes, Brian Anderson and
Omar Daal to formulate four-fifths of what will be considered one
of the better rotations in the National League next season. Adding
Johnson could be enough to make the Diamondbacks contenders for
what figures to be a slightly down year within the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look past the immediate, in the future things will be
really good here,'' said Benes, who led the last-place club with 14
victories. ``When we were together in '96, it wasn't a battle to
see who was going to have the better record. We competed. I think
it's what makes Atlanta so good. It doesn't matter if those guys
are playing golf, basketball or pitching. You don't want to be the
one to let the rest of them down. Todd brings a lot to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Colangelo: ``We think we have the equivalent of another
Andy Benes. You add Stottlemyre to (the rotation), that strengthens
us considerably.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, the son of former Yankees great and current
pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre, has reached at least 200 innings
pitched six times, including four of the past five seasons. He has
been placed on the disabled list only twice in his career, the last
being in 1993.

LUYENDYK PLANS TO RETIRE IN '99 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - For Mario Andretti, it was the ``Arrivederci, Mario''
farewell tour. Bobby Rahal had ``Rahal's Last Ride.''
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Foyt? He arrived at Indianapolis Motor Speedway one year
and said, ``That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arie Luyendyk likes Foyt's idea.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 seasons, two Indianapolis 500 wins, seven career wins
and an undetermined number of memories, Luyendyk has decided to
retire after next year's Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   How do you say, ``So long, folks,'' in Dutch?
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk, 45, a native of the Netherlands but a Scottsdale
resident the past nine years, will make the announcement public
today.
</P>
<P>
   Family considerations were at the root of the decision, but
Luyendyk admitted several weeks ago that three harrowing crashes
over the past two seasons also played a significant role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe someone is trying to send me a message,'' Luyendyk said.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk also expressed frustration and dissatisfaction with the
past Indy Racing League season in which he finished a disappointing
eighth in the drivers standings. Although he won the final race of
the season at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, it wasn't enough to sway
his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I (just) want to spend more time with my family,'' Luyendyk
said. ``There's no doubt they have made a lot of sacrifices because
of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk and his wife, Mieke, have four children. Arie Jr., who
at 17 is the oldest, is a Formula Ford 1600 racer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty good,'' the elder Luyendyk said recently.
</P>
<P>
   If the younger Luyendyk is anything like his father, he could
become very good.
</P>
<P>
   Of Luyendyk's seven Indy-car victories, two were in the fabled
Indianapolis 500 (1990 and 1997) and two were at Phoenix
International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   When Luyendyk won the 1990 Indy 500, he became the third driver
since 1952 to make Indy his first career win.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes me feel so good about winning at Indy is a lot of
drivers who have won this race have been my heroes,'' Luyendyk said
after the victory. ``Guys like Jimmy Clark, Graham Hill, Emerson
Fittipaldi and Mario Andretti.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk began pondering retirement earlier this season but
apparently didn't reach a final decision until last week, before
departing to Holland on a short vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Wile the decision wasn't completely unexpected, what does come
as a surprise is Luyendyk's preference to compete in only one
Indy-car race next year. But what a race it is.
</P>
<P>
   Although the split involving the Indy Racing League and the
rival Championship Auto Racing Teams has left a sour taste in the
mouths of many open-wheel fans, the Indy 500 remains a gigantic
event in many eyes, despite the absence of CART drivers such as Al
Unser Jr. and Michael Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are committed to a team as a driver for an entire
season, you are committed every day of the year,'' said Luyendyk,
who hasn't ruled out competing in selected major endurance
sports-car events (for example, 24 Hours of Daytona) after the Indy
500. ``The work doesn't start with practice on Friday and end with
the race on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the travel, the testing and the appearances. Even
when I'm at home, I'm working out, busy on the phone and thinking
about the business of racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is right for me to stop. I want to help my son with
his racing. I've been thinking about this for quite some time. I
know there has been some speculation about my plans, and rather
than have people guess, I wanted to be honest with everyone,
especially the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Luyendyk is commited to only one race in 1999, car owner
Fred Treadway of Indianapolis likely will be selecting another
full-time driver. The leading candidate appears to be U.S. Auto
Club Silver Crown champion Jason Leffler, who also is leading the
USAC National Midget Series, which races Saturday night at
Manzanita Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started my team in 1996, Arie was the natural choice
for his reputation, skill and experience,'' Treadway said. ``Arie
and I knew the day would come when he would step out of the car,
and regrettably, that day is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk will remain a team consultant and spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, I'm able to retire on my own terms, and I don't
think there could be any better place to do it than at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway,'' Luyendyk said.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk still holds several Indy 500 records, including the
one-lap qualifying mark (237.498 mph) and average winning speed
(185.981 mph). &QL;

L.A.'S SLIM IMAGE TAKES A POUNDING IN FAT STUDY
</HEADLINE>

(Will move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite its chic, sleek image, Los Angeles is
fatter than you might think.
</P>
<P>
   That's right: 47 percent of Los Angeles County adults are
overweight, and 14 percent are severely overweight, according to an
unprecedented county health poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In between bites of a burger, 45-year-old Don Como, a former
vegetarian, said the findings are alarming, but predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not surprising when you think of all the fast food
that's around that you can't help eating,'' said the resident of
Woodland Hills, an L.A.-area suburb.
</P>
<P>
   But while nearly half of Angelenos are carrying extra pounds and
are at increased risk for health problems, we're not as heavy as
Americans nationwide, 54 percent of whom are overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is we're a little better than the nation as a
whole,'' said Jonathan E. Fielding, Los Angeles County director of
public health.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the most important news is that one out of two
California adults is overweight or extremely overweight. And that
is costing everybody in terms of health and in terms of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Overweight people have a heightened risk for such ailments as
diabetes, heart disease and cancer, Fielding said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was based on telephone interviews with 8,000
households last year, during which researchers calculated whether
adults are overweight by using the body mass index. The index
measures the ratio of weight to height. Using that formula, the
National Institutes of Health recently revised its definition of
obesity downward, putting more Americans in the overweight
category.
</P>
<P>
   Using the new standards, the county survey found that 55 percent
of men and 39 percent of women in L.A. are overweight.
African-Americans have the highest rate of obesity at 58 percent
and Asian-Americans have the lowest, 25 percent. Latinos, 54
percent, and whites, 44 percent, fall in between.
</P>
<P>
   African-American and Latino cultures attach less stigma to extra
weight than does white culture, and men have long been immune from
the thinness pressure applied to women, said Morton Maxwell,
director of the UCLA University Obesity Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us men love our big bellies sticking out, because no
one tells us we don't look good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Forte and Mark Smith, watching their children at soccer
practice at Warner Park in Woodland Hills, said the overweight rate
wasn't surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised that it's that low,'' said Forte, 37, of Canoga
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Then he looked at an index chart and gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow! I'm overweight!'' cried the 5-foot-10-inch, 188-pound,
apparently fit soccer dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make everybody overweight,'' protested Smith, 30, of
Woodland Hills. To fall within acceptable bounds, said the
5-foot-9, 189-pound Smith, ``You'd have to be a string bean.''
</P>
<P>
   Their surprise echoed the complaints of Sally Smith, spokeswoman
for the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance in
Sacramento, who said the survey results are likely to prompt
ineffective ``yo-yo'' dieting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unrealistic of them to believe that by proclaiming people
overweight, people will automatically become thin,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity and nutrition specialists acknowledge that the body mass
index doesn't infallibly measure muscle mass or body fat levels _
the real gauges of health.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, they emphasized that it provides a good indication
of obesity across a population.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Maxwell said, major health studies suggest the
ideal weight should be below that dictated by the new standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was based on scientific evidence,'' he said, ``it would
be set lower.'' &QL;

MARANA GOES AFTER DODGERS  
 SPRING TRAINING PROPOSAL ON TAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEXA HAUSSLER  
 AND DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Officials from Marana will make their pitch today to
persuade the Los Angeles Dodgers to bring their spring training
operations to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Tucson suburb is one of several Arizona communities trying
to lure the team from its spring training home in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wymbs, special projects director for the Dodgers, is
scheduled to travel to Marana today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have developed a proposal. I don't know the specifics
right now, but we're going to look at the sites and evaluate
everything against the other proposals,'' Wymbs said.
</P>
<P>
   The city proposes building a state-of-the-art training facility
for the team, said Dick Gear, Marana's community and economic
development administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The city would not build a stadium, however. Instead, the team
would practice in Marana and share Tucson Electric Park with the
Diamondbacks and Chicago White Sox and Hi Corbett Field with the
Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The Marana facility would include practice fields, offices,
weight rooms and a hotel where the team could live during spring
training, Gear said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say how much the facility would cost.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have talked about possibly moving their training
camp from Vero Beach, Fla., and the Grapefruit League to the more
geographically convenient Cactus League. They are considering the
move even though there have been $1 million in renovations to the
Florida facility over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 9, the Fort McDowell Mohave-Apache Indian Community east
of Phoenix offered to build the Dodgers a $20 million facility near
the Beeline Highway.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's proposal promises to have a 12,000-seat stadium and
five or six practice fields _ covering an area of about 60 acres _
ready for spring training in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vero Beach has offered to buy the Dodgers' complex
and lease it back to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fort McDowell and Vero Beach have the most complete proposals
right now,'' Wymbs said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the situation is a matter of ``the tradition of Florida
and the proximity of Arizona. There are positives on both sides.
We're going to look objectively at all proposals. That has been our
commitment all along.''
</P>
<P>
   The team will make a decision within the next three months. &QL;

BACKUP TACKLE'S SEASON COMES TO CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Offensive tackle  &UR; Anthony Clement's rookie season
is over.
</P>
<P>
   He was placed on injured reserve Thursday, making him ineligible
to play the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   That move was made to find a place on the roster for offensive
tackle
 &UR; Jon Clark, who has been on the practice squad most of the season.
They needed to activate another offensive lineman because of the
broken right hand suffered by  &UR; Matt Joyce in last Sunday's loss to
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 6-foot-6, 345 pounds, will be the No. 3 tackle Sunday at
Washington and back up starters  &UR; Lomas Brown and  &UR; James Dexter.
</P>
<P>
   Clement, a second-round pick from Southwestern Louisiana, played
in only one game, Sept. 13 at Seattle. He underwent back surgery
four days later because of a herniated disc in his back.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals hoped to get Clement back later this month, but
his back was sore when he tried to run last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will spill over to next season,'' Coach
 &UR; Vince
 &UR; Tobin said of the injury. ``It has to be in the back of our minds,
but a lot of players who have back surgery come back to (resume)
their careers. There's nothing telling us this is career-ending or
career-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw nothing when he was healthy to preclude me from thinking
he can be an excellent football player in this league for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clement showed so much promise in training camp, he was expected
to compete for a starting job by midseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost a lot not being able to play this year,'' Tobin said.
``He needs the competition. He needs the practice. The only thing
he has gotten out of it is a year's experience being around the
football team and in meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Clement was the backup right tackle at the time of his injury.
He prefers to play left tackle, however, and was drafted as the
heir apparent to Lomas Brown at left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think I'm going to come back and start next year,''
Clement said of his return. &QL; 
Close call
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback  &UR; J.B. Brown appears recovered from a hamstring injury
that forced him to miss the Dallas game and could regain his
starting position ahead of  &UR; Tom Knight, who still has some soreness
in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If J.B. is well and Tommy is not, I'll start J.B.,'' Tobin
said. ``If they are both healthy, I'll probably start Tommy.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown will be the team's nickel back if he doesn't start. &QL; 
Short shots
</P>
<P>
   Center  &UR; Aaron Graham, who missed Wednesday's workout to have his
sore knee checked, returned to practice and is expected to start
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six quarters, the Cardinals have gained 746 yards
and scored 50 points. &QL;

STARR DEFENDS HIMSELF AND HIS WORK BEFORE THE NATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Across a long day and well into the night, Kenneth
Starr fought off Democratic assaults on the conduct of his office
Thursday and repeatedly sought to return attention to what he
described as President Clinton's pattern of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   In a 12-hour day that opened the House impeachment hearings, the
independent counsel testified in a mostly dispassionate monotone
about his four-year investigation that began with Whitewater and
ended with the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats challenged Starr's tactics and his judgment, and
the motives and fairness of the Republicans who control the
committee. But for all that, they seldom actually defended Clinton
directly. Republicans, for their part, praised Starr often and
extravagantly.
</P>
<P>
   Only when he was cross-examined by Clinton's lawyer, David
Kendall, did Starr show signs of irritation or anger. He heatedly
rebuffed Kendall's accusations that Starr's office had leaked grand
jury information about Clinton. Several times during those
exchanges, Starr interjected: ``That's unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 p.m. on Thursday night, the last questioner, David
Schippers, the Republicans' chief investigative counsel, tried to
apply balm to any wounds. ``You have been pilloried and
excoriated,'' he told Starr. He drew snorts and laughter from the
Democrats when he praised the independent counsel's treatment of
Monica Lewinsky. ``I hear laughter from the left,'' Schippers said,
referring to committee Democrats. ``But I often hear laughter from
the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr left the hearing room in the Rayburn Building at 10:20
p.m., and the committee began fighting over new subpoenas for other
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's appearance marked the beginning of the public phase of
the nation's third impeachment inquiry into a president, one for
which the public has shown little support in polls. Across the next
two weeks, the Republicans plan to take closed-door depositions
from four other figures, including Robert Bennett, one of Clinton's
lawyers, and Bruce Lindsey, the deputy White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is working on a tight schedule. Saying he is
mindful of public exhaustion with the Lewinsky case, Rep. Henry
Hyde, the committee chairman, has repeatedly vowed that he will end
the inquiry by the end of the year. And the incoming House speaker,
Bob Livingston, has also indicated that he would like impeachment
proceedings to be concluded before the new Congress takes office in
January.
</P>
<P>
   If the committee votes to recommend articles of impeachment
against Clinton, the matter then goes to the full House for an
impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   From the very first moments that the committee went into
session, the party divide was evident. The Republican-controlled
committee rejected an effort by Democrats to give the president's
lawyers two hours to question Starr, who had been granted two hours
to deliver his opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting strategies of the two parties _ reflected time
and again during the day _ were underscored almost immediately.
``Do we still have a government of laws and not of men?'' asked
Hyde as he opened the hearing. ``Does the law apply to some people
with force and ferocity while the powerful are immune? Do we have
one set of laws for the officer and another for the enlisted?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., the ranking Democrat, sought to put Starr
on trial, accusing him of crossing the ``line into obsession'' in
his investigation of Clinton. ``The idea of a federally paid sex
policeman spending millions of dollars to trap an unfaithful
spouse, or to police civil litigation, would have been unthinkable
prior to the Starr investigation,'' the Michigan Democrat said.
``Let there be no mistake; it is now acceptable in America to
investigate a person's private sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Starr had not shed any new light on his
investigation after the morning session. ``He offered no new
evidence, no new information, and no new explanations for his
tactics,'' said Gregory Craig, a White House special counsel who
sat at a separate table in the hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his wife were out of the country as the Judiciary
Committee held the first impeachment hearing against a president
since the Watergate inquiry of Richard M. Nixon 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hoped that Starr would refocus the public on the
charges against Clinton and forcefully make the case for
impeachment, and Schippers helped Starr recap those points at the
hearing's end. But for much of the day, Democrats turned the
session into a trial of the prosecutor, not of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr described himself as a fervent believer in the law and
said his legal team only wanted to ``do our duties as honorable
prosecutors.'' He spoke for hours in a patient voice that had
rarely been heard in public, replying at length to questions
ranging from details of the Lewinsky matter to how the
investigation had changed his personal life. He said he would
``stand behind each word'' of his report to the House charging
Clinton with 11 possibly impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a man of politics,'' Starr told the 37 members of the
House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he described himself as a man with ``unyielding faith
in our court system _ our system of judicial review, the
independence of our judges, our jury system, the integrity of the
oath and the sanctity, yes, the sanctity of the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr sought to dispel the argument that his case against
Clinton concerned the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
and not whether he lied under oath in the sexual harassment case
brought by Paula Corbin Jones and then before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual harassment cases are often he said-she said disputes,''
Starr said. ``Evidence reflecting the behavior of both parties can
be critical _ including the defendant's relationships with other
employees in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Such questions can be uncomfortable, but they occur every day
in courts and law offices across the country. Individuals in these
cases take an oath to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth. And no one is entitled to lie under oath simply
because he or she does not like the questions or because he
believes the case is frivolous or that it is financially motivated
or that it is politically motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also noted that it was not his office, but the House, that
decided to make public his report with all its lurid details.
</P>
<P>
   Once Starr faced his questioners, the tone changed and the
subjects shifted so that he was soon defending the conduct of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, the Democrats' senior investigative counsel,
questioned Starr about his ties to lawyers associated with Mrs.
Jones and about his office's early contacts with both Ms. Lewinsky
and with Linda Tripp, the woman who set off the investigation by
bringing prosecutors tape-recordings of her conversations with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell contrasted Starr's detailed report with that of the
Watergate prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, who had presented Congress
with facts but no conclusions. Starr replied that he was the first
to submit a presidential impeachment report under the independent
counsel statute, and he believed the statute required him to make
judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tool,'' he said of his report. ``This is only a tool
for you to use as you see fit. But I don't think it's fair to
criticize my office for not following a pattern that was not
governed by a statute.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most spirited exchanges with Lowell came over the
efforts by Starr's deputies the January day when they first
confronted Ms. Lewinsky to keep her from contacting a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Using Starr's own words for describing the president's evasions,
Lowell asked whether Starr had presented a ``distorted picture of
the facts'' in a press release from his office saying Ms. Lewinsky
consented to a meeting with FBI agents last January.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, Lowell said the statement did
not note that the young woman was scared and crying and that when
she asked to see her lawyer she was told, ``she would not be able
to help herself with her attorney there.'' She was, he said,
``threatened with going to jail for, quote, 27 years.'' And when
she asked to call her mother, Jackie Bennett, a Starr deputy said,
``You're 24. You're smart. You're old enough. You don't need to
call your mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't in your statement to the press that day, was it?''
asked Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing laughter, Starr said ``No, it wasn't, Mr. Lowell, and
let me explain what press statements are designed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point he said, ``Surely you don't think that a
witness is going to say, `Thank you, law enforcement, for finding
out that I'm in the middle of committing a felony.'''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said his attorneys were leery of having Ms. Lewinsky reach
out to her lawyer, Francis Carter, because they thought he had
assisted her in drafting a false affidavit. Starr's investigators
offered to help her seek a Legal Aid attorney, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, under withering questioning from
Democrats, Starr seemed more defensive about allegations that his
investigators had threatened one witness, Julie Hiatt Steele _ who
has contested Kathleen Willey's account of a sexual advance from
the president _ and said they would examine the legality of her
daughter's adoption.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he said he would answer a written question. At
another point he said that if Ms. Steele had a complaint it could
be resolved in court.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also called it a ``misjudgment'' that one of his
investigators in Arkansas had gone to a high school to subpoena the
16-year-old son of a Whitewater defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the long day, Republicans rose to the defense of
Starr. ``What we are seeing here is a desperate attempt to get away
from the facts of the case against the president,'' said Rep.
Charles Canaday, R-Fla. ``Now I understand that because I find that
the facts are particularly compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Several voiced their sympathy for Starr. ``I commend you for
standing up to the nonsense,'' said Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats showed no such sympathy. Rep. Barney Frank of
Massachusetts asked the independent counsel why he had not told the
public before the November election that he had found no evidence
of impeachable offenses in his other inquiries, which ranged from
the dismissal of White House Travel Office employees to the
Whitewater real estate deal in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said his legal mandate was only to report on evidence of
potentially impeachable offenses. ``In other words, you don't have
anything to say unless you have something bad to say,'' Frank
retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Inglis, R-S.C., gave Starr the opportunity to
emphasize that he considered perjury an impeachable offense, no
matter what the underlying matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what the underlying subject matter is,''
said Starr. ``Once you're in court, under oath, you tell the truth.
That's the way judges look at the world, and perhaps that's why no
judge being subjected to impeachment for perjury, has dared suggest
'Don't worry about it. It's not an impeachable offense.' It is.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also said that Clinton could be prosecuted for perjury
once he left office.
</P>
<P>
   Very few members of the committee asked Starr about any of the
actual facts of his case or dwelt on the contradictory witness
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., questioned Starr's charges of
obstruction of Justice. He noted that the White House had been
trying to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job for more than a year _ not
just after she was called to appear in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr said his office had concluded that there had been a
``stepping up of the efforts to get her a job, especially once the
witness list was issued.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once did Starr seem weary of his role, when Rep. Mary Bono,
R-Calif., asked him sympathetically about the toll his job was
taking. ``I would love to be back in private life,'' he said.

SCHOTTENHEIMER SHOULD BE SACKED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ That sound you heard Monday night was the door
slamming on the most overrated coach in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marty Schottenheimer, who has long tortured fantasy owners with
his schizophrenic game plans and senseless substitutions, should be
on his way out after the Chiefs' meltdown on national television
against the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   After that performance, Schottenheimer's shelf life will be
shorter than  &UR; Monica Lewinsky's ``tell all'' book. (What possibly
could be left to tell? That they had anchovies on the pizza?)
</P>
<P>
   On top of everything else, he shows up at the press conference
sobbing. Crying? There's no crying in football.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Schottenheimer has won plenty of regular-season
games but always found a way to lose in the playoffs. That's
because his players aren't in the game long enough to get their
uniforms dirty.
</P>
<P>
   His running-back rotation is something out of junior high
school, where every kid gets to play. He's ruined just about every
running back he's touched. This may explain his acquisition of  &UR; Bam
Morris, who is pre-disastered.
</P>
<P>
   Schottenheimer apparently played in the days when they taught
you to use your head _ as a battering ram. His game plans are like
 &UR; Shakespeare's plays.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody gets killed in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of ``Monday Night Football,'' is anybody else tired of
announcer
 &UR; Al Michaels whining about fan polls that call for a quarterback
switch? For two weeks, Michaels has railed against what he calls
``goofy'' polls _ after one such survey targeted his sacred 49ers
and
 &UR; Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels is laboring under the delusion that football is some
sort of separate nation-state that exists outside the realm of the
fans and the media. That we should simply be happy to watch every
Sunday and keep our big yaps shut.
</P>
<P>
   Last time I checked, if not for the ``goofy'' fans, there would
be no football. The NBA has disappeared, and I was careful to note
that the sun still rises in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the fans have a right to call for a quarterback switch,
even if it's plenty dumb. Some guys in my section at the Cardinals
game Sunday actually started chanting for  &UR; Dave Brown in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   I think they were kidding. Dave Brown is to quarterbacks what
Spam is to fine dining.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad to see Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin is still chairman
of the standing ``Let's miss the playoffs'' committee. How else
could you explain his opposition to the no-huddle offense, which
only produced the most passing yards ``ever'' by an NFL player in
Sun Devil Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   The no-huddle definitely would increase  &UR; Jake Plummer's fantasy
value. He seems comfortable in that setup, and the defensive
linemen get all tuckered out chasing him around.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what do I know? All I see are the touchdowns, the
hundreds of passing yards, the team marching up and down the field
like the University of Arizona band.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure there's a downside. Like, if the Cardinals score too
many points, Tobin might run out of room on that clipboard he keeps
hugging.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Plummer's one-game revival could also increase the
fantasy value of  &UR; Frank Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Tobin goes to the flying wedge. &QL; 
Tip of the week &QL; 
I like Giants running back  &UR; Gary Brown to have a nice game against
the Eagles. After their thrashing by the Redskins on Sunday,  &UR; Ray
Rhodes is a lame duck, and the Eagles are being sold to the
Colonel. &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL; 
 &UR; Kerry ``Tom'' Collins emerged from jail to lead the Saints over the
Rams, so he might be a nice pickup. Redskins wide receiver  &UR; Albert
 &UR; Connell seems ready to break out. Now that the Oilers are on a
roll, take a look at wide receiver  &UR; Willie Davis. &QL; 
One-hit wonder &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week, it's  &UR; ``Touchdown'' Tommy Vardell of the Detroit
Lions. Vardell is a nice player inside the 5-yard line, but Sunday
night's three touchdowns were a fluke. &QL;

THERE'S NO SAFETY FROM SELF-CRITICISM  
 ROOKIE TILLMAN AIMS TO IMPROVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Ask Pat Tillman to critique himself, and he might
beg off, thinking he couldn't do the job well enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals rookie safety is a tough grader when it comes to
self-assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hard on himself,'' Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave
McGinnis said. ``But most good players are hard on themselves. It's
the guys who view themselves through tinted shades who aren't
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Pat is very much a realist. He knows what he has to work
on, and he knows it's a constant job of working. He'll probably
never be satisfied, which is what you want in a good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Examine Tillman's statistics and they aren't half bad,
especially considering he's making the transition from linebacker
at Arizona State to NFL safety. He ranks third on the club in
tackles with 83 and has one sack.
</P>
<P>
   Turnovers, anyone? Well, Tillman would certainly like a few. He
has no interceptions, forced fumbles or fumble recoveries, the very
areas that were his strengths in college. Some also grumble that he
hasn't been as strong against the pass as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman, in fact, is among the grumblers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sum up my season so far?'' Tillman answered rhetorically,
``Needs improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   That's brutally honest. So, improvement in what areas?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lot of work to do, just in general. I just need to get
better, and not in any one particular area,'' he said. ``I have to
keep working and learning. As far as recognizing coverages, I make
an error here and there, and I can't afford to make any mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be pointed out, however, that Coach Vince Tobin isn't
among the grumblers. Tobin said the rookie is undergoing a tough
maturation process.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at free safety, and it's not unlike Jake Plummer at
quarterback,'' Tobin said. ``Both are pivotal positions on a
football team and focal points of what teams try to attack. They
attack offensively down the middle because it's the shortest way to
the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've seen a steady improvement. He certainly hasn't lacked
for aggression. He's one of our leaders in tackles, and he's been
in on a lot of plays. He's going to be a very good free safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Going to be? Tillman, like the fans who followed his college
career, expected to be one by now, perhaps overlooking a major fact
_ nothing comes easy to an NFL rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a linebacker and made him a free safety, and he had to
learn it in a training camp and four preseason games,'' Tobin said.
``There's a lot that goes on back there in the secondary. Every
team we play game plans and does thing differently than what you
see on film.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't intercepted as many passes as he'd like, but
interceptions are highly overrated sometimes in the secondary, as
long as you're in good position.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin added that there are a few areas Tillman hasn't played as
well as the coaching staff would like, but he's making strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things sometimes like recognition, getting deep enough in
halves coverage, or seeing the whole field as a free safety,''
Tobin said. ``The younger you are, sometimes you get tunnel vision
and look at one thing or just the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they gain experience, not only can they see the
quarterback, but also the wide-outs on both sides. They don't have
to worry so much about what to do as just doing it well. Pat
probably is still in the area of wondering what to do and not doing
it wrong. Once you get past that plateau, you know what you're
doing is right, and you can concentrate on just making plays.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis said another factor that people overlook for a rookie
is the adjustment to a longer season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard on all rookies, physically, mentally and
emotionally,'' he said. ``They think they know when they get into
it, but until they experience it, they don't know. They've already
played 14 games (counting preseason). In college, they'd already be
celebrating a bowl victory. It's part of the maturation process.''
</P>
<P>
   So, how's Tillman handling it? Typically, without complaint or
excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season is longer, no doubt,'' he said. ``But I'm getting
used to it like everybody else. It's not a huge problem.
Physically, I feel fine.'' &QL;

CLINTON URGES JAPAN TO KEEP MARKETS OPEN TO U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Updates earlier story with details of Clinton's speech on Friday
in Japan.)  (lb) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ President Clinton warned Japan on Friday that the United
States might feel pressure to restrict some markets if the U.S.
trade deficit keeps rising and Japan continues to limit U.S.
imports.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that a $195 billion package of tax cuts and
new spending announced by the government here on Monday might not
be enough to revive Japan's economy. ``The people here may conclude
that even more must be done to jolt the economy back into growth,''
he said in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce here.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that as the Asian financial crisis spread, he
decided to do ``everything we could to leave America's markets as
open as possible,'' although he knew that lower-priced goods from
Asia would cause the U.S. trade deficit to grow.
</P>
<P>
   But, he warned, ``if there is a perception of unfair trade,''
public support in the United States for open markets could
disappear. He cited as an example the surge this year in imports of
Japanese steel, which has dismayed the U.S. steel industry and
unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you put that against an inability to open more
markets,'' he said, it will ``create in our country the potential
for a retrenchment here in a way that will not be good for Asia or
Japan, or for the United States over the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   At the annual Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, held
last weekend in Malaysia, efforts to proceed with economic
liberalization in nine sectors collapsed in the face of Japan's
refusal to open its timber and fishing markets out of deference to
its powerful rural political constituencies. ``We wish that they
had been more forthcoming on all nine areas,'' Clinton said during
his speech, his first direct reference to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Clinton said he planned to deliver a similar message,
if a softer one, in meetings later Friday with Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton presses Japan to revive the economy, he is notably
short of both carrots and sticks. He took a new tack Friday in
suggesting that the U.S. free-trade policy was in effect an act of
generosity toward ailing Asian economies _ and could be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The president tried to present himself as reluctantly compelled
to inform Japan of the risk of a change in U.S. political
sentiment, saying, ``I want this mostly to be a good-news speech.''
</P>
<P>
   And he said he understood that in every society there are
certain industries that are ``especially sensitive to trade-opening
initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   He said even wealthy societies ``face a constant conflict
between the desire to get the aggregate benefit of an open economy
and the gnawing fear that it will not be possible to maintain the
social contract in the face of global economics.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has so far reacted coolly to the Japanese
government's stimulus package. Suggesting a certain skepticism, the
president said the speed with which it is carried out will
determine whether it is successful. Citing the American experience
with the collapse of its savings and loans, he said, ``Delay in a
crisis like this only makes matters worse.''
</P>
<P>
   He also called for vigorous enactment of Obuchi's plan for
reforming Japan's banking system, which has suffered from an inbred
network of weak loans that were often made for political and
personal reasons, rather than for economic ones.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Besides urging Japan's leaders to devise a plan to fix the
country's battered economy, Clinton found himself pressed to
justify his own policies, and to explain how he apologized to his
wife and daughter for his affair with a former intern.
</P>
<P>
   In a town-hall-style discussion televised nationwide late
Thursday night, Clinton told Japanese viewers, in response to a
housewife's question, that he had apologized to his family ``in a
direct and straightforward manner,'' and his smile broadened as he
added that he believed they had forgiven him.
</P>
<P>
   Before the name Monica Lewinsky crashed like an unmoored klieg
light into the television studio, the president handled queries
about whether he got good grades at school (``mostly''), why he
could speak so easily before large audiences (``the microphone is
your friend'') and how he coped with pressure (``a balanced
life'').
</P>
<P>
   He adroitly navigated an inquiry about his favorite meal among
``the dishes that your wife cooks,'' by saying that he adored
chicken enchiladas, without specifying a chef. ``I like sushi
too,'' he added, sensitive as ever to his immediate constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Seated on a tall, swiveling stool, Clinton taped the forum
Thursday evening, for broadcast Thursday night. He was encircled by
an audience of about 90 people, identified as housewives,
professionals, university students, small-business owners and
others. A few dozen more people participated from Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that the network, Tokyo Broadcasting
Systems, picked the audience and the questions, some of which were
read by the moderator from faxes and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who met with Japan's Emperor Akihito and Empress
Michiko on Thursday afternoon before a dinner in his honor at
night, hoped to use the forum to explain directly to the Japanese
people why he is urging their government to open its markets and
stimulate consumer demand, administration officials said. Seven of
the questions gave him a chance to do that.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton noted the rising U.S. trade deficit with Japan, he
seemed to suggest on Thursday that some Japanese industries were
engaging in dumping, the illegal trade practice of selling goods in
foreign markets at prices below cost. He pointed out that U.S.
imports of Japanese hot-rolled steel had increased fivefold over
the last year. ``No one quite believes that that's just because of
the economic problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts at an economic conference in Malaysia last weekend to
further liberalize trade foundered on Japan's insistence on
protecting its fishing and timber industries. On Thursday night,
Clinton did not specifically address those negotiations. But he
said that United States had discovered that it had increased jobs
by deregulating its airline and telecommunications industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say I never consciously asked Japan or any other
country to do something that is good only for the United States,''
he said. ``My belief is that our country is strengthened if Japan
is very strong, because if Japan is very strong, that brings back
Asia.''

THESE KIDS MAY BE ALL RIGHT  
 SUN DEVILS FRESHMEN ADJUSTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ..A - Sun Devil Stadium sits between a pair of buttes
only a few miles from the playing fields of St. Mary's, Tempe and
Mesa Mountain View high schools. But once you get there, you enter
another world entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most hyped, fawned-over prep star quickly learns
college football is a different game, played by different people,
people who are bigger, faster, stronger. And smarter. And then,
Justin Taplin said, ``You have to try even harder to keep your
skills up.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, you adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Taplin, from Tempe High School, Willie Daniel of St. Mary's and
Todd Heap of Mountain View are first-year Arizona State freshmen
who had to adjust quickly, jumping right into choppy waters without
the life preserver of a redshirt season. All have stayed afloat,
and all will play a role of some importance next week when they
suit up for the first time against rival Arizona in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Heap, a tight end and third-generation Sun Devil whose uncle, a
former basketball player, recently was inducted into the ASU Hall
of Fame, has been waiting for this game nearly his entire life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a passion of mine, every single U of A game,'' Heap
said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel calls it ``an all-out civil war'' and predicts a ``really
high-strung game.'' Taplin was a little slower in recognizing the
significance, mainly because he really wasn't an ASU fan until his
junior year of high school. But he's getting the message.
</P>
<P>
   All have had increasing responsibilities this year, but Daniel's
role has expanded the most. A running back and defensive back at
St. Mary's the past two years after transferring from Central High
(where he played quarterback), Daniel had an injury-marred senior
season. He expected to redshirt as a freshman at ASU. Now, because
of a depleted secondary, he's starting at strong safety. His first
start was last week in the mixing bowl that is Oregon's Autzen
Stadium. The Ducks have one of the most dynamic offenses in the
Pac-10, and proved it in a 51-19 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel pretty much played like a freshman. But given the
circumstances, no one is unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're asking Willie to do is more demanding than what
we're asking of (Heap and Taplin),'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said.
``And I think what he's doing is remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel's position requires that he recognize if the offense is
pulling something funny and react accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a freshman coming in, it takes a lot of maturity to be
able to play and keep your composure,'' he said. ``I'm not going to
take all the credit for that. I get a lot of help from my
teammates, especially (senior free safety) Mitchell Freedman. He
really takes care of me out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand it's a whole lot more mental than
physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Taplin, who has emerged as a dangerous kick returner, relies
more on instinct. He didn't play last year _ he was back at high
school, taking classes to regain his eligibility and extricate
himself from what he calls ``a whole bunch of crazy stuff'' that
originated when he failed to take the core courses necessary to
qualify for college.
</P>
<P>
   All that is behind Taplin, who is busy acclimating himself to
college life while running back kickoffs and punts and filling in
as an emergency cornerback during practice. He played the position
in high school but was recruited as a wide receiver. For now Taplin
considers himself a two-way player, a la Charles Woodson and Deion
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to expand my abilities,'' he said. ``It's
tough, real tough. Maybe one day it'll pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, however, would prefer that Taplin concentrate on one
thing, meaning offense.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder refrained from redshirting Daniel and Taplin because he
wants veteran players at their positions next season. Heap, on the
other hand, came assembled for immediate use. In his very first
game, he made an acrobatic catch in the end zone against
Washington. But only in the past few weeks has he become more a
part of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   There is rampant speculation Heap will return for his sophomore
season rather than go on a Mormon mission for two years, as he said
he would. Such talk makes him uncomfortable, but he conceded the
matter is not settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' he said. ``I'll look at everything after the
season's over and make a call after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just focusing on this game, and maybe a bowl game after
that.'' &QL;

UA OFFERS TOMEY HUGE RAISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN VAN DER WERF  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Dick Tomey, coach of the most successful football team
in University of Arizona history, is about to be richly rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   The school is offering Tomey a five-year deal at $500,000 per
year, an increase of almost 25 percent over what he is making now,
the university announced late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey's contract will likely include potential bonuses for
winning the Pac-10, for winning a certain number of games, or if a
certain percentage of his players graduate, standard options in
contracts for Arizona university coaches. It will be adjusted
annually for cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   The contract was discussed Thursday in a closed session of the
Arizona Board of Regents. The regents will release the full details
of the contract at their next meeting in January.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, if approved, will likely keep Tomey, 60, at UA for
the remainder of his career. The offer comes as Arizona, 10-1 this
year, prepares for a showdown with Arizona State next Friday and a
certain bowl game. Tomey's current contract, which pays him
$401,351 per year, expires on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Reached after a practice Thursday, Tomey said, ``I've just got
to wait on the process. It's in the officials' hands. They have the
say on the matter. I just have to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   The pay increase will boost Tomey past ASU basketball Coach Rob
Evans and make him the third-highest-paid coach in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ASU football Coach Bruce Snyder is making about $595,000 in base
salary. UA basketball Coach Lute Olson is being paid $528,955 this
year. Evans, who is two games into his ASU career, is making a base
salary of $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ASU President Lattie Coor confirmed Thursday that he
wants to extend Snyder's contract by another two years, through
2004. He also confirmed that the university will offer new
five-year contracts to baseball Coach Pat Murphy and women's
basketball Coach Charli Turner Thorne.
</P>
<P>
   Five years is the longest contract that can be offered under
regent policy.
</P>
<P>
   Coor acknowledged that it is unusual to offer long-term deals to
the baseball and women's basketball coaches, but said, ``The
universe is changing. There is more interest in our coaches from
other schools. These sports are higher-profile than ever.'' &QL;

KEALY GETS THROUGH AN OTHER WORKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Quarterback  &UR; Ryan Kealy had his second straight
extensive workout Thursday and is making fast progress, Arizona
State Coach  &UR; Bruce Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee last
week. He is expected to start against Arizona on Nov. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks good,'' Snyder said. ``He's not 100 percent, and he's
tender still. But he was in team work with people around him,
around his legs. He dropped back and threw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy did not play in the 51-19 loss to Oregon last Saturday. &QL; 
Recruiting update &QL; 
Approximately a third of the Sun Devils' 1999 recruiting class
could be made up of junior college players, Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   ASU hopes to sign eight to 10 for the 25-player recruiting
class. Snyder can bring in six mid-term players, and all will be
from junior colleges unless former Mesa Mountain View High School
offensive lineman  &UR; Damien Niko becomes eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Niko, who is enrolled at a junior college, still needs to pass
his college entrance exam. He can take the test this month and in
December. If he passes, he could enroll mid-term but still be a
true freshman, much like  &UR; J.R. Redmond did in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 19 recruits likely would include about 15 high
school players and four junior college athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said he already has eight to 10 commitments. &QL; 
Grayes matter &QL; 
ASU's defensive backfield continues to get thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman  &UR; Kyion Grayes has been dismissed from the team
for violating team rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Bruce Snyder issues and a team issue,'' said Snyder,
who would not specify the violation.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said Grayes, a product of Troy High in Fullerton, Calif.,
is ``no longer involved in anything in our program with the
exception of academics. We've maintained our academic support. We
monitor every class. That is his involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder would not say if or when Grayes would return. &QL; 
Quick hits &QL; 
Snyder plans to keep tailback Redmond (sprained ankle),
safety &UR; Mitchell Freedman (sprained knee, back) and cornerback
 &UR; J'Juan Cherry (thigh contusion) out of practice until next week.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said offensive lineman  &UR; Ralph Zarate, originally a member
of the 1997 recruiting class, is enrolled at Scottsdale Community
College as a full-time student and is working toward his AA degree.
He is expected to join the Sun Devils in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 tickets for the game at UA will go on sale at 10
a.m. Monday at the McKale Center Ticket Office. Cost is $28 each. &QL;

   With the holidays approaching, retailers at Arizona Mills went
shopping for workers last month. The Tempe mall held two job fairs
in October, seeking to fill 800 full- and part-time positions.
</P>
<P>
   But many stores left with their bags empty, as the recruitment
effort generated just 500 referrals _ and not all of those people
were hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have 300-plus positions to fill,'' said Anita
Weidner, Arizona Mills' marketing director. ``From what I hear from
our retailers, they're very flexible about working around people's
schedules,'' she added hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a slowing national economy, a lingering crisis in Asia
and some well-publicized layoffs among local high-tech and mining
companies, Arizona's job market continues to boom. In fact, the
Department of Economic Security said Thursday that the state's
jobless rate has dropped to its lowest level since modern
record-keeping began 28 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate ebbed to 3.6 percent
in October from 4.2 percent in September, as employers across the
state generated 16,400 new payroll jobs during the month.
</P>
<P>
   The jobless rate in metropolitan Phoenix was even lower,
slipping to 2.5 percent from 2.8 percent in September, helped by a
gain of 8,200 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concerns that Arizona would see a substantial slowdown this
year have not come to pass,'' said Dan Anderson, the department's
research administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The state's economic picture looks even better when compared
with the national situation, where unemployment in October remained
at 4.6 percent for the second straight month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona's jobless rate now stands a full percentage point
below the national average and represents the lowest level of
unemployment at least since January 1970,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is on target to exceed 90,000 new jobs in 1998. But if
the state doesn't reach that mark, it will reflect a lack of job
seekers, as Arizona Mills' situation shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor force growth has been slowing. That's a big part of
what's been happening in Arizona,'' said Debra Roubik, a Glendale
economist. That is, the tight job market mirrors a modest decline
in the number of workers migrating here from other states, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The DES figures show that the job market is particularly tight
in Arizona's two major urban areas. Both the Phoenix-Mesa and
Tucson metro areas in October tied their record-low unemployment
levels set earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson's rate fell dramatically, to 2.3 percent from 2.8
percent, as Pinal County added 6,500 positions.
</P>
<P>
   All of Arizona's rural counties also showed improvement,
including Yuma County, which slashed its jobless rate to a
state-worst 23.9 percent, from 27 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
   However, monthly fluctuations in rural counties tend to be more
volatile and thus less reliable because of the small populations in
these areas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the remarkable October figures, Roubik thinks the
state's economy is slowing gradually, in tandem with the nation's.
</P>
<P>
   The lingering Asian economic crisis took a modest toll last
month, as Arizona's manufacturing sector shed 400 jobs. Statewide
exports of electrical and electronics equipment are off sharply
this year, and several high-profile firms such as Motorola Inc.
have announced layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet manufacturing weakness in October was more than offset by
strength in education, construction, retailing, health services,
business services and the broad finance, insurance and real estate
sector. All of those industries generated at least 1,000 new jobs
during the month.
</P>
<P>
   Although some businesses are having trouble filling openings,
Anderson said he found little evidence that wages are increasing by
much.
</P>
<P>
   In the current low-inflation environment, ``Employers don't feel
they have a lot of ability to pass along higher wages in the form
of higher prices,'' he said. &QL;

FILM STUDENT IN UCLA LINE

 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For one week a year Kris Farris steps out of
character.
</P>
<P>
   The dead-on Bob Toledo impersonations are put in the closet. So
is the blue satin robe emblazoned with the gold letters ``KO
Champ'' that he'll wear around campus for laughs. You lookin' at
me?
</P>
<P>
   Farris is no longer the mild-mannered, good-humored,
behemoth-next-door.
</P>
<P>
   Which means it must be USC week.
</P>
<P>
   Farris, a 6-foot-9, 310-pound offensive tackle, is one of the
few UCLA players who have a real reason to hold a grudge with USC.
He ended up in Westwood because the Trojans didn't want him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, what pained Farris wasn't so much his rejection by USC's
football coaches as by its world-renowned film school.
</P>
<P>
   Farris was more interested in creating movies than creating
holes. He didn't want to be the next Anthony Munoz so much as the
next George Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty disappointing for him,'' his mother Debbie said.
``That was all he talked about until his senior year.''
</P>
<P>
   Farris still has a passion for movies. He owns a Digital Video
Disc player, has a video library of nearly 500 films and fully
intends on becoming a producer or director once he's done with
football.
</P>
<P>
   The rub is that Farris won't be done with football as soon as he
expected.
</P>
<P>
   He's playing like an All-America no sacks allowed this season
and a team-leading 40 knockout blocks, which gives him possession
of the robe. It's also near impossible to find an NFL draft
prospectus that doesn't have Farris pegged in the first round if he
forgoes his senior season. (ESPN's Mel Kiper currently has him
penciled in as the ninth-best prospect.)
</P>
<P>
   Farris, though, still thinks of himself as the guy who after his
first football practice, in eighth grade, asked his mother to take
him to the library so he could read a book that explained how the
game was played.
</P>
<P>
   He earned the scholarship to UCLA based on his potential, not
his play. While most of his teammates were All-American, all-this
or all-that, Farris wasn't even all-Seaview League. There were 27
players on his team at Santa Margarita High and 15 got awards at
the end of the season. Farris wasn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football didn't play any important role in my life until a
year ago,'' Farris said. I figured when I came here I'd never play.
I didn't think I'd ever start. I was overwhelmed. I was 6-foot-7,
250 pounds a skinny, wide-eyed kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really liked playing it before. It was just something
where I was big and I could use it as a stepping stone to get to
film school. Now, it's something I really enjoy. I love going out
and practicing. I love playing in the games. I love messing around
with my teammates. It's fun to me now. It's just as inspiring to me
now as film has been the rest of my life. It's kind of scary. If
you asked me right now to pick between football and film I think
I'd take football. I never thought I'd ever say that. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Movies have captivated Farris ever since his parents, Marty and
Debbie, found that planting 4-year-old Kris in front of Raiders of
the Lost Ark was the one way to get him to sit still.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, his birthday parties revolved around themes from
movies everyone got Superman capes one year; another year kids
dressed as their favorite convict for Escape from Alcatraz. By the
fifth grade, Farris was using his parents video camera to make
movies with his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved Superman, but I was never like most kids who thought
he could fly,'' Farris said. ``I knew he was on strings and wires.
I was never taken in by the fantasy of it. I just wanted to know
how they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his neighbor in Mission Viejo, Allen Stetson, spent the
better part of their youths trying to figure it out. They'd
re-enact scenes from their favorite films blowing up model
airplanes with firecrackers, smearing Farris' younger twin sisters
with catsup and having them roll down a hill and compile them into
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Their piece de resistance, ``Blood Vengeance,'' concludes with a
drug dealer being shot on the roof of a friend's house and falling
into a pool. Cinema vrit it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually story lines weren't our greatest concern,'' said
Stetson, a computer animation student at Cogswell College in
Sunnyvale.
</P>
<P>
   Football also became more important to Farris' film career after
his second year at UCLA, when he wasn't admitted to its film
school. Instead, he is majoring in English (coincidentally
following his idol, Steven Spielberg) and letting football open
doors for him.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked at Warner Bros. and Universal Studios during
breaks from school. He has watched James Burrows, the creator of
Taxi, Cheers and Fraser, preside over a set. He made a point of
introducing himself to Spielberg this summer in front of a Westwood
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I made an impression on him,'' Farris said. ``I'm
probably the biggest guy he's ever talked to.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, actor James Caan shook his hand and wished
him luck before a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like, `Come on, this is amazing,''' Farris said. ``The guy
I grow up watching on the Godfather for the last 20 years comes up
and shakes my hand and says `Good luck, Kris,' not `Good luck, 71.'
This is the stuff that's been able to happen to me. You can't put a
price on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it works. Without football, I'd still be sitting in
Orange County making little war films with my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he'll be busy on another project Saturday at the Rose
Bowl. It's been a box-office hit in Westwood seven years running.

CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST   STATUTE STYMIES TRANSIT PANEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seven of the 13 MTA board members were excluded
from voting on a crucial contract for the North Hollywood subway
extension because they admitted they took campaign contributions
from the contractor.
</P>
<P>
   To muster the necessary seven votes to even consider the motion
Thursday, the board held a lottery and Councilman Hal Bernson was
allowed to vote. He and five members voted for the contract, but
Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky dissented, causing
the motion to fail by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's CEO Julian Burke
said the rejection of the contract means the subway extension will
miss its scheduled opening date of May 2000. The length of the
delay was unclear, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to slow down this project, have more expense as a
result of slowing it down and possibly delay the opening beyond the
announced date,'' said Burke, obviously upset.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming the conflict-of-interest law has paralyzed the board,
members said they want to cut the number of votes necessary to pass
a motion as a way of circumventing the rule's intent.
</P>
<P>
   Seven board members could not vote on this contract because they
each had received at least $10 in campaign contributions from the
contractor, engineering management consultant
Parsons-Brinckerhoff/DMJM, within the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Those disqualified were Bernson; Mayor Richard Riordan, chairman
of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board; Councilman
Richard Alatorre; and Supervisors Michael D. Antonovich, Don Knabe,
Gloria Molina and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky could not be reached for comment after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Bernson in voting yes were Gardena Councilman James
Cragin, Duarte Councilman John Fasana, Riordan appointee Jose
Legaspi, Long Beach Councilwoman Jenny Oropeza and Glendale
Councilman Larry Zarian.
</P>
<P>
   MTA board members have found themselves in a similar quandary
since the retroactive, $10 limit took effect in January under a
state law written by state Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to get seven yes votes, board members complained
about the law and debated ways to get around it or make it less
restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   A member of Hayden's staff said they shouldn't look to the
lawmaker for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled them out of the pocket of contractors and they're
trying to climb back in,'' said Hayden's chief of staff, Rocky
Rushing. He said it may be time to talk about creating a board
consisting of nonelected officials as a way of avoiding conflicts
of interest from campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't think is the right thing to do is go back to
where we've been,'' Rushing said, adding, ``That's what got the MTA
into this mess,'' referring to the agency's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   MTA board members contended that the campaign contribution law
has made it hard for the agency to progress. Between absences and
conflicts of interest under the law, the board sometimes lacks
enough members even to vote on certain items.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't us who've been disenfranchised; it's the people who
elected us,'' Bernson said.
</P>
<P>
   With its $10 limit and retroactivity, the Hayden law is harsher
than any other elected body's conflict-of-interest rules, some MTA
board members complained. Even Burke called it ``a bizarre
statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan has been pushing for a solution, and the board was
scheduled to vote Thursday on a staff recommendation to lower the
minimum number of votes necessary to pass a motion.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would have required a majority of however many
board members are present at any given meeting and who don't have a
conflict of interest. At least three yes votes would be required
for a matter to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Antonovich balked at the proposal, saying the board should stick
with its current rule requiring seven votes for a motion to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to move away from that policy and principle is a step
away from accountability,'' he said. ``This sends the wrong message
to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   After more discussion, the board postponed a vote on the
proposal until January.
</P>
<P>
   Molina suggested the agency approach the state Legislature in
the interim to see if the contribution law can be made less
restrictive. If not, the MTA board could take another look at
amending its rules and procedures, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent of the legislation is very good,'' Molina said.
``The question is how can we bring some reason to this.
</P>
<P>
   To get board approval for the stalled contract for the North
Hollywood subway extension, a special meeting might have to be held
during December, when no board meeting is scheduled, MTA officials
said. &QL;

BIBLE WEEK JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF GOD-GOVERNMENT DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixteen simple words adopted in 1791: Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof.
</P>
<P>
   How this plays out in American life is not so simple.
</P>
<P>
   The president and governors of all 50 states issued National Day
of Prayer proclamations for its 47th annual observance. Government
officials pray before council meetings, school board meetings and
legislative sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Americans see ``In God We Trust'' on every coin and routinely
pledge allegiance to ``one nation under God.'' A representation of
the Ten Commandments sits in a public park across from the state
Capitol in Phoenix, and Moses holds the tablets in a frieze above
the U.S. Supreme Court justices' dais.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty governors and 500 mayors proclaim National Bible Week,
but only in Arizona are proclamations being challenged in court as
a violation of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   A restraining order obtained by the Arizona Civil Liberties
Union on Monday prevented Gilbert Mayor Cynthia Dunham from
proclaiming Bible Week in that city. On Thursday, Gov. Jane Hull
was sued by the ACLU for her Bible Week proclamation. National
Bible Week begins Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   God and government are entangled in ways courts have upheld, in
ways courts have struck down and in ways that likely would be
declared unconstitutional if challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you draw that line is going to be sometimes uncertain,''
said Brent Walker, general counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee,
a religious-liberties watchdog organization in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of rubs between the operations of those two
clauses that we just kind of live with,'' Walker said, referring to
the free-exercise and establishment clauses of the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go to court over every single issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The courts have not held that God or religious elements have to
be eliminated from government, said Marci Hamilton, a law professor
at Yeshiva University in New York City, who successfully argued
before the U.S. Supreme Court against the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act last year.
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down the act passed by Congress and signed by
the president that gave religion the balance of power in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, judges look for a pragmatic balance between church and
state, a line where neither state nor religion holds enough power
to be tyrannical, she said. No one is going to be converted by
reading ``In God We Trust'' on a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those sorts of things have been in place for so long that it
is fairly clear that there is no danger to the church-state
balance,'' she said. ``The republic has survived and thrived, and
we do not have a system where either government or religion is
totally dominant. If the coins were changed and we added language,
`Be born again,' that would be an endorsement in today's society.''
</P>
<P>
   However, government proclamations with any religious overtones
give the appearance of government endorsement of religion and cross
the line, Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Crampton, chief counsel for the American Family
Association Law Center in Mississippi, interprets the First
Amendment differently. The Founding Fathers' fear was of a
state-sponsored church, not the commingling of religious beliefs
and government, said Crampton, who takes on free-speech and
freedom-of-religion cases. Not allowing such proclamations violates
the right to free exercise of religion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't Congress, and the proclamation isn't a law,''
Crampton said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, also an ordained Southern Baptist minister, is all for
prayer and Bible reading, he said. He believes the National Bible
Week proclamation would withstand scrutiny, although he doesn't
think such proclamations are wise.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible Week proclamation has a phrase, ``the Bible is the
foundational document of the Judeo-Christian principles upon which
our Nation was conceived . . . ,'' that nearly calls the United
States a Christian nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``this annual emphasis has helped to strengthen
spiritual understanding throughout our nation by encouraging
personal reading and study of the Bible'' doesn't say the
government is encouraging Bible reading. The subtle wording means
the government is recognizing the National Bible Association's
activities, he said. That phrase was deleted from Gilbert's planned
proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible Week proclamation has obviously been drafted with a
good bit of lawyering. It goes right to the very edge,'' Walker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Day of Prayer proclamation, though, goes over the
line by calling people to engage in the ultimate act of religious
worship: prayer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the issue is that nobody has filed a suit to say the
president shouldn't sign a proclamation,'' said Walker, adding he
didn't plan to file such a lawsuit personally. ``It's a relatively
insignificant crack in the wall of church-state separation. A
constitutional amendment to allow state-sponsored prayer, that's a
serious challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, as long as government didn't violate the
prevailing religious points of view _ Protestant, Catholic and
Jewish _ society accepted and expected some religious involvement
in civic affairs, according to Dean Hoge, a religion sociologist at
Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The country, though, is in transition as minority voices become
more pluralistic and vocal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenges to church-state separation will be increasing,
and they will sue on all of those in the course of time,'' Hoge
said. ``I think they will win.''
</P>
<P>
   However, religion is so entrenched in culture and politics that
this transition will be gradual, taking 50 years or so, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional law, not public opinion, though is the deciding
factor, said Chris Allen, a member of the American Atheists board
of directors and a Utah resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority is religious, but that doesn't mean we have to
throw out the First Amendment and make government an arm of the
church,'' he said. ``Civil rights are supposed to be yours
regardless of what the majority wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Only so many battles can be fought in the current climate, said
Allen, although his group would like to challenge everything from
``In God We Trust'' to Christmas as a state and federal holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The public doesn't understand or support the separation of
church and state, and religious people hold powerful positions and
push their belief system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Christians want government officials to encourage their
constituents to read the Bible and pray as a way to restore
morality, said Jodie Stamps, a member of the Christian Covenant
Fellowship in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since the separation of church and state, it's left a
door for the devil to walk right in. That door needs to be closed
up,'' Stamps said.
</P>
<P>
   People of many faiths believe tolerance is the key. A ``Holy
Scriptures Week'' would be more appropriate than Bible Week, but
government should recognize the role religion plays.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Bill Isabell, a Gilbert resident and carpenter
who goes to Mass every Sunday with his family. He attended the
Gilbert Town Council meeting Tuesday _ when Bible Week was on the
agenda _ because his daughter Katie, 11, was being honored as the
student of the month for Towne Meadows Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see why the ACLU is upset, but it doesn't upset me,''
Isabell said. ``I think the majority of people can take it or leave
it. That is what's great about our country.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ The Seahawks' season-long search for their
missing offense is turning into a scavenger hunt.
</P>
<P>
   With six games remaining, starting with Sunday's matchup against
the 7-3 Cowboys in Dallas, the Seahawks can't be worried about
finding a way to win four or five games. The immediate concern is
winning another game _ and that's a long shot until the offense can
move the ball consistently.
</P>
<P>
   With the Seahawks losing five of their past seven games and the
offense ranked 25th in the NFL, their situation has spawned
suggested solutions that the players and coaches view as nonsense,
everything from benching Warren Moon, to replacing Ricky Watters,
to firing Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's panic stuff,'' wide receiver Mike Pritchard said.
``Actually, that would be kind of, I don't want to say stupid, but
it would be stupid. We're in a situation where we as an offense
need to step up and execute, not start tearing everything apart.''
</P>
<P>
   paper, this unit is better than the one that ranked third in the
NFL last season. On the field, it has been another story, one that
could contain an unhappy ending if it continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been consistent enough in any aspect of our game to
be consistent moving the football,'' said Erickson, the Seahawks'
fourth-year coach. ``That boils down to throwing it. That boils
down to catching it. That boils down to blocking the run correctly.
It's just a number of different things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could sit here and talk forever, but we're just not
consistent in any aspect of it at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The most-mentioned remedies are mostly non-options:
</P>
<P>
   Change the quarterback _ Callers to sports-talk radio shows
don't have a monopoly on this conversation. Replacing Moon has been
discussed by the coaches in their weekly planning meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Their decision: Moon remains the best of the three quarterbacks
and provides the team with its best opportunity to win.
</P>
<P>
   Asked this week if he would consider pulling Moon if he
struggles against the Cowboys, Erickson said, ``No. Not at all. I
wouldn't do that. Warren is the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kitna might be the quarterback of the future. But this
team's future, and especially this coaching staff's future, is
Sunday against the Cowboys and Nov. 29 against the Tennessee
Oilers. Erickson must do everything he can to win every game. He is
asking his players to do the same. A move to Kitna this early would
be the equivalent of a concession speech.
</P>
<P>
   But Moon is struggling, along with the rest of the offense. He
has completed only 29 passes in the past two games combined, with
one touchdown and five interceptions. Last year, he completed at
least 20 passes in 10 of the 12 games he started and finished.
</P>
<P>
   Moon has not looked comfortable in the pocket, which can be
traced to the two broken ribs he suffered at Kansas City on Oct. 4;
the 10 times he has been sacked in the three games since returning;
and his own shaken confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you're going through a slow period, whether it be now
or any other times where I've had slow periods in a season, you
start questioning yourself,'' said Moon, who turned 42 on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Replace Watters with rookie Ahman Green _ The Seahawks need to
work Green into the offense. His speed and quickness provide a nice
counterpunch to Watters' pounding style. But Green being elevated
to No. 1 and Watters being demoted to No. 2 will not happen, and it
should not happen.
</P>
<P>
   As with the quarterbacks, the running back position is evaluated
each week. The coaches have reached the same conclusion about
Watters as they have with Moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting Ricky down is not going to solve our problems,''
offensive coordinator Bob Bratkowski said. ``That's not the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Watters has continued to run hard, even when the holes have not
been there.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem in the running game is the blocking scheme. The
coaches need to keep things simple. They talked about doing this
during their bye week, but have since returned to the combination
blocks that are not working as well as the basic
block-the-man-in-front-of-you approach might.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer this drags on, the harder it is to get out of it,''
guard Pete Kendall said of the offensive slump. ``I know
personally, I'm pressing right now and that's not helping me. As an
offensive group, we're pressing. As an offensive line, we're
pressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stick with the three-receiver sets in the red zone _ Another
move made during the bye week was the return to the
multiple-receiver sets that were so productive last season. But on
the rare occasions when the offense has gotten inside the
opposition's 20-yard line by passing the ball from the
three-receiver sets, the coaches junk it for two-back alignments.
</P>
<P>
   There is a method behind what appears to be madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people in the league go to two backs, and there's
a reason for it,'' Bratkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   By replacing a receiver with a second back, the offense gains an
extra blocker whether the play is a run or a pass, and keeps the
defense in a more predictable personnel package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the criticism about getting too conservative down
there,'' Bratkowski said. ``But when you go to (three receivers),
you then open yourself up to a lot more exotic coverages. You can
kind of predict the things you're going to get when you're in two
back and you can still have some solid running game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have scored 12 touchdowns on 23 trips inside the
20. That's 52 percent, which is better than average. Last year,
when the Seahawks led the league in passing offense, they had a
touchdown percentage of 45.5 in the red zone. Of course, last year
they were inside the 20 more often (44 times) and also had more big
plays (21 runs or passes of at least 25 yards after 10 games,
compared with 12 this season).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest reason for the Seahawks' infrequent trips
into the red zone are penalties. Sixteen different offensive
players have been penalized in 10 games for everything from delay
of game, to holding, to false starts, to unnecessary roughness.
</P>
<P>
   These drive-killing penalties have put the offense in too many
third-and-long situations. The Seahawks have had 16 third downs in
the past two games where they needed 10 or more yards to pick up a
first down. Not surprisingly, they were 0-for-13 in third-down
situations in Oakland last week and 2-for-11 the week before
against Kansas City.

 DeSAUSSURE WON'T MAKE PULLMAN TRIP  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A few ill-chosen words initially cost Andre DeSaussure
his job. Now he has lost his seat on the team's chartered jet.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' second-leading receiver will be left home today and
won't play against Washington State when his teammates travel to
Pullman for Saturday's Apple Cup, coach Jim Lambright said during
Thursday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   DeSaussure fell in his coach's disfavor _ again _ after making
several disparaging comments about the Cougars and Pullman to a
couple of reporters at Monday's media luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright said the harshness of the penalty was determined by
the player's long track record, rather than words alone. For much
of his UW career, DeSaussure has been regarded as an undisciplined,
underachieving player. He has been left home from road trips
before, though never as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision was based on his five years, not this one
action,'' said the coach, standing in the driving rain. ``You don't
do it on the spur of the moment. You do it trying to teach him how
to do things right over a season.''
</P>
<P>
   DeSaussure, a senior with 25 catches for 491 yards and two
scores, practiced with the team Thursday, but was not allowed to
speak with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently has tried to make amends with Lambright, hoping
for a reprieve if there is a bowl game. He stood in a meeting room
and apologized to his teammates, and he has run full speed in
practice as a scout-teamer. A second chance is in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him how proud I am of him for that,'' Lambright said.
``We've got a bowl game to play. We've gone through that. I told
him he has the right to compete for the starting job then.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, DeSaussure was overheard saying he hoped the
Pullman trip wouldn't be taken from him. Teammates said they would
prefer to have DeSaussure at the Apple Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he did was inexcusable and needs to be
addressed,'' fellow wide receiver Joe Jarzynka said. ``But I think
it's harsh not taking him.''
</P>
<P>
   DeSaussure's freefall has made Jarzynka a starter at flanker, a
first for him while serving as the UW place-kicker. As a sub
receiver, Jarzynka normally draws 5 to 15 offensive plays. As the
first-teamer, he expects his time to double.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WON'T RENEW PIERCE PRESIDENT'S CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will move in the ``n'' Calfiornia news file.) 
BY SHARLINE CHIANG  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pierce College President E. Bing Inocencio will
not have his contract renewed when it expires in June.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Community College District board members voted in
closed session Wednesday not to renew Inocencio's three-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Shrouding the decision in mystery, district administrators and
board members declined Thursday to explain why the board chose to
end Inocencio's stay at the helm of the system's largest campus. He
was hired in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   District spokesman Blair Sillers would only release a terse
statement saying she would not discuss the board's 5 to 1 vote.
Trustee Julia Wu cast the opposing vote and Trustee and board Vice
President Gloria Romero was absent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't provide that information,'' Sillers said. ``I've been
told there is no comment at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Inocencio could not be reached for comment. Repeated messages
left for board members were not returned. The decision comes at a
time when the 51-year-old campus is moving rapidly forward with two
ambitious and controversial money-making projects _ a golf course
or other venture on its 240 acres of farmland and a biotech park.
The projects each could bring the college more than $1 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, campus leaders said progress on the projects will
not be interrupted by the board's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The projects are moving forward, this will not affect the
projects,'' said Martin Mota, chairman of Pierce Council, the
college's main governing board and one of the key coordinators of
both projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have good people involved. The Pierce Council and the upper
administration will move forward with the projects. ... These were
not Bing projects.''
</P>
<P>
   On the board's decision, Mota said, ``It's unfortunate. I really
like Bing a lot. But I think the college will move forward from
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Around campus, the board's decision got mixed reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Several people said there were complaints about Inocencio's
management style and his community relations skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Bing, but I think maybe Bing is not really the right
person for what Pierce needs right now,'' said student body
President Heather Putnam. ``If the board believes we do need a
progressive president, one who can see the vision of Pierce, than
the board does what it must.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Krahn, president of Pierce's Academic Senate, said the
college is no stranger to change. Inocencio is the school's sixth
president in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not in any way in denial about the fact that we have some
challenges,'' she said. ``But we've been here for 50 years and
we're not out (of business).''
</P>
<P>
   Inocencio, 63, a native of the Philippines, left New York in
1996 to become Pierce president. He was hired at a starting salary
of $93,353 to bring stability to the campus that was campus was
denied accreditation from the Accrediting Commission for Community
and Junior Colleges of the Western Association of Schools and
Colleges in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Once the shining star of the district, serving up to 24,000
students, Pierce has been struggling in past years, saddled with
deficits and declining enrollment. Early this fall, the school
enrolled about 12,300 students, about 10percent fewer than the same
time last year.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997-98, Pierce was running a $1.8 million
deficit, and already owed the district reserves an additional $4
million, according to district officials.
</P>
<P>
   Inocencio was handpicked by a campus selection committee for
what they said was his business experience, can-do attitude and
focus on students. Brought in to be a savior, the former Fulbright
scholar and business consultant, served as associate provost at New
York City Technical College in Brooklyn, before coming to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   However, Inocencio almost immediately began antagonizing
community groups by making decisions without public input. He's
been criticized for canceling Pierce's popular Fourth of July
celebrations and for standing silent after the school's agriculture
department decided to cancel its annual intercollegiate rodeo. &QL;

GAILEY'S PLAYBOOK REVEALS WILD SIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Chan Gailey projects a conservative and
unassuming personality.
</P>
<P>
   But in leading the Cowboys to first place in the NFC East,
Gailey has revealed his wild side.
</P>
<P>
   It usually shows up on game day when Gailey changes from
cautious to extravagant with his offensive play-calling, mixing in
trick plays and wide-open formations to the Cowboys' run-based
attack. And the flair of unpredictability has helped the Cowboys
build one of the best offenses in the league so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize that you don't trick a lot of people in this
league,'' said quarterback Troy Aikman. ``But when you can give
people a different look, especially when you can run them, it makes
a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's up Gailey's sleeve?
</P>
<P>
   The option play in pro football.
</P>
<P>
   He called it twice last Sunday against the Cardinals with
receiver Ernie Mills playing the quarterback role.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was punter Toby Gowin taking off on a fake punt
for a 33-yard gain?
</P>
<P>
   He did that against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not even including the six reverses Mills and
receiver Billy Davis have run or the shovel pass off the fake
reverse that resulted in a Chris Warren touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who played in Pittsburgh where Gailey was the offensive
coordinator, said to expect the unexpected with Gailey. Aikman says
he is certainly a believer in Gailey's trickery.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, whose offense is still conservatively based on the
running game and tailback Emmitt Smith, credits his liberated
drifts to his experiences under Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves
when both were in Denver (1985-1990) and under Steelers coach Bill
Cowher the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Reeves' contribution is understandable, considering that
Reeves is an offensive coach and learned about the importance of
trick plays from former Cowboys coach Tom Landry, a legendary
offensive innovator. Gailey said Cowher's lack of inhibitions about
trick plays initially surprised him because of his defensive roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He \RCowher\S taught me how it can affect defenses,'' Gailey
said. ``And he is wilder about it than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey says he's not reckless in his beliefs and understands
that you don't win with trick plays alone. However, he said they
can enhance a game plan because ``it keeps the defense off-balance
because they don't know what's coming next.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the use of trick plays also can give a coach the
upper hand in the pre-game mental battle. The thought is that teams
have to take time away in meetings and practices from preparing for
the Cowboys' base offense to prepare for something that they may or
may not see in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys go into every game with at least two or three trick
plays in the game plan. Sometimes they use them, sometimes they
don't.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said that strategy is no different than most teams.
However, he has come to find out that running trick plays is more
than lip service with Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times over the years, we've had things in the offense
but never have run them in the ballgame,'' Aikman said. ``That's
really what separates Chan from some of the other coordinators. He
is willing to call them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin agreed, but compared Gailey to
former Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson in that they each calculate the
best time to use the trickery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan is a lot like Jimmy in that he will take that risk, but
they will calculate when the best opportunity presents itself,''
Irvin said. ``They look at the right area of the field and the
smart time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Gailey is also smart about is keeping his bag of gimmicks
in a shroud of secrecy. Not one trick play is listed in the
Cowboys' phone-book thick playbook; they are all in Gailey's head.
He does that to keep the current players concentrating on the base
plays and the former players from spreading his secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Two common gadget plays in the NFL aren't in Gailey's bag.
Gailey said an option pass back to Aikman as a receiver is out ``at
least until \Rhis fractured collarbone\S is healed.''
</P>
<P>
   And Irvin said he will have no part of any type of hook and
lateral, which usually consists of a receiver catching the ball and
pitching off to a runner.
</P>
<P>
   Citing his lack of receptions of late, Irvin said, ``Any ball
thrown my way, I'm keeping.''

DODGERS, ANGELS COURT BIG UNIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Free-agent left-hander Randy Johnson will visit
the Los Angeles Dodgers and Anaheim Angels on Saturday after
receiving three-year offers from both clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers made their proposal Thursday. It is thought to be
competitive with the three-year offer by the Texas Rangers worth
between $36 million and $39 million, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is of no value to the Dodgers to discuss the
process,'' general manager Kevin Malone said Thursday. ``Why would
I want to tip off 29 other clubs on what we are doing?
</P>
<P>
   ``But if he shows up, I guess you could say we've discussed the
parameter of an offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's agents Barry Meister and Alan Nero have insisted that
the Dodgers would have to make an offer before the pitcher made a
visit.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels responded shortly after free agents became eligible
to talk to other clubs, a period that began 15 days after the World
Series. But as the Angels learned with Mo Vaughn _ Boston's free
agent slugger who has not responded to their six-year, $72 million
offer _ being first means little.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 35, also is expected to hear from the World Series
champion New York Yankees. He would like a fourth season
guaranteed. The Rangers have offered a fourth year at the club's
option.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have interest in signing Johnson or San Diego's
free-agent right-hander Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson might be more attractive for several reasons, including
his dominance as a left-hander. The Dodgers' four existing
starters, Chan Ho Park, Ismael Valdes, Dave Mlicki and Darren
Dreifort are right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson struck out 329 batters last season and was 10-1 with
Houston after coming over from Seattle at the July 31 trade
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   He also is seeking a shorter contract than Brown, who is trying
to get a six-year deal worth $72 million. The Dodgers already are
tied into long-term deals with Gary Sheffield, Raul Mondesi and
Eric Young, which limits their financial flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   The down side is Johnson's age and history of lower-back pain
that wiped out much of the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Malone also has spoken to Brown's agent Scott Boras but has not
made an offer. The Colorado Rockies, who signed Dodgers free-agent
left-hander Brian Bohanon to a three-year $9 million contract, want
Brown but said this week they will not offer a six-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson would like to sign with a team that trains in Arizona,
where he lives. He met twice last week with the Arizona
Diamondbacks and reportedly was impressed. The Dodgers are expected
to leave their spring-training base in Florida after the coming
year and move to Arizona for the 2000 season. That also will be
part of their pitch to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   __ Radinsky leaves: Left-handed reliever Scott Radinsky, the
Simi Valley resident who pitched three seasons for the Dodgers,
signed a two-year, $5.5 million contract with the St. Louis
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Radinsky, 30, pitched well for the Dodgers in a setup role in
1996 and '97 but faltered when made the closer early last season.
His 11 blown saves were second-most in the National League, but he
regained his effectiveness when he returned to a setup role after
the Dodgers acquired closer Jeff Shaw at the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Radinsky, who earned $900,000 from the Dodgers last season, will
make $2.5 million in 1999 and $2.5 million in 2000. He has an
option for 2001 at $2.5 million with a $500,000 buyout. Radinsky's
salary bump despite the off year is a reflection of the premium
placed on left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets recently signed former Dodgers middleman
Dennis Cook to a three-year, $6.6 million contract. Cook, the Mets
left-handed setup man for John Franco, received more years than
Radinsky but less money per season. Cook also will be 36 on Opening
Day, five years older than Radinsky.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the Dodgers claim they did not get competitive in
Radinsky negotiations is they wanted a left-hander who could get
out left-handers. Radinsky, who has great movement on his 90-mph
fastball, actually struggled last year more against lefties than
righties. They batted .281 against him with a .482 slugging
percentage.

 &HT;    Leaflet plaintiffs: Erwin Center a public forum
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Four environmental activists challenged in
federal court on Thursday a University of Texas policy that
prohibits anyone who is not a student, staffer or faculty member
from distributing pamphlets on campus property.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the activists were threatened with arrest after
attempting to pass out environmental information fliers outside the
Erwin Center, which is owned by the university.
</P>
<P>
   During the nonjury trial, Martha Owen, the activists' attorney,
argued that the Erwin Center is a public forum.

<P>
   Therefore, it's unconstitutional to ban the distribution of
information on its sidewalks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside the Erwin Center, TicketMaster operates an office on
the university's side of the sidewalk,'' Owen said. ``Clearly, by
tradition or design, this is a public forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Smith, a UT administrator who sees to the enforcement of
campus rules and regulations, testified that the university limits
free expression to students, faculty and staff because of crowding
and safety issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campus has 70,000 people that come and go every day,'' he
said. ``We have an enormous task of managing these people and
making sure activities, such as leafletting, do not interfere with
our carrying out our primary mission, education.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . I think we would lose control if we allow anyone to come
in at any time to distribute leaflets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Erwin Center is the site of events ranging from ball games
to rock concerts.
</P>
<P>
   The university owns it, but because state law stipulates that no
tax dollars can be used to run it, it must rely on commercial shows
for its support.
</P>
<P>
   Smith testified that the university decides which music groups
or shows will perform there.
</P>
<P>
   During a moment of levity, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks asked
Smith what rock concerts had to do with the mission of the
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand a group called the Barenaked Ladies is playing
this weekend. . . . Now, what I want to know is how do they help
fulfill this mission?'' Sparks asked, causing a ripple of laughter
in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our commitment to improving student life,'' Smith
answered.
</P>
<P>
   The headlining group at the Erwin Center this weekend is
actually Austin's own Dixie Chicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like the record to show that I'm sure the Dixie Chicks
must be the better act, evident by name alone,'' Sparks joked at
his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony for both sides ended Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   While Sparks did not issue a ruling, he indicated that he had
not heard sufficient evidence proving the Erwin Center is not a
public forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Mall is the reverse of (the Erwin Center),'' he said.
``There's no expectation of 30,000 people coming to marvel at the
library, as 30,000 people are likely to go see the Dixie Chicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks said he would rule after Dec. 1.

 &HT;    Leaflet plaintiffs: Erwin Center a public forum
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Four environmental activists challenged in
federal court on Thursday a University of Texas policy that
prohibits anyone who is not a student, staffer or faculty member
from distributing pamphlets on campus property.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the activists were threatened with arrest after
attempting to pass out environmental information fliers outside the
Erwin Center, which is owned by the university.
</P>
<P>
   During the nonjury trial, Martha Owen, the activists' attorney,
argued that the Erwin Center is a public forum.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, it's unconstitutional to ban the distribution of
information on its sidewalks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside the Erwin Center, TicketMaster operates an office on

Dierker envisions All-Star lineup with Caminiti signing
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Upgrading the Astros' lineup would seem to be as necessary as
giving Tyra Banks a makeover.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, even the most beautiful faces can use a little
rouge, and the Astros dressed up their lineup Thursday when third
baseman Ken Caminiti passed his physical and officially returned to
his original organization.
</P>
<P>
   Revlon might not produce enough makeup to hide the bruises the
Astros could leave on National League pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lineup will almost look like an All-Star team,'' said
manager Larry Dierker, who didn't think his offense could be more
potent than it was in 1998 when the Astros scored a club-record 874
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding Caminiti to a cast that included Craig Biggio, Jeff
Bagwell, Moises Alou and Derek Bell almost seems unfair to the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lineup we can win a ring with,'' said Caminiti, 35,
who reached the World Series with the San Diego Padres last month.
``All you can ever ask for is a chance, and with this lineup we
definitely have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It's uncertain how Dierker will fill out his lineup card on most
nights, but he offered a hint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of like the sound of Bagwell, Caminiti and Alou,'' said
Dierker, indicating the trio would bat in the 3-4-5 slots. ``You
could really throw all of their names into the air and let them hit
in whichever order they fell down. It doesn't matter where they all
hit; we're going to score a lot of runs.''
</P>
<P>
   A quickie look at the team as it stands: &QL; 
The infield &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The right side of the Astros' infield has been a notch above the
left because of Bagwell and Biggio. The addition of Caminiti brings
the playing field a bit closer to level.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers will be most affected by Caminiti's return. Spiers
platooned with Sean Berry at third base in 1997 but won't get as
much time there next season.
</P>
<P>
   In order to get Spiers into the lineup, Dierker likely will get
him some action at shortstop against certain righthanders, and he
could give Biggio a break at second base.
</P>
<P>
   One scenario for getting Spiers' bat into the lineup is to
platoon him at shortstop with Ricky Gutierrez. But Dierker has some
concerns about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable with Billy playing shortstop every once in a
while, but we're kidding ourselves if we think he can do it a
lot,'' Dierker said. ``When I talked to him about it last season,
he had concerns about it himself. Maybe that would change if we
played him a lot during the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   The job behind catcher Brad Ausmus is uncertain, but it appears
Mitch Meluskey will be given every chance to get the backup job
Tony Eusebio has held the past two seasons. &QL; 
The outfield &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The $5.25 million question is ``Will the Astros trade Bell?''
Actually, that seems to be the question every offseason. Outfield
depth was one of the Astros' strength in 1998, when Bell and Alou
started on the corners with Carl Everett and Richard Hidalgo
sharing center field.
</P>
<P>
   There is no consensus in the organization regarding how to
address the logjam. Some think Everett and Hidalgo deserve to play
every day; others like the idea of having a high-quality fourth
outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   This could depend on what happens with Randy Johnson, whose
signing would take a significant chunk out of the Astros' budget.
In other words, if Johnson is here, maybe Bell won't be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a surplus of outfielders, but there's nothing wrong
with that,'' Dierker said. ``I guess we could trade one of them in
the right deal, but I'd rather have all of them back.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Astros pull off a trade for Toronto's Roger Clemens _
that situation will be more clear in about four weeks _ they
probably would have to part with one of their front-line
outfielders. &QL; 
The rotation &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It's better if Johnson returns, but the odds of that happening
don't look good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more time has developed, the more he may be moving away
from us,'' Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. said. ``But I'm not
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds likely will be on the mound opening day and will
have a chance to establish himself as the ace. Mike Hampton and
Jose Lima are quality starters, and Scott Elarton will move from
the bullpen to the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Holt, recuperating from shoulder surgery after the 1997
season, probably will battle Sean Bergman for the fifth spot. &QL; 
The bullpen &QC;
</P>
<P>
   General manager Gerry Hunsicker will try to add a righthander to
replace Elarton, but other than that, most of the same faces figure
to be in the bullpen in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Powell and Doug Henry will set up Billy Wagner, whom the
Astros hope will have a reliable pitch to complement his blazing
fastball by the time spring training ends.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Nitkowski and Trever Miller will be bullpen lefthanders.
Jose Cabrera, who spent most of the 1998 season on the disabled
list, is a candidate to replace Elarton, but expect Hunsicker to
bring a few arms to camp as insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Springer, who is under contract with the Braves, has told
friends he would like to return to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a few minor adjustments _ a bench player or perhaps a
reliever or two _ the Astros likely are through dealing. After all,
a team that wins 102 games is hardly in need of an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe that if we do nothing else this
offseason, I'm ready to go to battle with this team,'' Hunsicker
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States has been in revolutionary mode this week.
Though his spokesmen deny that Vice-President Al Gore intended in
his remarks in Malaysia on Nov. 16 to incite anyone to rebel
against the government, he minced no words in describing as
``brave'' the Malaysians who have been calling for political
reform.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, the United States now makes no secret of its earnest
wish to see Saddam Hussein overthrown, or of its support for the
opposition groups that it hopes will be the instrument of its
desires.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting thus to get rid of Hussein, a despot with a long
criminal record who is plainly dangerous both at home and abroad,
may be considered highly desirable. But Malaysia is not Iraq. It is
no danger to others, and is ruled by a relatively benign government
whose head, Mahathir Mohamad, though autocratic, is
constitutionally elected.
</P>
<P>
   Is the United States wading into dangerous waters?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes, but it is right to do so nonetheless, so long
as it is aware of the risks.
</P>
<P>
   One risk, in Malaysia certainly, is that criticism may
strengthen the hand of the government, not of the opposition it is
intended to help.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitivities are acute in many countries, and criticism from
foreigners, especially from ``arrogant'' or ``inconsistent''
Americans, can often turn even opponents into nationalists. It may
also upset other allies.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Philippines has been quick to applaud Gore's
remarks, other countries in the region have been more reticent.
They worry, no doubt, for the cohesion of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, whose meeting it was that brought the
American vice-president to Malaysia in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   APEC is a fragile organization, they may reckon, and needs to be
strengthened, not weakened, if it is to last.
</P>
<P>
   Similar worries also apply in Iraq. Hussein makes capital from
his readiness to defy the might of America, and this goes down well
in parts of the Arab world, where the United States needs all the
friends it can find.
</P>
<P>
   But other concerns loom larger in Iraq. In Malaysia, dangerous
critics may get beaten up; in Iraq, if they are caught, they are
certain to be tortured and killed.
</P>
<P>
   There are practical difficulties in helping them, too. The Iraqi
opposition is ineffective, divided and largely in exile. Much of it
is also unsavory: many of those who might conceivably carry out a
coup are themselves implicated in Hussein's crimes. And many of the
others, having lost faith in getting decisive help from outsiders,
have come to unspoken arrangements with his regime.
</P>
<P>
   It is conceivable that America could nonetheless fortify the
opposition enough to worry Hussein. After all, though the Bay of
Pigs operation to remove Fidel Castro in 1961 ended in fiasco, the
decision to arm opponents of Soviet rule in Afghanistan in the
1980s proved much more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even this example should be cautionary. Driving the Russians
out of Afghanistan involved a hideous civil war that even by 1987
had claimed the lives of perhaps 1.24 million people, mostly
civilians. And out of it emerged a battle-hardened breed of Muslim
fanatic, the Afghanis, who are now blamed for most of the acts of
international terrorism carried out against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One of the unintended consequences of a civil war in Iraq could
be the breakup of the country. In an ideal world that might be
desirable, especially if it led to the establishment of a state for
one of the world's stateless nations, the Kurds. But it would
horrify Turkey, an American ally, never mind Iran and Syria, each
of which has its own Kurdish minority. Civil war in Iraq could turn
into regional chaos.
</P>
<P>
   So why is America right to wade in? Essentially, in Malaysia,
because America's long-term national interest is to stand up for
the values upon which George Washington's country is founded and by
which it still lives.
</P>
<P>
   These values sometimes produce awkward outcomes: it is possible,
for instance, that a Malaysian government led by Anwar Ibrahim, the
former finance minister now being prosecuted for sodomy and
corruption, would be no easier to deal with than Dr. Mahathir's. It
might even be no friendlier to the West.
</P>
<P>
   But if democratic values are not openly defended by the United
States _ and by their other proponents, whether in Asia or anywhere
else _ they will not in the long run triumph, and people everywhere
will be the poorer.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the short run, there will be costs. APEC, for instance,
for all its fragility, is not well served by the studious lack of
mutual criticism most of its members observe: it will not gain
strength through silence.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, more immediate considerations apply. As long as Iraq is
run by a man who is plainly intent on gaining weapons of mass
destruction, whatever his latest promises, the outside world must
do whatever it can to frustrate him.
</P>
<P>
   The means at its disposal are limited: weapons inspections,
sanctions, diplomacy backed by the credible threat of force _ and
support for the opposition, both Arab and Kurdish, albeit without
encouraging foolish ideas about independence for Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   All of these have their risks and drawbacks. None is guaranteed
to work indefinitely. Indeed, imagination may be needed to make
them work better, or at all. A way must be found, for example, to
enable Iraq to pump the oil it is entitled to export, so that it
can buy the food and medicine needed to alleviate the suffering of
its people.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long run, in Iraq as in Malaysia, peace and
prosperity will come only with stable democracy. America is right
to say so. &QL;

for all its fragility, is not well served by the studious lack of
mutual criticism most of its members observe: it will not gain
strength through silence.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, more immediate considerations apply. As long as Iraq is
run by a man who is plainly intent on gaining weapons of mass
destruction, whatever his latest promises, the outside world must
do whatever it can to frustrate him.
</P>
<P>
   The means at its disposal are limited: weapons inspections,
sanctions, diplomacy backed by the credible threat of force _ and
support for the opposition, both Arab and Kurdish, albeit without
encouraging foolish ideas about independence for Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   All of these have their risks and drawbacks. None is guaranteed
to work indefinitely. Indeed, imagination may be needed to make
them work better, or at all. A way must be found, for example, to
enable Iraq to pump the oil it is entitled to export, so that it
can buy the food and medicine needed to alleviate the suffering of
its people.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long run, in Iraq as in Malaysia, peace and
prosperity will come only with stable democracy. America is right
to say so. &QL;

<P>
   For years, people have had Malthusian nightmares about global
population growth. Although, in some countries, too many babies
have put pressure on food distribution, the environment and the
supply of school places and health care, Malthus has mostly turned
out to be bunk.
</P>
<P>
   But his gloomy predictions frightened successive Chinese
Communist leaders into the most outrageous population policy the
world has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to quadruple Chinese living standards per head by
2000, Mao and his successors took the simple expedient of banning
the growth in the number of heads.
</P>
<P>
   But the result will be to exacerbate an entirely new sort of
demographic crisis in the next century, when China will become the
oldest poor country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some of what has happened in China has happened all over eastern
parts of Asia: a phenomenon that Nicholas Eberstadt, an American
demographer, has dubbed ``a world population implosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Far faster than in the industrial world, life expectancy has
risen and fertility has declined. Yet China is aging much faster
than any comparably poor country has ever done before, thanks at
least partly to its one-child policy.
</P>
<P>
   Fertility seems already to have fallen below the level needed to
replace the population. If that doesn't change, more than one in
five Chinese will be 60 or older by 2030, and the absolute size of
its work force will have begun to decline.
</P>
<P>
   If this comes about, unlike most countries China will have grown
old before, rather than after, it has grown rich.
</P>
<P>
   The main consequence will be a big burden on those of working
age. Too many grandparents will need family and financial support;
not enough youngsters will be around to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   Because the family still takes primary responsibility for caring
for the old, middle-aged women will find themselves looking after
several old folk, and unable to work just when they most need to be
building up savings for their own old age.
</P>
<P>
   As for people at work, they will foot the bill for, among other
things, health care and pension schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these demographic trends were to change, China would
still need to reform financial support for the old. A pension is a
luxury enjoyed mainly by China's minority of urban workers in state
jobs; most old folks receive nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the obligation on state firms to support former employees
is one of the biggest barriers to the industrial restructuring that
China desperately needs to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   To disentangle this mess, the government plans to create a
single unified scheme. So far, though, it has merely created a new
sort of mess, with pension obligations fragmented among
municipalities, rather than among firms.
</P>
<P>
   Even more serious is the need to make sure that the money people
are saving for their old age is well invested. The World Bank is
urging the creation of a properly funded scheme.
</P>
<P>
   China's savings rate is more than 40 percent of GDP; as in much
of East Asia, baby-boomers are busily squirrelling away cash to
help them through their twilight years. But in China, where banks
are fragile and the stock market primitive, the pensions pile is a
standing temptation to fraud and waste.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic issue for China, however, is whether the
government should continue to tell women how many children to have.
</P>
<P>
   The one-child policy has already softened at the edges: rural
families are frequently allowed two children, especially if their
firstborn is a girl; and when two only-children marry each other,
they are allowed two babies. But the government continues to
intervene, on a scale unknown anywhere else in the world, in
people's reproductive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese individuals have long had their fertility decisions
interfered with by their extended families, but never before, even
in China, has the state itself decided how many babies millions of
women should have. Undoubtedly, most families would like to decide
for themselves how many children to have.
</P>
<P>
   Given the way fertility has declined throughout East Asia, it
seems unlikely that births would rise dramatically if families were
given plenty of advice, access to contraception and then left to
themselves. But a few more babies would make all the difference to
the lives of China's old folk in a couple of decades from now. &QL;

BENCH BUOYS WAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The element that has long eluded coach Lorenzo
Romar's Pepperdine Waves has suddenly become their greatest
strength. For the first time in Romar's three seasons, the Waves
are as deep as the neighboring Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Bench depth kept the Waves undefeated Thursday night, as the
reserve tandem of Robert Fomby and Marc McDowell sparked a
second-half scoring surge to hold off Fresno State 78-71 at
Firestone Fieldhouse.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell scored 12 of his team-leading 16 points in the second
half, and Fomby scored nine of his 12 points in the period to push
the Waves to a 3-0 record. All the more impressive considering
Pepperdine knocked off a talented Fresno team despite an off night
from Jelani Gardner (10 points).
</P>
<P>
   ``In our three victories, our bench has been phenomenal,'' Romar
said. ``It's so good to replace (starters) with guys that give you
a lift. They don't drop off. And that's one thing we've not had
here for the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem solved.
</P>
<P>
   Five Waves scored in double figures Thursday, with 15 points
from Kelvin Gibbs and 10 from Nick Sheppard. But Gibbs, Gardner and
Sheppard did most of their damage in the first half, when the Waves
took a 39-32 lead, leaving it up to the second-stringers to hold on
the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's just feeding off the other players, off
everybody's intensity,'' Fomby said of his offensive outburst. ``I
wanted to play hard, and that's all I want to do every time I come
out.''
</P>
<P>
   He also did some fancy feeding, dishing to McDowell for a trio
of baskets, including an assist on a 3-pointer that pushed the lead
to a commanding 68-51 with 6:50 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno seemed primed to stay undefeated itself, taking an early
8-0 lead and holding the advantage for the first 13 minutes of the
game. But a 19-11 run by the Waves tied the game at 19 with 7:22
left and the Bulldogs fell back on their heels. They held their
last lead at 30-27 with 4:05 remaining, then watched the Waves
mount a 12-2 run heading into halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno star Courtney Alexander scored a team-high 16 but missed
9 of 15 shots and had six turnovers while a cadre of NBA scouts
looked on. Credit Waves guard Tommie Prince with a nice bit of
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no intensity. None,'' groused Fresno coach Jerry
Tarkanian, whose team fell to 2-1. ``I thought at halftime we'd
come out in the second half and get desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we got behind, we didn't play with intensity,''
Tarkanian added.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Waves) played very well. But we obviously made them
play well.''

   LA PALOMA RANCH, CHARLOTTE, TEXAS _ What makes Texas different?
Not just that Texans think of themselves as bigger and better than
other Americans, though of course they do; not that they live in
boots, wear bolo ties and show other weird sartorial flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   What really counts is that they, and not the federal government,
own the land they walk on.
</P>
<P>
   Given the size of Texas, it is extraordinary that it contains
virtually no public land. Even the most desolate sweeps of desert
are private fiefs protected by the toughest trespassing laws in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Other western states are a checkerboard of federal lands (Nevada
is 86 percent federally owned, Utah 64 percent). Less than 2
percent of Texas _ 2.7 million acres out of 171 million, or 1.1
million out of 69 million hectares _ belongs to the government.
</P>
<P>
   How did Texas come to be so independent? Largely because it was
independent. When the Republic of Texas joined the Union in 1845 as
a sovereign nation, it kept title to its unappropriated land. The
federal government received nothing. This was important to Texans.
Mexican rule had given them a mistrust of distant power.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the carnage of the Alamo, Texans forged a simple mantra:
Texas should always be in the hands of Texans. So it has remained.
</P>
<P>
   Even today the only large tracts of federal land in Texas have
either been bought (military bases) or donated (Big Bend National
Park). The rest is in private hands, from the small to the
extremely large.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, big ranches still gripped the imagination of
Texans. Just to mention the JA, the Four Sixes, the Wagoneer or the
Matador was enough to get them misty-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   Big ranching families had a lustre that was part John Wayne,
part royalty. This is less true today. Suburbanization, the North
American Free-Trade Agreement, the trauma of the 1980s' oil bust, a
growing Latino population and a newly diversified economy have all
loosened ties to the land.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago Texans knew more about the King Ranch than they
did about Michael Dell, the owner of Dell Computer, the richest man
in Texas. Today it is the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Texans are all too aware that even the biggest and most
profitable ranches earn less than any medium-sized Austin software
company.
</P>
<P>
   It is bad manners to ask a Texas rancher the size of his spread.
And, unsurprisingly, reliable statistics on land ownership are hard
to come by. Proposals to lay out who owns what, and how much, are
thrown out of the state legislature as soon as they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're dismissed for what they are,'' says one official at
the Texas Land Office: ``federal, socialist, environmentalist
plots.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the broad brush strokes of landownership are clear.
Cattle-raisers still dominate the land. About 55 percent of Texas _
94 million acres _ is under ranch management, though the huge
ranches that remain are a shadow of their former selves.
</P>
<P>
   The Matador used to have 100 cowboys and 70,000 head of cattle;
now it has only eight cowboys and 7,500 cattle. Fencing and even
branding are contracted out to a new breed of freelance
day-laboring cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Dolph Briscoe, a colorful former governor of Texas and the
largest single landowner in the state (640,000 acres of south
Texas), points out that it used to take 15 cowboys two weeks to
round up his cattle. Now it takes half a day in a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, Briscoe is luckier than most. His children want to
follow in his footsteps. Texan ranchers are getting older: on
average, now, over 55. This does not bode well. Children who have
grown distant from the land are likelier to sell it than to work
hard to pay off inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Old giants such as the XIT, a 3 million-acre spread in the Texas
Panhandle, have long since been broken up. The other big ranches
are getting smaller, and smaller ranches more numerous.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most telling statistic on ranching in Texas is that
70 percent of the state's ranches now run fewer than 50 head of
cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how high Texas may climb,'' ran a recent editorial
in the Dallas Morning News, ``its roots are in the range.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise of a new breed of Texas rancher proves the point. Small
plots of 100 acres or less _ ranchettes _ have become popular with
city slickers. Developers shamelessly entice buyers by tugging at
their heartstrings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Own a piece of Texan history,'' says a brochure for land
parcels on the famous YO Ranch just west of San Antonio. ``Be a
Texan, buy land,'' exclaims another, pointedly playing on the
notion that owning a ranch is a patriotic duty.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, old-timers scoff at ranchettes. They may be big
enough to give a city boy some peace and quiet, they say, but they
are too small to be economically viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ranchette-owners,'' goes one crack, ``are 40-40 types. They
work 40 hours a week in the city and run 40 cattle out on their
land.'' The typical owner, it turns out, is a middle-aged, affluent
professional who was raised in rural Texas and wishes he was still
there.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchettes have pushed up land prices and, with them,
inheritance taxes. This has tempted some old-timers to sell out,
and this year's drought has driven more out of the business.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas ranchers are a tough breed. Most are reluctant to sell
the ranches their forebears worked hard to build. ``Hold on to the
land,'' they say, ``God's not making any more.'' &QL;

<P>
   Yet, since land scarcely pays, giving profit margins of less
than 5 percent on big ranches even in a good year, ranchers are
being pushed into a painful shift in land-management.
</P>
<P>
   It is rather like the steps British aristocrats had to take to
hang on to their stately homes. Ranches, once jealously guarded
private preserves, are now almost obliged to be open to the public
and to market themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters who strayed on to ranch land used to be prosecuted. Now
they are welcomed with open arms _ assuming, that is, that they pay
handsomely. Tourist pursuits such as bird-watching are increasingly
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary King Ranch, once the biggest beef-producing spread
in the world, is now run by businessmen in Houston with a mandate
to earn money for the extended King clan.
</P>
<P>
   They have increased hunting on the 800,000-acre ranch and have
brought out a line of King products (this season, there is talk of
a King Ranch cologne). Cattle are now an afterthought; but profits
on the ranch have risen from $100 million in 1988 to $183 million
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of Faustian pact,'' frets one rancher; ``the more
we open up our land, the less control we'll end up having.''
</P>
<P>
   Big ranches will survive, all right; but most of them, like the
King Ranch, will increasingly become corporate concerns. Ranch
managers will exact further efficiencies and supplement their
income with hunters and bird-watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Ranches which do not measure up, or are closer to the city, will
be broken up into ranchettes. And this tells a greater truth about
the Lone Star state. No matter how intoxicating the myth, the
bottom line is even more important. &QL;

   LA PALOMA RANCH, CHARLOTTE, TEXAS _ What makes Texas different?
Not just that Texans think of themselves as bigger and better than
other Americans, though of course they do; not that they live in
boots, wear bolo ties and show other weird sartorial flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   What really counts is that they, and not the federal government,
own the land they walk on.
</P>
<P>
   Given the size of Texas, it is extraordinary that it contains
virtually no public land. Even the most desolate sweeps of desert
are private fiefs protected by the toughest trespassing laws in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Other western states are a checkerboard of federal lands (Nevada
is 86 percent federally owned, Utah 64 percent). Less than 2
percent of Texas _ 2.7 million acres out of 171 million, or 1.1
million out of 69 million hectares _ belongs to the government.
</P>
<P>
   How did Texas come to be so independent? Largely because it was
independent. When the Republic of Texas joined the Union in 1845 as
a sovereign nation, it kept title to its unappropriated land. The
federal government received nothing. This was important to Texans.
Mexican rule had given them a mistrust of distant power.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the carnage of the Alamo, Texans forged a simple mantra:
Texas should always be in the hands of Texans. So it has remained.
</P>
<P>
   Even today the only large tracts of federal land in Texas have
either been bought (military bases) or donated (Big Bend National
Park). The rest is in private hands, from the small to the
extremely large.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, big ranches still gripped the imagination of
Texans. Just to mention the JA, the Four Sixes, the Wagoneer or the
Matador was enough to get them misty-eyed.
</P>

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Cook County Hospital in Chicago is the inspiration for
the television drama ``ER.'' The real hospital, though lighter on
romance, is every bit as bloodsoaked: Cook County had to treat
nearly 900 gunshot wounds last year.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Daley, Chicago's mayor, would like the gun industry to
begin paying for that care and for the other costs associated with
violence caused by guns.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Chicago and Cook County have therefore filed suit
against 12 gun shops in the Chicago suburbs, 22 gun manufacturers
and four gun distributors.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks $433 million in compensation for gun-related
costs incurred since 1994 by the police, the emergency medical
services, the criminal justice system and the Cook County Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a product-liability case; rather, the suit alleges
that the defendants have created a public nuisance because they
knowingly design, market and distribute guns that will make their
way to Chicago and be used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The city has gathered some compelling evidence. In a three-month
investigation, undercover police officers bought 171 guns from
suburban gun shops while posing as gang members, motorcycle toughs
and soldiers of fortune complete with camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   They were sold the guns even though they said that they lived in
Chicago (where handguns are banned unless they were registered
before 1982), that they planned to use the guns to retaliate
against others, or that they were buying guns for people who did
not have a state firearm-owners identification card, which is
required for gun-ownership in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, when the officers made it clear that they planned
to use the gun for a street killing, a sales assistant recommended
a particular bullet because ``it doesn't go through the target and
hit a little girl on the next block.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that the gun sellers are no different from a
tavern owner who plies a patron with drinks and then helps him to
his car.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-distributors and manufacturers stand accused of
providing the Chicago suburbs with more guns than can be absorbed
by the legal market.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Polsby, a law professor at Northwestern University who is
opposed to gun control, calls the lawsuit ``a novel take on the
theory of public nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   Public-nuisance statutes are designed to provide a legal tool in
cases where an offender does a small amount of harm to many people;
because it costs too much for a large number of plaintiffs to sue
on their own, the government can consolidate the claims and thus
deal with the matter more efficiently. Such laws have long been
used to close polluting factories or take down offensive
billboards.
</P>
<P>
   To win this case, according to Richard Epstein, a professor of
law at the University of Chicago, the city must prove ``a rather
elaborate chain of causation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to argue that the gun dealers are not fastidious
shopkeepers; it is another to prove them responsible for Chicago's
gun carnage. And gun-proponents argue that some guns actually deter
crime, saving taxpayers money.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the action is likely to be a winner, if not
necessarily in court. The suit will hit the gun industry in its
wallet, which is not nearly as fat as that of the tobacco industry:
it is expensive to mount a defense in any legal case, even one that
makes law professors scoff.
</P>
<P>
   It is also good politics for Mayor Daley, who is up for
reelection next year.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's voters have less tolerance for guns than most
Americans. George Ryan, a Republican, was elected governor of
Illinois this month in large part because he claimed to be tougher
on guns than his Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's anti-gun credentials are already rock-solid. In
addition to a ban on handguns, Chicago leads the country in the
number of guns confiscated and destroyed every year.
</P>
<P>
   The new lawsuit is neither a cheap nor a democratic way to deal
with the problem of guns; but Daley hopes, first, that he will win
it, and then that it will ratchet up pressure on the industry and
help him lobby for more stringent gun-control measures at state and
federal level. Soon after announcing the lawsuit, he flew off to
Washington to do just that. &QL;

law at the University of Chicago, the city must prove ``a rather
elaborate chain of causation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to argue that the gun dealers are not fastidious
shopkeepers; it is another to prove them responsible for Chicago's
gun carnage. And gun-proponents argue that some guns actually deter
crime, saving taxpayers money.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the action is likely to be a winner, if not
necessarily in court. The suit will hit the gun industry in its
wallet, which is not nearly as fat as that of the tobacco industry:
it is expensive to mount a defense in any legal case, even one that
makes law professors scoff.
</P>
<P>
   It is also good politics for Mayor Daley, who is up for
reelection next year.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's voters have less tolerance for guns than most
Americans. George Ryan, a Republican, was elected governor of
Illinois this month in large part because he claimed to be tougher
on guns than his Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's anti-gun credentials are already rock-solid. In
addition to a ban on handguns, Chicago leads the country in the
number of guns confiscated and destroyed every year.
</P>
<P>
   The new lawsuit is neither a cheap nor a democratic way to deal
with the problem of guns; but Daley hopes, first, that he will win
it, and then that it will ratchet up pressure on the industry and
help him lobby for more stringent gun-control measures at state and
federal level. Soon after announcing the lawsuit, he flew off to
Washington to do just that. &QL;

 DEVILS TAME HURRICANES IN THEIR 10th VICTORY OF SEASON  
(bl) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In contrast to their previous two games,
when they collapsed in the third period, the New Jersey Devils
rallied for a 3-2 overtime victory over the Carolina Hurricanes on
Thursday night at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Niedermayer of the Devils tied the score with 4 minutes 3
seconds left in regulation, and Jay Pandolfo won the game with 1:27
left in overtime as the Devils became the first team in the
National Hockey League to win 10 games this season. Jason Arnott
scored the first goal for the Devils, who posted their fifth
consecutive victory at home and improved to 10-6-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils won, before a crowd of 14,586, despite playing a
listless game, especially with the man advantage. They came up
empty on eight power plays and allowed chances to the Hurricanes
during those advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't watch the game very much,'' coach Robbie Ftorek said,
``because I was thinking about the way we were playing. My thoughts
were how to fix it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ftorek sat down Patrik Elias for the first time this season
after Elias had gone without a goal in his previous 12 games, and
he benched Brendan Morrison for the second time after he had scored
once in his previous 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Their places were taken by Sasha Lakovic, who is known as a
fighter and who had not played since the fourth game of the season,
and Sergei Brylin, who was scratched in the previous game.
</P>
<P>
   With more muscle than finesse, the Devils pushed the Hurricanes
around near their goalie, Arturs Irbe, and created a number of
turnovers in Carolina's zone. At the same time, the Devils lost
some speed without Elias and Morrison and faced two three-on-one
rushes. But Carolina failed to capitalize on its breakouts against
goalie Martin Brodeur, shooting the puck wide each time.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had the territorial domination for the most part,
outshooting the Hurricanes by 41-20 for the game, but the teams
started the third period tied at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott opened the scoring for the Devils with his third goal of
the season, 6:52 into the game, when he took a pass from Lyle
Odelein in his zone, skated all the way down the right wing and
beat Irbe from the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff O'Neill tied it with his fourth goal of the season, just
over three minutes later, when he converted a rebound of a shot by
Glen Wesley during the Hurricanes' first manpower advantage of the
game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sheppard put the visitors in the lead on Carolina's fourth
manpower advantage. The goal came with 9:04 left, when he leapt on
a loose puck in the slot and beat Brodeur with a rising shot for
his seventh goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer saved the night for the Devils when he scored from
close range by converting his own rebound to force the first
overtime of the season for New Jersey, setting the stage for
Pandolfo's decisive goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not playing well and winning is a good feeling,'' said
Pandolfo, who scored his winner when he stepped in the slot and
beat Irbe after Denis Pederson intentionally pushed the puck
forward during a face-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to come back and win after not playing well,''
Niedermayer said. ``We were out of sync on the power play. We
weren't making the right plays and weren't making good decisions
with the puck.''

CENDANT IS SAID TO READY SALE OF SOFTWARE UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: This story has been added to the dress page of the NYT
busines section)  
(bl) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of its first moves to bail out of some of its troubled
businesses, Cendant Corp. is close to selling its software division
to Vivendi SA, a French utilities group, a person close to the
marketing and franchising company said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The price is $800 million in cash and as much as another $200
million, contingent on the performance of the software division,
this person said. The transaction could be announced as early as
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The once high-flying Cendant, which franchises brands like the
Century 21 and Coldwell Banker real-estate brokerages, Ramada
hotels and Avis car rentals, has been reeling from the revelation
last April of accounting irregularities that had led to vastly
overstated earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Parsippany, N.J., was created at the end
of 1997 by the combination of HFS Inc. a franchiser of hotel,
real-estate and other companies, with CUC International, which ran
shopping clubs and had owned the software companies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the company has said it would sell the
software unit and a small classified advertising company. It also
scrapped plans to buy American Bankers Insurance Co. for $3.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant Software is one of the world's largest makers of
computer games and educational software, including the trivia game
``You Don't Know Jack'' and the ``Math Blaster'' tutorial for
children. It had revenue last year of $433.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``One billion is pretty much in line with what we had
expected,'' said Keith Benjamin, an analyst at BancBoston Robertson
Stephens. Still, he pointed out that $1 billion was far less than
the company had paid for its software businesses. In 1996, CUC
bought Davidson &AMP; Associates and Sierra On-Line, two leading
software companies, for $1.8 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The sale price also is less than the estimates of $1.5 billion
to $2 billion that had circulated just a few weeks ago when the
company announced that five suitors were interested in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for software programs has fallen as users have turned to
entertainment and information available for free on the Internet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They were the best companies in what turned out to be a very
bad business,'' Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   The person close to Cendant said that the company would actually
record a gain of $450 million on the sale, implying that it had
substantially written off the value of the acquisitions earlier. He
also said that the deal was expected to enhance Cendant's per-share
earnings in 1999. The proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce
Cendant's debt and buy back its stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was first reported in The Financial Times on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It still leaves Cendant with the question of the other former
CUC businesses, Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should probably spin out their Internet operations and
sell off the rest of the CUC businesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The software unit will be purchased by Havas SA, a media company
owned by Vivendi that specializes in multimedia properties.
Vivendi, which changed its name this year from Compagnie Generale
des Eaux SA, has said it plans to make a series of acquisitions in
the communications area. Earlier this year, it purchased control of
Anaya, an educational publishing company in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant's accounting problems were discovered in what had been
parts of CUC International, which was merged into HFS Inc. to form
Cendant last December.
</P>
<P>
   When word of the irregularities came out, Cendant's shares
plummeted 41 percent. Subsequent reports that expanded the scope
and duration of the accounting problems drove its stock still lower
in July.
</P>
<P>
   As more details of the accounting problems became public,
Cendant chairman Walter Forbes and eight other executives who had
created CUC resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant's stock continued to slump until a month ago, when the
company's turnaround efforts began to pay off. Third-quarter
operating income exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But it still faces numerous shareholder lawsuits over the
accounting scandal.

<P>
   SHANGHAI _ In their small apartment in a back street of
Shanghai, Zhang Ziqiang and his wife gloomily reflect on their
predicament. He is 47, she 42, and in this richest and most
exhilarating of China's cities, their lives typify those of a
growing number of baby-boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang lost his job last November. He had worked all his life in
a hat factory, pressing caps. The firm was taken over by a bigger
one, the 150 workers laid off and the factory building sold. ``Only
the important people kept their jobs,'' he says sourly.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is in the same boat. The food shop where she served
merged with another in 1992. For a while, she sold bedding on
commission for one of China's new fly-by-night private companies.
Four months ago that, too, came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 60 percent of the people in this street are in the
same position,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhangs are luckier than many. Each receives a small monthly
payment from their former firm: Zhang, instead of earning 600 yuan
($72) a month, now gets 260 yuan, and his wife receives another 140
yuan.
</P>
<P>
   But the payments will not last much longer. So Zhang peddles
rice bowls and chopsticks in the street, while his wife gets up at
3 a.m. to cook rice balls and sell them to the queue at the local
bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   In much of China, skilled workers like the Zhangs are tasting
poverty and insecurity for the first time in a generation. The
baby-boomers are bearing the brunt of economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's economic reform will be at the cost of a whole
generation,'' according to Peng Xizhe, the director of the
Institute of Population Research at Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
   The baby-boomers, and especially those born in the first half of
the 1950s (like Jung Chang of ``Wild Swans'' fame), have already
had more than their fair share of misfortune. They are an unusually
large age-group, the second-biggest in China's history.
</P>
<P>
   Their childhood saw the three-year famine that began in 1958, in
which 30 million Chinese died. As a result, their health is worse
than both younger and older Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   So is their education. Their high-school years coincided with
the cultural revolution, when many urban youngsters were packed off
to the country for a decade. Zhang, for instance, did not finish
high school because he was sent to Yunnan for nine years to plant
crops and cut trees.
</P>
<P>
   Not many baby-boomers managed to resume their education. So this
``most miserable cohort,'' as Peng calls them, is peculiarly
ill-prepared for the economic shock that has now hit the Zhangs and
so many of their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I apply for jobs, I'm either too unqualified or too
old,'' says Zhang's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, at least 5.5 million workers are unemployed
(and therefore drawing no financial support), and more than 10
million are ``laid off,'' a euphemism for unemployment supported by
modest benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Some people reckon that 30 million to 50 million Chinese workers
are unneeded. Meanwhile, about 8 million new people enter the work
force each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhangs' constant nightmare is that the pace of layoffs in
Shanghai will rise, depressing the market for chopsticks and rice
balls and increasing the competition on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Worse lies ahead. Many of the urban baby-boomers, Peng points
out, did not marry until they returned from their enforced rural
exile. The result was a marriage boom in the early 1980s _ just as
the one-child policy was entering its first and most dogmatic
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Today, younger people can often find loopholes that allow them
to have two children. But many baby-boomer couples, whose mediocre
education and interrupted working lives have so reduced their
ability to save, will find themselves in old age with only one
child to support them.
</P>
<P>
   They pose the most intractable aging problem anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is likely to be at its most acute in Shanghai.
There, fertility plummeted in the late 1960s _ almost a decade
before the rest of China _ and one-child families have been
standard since the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy has risen by an astonishing 33 years in a mere
five decades. Since 1993, deaths among the city's official
residents have exceeded births.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for illegal immigrants, who pour into the city and
now account for over one-fifth of Shanghai's people, the population
of Asia's most ebullient city would have been contracting.
</P>
<P>
   But even the flood of immigrants will not prevent Shanghai from
becoming a city of the old within just over a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Peng, who has made a special study of the city's demography,
calculates that in 2025 one-third of the population will be 60 or
over, even if migrants continue to arrive at the present pace. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 825. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Where Shanghai leads, the rest of China will follow. The first
serious consequence of China's aging is the rapid rise in the
number of pensioners supported by the dwindling number of workers
in present and former state enterprises. As layoffs rise, some
companies find themselves with more pensioners than workers.
</P>
<P>
   In a report last year, the World Bank argued that the obligation
to pay pensions was slowing down the desperately needed
restructuring of China's industrial giants.
</P>
<P>
   By 2020, 16 percent of China's population will be 60 or older _
not far short of Japan's 17.3 percent in 1990. In urban areas, the
``dependency ratio'' (a figure that includes children as well as
old folk) may be above 47 percent in 2030, over three times the
1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``China will have a high-income economy's old-age burden with a
middle-income economy's resources for shouldering it,'' comments
the Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Shanghai, the Zhang household's misery is eased a little
by a loan from Mrs. Zhang's niece, a youngster who speaks good
English and works as a tour guide. Little does she know it, but she
may be supporting many more baby-boomers in the course of the next
four decades. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ In their small apartment in a back street of
Shanghai, Zhang Ziqiang and his wife gloomily reflect on their
predicament. He is 47, she 42, and in this richest and most
exhilarating of China's cities, their lives typify those of a
growing number of baby-boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang lost his job last November. He had worked all his life in
a hat factory, pressing caps. The firm was taken over by a bigger
one, the 150 workers laid off and the factory building sold. ``Only
the important people kept their jobs,'' he says sourly.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is in the same boat. The food shop where she served
merged with another in 1992. For a while, she sold bedding on
commission for one of China's new fly-by-night private companies.
Four months ago that, too, came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 60 percent of the people in this street are in the
same position,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhangs are luckier than many. Each receives a small monthly
payment from their former firm: Zhang, instead of earning 600 yuan
($72) a month, now gets 260 yuan, and his wife receives another 140
yuan.
</P>
<P>
   But the payments will not last much longer. So Zhang peddles
rice bowls and chopsticks in the street, while his wife gets up at
3 a.m. to cook rice balls and sell them to the queue at the local
bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   In much of China, skilled workers like the Zhangs are tasting
poverty and insecurity for the first time in a generation. The
baby-boomers are bearing the brunt of economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's economic reform will be at the cost of a whole
generation,'' according to Peng Xizhe, the director of the
Institute of Population Research at Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
   The baby-boomers, and especially those born in the first half of
the 1950s (like Jung Chang of ``Wild Swans'' fame), have already
had more than their fair share of misfortune. They are an unusually
large age-group, the second-biggest in China's history.
</P>
<P>
   Their childhood saw the three-year famine that began in 1958, in
which 30 million Chinese died. As a result, their health is worse
than both younger and older Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   So is their education. Their high-school years coincided with
the cultural revolution, when many urban youngsters were packed off
to the country for a decade. Zhang, for instance, did not finish
high school because he was sent to Yunnan for nine years to plant
crops and cut trees.
</P>
<P>
   Not many baby-boomers managed to resume their education. So this
``most miserable cohort,'' as Peng calls them, is peculiarly
ill-prepared for the economic shock that has now hit the Zhangs and
so many of their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I apply for jobs, I'm either too unqualified or too
old,'' says Zhang's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, at least 5.5 million workers are unemployed
(and therefore drawing no financial support), and more than 10
million are ``laid off,'' a euphemism for unemployment supported by
modest benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Some people reckon that 30 million to 50 million Chinese workers
are unneeded. Meanwhile, about 8 million new people enter the work
force each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhangs' constant nightmare is that the pace of layoffs in
Shanghai will rise, depressing the market for chopsticks and rice
balls and increasing the competition on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Worse lies ahead. Many of the urban baby-boomers, Peng points
out, did not marry until they returned from their enforced rural
exile. The result was a marriage boom in the early 1980s _ just as
the one-child policy was entering its first and most dogmatic
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Today, younger people can often find loopholes that allow them
to have two children. But many baby-boomer couples, whose mediocre
education and interrupted working lives have so reduced their
ability to save, will find themselves in old age with only one
child to support them.
</P>
<P>
   They pose the most intractable aging problem anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is likely to be at its most acute in Shanghai.
There, fertility plummeted in the late 1960s _ almost a decade
before the rest of China _ and one-child families have been
standard since the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy has risen by an astonishing 33 years in a mere
five decades. Since 1993, deaths among the city's official
residents have exceeded births.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for illegal immigrants, who pour into the city and
now account for over one-fifth of Shanghai's people, the population
of Asia's most ebullient city would have been contracting.
</P>
<P>
   But even the flood of immigrants will not prevent Shanghai from
becoming a city of the old within just over a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Peng, who has made a special study of the city's demography,
calculates that in 2025 one-third of the population will be 60 or
over, even if migrants continue to arrive at the present pace. &QL;

<P>
   HONG KONG _ As Microsoft and Intel can attest, dominance is a
dirty word in the technology industry. Yet one giant has escaped
notice.
</P>
<P>
   VTech, Hong Kong's largest electronics firm, has more than 70
percent of a worldwide computer and electronics market worth more
than half a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Why has America's Justice Department not denounced this
shameless monopolist? Perhaps it is because VTech makes kiddie
computers and electronic learning toys. Its products go to pre-teen
children, not yet schooled in the art of antitrust complaints.
</P>
<P>
   VTech sells more computers of one sort or another (14 million
last year) than Dell and IBM combined. The market is growing
healthily, VTech's net profit margins are a very PC-like 10 percent
or so, and the firm will achieve $1 billion in sales next year.
</P>
<P>
   True, a lot of these ``computers'' have keyboard buttons shaped
like animals, go by such names as Little Smart Count 'n' Go Bug,
and sell for less than $30. But others are sophisticated notebooks,
with e-mail and spreadsheets, selling for several hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This makes VTech's dominance all the more surprising. The toy
industry is ruled by American giants such as Hasbro, Mattel and
Fisher-Price, huge marketing machines that control most of the
shelf space at Toys ``R'' Us and other retailers. All of them can
make, and have made, similar electronic learning aids.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Allan Wong, VTech's founder, runs out of fingers as he
counts the big toy firms that have entered his market in the past
15 years. But most soon leave: VTech's chief competitors today are
Team Concepts, another Hong Kong company, and Tiger, a Japanese
firm bought earlier this year by Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   From his offices in a dusty industrial complex near Hong Kong's
border with China, Wong seems genuinely bemused by VTech's
dominance, if not its success.
</P>
<P>
   It did not invent the market _ indeed, Wong got into electronic
educational toys in the early 1980s when Sears asked the former NCR
engineer to come up with something that could compete with Texas
Instruments' ``Speak and Spell,'' the first toy to have a
synthetic-speech chip.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it common in the fickle toy industry for one company to
rule a market segment for long. Only Lego comes close: for all
Barbie's durability, she has always had lots of rivals.
</P>
<P>
   VTech's advertising and marketing is modest by toy-industry
standards _ just 10 percent of sales, about half that of the big
American brands _ and it eschews daytime television, preferring to
advertise in Good Housekeeping magazine and other publications
aimed at parents.
</P>
<P>
   As a result children rarely know its name. It is adults, a far
more demanding audience, who decide whether or not to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason VTech can dominate the business is the troubled
state of toy shops. Video games are taking more of children's time,
attention and money. Because they are bought by adults as well as
children, they are sold in computer and music stores rather than
toy shops.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us has closed 90 stores this year alone, and other
toy retailers are cutting both their shelf space and the number of
different toys and brands they put on those shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas leading products _ mostly produced by the bigger firms _
gain market share, lesser brands tend to be discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies are thus vulnerable to VTech; but is it at
risk from the bigger firms? Probably not. They cannot, by and
large, be bothered to try to grab VTech's market.
</P>
<P>
   The market for ``educational learning aids,'' as such gadgets
are grandly called, is still just 2 percent of the overall toy
industry; and, thanks to VTech and its Asian competitors, margins
are less than half those elsewhere in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the research and development costs are dauntingly
high: making a computer is one thing, but making one with a large
LCD screen, keyboard and a mouse for less than $70 is quite
another. Each must be programmed in as many as a dozen different
languages, with voices and scripts produced by linguists around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Facing such costs, it is easy to see why companies making a
fortune on Toy Story figurines might be only too happy to leave
kiddie computers to VTech.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, too, why VTech, which will never have the marketing
clout of the rich-world giants, is happier using its market as a
launch pad into electronics than into other sorts of toys.
</P>
<P>
   Bankrolled by its toy sales, it has moved into cordless
telephones, and now has half the market in America for
high-frequency models, under its own label and for Lucent and Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Now I've got a Little Smart ABC Playground, daddy, please can I
have a cordless phone? &QL;

shelf space at Toys ``R'' Us and other retailers. All of them can
make, and have made, similar electronic learning aids.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Allan Wong, VTech's founder, runs out of fingers as he
counts the big toy firms that have entered his market in the past
15 years. But most soon leave: VTech's chief competitors today are
Team Concepts, another Hong Kong company, and Tiger, a Japanese
firm bought earlier this year by Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   From his offices in a dusty industrial complex near Hong Kong's
border with China, Wong seems genuinely bemused by VTech's
dominance, if not its success.
</P>
<P>
   It did not invent the market _ indeed, Wong got into electronic
educational toys in the early 1980s when Sears asked the former NCR
engineer to come up with something that could compete with Texas
Instruments' ``Speak and Spell,'' the first toy to have a
synthetic-speech chip.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it common in the fickle toy industry for one company to
rule a market segment for long. Only Lego comes close: for all
Barbie's durability, she has always had lots of rivals.
</P>
<P>
   VTech's advertising and marketing is modest by toy-industry
standards _ just 10 percent of sales, about half that of the big
American brands _ and it eschews daytime television, preferring to
advertise in Good Housekeeping magazine and other publications
aimed at parents.
</P>
<P>
   As a result children rarely know its name. It is adults, a far
more demanding audience, who decide whether or not to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason VTech can dominate the business is the troubled
state of toy shops. Video games are taking more of children's time,
attention and money. Because they are bought by adults as well as
children, they are sold in computer and music stores rather than
toy shops.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us has closed 90 stores this year alone, and other
toy retailers are cutting both their shelf space and the number of
different toys and brands they put on those shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas leading products _ mostly produced by the bigger firms _
gain market share, lesser brands tend to be discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies are thus vulnerable to VTech; but is it at
risk from the bigger firms? Probably not. They cannot, by and
large, be bothered to try to grab VTech's market.
</P>
<P>
   The market for ``educational learning aids,'' as such gadgets
are grandly called, is still just 2 percent of the overall toy
industry; and, thanks to VTech and its Asian competitors, margins
are less than half those elsewhere in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the research and development costs are dauntingly
high: making a computer is one thing, but making one with a large
LCD screen, keyboard and a mouse for less than $70 is quite
another. Each must be programmed in as many as a dozen different
languages, with voices and scripts produced by linguists around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Facing such costs, it is easy to see why companies making a
fortune on Toy Story figurines might be only too happy to leave
kiddie computers to VTech.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, too, why VTech, which will never have the marketing
clout of the rich-world giants, is happier using its market as a
launch pad into electronics than into other sorts of toys.
</P>
<P>
   Bankrolled by its toy sales, it has moved into cordless
telephones, and now has half the market in America for
high-frequency models, under its own label and for Lucent and Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Now I've got a Little Smart ABC Playground, daddy, please can I
have a cordless phone? &QL;

   IMPEACH-CLIFFORD _ It was one of those accidents of timing: two
events, coinciding by chance, each of which throws the other into
relief. At 10 a.m. on Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats began
hearings into possibly impeachable offenses by the president. At
almost the same moment at Washington National Cathedral, a memorial
service began for Clark M. Clifford, friend and adviser to
presidents in a more genteel day. By R.W. Apple Jr. (1400 words)

<P>
   IMPEACH-VOICES (Houston) _ Waiting for a bus in Denver, walking
along the sidewalk in Coral Gables, sipping a glass of wine at a
sidewalk cafe in Houston, sitting at home sick in Brooklyn, the
sentiment was pretty much the same: Enough already. The spectacle
of Kenneth Starr delivering his testimony, alternately bolstered by
Republicans and hectored by Democrats, did not seem to do much to
change the minds of the testimony-weary members of this particular
out-of-focus group. By Rick Lyman.

<P>
   IMPEACH-MEMBERS (Washington) _ It took 60 seconds for civility
to vanish in a whirl of acrimony today as Republicans and Democrats
on the House Judiciary Committee faced President Clinton's accuser
for the first time. ``You are disrupting the continuity of this
meeting with these adversarial ...'' said Rep. Henry J. Hyde, the
committee's chairman, groping for the right word to cap his
sentence. ``We're disrupting a railroad, it seems like, Mr.
Chairman,'' said Rep. Melvin L. Watt, D-N.C. And so it went. By

   ISRAEL-SETTLEMENTS (Psagot, West Bank) _ The signing of the Wye
peace memorandum in Washington last month dropped like a missile of
doom into Israel's political right wing. It shattered alliances,
blurring the political identity of a movement built around
defending the Jewish homeland against territorial compromise. It
expanded the political center, and transformed those who clung to
their right-wing ideology into a kind of fringe. What has emerged
most powerfully is a new pragmatism, which puts the movement's
guiding ideology on the back burner, if not in the waste bin. By
Deborah Sontag.

the family diamonds and pearls. Bereft, the prince and princess
say, they slept with the corpse on a stone slab, he on one side,
she on the other. Then they did the embalming themselves, careful
to keep Her Highness' head on a brocade pillow. The macabre has
befallen the house of Oudh, creating an eerie tale of people

high-desert region known as the Malheur has never had any problem
attracting visitors. Hundreds of thousands of them gather in the
spring and fall along the Pacific Flyway, turning the sagebrush
country of Oregon's Outback into a Serengeti of sorts, with an
astounding collection of wildlife: songbirds, sandhill cranes,
trumpeter swans, pelicans, bufflehead ducks, pronghorn antelopes

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Buying computers at toy shops is old hat. The
novelty this Christmas will be buying your toys at the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Amazon.com has confronted Barnes &AMP; Noble in the book
trade, so an Internet arrival, eToys, is vying with Toys ``R'' Us
to become the toyshop of the web.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in March 1997 with backing from idealab!, a Californian
venture capitalist, eToys launched its web service towards the end
of last year. So this is really the firm's first big Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 7,000 toys from 235 suppliers, eToys has more
items in stock than most bricks-and-mortar toy shops.
Unfortunately, it does not (yet) ship toys abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Toys are not obviously suited to being sold online. After all,
children love to try out the Lego and touch the Barbie dolls. That
is precisely why many parents are delighted to avoid a visit to a
real shop.
</P>
<P>
   At eToys, a search engine finds what you need, such as a toy for
a two-year-old girl who likes the Teletubbies, but is lumbered with
parents unwilling to pay more than $10.
</P>
<P>
   As well as finding birthday presents within a budget, the store
will wrap them and mail them. The web site is more than just a
glorified catalogue, featuring, for example, e-mail birthday
reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research, a high-tech consultancy, estimates that in
2003 about 5 percent of all toys in America will be sold over the
Internet, generating revenue of $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   More books will be sold online, but the toy business will be
more profitable, since margins are higher, averaging 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, Toys ``R'' Us has had its own retail web site.
Although it is like eToys', the site stocks only 5,000 toys.
Whereas eToys pays a fee of 25 percent of any sales garnered from
referrals coming from partner web sites, such as AOL and Yahoo!,
Toys ``R'' Us has no partnership program, which is considered a
must in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us appears to find it hard to reconcile its new site
with its offline presence (even that is not healthy: it announced a
third-quarter loss of $475 million on third-quarter sales of $2.17
billion on Nov. 16). It must also learn how to run a mail-order
business, which, unlike Barnes &AMP; Noble, it has never done.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us may soon perfect its web site. It has a strong
brand, and can use its advertising to promote its Internet address.
It is also integrating its offline and online operations. Consumers
can, for example, return an item bought online at their local Toys
``R'' Us store.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to play for _ including foreign distribution, not
due to start until 1999 _ before eToys becomes the Amazon.com of
the toy world. &QL;

CSUN WATCHES AND WAITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before Cal State Northridge leaves its hotel for Idaho State's
Holt Arena on Saturday, Montana vs. Montana State should be
decided.
</P>
<P>
   It means the 23rd-ranked Matadors should know whether a win
against Idaho State means instant gratification or whether they'll
have to wait until Division I-AA playoff bids are announced Sunday
morning to truly celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Montana State and Montana kick off at noon. CSUN and Idaho State
play at 5:35 p.m. (Pacific).
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll be watching to see how it goes,'' CSUN quarterback
Marcus Brady said Thursday. ``Hopefully, Montana will win.''
</P>
<P>
   To rehash, if Montana State (7-3, 5-2 Big Sky) beats Montana
(7-3, 5-2), the Bobcats earn the Big Sky Conference's automatic bid
to the NCAAs. If Montana and CSUN (7-3, 5-2) win, the Matadors get
the automatic bid. If Montana wins and CSUN loses, the Grizzlies
get the berth. The three are tied atop the Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Montana State wins, CSUN still has an opportunity to
reach the playoffs. Division I-AA gurus insist the Matadors will
get an at-large invitation into the 16-team field with a win
against the 2-8 Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   That's why talk of watching the scoreboard, or Sportsticker on
the hotel television, has been minimal at CSUN this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked about the Montana-Montana State game,'' CSUN
coach Ron Ponciano said. ``We feel it's irrelevant. The bottom line
is that we've got to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Stopping Brady: After watching the game film of CSUN
quarterback Marcus Brady's 466-yard, four-touchdown effort last
week at Southwest Missouri State, Idaho State coach Tom Walsh
figured there was one way to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if he woke up with the flu and had a 104 temperature and
couldn't play the game, then you can stop him,'' Walsh said. ``It's
hard to believe he's a redshirt freshman.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady is 228 for 333 for 2,671 yards, 23 touchdowns and nine
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ponciano gets raise: CSUN's 7-3 mark hasn't gone unnoticed by
the administration. Earlier this week Ponciano was given a 5.5
percent raise from $75,000 to $79,4128. The first-year coach signed
a three-year deal in January.
</P>
<P>
   __ Stadium cleanup: Maybe if the Matadors make the playoffs and
get a home game, then someone will clean up North Campus Stadium.
Papers, cups, food wrappers and old newspapers, remnants of CSUN's
last home game nearly two weeks ago, litter the visitors' side,
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors put in a bid _ a $30,000 guarantee accompanies it _
to host a first-round game if they qualify for the playoffs. Also,
if CSUN gets the home game, ticket prices are set. Seats with backs
are $15, reserved seats $10, general admission $8 and students and
senior citizens $5. Season-ticket holders will have the opportunity
to purchase their regular seats before tickets go on sale to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   __ Paying respects: Ponciano missed about an hour of Thursday's
practice because his flight from Sacramento was delayed. Ponciano
was in his home town of Willows, about 85 miles north of
Sacramento, to attend the funeral of long-time friend and Willows
``community legend'' Herb Carrier, who died Sunday of brain cancer
at the age of 61.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody within three counties of farms knew him,'' Ponciano
said. ``To put a stamp on the world like that is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Scout Bowl: Thursday could have been CSUN's last practice, so
a ``Scout Bowl'' was staged. The spirited contest pitted the
offensive and defensive scout teams, and Ponciano noticed a few
players. They were running backs Greg Morena (San Diego State
transfer) and Alan Taylor, defensive lineman Henry Herr and
linebacker Reid Isaac.

of last year. So this is really the firm's first big Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 7,000 toys from 235 suppliers, eToys has more
items in stock than most bricks-and-mortar toy shops.
Unfortunately, it does not (yet) ship toys abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Toys are not obviously suited to being sold online. After all,
children love to try out the Lego and touch the Barbie dolls. That
is precisely why many parents are delighted to avoid a visit to a
real shop.
</P>
<P>
   At eToys, a search engine finds what you need, such as a toy for
a two-year-old girl who likes the Teletubbies, but is lumbered with
parents unwilling to pay more than $10.
</P>
<P>
   As well as finding birthday presents within a budget, the store
will wrap them and mail them. The web site is more than just a
glorified catalogue, featuring, for example, e-mail birthday
reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research, a high-tech consultancy, estimates that in
2003 about 5 percent of all toys in America will be sold over the
Internet, generating revenue of $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   More books will be sold online, but the toy business will be
more profitable, since margins are higher, averaging 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, Toys ``R'' Us has had its own retail web site.
Although it is like eToys', the site stocks only 5,000 toys.
Whereas eToys pays a fee of 25 percent of any sales garnered from
referrals coming from partner web sites, such as AOL and Yahoo!,
Toys ``R'' Us has no partnership program, which is considered a
must in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us appears to find it hard to reconcile its new site
with its offline presence (even that is not healthy: it announced a
third-quarter loss of $475 million on third-quarter sales of $2.17
billion on Nov. 16). It must also learn how to run a mail-order
business, which, unlike Barnes &AMP; Noble, it has never done.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us may soon perfect its web site. It has a strong
brand, and can use its advertising to promote its Internet address.
It is also integrating its offline and online operations. Consumers
can, for example, return an item bought online at their local Toys
``R'' Us store.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to play for _ including foreign distribution, not
due to start until 1999 _ before eToys becomes the Amazon.com of
the toy world. &QL;

RANGERS DEFEAT KINGS, 5-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took a journey to the opposite corner of the
continent for the Rangers to find a team playing worse than
themselves. That team was the injury-riddled Kings and the Rangers
beat them by 5-1 on Thursday night in the Forum. The result ended a
three-game streak without a victory for New York, and it extended
the Los Angeles losing streak to six games.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksei Kovalev led the Rangers with his first two goals of the
season. Also scoring were Manny Malhotra, Adam Graves and John
MacLean. The Rangers got a strong performance in front of their net
from the backup goalie Dan Cloutier. Two of the goals were scored
on the revived power play, which had gone more than 14 minutes
without a goal the night before in a 3-1 defeat in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will play the third game of their five-game trip on
Saturday night in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The game was marred by an ugly incident late in the third period
when Jeff Beukeboom, the big Ranger defenseman, was knocked
semiconscious by a punch to the head that was thrown from behind by
Matt Johnson of the Kings. Johnson may have been retaliating for an
incident a few minutes before in which Beukeboom tripped Glen
Murray of the Kings with a ``slew-foot'' technique that is often a
cause for suspension. Johnson was ejected from the game with a
match penalty and will be suspended automatically, pending a league
review. Beukeboom was revived and left the ice with help from
medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Under the league's crackdown against slew-footing and blows to
the head this season, it is very likely that Johnson will miss
several games. It is also possible that Beukeboom's unpenalized
trip will be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the game, the Rangers got another scare when Todd
Harvey, one of their best players, left the game after blocking a
shot with his arm. He remained on the ice for a couple of minutes
and then left the playing surface with medical personnel. But the
Rangers announced later that Harvey had only cut his elbow. He
returned in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into Thursday night's game, the Rangers' winning
percentage of .382 was the worst in the Atlantic Division and the
worst in the Eastern Conference. In the 27-team National Hockey
League, their record was worse than all but the Chicago Blackhawks
and Los Angeles, who play in the Western Conference. Even the
expansion Nashville Predators were doing better at .406.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, at .342, had the lowest winning percentage in the
league entering tonight's game. During the season, winning
percentage is the most accurate method of rating teams relative to
each other. Although point totals determine final standings, they
are often misleading during the season when teams have played an
unequal number of games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have reasons for their poor percentage. They played
again without Rob Blake, their captain and star defenseman, who has
not played since Nov. 5 because of a broken right foot. Blake won
the Norris trophy last season as the league's best defenseman. His
recovery is listed as week to week.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles also played without right wing Russ Courtnall, a
former Ranger, who fractured his right ankle when he was struck by
a puck during the Kings' 5-4 loss to San Jose on Wednesday night.
Courtnall will miss four to six weeks, the team said.
</P>
<P>
   Cloutier was making his fifth appearance of the season in goal
for the Rangers on Thursday night. His record was 1-1-1 and his
goals-against average was 2.30. Mike Richter started Wednesday
night's game, a 3-1 defeat in Anaheim that left the Rangers with a
three-game streak without a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's game was Wayne Gretzky's final visit to the
Forum. In this building, he starred for the Kings from 1988 through
1996 before leaving first for St. Louis and then for New York. The
Kings will move next season to a new building in downtown Los
Angeles. Gretzky assisted on Kovalev's second goal late in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my memories there are good,'' Gretzky said of the Forum.
``It was a wonderful time in my life and I really enjoyed playing
there. A lot of great moments, a lot of wonderful times. In a lot
of ways, it's disappointing that the Forum won't be there anymore.
But realistically, it's time to move on. They need a change.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Kings' best season, they lost to Montreal in the 1993
Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the Rangers led by 3-0 after one period and by
4-1 after two. Malhotra scored his fourth goal of the season, a
remarkable total for a player who has appeared in only 12 games and
has played few minutes in most of them. At 3 minutes 35 seconds, he
took a drop pass from Mike Knuble and slapped the puck past Kings
goalie Manny Legace.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev, who has played well in recent games, scored his first
of the season at 6:33, on the power play, when he stood near the
crease and turned in a pass from Niklas Sundstrom. Graves, at even
strength, made it 3-0 at 13:28 by deflecting Harvey's shot. It was
the sixth of the season for Graves, tying him, momentarily, for the
team lead with Harvey and MacLean.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Kings got one back, by Mark Visheau, MacLean gave
the Rangers a 4-1 lead at 11:38, on the power play, by flipping in
a Mathieu Schneider rebound.

VAN GOGH SELF-PORTRAIT SELLS FOR $71.5 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new chapter in auction history unfolded here at
Christie's on Thursday night when a haunting van Gogh self-portrait
from 1889 was sold for $71.5 million, nearly three times its high
estimate. It was the second-highest price for a van Gogh at auction
and the third-highest price for any artwork ever sold at auction.
</P>
<P>
   Right from the start, the evening had the feel of a winner _
quite a reversal from the previous three nights, when buyers were
reserved and prices mixed. The sale began with a dazzling group of
Magrittes from the estate of Harry Torczyner, the artist's lawyer,
many of which brought more than twice their high estimates. And
then bidding fever became contagious.
</P>
<P>
   The sale totaled $166.7 million, far above its high estimate of
$134.3 million. Of the 68 works offered, 59 found buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The depth of the bidding was extraordinary,'' said Franck
Giraud, head of Christie's 19th and 20th-century art departments in
New York. ``Buyers came from every part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The high price for the van Gogh stunned the audience, which
overflowed Christie's Park Avenue salesroom. Seven bidders, on the
phone and in the room, seriously tried to buy it. By the time the
bids reached $50 million, the competition was down to a telephone
bidder and Christopher Hartop, director of specialist departments
at Christie's, who was taking his cues from John Lumley, the head
of the 19th- and 20th-century art for Christie's worldwide. When
Lumley discreetly nodded, Hartop's hand went into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about the still-unidentified buyer started buzzing
as soon as the hammer fell. Was it casino owner Stephen Wynn, who
has been voraciously buying Impressionist, modern and contemporary
pictures for several years? No, members of the audience concurred,
since William Acquavella, the Manhattan dealer who frequently bids
for Wynn, dropped out of the race halfway through.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft mogul Bill Gates was another name bandied about, but
the buyer is more likely to be a European, since Gates would
probably have bid through Patricia Hambrecht, as he did when he
bought the Leonardo Codex for $30.8 million in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   More likely possibilities, experts said, would include Philip
Niarchos, son of shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos, who amassed one
of the most important collections of Impressionist and modern art
in private hands before his death in 1996. Another was Baron Hans
Heinrich von Thyssen-Bornemisza, the Swiss billionaire and
collector.
</P>
<P>
   But the mystery of auctions is what keeps the audience riveted,
as it did Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   What made van Gogh's ``Portrait of an Artist Without His Beard''
so special was that the artist painted it for his mother, Anna
Cornelia Carbentus van Gogh, for her 70th birthday not long before
his suicide in 1890. At the time, van Gogh was ill in St. Remy,
France, and wanted to reassure his mother that he was all right. He
painted himself with chiseled features, a clean-shaven face and an
intense stare.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   The van Gogh was one of 10 paintings being sold by the heirs of
Jacques Koerfer, a German-born collector and former chairman of the
BMW automotive company, who died in 1991. This was the fourth block
of Koerfer property Christie's had sold in the last six years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Five bidders wanted Cezanne's ``Chateau Noir'' (1904), once in
the collection of Lord Kenneth Clark, former director of the
National Gallery in London. The landscape, which Christie's
estimated would bring $5 million to $7 million, sold for $11.5
million to Simon de Pury, the former chairman of Sotheby's in
Europe, who is now a private dealer and art adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular work from the Koerfer collection, Leger's
``Composition (The Typographer),'' a colorful synthetic Cubist
painting from 1917-18 estimated at $5 million to $7 million, went
to Desmond Corcoran, a London dealer, for $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Magrittes from the Torczyner estate were among of
the artist's best-known images, and Torczyner bought them directly
from the artist. ``Personal Values'' (1952), a play on scale
showing an oversized comb standing upright on a bed, a giant match
and a green wine goblet on the floor, an enormous pill and a
shaving brush in a bedroom with sky-patterned walls, was expected
to fetch $2.5 million to $3.5 million. It sold for $7.1 million, a
record for the artist, to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art,
which has aggressively been building its permanent art collection
in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Applause broke out when ``The Fighter's Grave,'' Magritte's
painting of a room-size rose, sold to an unidentified bidder for
$5.7 million, nearly three times its $2 million high estimate.
Several lots later, five bidders tried to buy ``Son of Man''
(1964), a self-portrait in which the artist poses in a bowler hat
with a green apple obscuring his face. Estimated at $2 million to
$3.5 million, it ended up selling for $5.3 million to an
unidentified American collector bidding by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Torczyner, who died in April, also owned Francis Bacon's
``Portrait of George Dyer'' (1967), showing the artist's former
lover with a twisted face and posed sitting cross-legged above a
floral carpet on a pedestal chair. Expected to sell for $1.5
million to $2 million, it went to an unidentified bidder for $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bidding stimulates bidding,'' said James Roundell, a London
dealer. ``People like to see an active salesroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening's biggest casualty was a nude by Modigliani. There
were simply too many Modiglianis on the market this week. On Monday
night, Sotheby's sold two of the artist's wife, Jeanne Hebuterne,
clothed, from the Reader's Digest Collection, for $15.1 million and
$9.9 million. Thursday night's nude, painted around the same time,
was expected to sell for $8 million to $10 million, but nobody was
willing to pay more than $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, experts were amazed at the sale's success, given the
cautionary feeling that pervaded the week's auctions until Thursday
night. ``It's hard to believe the market could absorb so much
art,'' said Barbara Mathes, a Manhattan dealer. ``And at such great
prices.'' &QL;

FRESHMEN PROPEL UCLA PAST SANTA CLARA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The new-era UCLA Bruins Gadzuriced out of the
blocks, Rushed to a first-half lead and, finally, Moisoed to a
season-opening victory over Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   The final score, 89-76, obscured what was a close game until
UCLA's 10-0 surge midway through the second half created a
comfortable margin for the stretch run Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was UCLA's first season-opening victory since 1994, when the
eventual national champions thrashed Cal State Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman forward Jerome Moiso scored 16 points and headed the
late-game charge. But he had help. Freshman forward JaRon Rush
added a team-high 19 points, and rookie center Dan Gadzuric
contributed nine.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA lockout turned Pauley Pavilion into the place to be.
Ex-Bruins Reggie Miller, Don MacLean, Toby Bailey, Tracy Murray and
the Clippers' Michael Olowokandi were among the courtside
observers.
</P>
<P>
   They no doubt left exhausted after watching UCLA coach Steve
Lavin rotate 12 players at a breathtaking rate _ as if he were
trying to erase the memory of last year's Iron Five in a single,
40-minute deluge.
</P>
<P>
   Two exhibition games had given UCLA's rookies a skewed view of
what they would face Thursday night. Both the California West
All-Stars and Taiwan National Team allowed the Bruins to play in
fifth gear, fast-breaking at will, throwing countless alley-oops
and having a playground good time.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with Santa Clara, a team known for its disciplined,
deliberate style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used a football analogy,'' Lavin said. ``I told them not
every team is going to let you score. You've got to be able to play
in the rain at Oregon State, play a move-the-chains game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa Clara takes opportunity (fast) breaks, but if they
aren't there, they grind it out until they get a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's starting lineup was big and young, with four freshmen
(Gadzuric, Moiso, Rush and Matt Barnes) surrounding sophomore point
guard Earl Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric was the most impressive in the opening minutes, scoring
UCLA's first eight points. Rush followed with a 3-pointer, then
Moiso converted back-to-back baskets and the Bruins had a 22-9
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos responded immediately and a pattern was set: For the
remainder of the half, UCLA surged to double-digit leads, only to
watch Santa Clara draw close.
</P>
<P>
   It was an amusing sight. The Bruins scurried about, diving for
every loose ball, rotating players at a frenetic pace, while the
Broncos wasted little effort in making UCLA pay for each lapse.
When Darrell Teat burned Rico Hines for a lay-up, then converted a
miss, the Broncos had pulled within 38-31.
</P>
<P>
   The pace slowed in the second half, then stopped altogether with
13 minutes remaining when Broncos coach Dick Davey and UCLA's
Travis Reed were assessed technical fouls. The exchange ended with
two free throws by Nathan Fast, and UCLA's lead had dwindled to
56-52.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins responded with their best sequence of the game,
combining patient offense with sound defense. Watson hit two free
throws, then Rush tipped in his own miss for a 60-52 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso blocked Justin Holbrook's baseline jumper, and with 11
minutes left Watson found Barnes on a half-court alley-oop pass for
a 64-52 lead. Moiso extended the margin to 14 when he drained a
high, soft turnaround from the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, Moiso connected from the right corner for a
76-61 lead.
</P>

QUILES DOMINATES BUT IS UNIMPRESSIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ricky Quiles, always full of potential but
relatively inactive, didn't have a breakthrough Thursday at the
Country Club in Reseda.
</P>
<P>
   Quiles retained his relatively meaningless WBF super lightweight
title by outpointing tough but marginally talented journeyman
Francisco Mendez over 12 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   However, Quiles (28-2-1, eight KOs) hardly looked like a
contender for a major title. He displayed his solid boxing skills,
but once again his lack of power was evident. Mendez (12-14, seven
KOs) was never fazed by Quiles' punches and continually threw his
own to frustrate the champion.
</P>
<P>
   Quiles landed more solid blows and wore down Mendez to gain the
decision. Quiles was awarded two knockdowns, but Mendez was never
seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   __ In other fights: Cruiserweight Victor Ortiz of Simi Valley
stopped Joaquin Felix at 1:49 of the fourth round; Juan Lazcano won
by TKO over Olegario De Leon at 2:43 of the fourth round of a super
lightweight bout; and Sal Garcia (2-0-2) stopped Santana Baez
(1-9-1) at 1:40 of the second round of a featherweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller had to pull out of a scheduled light heavyweight
bout with contender Chris Johnson because he failed complete
medical testing.

TROJANS KEEP POISE VS. BOISE STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With only eight players in uniform and six in
street clothes, the USC women's basketball team hardly looked like
a team ready to open its season Thursday night. And after trailing
Boise State by two points at halftime, it was apparent that the
Women of Troy's depth would be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   But not enough to actually lose the game.
</P>
<P>
   USC still proved too much for Boise State, pulling away for a
71-54 victory at the Lyon Center.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman guard Tiffany Elmore sparked USC, scoring nine points
in the second half and finishing with 11. Point guard Kristin Clark
added 12 in the second half and finished with a game-high 15 points
and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our conditioning really came through. We're hurting
numbers wise right now,'' USC coach Chris Gobrecht said. ``It's
frustrating. We've just got to hang in there until we're full
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   USC was without point guard Erica Mashia, experiencing knee
problems after missing two years with a hip injury. She might
require knee surgery and is considered day-to-day. Also missing was
forward Carmen Krause (sprained ankle), forward Aimee Copp
(ineligible until Dec. 29) and guard Kiyoko Miller, who had
shoulder surgery and might return in late December.
</P>
<P>
   Two other players, transfers Danielle Golay and Denise Woods,
must redshirt this season.

REIGN REMAINS PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They were everywhere, harassing at one end of the
floor, connecting at the other. The Reign of terror continued
Thursday night as Seattle's American Basketball League team
remained unbeaten with a 61-57 victory over the Columbus Quest.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Starbird became the heroine after nearly starring in a
tragedy. The second-year guard fouled Sonja Tate on a fast-break
layin, producing a 3-point play that pulled Columbus into a 57-57
tie. Ten minutes earlier, Seattle led 53-36.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, this game would have been blown. Thursday night, it
was rescued, first by Starbird and then by Val Whiting.
</P>
<P>
   After being fouled by Shannon Johnson on a 3-point attempt with
33 seconds left, Starbird made two free throws to put the Reign in
front 59-57. Whiting preserved the win by stealing the ball from
Andrea Lloyd and sinking two more free throws with seven seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, Whiting had been shut out in the fourth quarter.
But the Reign center used her active hands to save the Reign. In
the final period, Whiting stole the dribble from Johnson, rejected
Tonya Edwards on a drive, blocked another attempt from Johnson and
snatched the ball from Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was off offensively, so I decided what else can I do but
play defense,'' Whiting said. ``She crossed the ball in front of me
and I took it from her.''
</P>
<P>
   After the final horn, Whiting got hugs from Starbird and Nadine
Malcolm, her sheepish smile replacing the despondent look from a
year ago. This is a different feeling and different team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible,'' Starbird said after scoring 17 points. ``At
no point during the offseason did I think we'd be 4-0.''
</P>
<P>
   The Quest noticed the transformation. As two-time ABL titlists,
they are knowledgable judges, pegging the Reign as a
playoff-caliber team with championship potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the talent and mentality now,'' Lloyd said. ``Having
a winning mentality is crucial. They can compete with any team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely a better team than in the past,'' said
Quest forward Tonya Edwards, limited to 4-for-18 shooting by the
Reign defense.
</P>
<P>
   The only disappointment was the attendance. Just 2,502 fans came
to Mercer Arena to watch the best two teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the nature of the game, we would have hoped for 3,200,''
said Reign general manager Karen Bryant. ``But weekdays are always
going to be a tough draw.''
</P>
<P>
   In its third year, the Reign finally has a team with confidence
and chemistry, ability and attitude. The players fight for loose
balls and hit open shots, creating a combination that is producing
victories.
</P>
<P>
   At 4-0, the team is already more than one-quarter of the way to
last year's victory total of 15.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus arrived without three key players sidelined by knee
injuries. Nonetheless, the Quest was 4-0 when it got here and 4-1
now, stifled by the relentless Reign, which was once but a drizzle
in this town.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a 34-26 halftime lead, the Reign kept firing in the
third quarter, Angela Aycock knocking down back-to-back threes to
pump Seattle's advantage to 53-36.
</P>
<P>
   As quickly as the Reign built the lead, it let it get away. But
since it is this year, the Reign responded and the opponent
collapsed for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played real well down the stretch last year,'' said
Columbus coach Brian Agler. ``You could see they were playing with
a lot more confidence. It's just carried over.''
</P>
<P>
   AGLER AFTERMATH: Agler led Columbus to the first two ABL
championships. If he wins another, it will be his last. Tuesday,
Agler accepted a three-year contract from the WNBA to become coach
and GM of the expansion Minnesota franchise. USA Today reported the
deal to be worth $200,000 a year. He is the first ABL coach to
defect to the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   Buzz around the ABL is that league officials were miffed that
Agler took the WNBA deal before the ABL had a chance to
counteroffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say the ABL resurrected his career,'' said
Bryant. ``He was in trouble at Kansas State and the ABL gave him
new life. On the other hand, you can't hold that against him. He
made the most of his opportunity.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Across a long day and well into the night, Kenneth
Starr fought off Democratic assaults on the conduct of his office
Thursday and repeatedly sought to return attention to what he
described as President Clinton's pattern of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   In a 12-hour day that opened the House impeachment hearings, the
independent counsel testified in a mostly dispassionate monotone
about his four-year investigation that began with Whitewater and
ended with the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats challenged Starr's tactics and his judgment, and
the motives and fairness of the Republicans who control the
committee. But for all that, they seldom actually defended Clinton
directly. Republicans, for their part, praised Starr often and
extravagantly.
</P>
<P>
   Only when he was cross-examined by Clinton's lawyer, David
Kendall, did Starr show signs of irritation or anger. He heatedly
rebuffed Kendall's accusations that Starr's office had leaked grand
jury information about Clinton. Several times during those
exchanges, Starr interjected: ``That's unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 p.m. on Thursday night, the last questioner, David
Schippers, the Republicans' chief investigative counsel, tried to
apply balm to any wounds. ``You have been pilloried and
excoriated,'' he told Starr. He drew snorts and laughter from the
Democrats when he praised the independent counsel's treatment of
Monica Lewinsky. ``I hear laughter from the left,'' Schippers said,
referring to committee Democrats. ``But I often hear laughter from
the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr left the hearing room in the Rayburn Building at 10:20
p.m. The committee then met in executive session until nearly 1
a.m. debating subpoenas for other witnesses. No hearings were set
for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In party-line votes, the committee agreed to take closed-door
depositions from Robert Bennett, Clinton's lawyer in Paula Jones'
sexual-harassment lawsuit; Daniel Gecker, the lawyer for Kathleen
Willey, who testified that Clinton groped her; and Nathan Landow, a
developer and Democratic fund-raiser who counseled Mrs. Willey. The
panel also agreed to summon Bruce Lindsey, the deputy White House
counsel. The depositions will probably not take place until next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's appearance marked the beginning of the public phase of
the nation's third impeachment inquiry into a president, one for
which the public has shown little support in polls.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is working on a tight schedule. Saying he is
mindful of public exhaustion with the Lewinsky case, Rep. Henry
Hyde, the committee chairman, has repeatedly vowed that he will end
the inquiry by the end of the year. And the incoming House speaker,
Bob Livingston, has also indicated that he would like impeachment
proceedings to be concluded before the new Congress takes office in
January.
</P>
<P>
   If the committee votes to recommend articles of impeachment
against Clinton, the matter then goes to the full House for an
impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   From the very first moments that the committee went into
session, the party divide was evident. The Republican-controlled
committee rejected an effort by Democrats to give the president's
lawyers two hours to question Starr, who had been granted two hours
to deliver his opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting strategies of the two parties _ reflected time
and again during the day _ were underscored almost immediately.
``Do we still have a government of laws and not of men?'' asked
Hyde as he opened the hearing. ``Does the law apply to some people
with force and ferocity while the powerful are immune? Do we have
one set of laws for the officer and another for the enlisted?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., the ranking Democrat, sought to put Starr
on trial, accusing him of crossing the ``line into obsession'' in
his investigation of Clinton. ``The idea of a federally paid sex
policeman spending millions of dollars to trap an unfaithful
spouse, or to police civil litigation, would have been unthinkable
prior to the Starr investigation,'' the Michigan Democrat said.
``Let there be no mistake; it is now acceptable in America to
investigate a person's private sexual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Starr had not shed any new light on his
investigation after the morning session. ``He offered no new
evidence, no new information, and no new explanations for his
tactics,'' said Gregory Craig, a White House special counsel who
sat at a separate table in the hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his wife were out of the country as the Judiciary
Committee held the first impeachment hearing against a president
since the Watergate inquiry of Richard M. Nixon 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hoped that Starr would refocus the public on the
charges against Clinton and forcefully make the case for
impeachment, and Schippers helped Starr recap those points at the
hearing's end. But for much of the day, Democrats turned the
session into a trial of the prosecutor, not of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr described himself as a fervent believer in the law and
said his legal team only wanted to ``do our duties as honorable
prosecutors.'' He spoke for hours in a patient voice that had
rarely been heard in public, replying at length to questions
ranging from details of the Lewinsky matter to how the
investigation had changed his personal life. He said he would
``stand behind each word'' of his report to the House charging
Clinton with 11 possibly impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a man of politics,'' Starr told the 37 members of the
House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he described himself as a man with ``unyielding faith
in our court system _ our system of judicial review, the
independence of our judges, our jury system, the integrity of the
oath and the sanctity, yes, the sanctity of the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr sought to dispel the argument that his case against
Clinton concerned the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
and not whether he lied under oath in the sexual harassment case
brought by Paula Corbin Jones and then before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual harassment cases are often he said-she said disputes,''
Starr said. ``Evidence reflecting the behavior of both parties can
be critical _ including the defendant's relationships with other
employees in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Such questions can be uncomfortable, but they occur every day
in courts and law offices across the country. Individuals in these
cases take an oath to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth. And no one is entitled to lie under oath simply
because he or she does not like the questions or because he
believes the case is frivolous or that it is financially motivated
or that it is politically motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also noted that it was not his office, but the House, that
decided to make public his report with all its lurid details.
</P>
<P>
   Once Starr faced his questioners, the tone changed and the
subjects shifted so that he was soon defending the conduct of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, the Democrats' senior investigative counsel,
questioned Starr about his ties to lawyers associated with Mrs.
Jones and about his office's early contacts with both Ms. Lewinsky
and with Linda Tripp, the woman who set off the investigation by
bringing prosecutors tape-recordings of her conversations with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell contrasted Starr's detailed report with that of the
Watergate prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, who had presented Congress
with facts but no conclusions. Starr replied that he was the first
to submit a presidential impeachment report under the independent
counsel statute, and he believed the statute required him to make
judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tool,'' he said of his report. ``This is only a tool
for you to use as you see fit. But I don't think it's fair to
criticize my office for not following a pattern that was not
governed by a statute.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most spirited exchanges with Lowell came over the
efforts by Starr's deputies the January day when they first
confronted Ms. Lewinsky to keep her from contacting a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Using Starr's own words for describing the president's evasions,
Lowell asked whether Starr had presented a ``distorted picture of
the facts'' in a press release from his office saying Ms. Lewinsky
consented to a meeting with FBI agents last January.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, Lowell said the statement did
not note that the young woman was scared and crying and that when
she asked to see her lawyer she was told, ``she would not be able
to help herself with her attorney there.'' She was, he said,
``threatened with going to jail for, quote, 27 years.'' And when
she asked to call her mother, Jackie Bennett, a Starr deputy said,
``You're 24. You're smart. You're old enough. You don't need to
call your mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't in your statement to the press that day, was it?''
asked Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing laughter, Starr said ``No, it wasn't, Mr. Lowell, and
let me explain what press statements are designed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point he said, ``Surely you don't think that a
witness is going to say, `Thank you, law enforcement, for finding
out that I'm in the middle of committing a felony.'''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said his attorneys were leery of having Ms. Lewinsky reach
out to her lawyer, Francis Carter, because they thought he had
assisted her in drafting a false affidavit. Starr's investigators
offered to help her seek a Legal Aid attorney, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, under withering questioning from
Democrats, Starr seemed more defensive about allegations that his
investigators had threatened one witness, Julie Hiatt Steele _ who
has contested Kathleen Willey's account of a sexual advance from
the president _ and said they would examine the legality of her
daughter's adoption.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he said he would answer a written question. At
another point he said that if Ms. Steele had a complaint it could
be resolved in court.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also called it a ``misjudgment'' that one of his
investigators in Arkansas had gone to a high school to subpoena the
16-year-old son of a Whitewater defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the long day, Republicans rose to the defense of
Starr. ``What we are seeing here is a desperate attempt to get away
from the facts of the case against the president,'' said Rep.
Charles Canaday, R-Fla. ``Now I understand that because I find that
the facts are particularly compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Several voiced their sympathy for Starr. ``I commend you for
standing up to the nonsense,'' said Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats showed no such sympathy. Rep. Barney Frank of
Massachusetts asked the independent counsel why he had not told the
public before the November election that he had found no evidence
of impeachable offenses in his other inquiries, which ranged from
the dismissal of White House Travel Office employees to the
Whitewater real estate deal in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said his legal mandate was only to report on evidence of
potentially impeachable offenses. ``In other words, you don't have
anything to say unless you have something bad to say,'' Frank
retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Inglis, R-S.C., gave Starr the opportunity to
emphasize that he considered perjury an impeachable offense, no
matter what the underlying matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what the underlying subject matter is,''
said Starr. ``Once you're in court, under oath, you tell the truth.
That's the way judges look at the world, and perhaps that's why no
judge being subjected to impeachment for perjury, has dared suggest
'Don't worry about it. It's not an impeachable offense.' It is.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also said that Clinton could be prosecuted for perjury
once he left office.
</P>
<P>
   Very few members of the committee asked Starr about any of the
actual facts of his case or dwelt on the contradictory witness
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., questioned Starr's charges of
obstruction of Justice. He noted that the White House had been
trying to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job for more than a year _ not
just after she was called to appear in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr said his office had concluded that there had been a
``stepping up of the efforts to get her a job, especially once the
witness list was issued.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once did Starr seem weary of his role, when Rep. Mary Bono,
R-Calif., asked him sympathetically about the toll his job was
taking. ``I would love to be back in private life,'' he said.

FACTS WILL FURTHER TAINT BUT NOT TOPPLE CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For much of Thursday, it was buried below a
blizzard of procedural spats, made-for-television speeches and
relentless Democratic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But during 12 grueling hours of testimony, independent counsel
Kenneth Starr, in a soft and plodding monotone, outlined a
devastating case against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The sound bites that emerged from the ornate hearing displayed
snarling lawmakers scoring points by attacking the independent
counsel and, at times, each other.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony that is more likely to make an impression on the
annals of history, however, will be Starr's description of the
president as a habitual liar who systematically chose deception
over honesty in an attempt to save himself from legal jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's allegations _ even if all are proved true _ may fall far
short of the standard for impeachment. That is a judgment of the
overwhelming majority of Americans, and, barring the introduction
of stunning new evidence, it appears to be the conclusion of the
majority in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Starr's appearance was a failure. Clinton's
popularity has soared since Starr began his inquiry into Clinton's
sex life. Nothing that was said Thursday is likely to change that.
Eight networks broke into programming to cover the impeachment
inquiry, but the American public long ago tuned it out.
</P>
<P>
   Long, drawn out, and at times so dull that people in the hearing
room could be seen dozing off, Starr nonetheless may have
accomplished as much as he could have hoped for _ showing himself
as something besides the obsessed, overzealous inquisitor, as his
critics have portrayed him.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were merciless in their attacks. Rep. John Conyers of
Michigan labeled Starr a ``federally paid sex policeman,'' while
Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts called him an ``expert on unfair
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet not a single Democrat disputed his many allegations against
Clinton, allowing Starr to make his strongest, most concise case to
date against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Minus the crude references to stained dresses, oral sex and
cigars that colored his original 450-page report to Congress, Starr
delivered a far more sympathetic view of his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was never ``the propriety of the relationship''
between Clinton and Lewinsky, he said. Instead, it ``is about
obstruction of justice, lying under oath, tampering with witnesses
and misuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On at least six different occasions from Dec. 17, 1997,
through Aug. 17, 1998, the president had to make a decision,''
Starr said. ``He could choose truth, or he could choose deception.
On all six occasions, the president chose deception.''
</P>
<P>
   The criminal behavior began long after Clinton had ended his
relationship with Lewinsky, Starr testified. It started after
Clinton learned that Lewinsky was on a witness list to testify in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said Clinton called Lewinsky at her home at 2 a.m. to
discuss their stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president could have told Ms. Lewinsky that they must tell
the truth under oath. The president could have explained that they
might face embarrassment, but that, as a citizen and as the
president, he could not lie under oath, and he could not sit by
while Monica did so.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Starr continued, ``the president did not say anything like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, Starr said Clinton coached Lewinsky to continue
their lie, marking a ``critical turning point'' in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment, the president's intimate relationship with a
subordinate employee was transformed . . . into an unlawful effort
to thwart the judicial process. This was no longer an issue of
private conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, who has interviewed at least 118 witnesses,
taken more than eight months and spent at least $6 million
investigating the Lewinsky matter alone, cited numerous other
occasions of presidential deception, including Clinton's sworn
testimony in the Jones civil case and before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   While most Americans have accepted the dishonesty as an effort
to protect his family and avoid embarrassment, Starr portrayed
Clinton as a defendant trying to manipulate the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence suggests that the eight months included false
statements under oath, false statements to the American people,
false statements to the president's Cabinet and his aides, witness
tampering, obstruction of justice and the use of presidential
authority and power in an effort to conceal the truth of the
relationship and to delay the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the depth of the wrongdoing, Starr used the
analogy of a hypothetical Supreme Court nominee who is accused of
sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, Starr asked the committee, that several women other
than the accuser are called to testify, and ``suppose that the
nominee then confers with one of those women ahead of time, and
they agree that they will both lie to the Senate Judiciary
Committee about their relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Assume, he added, they both do lie under oath about their
relationship and then lie to a grand jury about it. The committee
members would be outraged, he suggested, as they should be now.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Democrats ignored Starr's presentation. The
most direct response came nearly 10 hours into the proceeding, when
David Kendall, Clinton's attorney, declared: ``Nothing in this
overkill of an investigation amounts to justification for
impeachment of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attorney, however, like the Democrats on the
committee, did not dispute the facts, which at this point are
unlikely to topple the president but are certain to represent an
unpleasant chapter of his legacy.

HISTORY STARTING WITH JFK HAS TAUGHT US REALISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a strange, jarring journey it's been. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what we have learned about ourselves since John F. Kennedy's
assassination on Nov. 22, 1963, in Dallas? A little more, I think,
than we've learned about who killed the president and why. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we know what the Brahminic Warren Commission pronounced with
false certainty: Lee Harvey Oswald, odd _ and soon dead _ loner,
did it alone. And we know what the huge conspiracy industry says:
It was Castro or organized crime or some darkly Oliver Stoned part
of the government itself or. . . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But many of us still doubt all those explanations. And new
information continues to feed our doubts. Just this month, for
instance, the National Archives released another 400,000 pages
(imagine that) of internal assassination records. Those documents
revealed perplexing evidence that the doctors who conducted the
autopsy on JFK's brain may have performed two examinations of two
different brains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So 35 years after we froze at the horrifying news (I was in a
college physics class), many of us who lived through it _ and
Vietnam and Watergate and Iran-Contra and Monica Lewinsky and on
and on _ now view the world in very different ways (partly because
we now also know of JFK's own sexual sins). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some grieve over our so-called lost innocence. Not me. I say
innocence is no friend in this rough world. I say the boundless
idealism associated with the Kennedy presidency did us more harm
than good. (Did we not think we could eliminate poverty? Did we not
imagine we were right and would win in Vietnam?) I say the clarity
that comes from a realistic assessment of life better suits us both
for survival and _ to use an out-of-date concept _ for goodness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We seem to praise idealism blindly, almost mindlessly. We look
to the glossy hopes of youth and wish our own were as pure and
holy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I would never dream of suggesting that young people shouldn't
have idealistic dreams. (That's what youth is for.) But those of us
who are adults, while never losing our vision of a better world,
should know there are assassins loose as well as terrorists,
criminals and greedy plutocrats who wish us harm. How can we
protect ourselves from them if we imagine that there is no evil in
the human soul? This ancient word from the prophet Jeremiah (17:9
in the New International Version) should guide our thinking: ``The
heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can
understand it?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to imply we have no capacity for good. Indeed, the
world is full of impressive examples of prodigal charity. Each of
us can name modern saints and heroines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But we inhale the false atmosphere of charming gullibility if we
imagine that the best among us are incapable of deceit or that the
worst just need a hug. We don't want to foreclose the hope of
redemption for anyone, but neither do we do ourselves any favors by
attributing to humankind a beneficence that our tawdry, bloody
history doesn't warrant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And what a 35-year history. JFK, dead and gone. Martin Luther
King Jr., dead and gone. Robert F. Kennedy, dead and gone. Matthew
Shepard, dead and gone. George Wallace, shot. Ronald Reagan, shot.
Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, John Lennon, dead and
gone. Thousands with AIDS, dead and gone. Millions of Cambodians,
Rwandans, Bosnians, dead and gone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 20th century has been a screaming indictment of the
boneheaded Enlightenment idea of human perfectibility. But 35 years
after Dealey Plaza, we know more clearly our capacity for
individual and collective evil. And that should give us more
reasonable expectations about the goodness we need if we are to
live together _ if not in peace, then at least in a cease-fire. &QL;

SO FAR, CHEMISTRY CLASS HARD FOR STARS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Truth be told, Brett Hull wants more ice time.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, so does Sergei Zubov and Pat Verbeek and Joe
Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you asked, every single player on the team would
want to be out there more,'' defenseman Craig Ludwig said. ``But we
all know we have to do what's best for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding that chemistry has been part of the challenge for this
season's Stars and part of the reason they can be shut out by
Phoenix one night then come back to rout defending champion Detroit
and Boston in back-to-back road games later that week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected to have to deal with change; we're a different
team,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``This is a new season and
we have new elements in our locker room. We have players at
different stages of their careers with different individual needs.
Chemistry isn't something that's instant, it's developing all the
time. And we're in that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite having one of the best records in the league (9-3-2),
the drive to a much-anticipated Stanley Cup has featured a few
bumps already:
In the locker room ``There's no possible way Brett Hull can do
anything in 11 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull's comment concerning his ice time after he played 11
minutes, 55 seconds in a 4-3 victory Nov. 7 against the Los Angeles
Kings, became the most publicized controversy so far this season.
However, almost every person involved in the organization said
Hull's comment was blown out of proportion by the media. He has
been trying to put to rest any thought he is unhappy since joining
the Stars as a free agent in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having the time of my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hull played 10 seasons with the St. Louis Blues and was not only
the center of the team, but at times the center of the entire city.
With the Stars, his ice time has decreased from an average of 20 to
17 minutes a game. But that follows a Stars' trend. Nieuwendyk and
Verbeek also saw their ice time decrease after coming to the Stars'
balanced system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each guy thinks differently, but it's up to each guy to put
aside personal goals to achieve what we as a group want to
achieve,'' Verbeek said. ``That's how you get group chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull said the emotional change was more than he thought it would
be, but Hitchcock said the ice-time incident might actually be good
for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe the one benefit from this thing is it's made a
lot of people feel more comfortable with Hully,'' Hitchcock said.
The coach and his team After Hull's comment, Hitchcock said the
severity was blown out of proportion, but then added: ``This is a
really good lesson for Brett Hull. He allowed himself to get going
there, and you can't do that. I don't know what he did before, but
you don't do that here.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, when asked about Mike Modano's nine-game goal
drought, Hitchcock said the center's lack of intensity in the
gritty areas was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   While Modano agreed his game was below par, he added it is hard
sometimes dealing with public criticism _ even if it is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it publicly and personally,'' Modano said. ``Its OK for
the coach to do it, and yet it's not OK for the player, that's
hard. I guess that's part of the business that we just have to deal
with.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the players are beginning to buy into ``Hitchspeak.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Modano responded to a question with this
Hitchcockian phrase: ``You can skate as hard as you want, but if
you're not skating with purpose, it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ludwig said, the players believe one thing _ ``When we play
the way he wants us to play, we win a lot of games.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ice In the Stars' first seven games, they won on the
strength of their power play. Afterward, they struggled with the
power play and scoring, which is at 2.6 goals per game. In a 4-0
loss at San Jose and a 2-0 home loss against Phoenix, the Stars had
mental lapses offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt as a team we were playing the score and I felt as a
team we weren't ready to go the distance in games _ meaning to do
whatever it took in tough situations,'' Hitchcock said ``Getting
beat by a good goaltender, you can use that excuse every night. We
can't allow the mind-set in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock did allow one excuse for inconsistency _ the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Already the Stars have had two stretches of five days off. In
addition, they played seven of their first nine games at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an older team, I don't think this extended time between
games has helped us. I don't think we've gotten into a rhythm
yet,'' Hitchcock said. ``Once we get our emotional level up again
we'll be able to perform at a pretty high level for an extended
period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars play 20 games in the next 42 days. So they should get
every chance to build chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously haven't played near as well as we can,''
Nieuwendyk said. ``But we're also in the second month of the
season. We should get better every month along the way.''

RIVALRY WEEKEND HAS EXTRA MEANING FOR KENTUCKY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bobby Bowden wishes he could be a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't coaching the dadgum Florida-Florida State game, I
could look around and get excited about all those big games,'' the
Florida State coach said. ``What would be exciting to me would be
for everybody else to lose and us win.''
</P>
<P>
   The third Saturday in November is Rivalry Day in college
football. Tomorrow, some of the traditional games include added
burdens of various weights. Kentucky-Tennessee, Southern
California-UCLA, Kansas State-Missouri and Florida-Florida State
are rivalry games of national significance.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers survived Arkansas' upset bid last week, their
first as the top team in the Bowl Championship Series rankings.
Kentucky visits tomorrow, and quarterback Tim Couch has a tragic
incentive.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday morning, Wildcats center Jason Watts wrecked his
pickup on the way to hunt deer. Artie Steinmetz, a redshirt
defensive tackle, and Eastern Kentucky University student Scott
Brock were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Brock and Couch were best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a football player, you think you've been through a lot
of tough things, losing games in the last seconds, taking big
hits,'' Couch said through sobs earlier this week. ``You think
you're a tough person until you have to deal with going in and
seeing your best friend's parents after he's just passed away.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock convinced Couch to choose Kentucky instead of Tennessee.
Couch admits that thinking about playing a crucial football game _
any football game _ seems insignificant, but that he'll have a
special incentive against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott would want me to beat Tennessee more than anything,''
said Couch, who passed for 476 yards and two touchdowns against the
Volunteers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Watts was charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter
Wednesday after tests indicated he had a blood-alcohol level of
0.15; in Kentucky, a driver is presumed intoxicated at 0.10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know how the guys are going to react,'' said
Kentucky coach Hal Mumme, whose players attended funerals for
Steinmetz and Brock on Thursday. ``We had a great practice Tuesday.
What I'm most worried about is I don't know if we'll be emotionally
charged or emotionally drained on Saturday. We won't know until
then.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the other big games withers when compared to
the grief Kentucky has faced this week.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rose Bowl, UCLA will try to extend its 19-game winning
streak by beating Southern Cal for the eighth consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still incomprehensible to me that we've lost seven
straight years. Just shocking,'' Trojans coach Paul Hackett said.
``Nothing is more important than beating UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks ago, Hackett said Oregon had the best team in the
Pacific-10 Conference. That comment came after UCLA had defeated
Oregon in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody says something like that, you store it in the
back of your mind,'' UCLA tight end Mike Grieb said. Added UCLA
cornerback Ryan Roques: ``We remember those words. We don't like it
when other people tell us we're not good enough to do that or good
enough to beat this team.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is No. 2 behind Tennessee in the Bowl Championship Series
rankings. Kansas State is No. 3 and hopes it continues to gain
ground with a victory in Columbia, Mo. However, the Wildcats are
coming off the biggest victory in school history, last week's 40-30
defeat of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say ``let down?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some concerns in that regard,'' Wildcats coach Bill
Snyder said. ``I've been proud of our players. They rise to the
occasion. They handle things really well. I'd like to think we
would handle this quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's three losses have come to ranked teams (Ohio State,
Nebraska and Texas A&AMP;M) and all of those games were decided in the
second half. The Tigers are tired of coming close. They haven't
beaten a top-10 team since 1981 and are 5-56 against Associated
Press Top 25 teams since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could win one game all season it would be K-State,''
Missouri defensive lineman Justin Wyatt said. ``That's just a team
you want to beat more than anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tallahassee, Florida plays Florida State. The Gators are No.
4 in the bowl-series rankings; the Seminoles are No. 5. Both teams
have one loss. The team that wins knows what else needs to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're thinking about is trying to beat FSU so that we're
in position if some of those teams lose down the stretch,'' Florida
coach Steve Spurrier said. ``Those three undefeated teams
\RTennessee, UCLA and Kansas State\S just seem to be barely getting
by every week. They have to win them all. We have to win this one
and wait and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Florida-Florida State series is savory. In 1996,
Florida State won at home, only to wind up playing the Gators again
in the Sugar Bowl with the national title at stake. Last season,
the Gators ended the Seminoles' national-championship hopes when
Spurrier alternated QBs Doug Johnson and Noah Brindise.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, Florida State will be using inexperienced quarterback
Marcus Outzen in place of injured starter Chris Weinke. Johnson,
who lost the Florida job earlier in the season, has returned as the
starter and has passed for 1,118 yards and 10 touchdowns in his
past three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a darn big game,'' Bowden said. ``For our boosters and
alumni, it's their No. 1 game. Therefore, we have to make it that
way if we don't like heat. Because we know we're going to get heat
if we lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame; it takes some of the fun out of it.''

WARREN MOON: ONE FOR THE AGED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To a growing cast of thirty-something NFL quarterbacks, Warren
Moon is something of a father figure.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway, 38, and Dan Marino and Steve Young, both 37, are
future Hall of Famers. Bubby Brister, Elway's 36-year-old stand-in,
and Vinny Testaverde and Randall Cunningham, both 35, are having
exceptional seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in 44-year-old Steve DeBerg, Atlanta's backup, and the old
guard represents one side of a widening rift in the NFL. While
experienced middle-aged quarterbacks are enjoying career
revitalizations, the league's young quarterbacks are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is exactly right,'' Cowboys quarterback coach Buddy Geis
said. ``You've got some guys that have been in the league 14-15
years. But there aren't many guys with that five, six, seven years
in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   No NFL starter has more experience than Moon, who turned 42 on
Wednesday. His resume includes 15 NFL seasons, six years in the
Canadian Football League and a Pro Bowl trip last season that
provided leverage in his contract holdout during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kept himself in great physical condition. Sometimes it's
just a freak of nature at that age,'' Seattle Seahawks coach Dennis
Erickson said. ``Physically, he is able to do those things and
obviously the mental aspect, because of the years he's played, also
helps him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing. It doesn't happen too many times in the NFL that
a guy at that age can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon's season hasn't been the Pro Bowl-caliber of last year, but
he has been a benchmark of consistency. He has started nine games
for the 5-5 Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much age as it is experience,'' Moon said. ``These
guys just don't have any experience in the league. They don't
really know their own team and their offense as well as you need to
and then you have to go against defenses and teams that you have
never seen before except on film.
</P>
<P>
   ``... You look at Troy Aikman or any of these guys that were
first-round picks and they don't come into the league and set it on
fire. It takes a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman remembers his first year as the Cowboys' starter, a 1-15
season. Only Miami's Dan Marino made a better start, earning a Pro
Bowl berth as a rookie, while playing on a talented, veteran team.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Bradshaw threw 24 interceptions as a rookie. John Elway
found the bench in his first game. Even Joe Montana learned by
watching DeBerg.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, at the quarterback position in particular,
experience helps,'' said Aikman, who turns 32 tomorrow and will
face Moon and the Seahawks on Sunday at Texas Stadium. ``You look
at the two rookies, Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf, they've
struggled. We all struggled when we first got here. It takes a few
years to figure out what is going on in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time a lot of guys figure it out, their bodies are too
old.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little argument today's young quarterbacks harbor
incredible talent. The concern is of flaming out before they can
reach the level of Marino, Elway, Aikman and Moon because they are
forced into starting roles too soon. Multi-million dollar contracts
are partly to blame, said former Cowboys quarterback Babe
Laufenberg, who learned behind a couple of pretty good
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pay $70 million and you don't put him on the bench and let
him develop on the bench,'' Laufenberg said. ``It's almost
impossible to play as a rookie. You have to have so much go right
for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarterback has to be the guy in the foxhole that when the
grenade comes he has to be the one to dive on it, not be the first
one out of the foxhole.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, coaches would like rookie quarterbacks to learn the
game from the sidelines for two or three years. The Oilers drew
criticism when they held back Steve McNair early in his career. Now
they are watching him blossom. But for high-profile, high-dollar
rookies forced into the fire like Leaf and Manning, their future is
unpredictable. It could be as perpetual as Moon's, or as fleeting
as that of Heath Shuler, the third overall pick in the 1994 draft
and Manning's predecessor at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would like to give them time,'' Geis said. ``But they have
to be ``the'' guy, instead of watching someone else perform and
say, `OK, I know what they're trying to do.'''
</P>

HISTORIC GIRLS WRESTLING MEET IN TEXAS DECIDED IN FINAL MATCH
</HEADLINE>
 SCHOOLS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DON EMMONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON _ The outcome of a historic moment in high school
wrestling in the state of Texas came down to the final match of the
night between two friendly foes.
</P>
<P>
   With a sizable crowd in attendance at Arlington High School on
Thursday night for what is considered the first official high
school girls wrestling dual meet in Texas, Arlington heavyweight
Kara Armstrong and Sam Houston heavyweight Sandra Kitchens were
left to decide which school would record the first girls dual meet
victory in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   With Arlington and Sam Houston tied, 30-30, Armstrong and
Kitchens pushed and tugged each other around before Kitchens threw
Armstrong down to the mat and rolled her over for a fall _ one
minute into the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Once the official signaled Kitchens had recorded a
crowd-stirring pin, her teammates and coaches jumped out of their
seats positioned next to the mat and started celebrating a 36-30
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens' victory put Sam Houston in the record books.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great,'' said Kitchens, a sophomore, who admitted
being nervous before tangling with Armstrong. ``My coach told me
that it would all come down to the final match and it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to put her in a headlock and throw her down. That's
what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Houston coach Nick Purler was pleased with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of highs and lows until the last match,'' Purler
said. ``Right before (Kitchens') match, I could see the calmness
come over her face and I knew she would win.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who also admitted coping with nervousness, had to jog
for 45 minutes prior to the dual meet in order to lose 3.5 pounds
to meet weight requirements of 215 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's arms still shook frantically while congratulating
Kitchens on her victory several minutes after the decisive
encounter between two friends who first met as freshmen on a mat
last year. Kitchens, a state runner-up last year, prevailed in the
first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're friends,'' Armstrong said. ``I felt I wrestled up to the
extent of my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Cotter and Brenda Malott of Sam Houston also recorded
pins. The Texans also benefited from two forfeits at weight classes
that the Colts didn't supply any participants.
</P>
<P>
   Cotter pinned Stevie Bradrick at 3 minutes, 57.3 seconds into
the 128-pound match. Malott made quick work of Teresa King by
recording a pin in 28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Reynolds of Arlington opened by taking only 18 seconds to
pin Barbara Ortega in record time in the 95-pound match. Lauren
Allen stopped Loretta Olivas in 52 seconds by fall to give
Arlington a victory at the 119-pound weight division.
</P>
<P>
   Darcy Roman (148 pounds) and Geanie Jaffe (165 pounds) also
posted pins for Arlington. Roman stopped Ember Bretman in 30
seconds and Jaffe took care of Brandy Killingsworth in barely over
a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing, Arlington coach Henry Harmoney considered the
event a success for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was kind of fun,'' Harmoney said. ``This is going
to be good. It went fast, it went well and people like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Our) veterans pretty much did what I expect them to do. I
think Sam Houston did a great job. But (wrestling) changes
everyday.''

 &HT;    
 By RABBI ELI HECHT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I was born into a modern American religious family on my
father's side. I was especially proud to be a fourth-generation
American Jew, played a great game of baseball, enjoyed reading the
Sunday funnies and celebrated American holidays.
 &HT;    My mother's family was the complete opposite. They all came from
Europe and had no appreciation for baseball or any American
pastimes.
 &HT;    Growing up in the '50s, I went to a small cheder, a Jewish
school. Almost all of my classmates were children of refugees.
 &HT;    One year I was introduced to a very strict, no-nonsense Jewish
teacher -- called a rebbe. This rebbe had very little patience for
me, as I was very different from his European students. I was an
American -- a Yankee boy.
 &HT;    According to my rebbe's thinking, all American customs were
taboo. They were considered traif, non-kosher. Easter, Halloween,
Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July were all jumbled into one big
no-no. They were American and were out of bounds.
 &HT;    He claimed that a Bible law forbids the Jewish nation to emulate
the ways of other nations. He would quote the biblical verse
Leviticus 18:3: ``Neither shall ye walk in their statutes; do not
follow their social customs.''
 &HT;    However, not all Jews think that way, as we shall see.
 &HT;    A week before Thanksgiving my father called up my European
grandparents and told them that he had received an 18-pound turkey
from his synagogue's caterer. This was a gift to our large family
for Thanksgiving. On Thursday we would have a Thanksgiving repast.
 &HT;    That Monday the rebbe made a speech. Thanksgiving is forbidden.
It is a pagan holiday. No Jewish boy is allowed to eat turkey.
 &HT;    Now I was in trouble. I thought that if I ate turkey my teeth
would fall out. What would I do?
 &HT;    I told my rebbe about the early Indians and the first
Thanksgiving. I thought he would realize that Thanksgiving could be
considered a good deed for both Jews and Gentiles. I tried to tell
him about the friendly Indians; how they saved the starving
Puritans; that the Thanksgiving meal reminds us of the foods the
Indians showed the settlers and it taught them how to survive
through the rough winters in the new world. This was a mitzvah, a
good deed, to share and give thanks to God.
 &HT;    ``Yingele (sonny boy),'' he said, ``I told you we don't
celebrate these holidays. It is forbidden to even listen to your
bubbemeises (tall tales).''
 &HT;    That night I told my dad that I wouldn't participate in a pagan
holiday. ``It's against the Bible,'' I said. He flew into a rage. I
thought he was going to clobber me.
 &HT;    ``You are an American, a fourth-generation American,'' he said.
Be happy that you have a country that believes in God. If anything,
Thanksgiving is a Jewish idea.'' He told my mother that if this
continued he would take me out of that cheder, the Jewish school.
 &HT;    For the next few years my father bought a large turkey for
Thanksgiving and we had two turkey meals: one on the American
Thanksgiving and one on the following Shabbos. We now celebrated
Thanksgiving on the Jewish holy day of Sabbath.
 &HT;    I thought that my dad had a point. Thanksgiving, indeed, was a
holiday that fit into the Jewish idea of remembering God's goodness
in providing us with our needs. Thus, we could have Thanksgiving
every Sabbath.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I was born into a modern American religious family on my
father's side. I was especially proud to be a fourth-generation
American Jew, played a great game of baseball, enjoyed reading the
Sunday funnies and celebrated American holidays.
 &HT;    My mother's family was the complete opposite. They all came from
Europe and had no appreciation for baseball or any American
pastimes.
 &HT;    Growing up in the '50s, I went to a small cheder, a Jewish
school. Almost all of my classmates were children of refugees.
 &HT;    One year I was introduced to a very strict, no-nonsense Jewish
teacher -- called a rebbe. This rebbe had very little patience for
me, as I was very different from his European students. I was an
American -- a Yankee boy.
 &HT;    According to my rebbe's thinking, all American customs were
taboo. They were considered traif, non-kosher. Easter, Halloween,
Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July were all jumbled into one big
no-no. They were American and were out of bounds.
 &HT;    He claimed that a Bible law forbids the Jewish nation to emulate
the ways of other nations. He would quote the biblical verse
Leviticus 18:3: ``Neither shall ye walk in their statutes; do not
follow their social customs.''
 &HT;    However, not all Jews think that way, as we shall see.
 &HT;    A week before Thanksgiving my father called up my European
grandparents and told them that he had received an 18-pound turkey
from his synagogue's caterer. This was a gift to our large family
for Thanksgiving. On Thursday we would have a Thanksgiving repast.
 &HT;    That Monday the rebbe made a speech. Thanksgiving is forbidden.
It is a pagan holiday. No Jewish boy is allowed to eat turkey.
 &HT;    Now I was in trouble. I thought that if I ate turkey my teeth
would fall out. What would I do?
 &HT;    I told my rebbe about the early Indians and the first
Thanksgiving. I thought he would realize that Thanksgiving could be
considered a good deed for both Jews and Gentiles. I tried to tell
him about the friendly Indians; how they saved the starving
Puritans; that the Thanksgiving meal reminds us of the foods the
Indians showed the settlers and it taught them how to survive
through the rough winters in the new world. This was a mitzvah, a
good deed, to share and give thanks to God.
 &HT;    ``Yingele (sonny boy),'' he said, ``I told you we don't
celebrate these holidays. It is forbidden to even listen to your
bubbemeises (tall tales).''
 &HT;    That night I told my dad that I wouldn't participate in a pagan
holiday. ``It's against the Bible,'' I said. He flew into a rage. I
thought he was going to clobber me.
 &HT;    ``You are an American, a fourth-generation American,'' he said.
Be happy that you have a country that believes in God. If anything,
Thanksgiving is a Jewish idea.'' He told my mother that if this
continued he would take me out of that cheder, the Jewish school.
 &HT;    For the next few years my father bought a large turkey for
Thanksgiving and we had two turkey meals: one on the American
Thanksgiving and one on the following Shabbos. We now celebrated
Thanksgiving on the Jewish holy day of Sabbath.
 &HT;    I thought that my dad had a point. Thanksgiving, indeed, was a
holiday that fit into the Jewish idea of remembering God's goodness
in providing us with our needs. Thus, we could have Thanksgiving
every Sabbath.
 &HT;    I don't remember if Thanksgiving became a kosher holiday or not,
but we solved our family dilemma.
 &HT;    When Abraham Lincoln signed the original Thanksgiving

choicest bounties of heaven; we have been preserved these many

 &HT;    Ohio researchers push for more drug-prevention programs
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Nearly one in four Dayton-area high school
seniors is a regular cigarette smoker, prompting researchers at
Wright State University to urge that drug-prevention programs focus
more heavily on legal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The people who are trying to limit teen-agers' use of tobacco
and alcohol are being both outspent and outsmarted by the
industries that sell those products, said Russel Falck and Harvey
Siegal of the WSU School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they accomplishing what we want them to accomplish?''
Siegal asked Thursday of programs and advertisements designed to
reduce teen drug use. ``We know Joe Camel was accomplishing what
the tobacco companies wanted to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegal directs Wright State's Substance Abuse Intervention
Program, which helped conduct the Dayton Area Drug Survey (DADS) of
nearly 2,000 seniors and 5,000 other students in Montgomery and
Greene counties in February. With local school districts and United
Health Services collaborating, the biannual survey also found one
in 20 seniors had tried unsuccessfully to quit and more than one in
seven smoked at least 10 cigarettes a day, an increase of 73
percent in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol use has remained steady in that period among seniors _
84 percent saying they have drunk at least once in their lives, 29
percent having five or more drinks at least once and 4.3 percent
drinking at least 20 times a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to actively mounting drug-prevention programs,
it's essential that we also evaluate them,'' Siegal said. ``We need
some realistic research to show us what is working and what is not,
so we can tinker with them and make them better.''
</P>
<P>
   Flashy TV commercials, ``just say no'' sermons and long-term
threats of cancer aren't keeping kids away from cigarettes, he
said. When the survey asked abstainers why they don't use drugs,
Siegal said, ``They said it was because if they do this, they can't
do something else that's important to them, like sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegal and Falck agree the biggest step toward reducing teens'
smoking and drinking would be to severely restrict the marketing of
those legal recreational drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Both researchers characterized the tobacco industry's pending
multistate legal settlement as better than nothing but not enough.
The settlement would prohibit tobacco companies from advertising
with cartoon characters, on billboards or clothing and through
sponsorships of entertainment events. It also will give the states
money for anti-smoking education, about $392,000 a year for 25
years in Ohio's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very good that the billboards are coming down, but the $6
billion a year the tobacco industry spends is going to find its way
into other marketing outlets,'' said Falck, an assistant professor
of community health in the med school.
</P>
<P>
   The survey included illegal drug use and also found:
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the survey was begun in 1990, more than
half the seniors said they had smoked marijuana at least once.
</P>
<P>
   About one in five seniors have used hallucinogens such as LSD,
more than double the 1990 figure of one in 12.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of those using crack cocaine at least once was
5.8, the highest since the 1980s. Other cocaine use was up more
than 50 percent in four years to 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, the trend for seventh-graders is a decline
in the use of all the most prevalent drugs except inhalants. In the
past four years, they have reported declines in use of marijuana by
32 percent, alcohol by 20 percent, cigarettes by 24 percent and
smokeless tobacco by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Falck said too many adults think of smoking as a youthful
indiscretion that kids will outgrow. But after six or seven months
of regular smoking, most are addicted at least to some degree. And
Harvard University reported Tuesday that 28 percent of American
college students smoked regularly in 1997, slightly above the adult
rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next generation of smokers is already in place,'' Falck
said. ``We'll be paying for that for a long time.

 &HT;    Study points up problems for elderly drivers
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Testing older drivers for depth perception and
ability to see traffic signals would be a better test of skills
than judging them on night vision, University of Utah researchers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing Utah traffic accident data from 1992 to 1995 involving
people age 70 and older, the study found no support of the common
perception that older drivers cannot see as well at night and,
therefore, cause crashes.
</P>
<P>
   That theory, as well as the belief that older drivers lose
control of motor vehicles at high speeds, has been floated in many
states as reasons for restricting senior citizens' driver's
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A difference in older drivers and younger drivers involved in
crashes at night did not pan out,'' said Larry Cook, a statistician
for the University of Utah team that presented its findings
recently at the annual American Public Health Association meeting.
``And the odds ratio for a serious crash at highway speed vs. other
speeds was no different for older drivers than younger drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger drivers for the study were defined as ages 30-39.
</P>
<P>
   Where older drivers are more likely to cause crashes is at
crowded intersections, making left-hand turns and failing to yield
the right of way. They are almost four times as likely as younger
drivers to cause a crash by failing to yield and 1.5 times more
likely to cause an accident by running a stop sign or red light,
the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests older drivers have trouble spotting traffic signs
and signals in a cluttered visual field at any time of day,'' Cook
said. ``Depth perception may also be a factor because we found many
T-bone-type collisions caused by turning left and running into
oncoming traffic. These are usually caused when drivers fail to
judge the speed of oncoming traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   T-bone crashes, in which one car broadsides a second car, can
seriously injure both drivers and their passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Senior drivers are also almost three times more likely to be
hospitalized after crashes, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, about 30 (percent) to 35 percent of people who are
wearing seat belts still require hospitalization,'' Cook said.
``But we found 68 percent of seniors involved in these crashes
needed to go to the hospital. That may be because of the severity
of these T-bone collisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Since depth perception and ability to properly see traffic
signals vary from person to person, the researchers recommended
such tests be done individually instead of making restrictions
based solely on age. The University of Alabama at Birmingham has
developed such a test for older drivers called the Useful Field of
Vision, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   While reaction time of the eye is known to decline with age, and
there is a diminished capacity for quick decision-making as the
years add up, the Utah study is the first to compare crash traffic
data among senior citizens against drivers almost half their age.

 &HT;    Enslaving the truth cancels the power of history
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday, Nov. 22
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In June 1997, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation invited
Arneatha Jones Roberts to a ``Getting Word Gathering'' at
Monticello. This charming little lady, the widow of a dentist who
retired to West Palm Beach, Fla., 20 years ago, was among more than
110 descendants of the Monticello slave community in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   During the weekend, Ms. Roberts was selected to plant a tree at
the historic plantation in honor of her late brother, artist
Lawrence Arthur Jones. She says this recognition would have pleased
the former Jackson State University art professor because he
unwittingly sabotaged an opportunity to have a book written about
his highly acclaimed artwork.
</P>
<P>
   When white interviewers approached Mr. Jones shortly before his
death in 1996, he insisted that any book about him include
information about his identity as a Hemings and his possible
relationship to Sally Hemings. She was the supposed slave mistress
of Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence and
the nation's third president.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother, Lawrence, just kept talking about it,'' Ms.
Roberts says. ``Wouldn't let it go, and those folks (interviewers)
didn't want to hear nothing about that kind of stuff, so they
didn't write the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts, who grew up in Lynchburg, Va., can trace her
family's ancestry through her mother Nannie Hemings, and Mr. Jones
to a maternal grandfather, Ellis Hemings, who was born in 1855.
Orphaned when very young, Nannie was reared by an aunt also named
Sally Hemings. Thus, Ms. Roberts' invitation to historic Monticello
seemed in part official validation of her heritage.
</P>
<P>
   As if to maintain denial that any of the slave descendants were
related to Jefferson, Ms. Jones says, the press was banned from the
``Gathering.'' Officials tactfully cautioned attendees that their
presence did not mean they were blood relatives of the former
president. Paternity in a slave society is hard to document.
</P>
<P>
   But this month, the British journal Nature ended much
speculation. Scientists at Oxford University announced that DNA
tests show Thomas Jefferson fathered Sally Hemings' youngest son,
Eston. Since the DNA evidence on the Y chromosome is used to
confirm common ancestry, only male heirs can be confirmed.
Descendants of Sally's three daughters cannot be proved or
disproved.
</P>
<P>
   The press hailed this well-documented and long-known public
secret as a bombshell. Blacks, including Ms. Roberts and her
relatives, were not surprised. We have always been more informed by
the truth of our experiences than the written records of
historians.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is obvious. We have never had the luxury of denying
the dehumanizing power whites have had over our lives. Evidence
abounds that the laws against miscegenation applied to black men
only. Race-mixing existed on every plantation during slavery _ and
in every legally segregated community thereafter. Even some of the
blacks with the darkest complexions throughout the South can claim
white relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The varied hues of black people have been sufficient to effect
within the race something of a caste system based on color. Slave
owners' wives, many considered property themselves, frequently
noticed that their own children bore a striking resemblance to
``yard children.'' These women had little option except to ignore
``the problem'' that many mentioned only in their diaries.
</P>
<P>
   For blacks, the circumstantial evidence that Thomas Jefferson
maintained an ongoing relationship with Sally Hemings is totally
convincing. He was in Paris with Sally, who was serving as his
daughter's maid, and at home at Monticello each time Sally
conceived a child. In 1873, Sally's second youngest son told Ohio's
Pike County Republican newspaper that his mother had told all of
her children their father was Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Stack that evidence against written records of Monticello
plantation life. They reveal that, at one point, the entire
household staff at Monticello were members of the Hemings family.
From the time Betty Hemings, mother of Sally, arrived at Monticello
in 1774, she and her children assumed primary household duties. The
Hemings women were never drafted to do grueling plantation work.
Edmund Bacon, Monticello overseer from 1806 to 1822, said, ``I was
instructed to take no control of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Note also that Jefferson freed all of Sally's seven children. In
fact, all of the slaves freed during his lifetime or in his will
were members of the Hemings family.
</P>
<P>
   Still, respected historians such as Dumas Malone, author of the
Pulitzer-Prize winning six-volume biography of Jefferson, routinely
dismissed stories that Jefferson cohabited with a slave as
``filth'' and ``virtually unthinkable.'' He called ex-slave
descendants' claim of a blood relationship with the most highly
respected American intellectual of the 18th century ``Negroes'
pathetic wish for a little pride.'' A paradox that that blacks find
most insulting to their humanity is that Jefferson scholar Malone,
born in Mississippi and raised in Georgia, could accept that
Jefferson owned 200 slaves he allowed to be supervised by
notoriously cruel overseers but could not reconcile Jefferson's
moral standards and classical taste with an attraction to a black
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Of mixing the races, Jefferson wrote, ``Amalgamation produces a
degradation to which no one ... can innocently consent.'' Yet he
ignored that standard when confronted with his own sexual desire.
Slaves were chattel available for any use a master desired.
Undeniably, such use often meant sex. Like his aristocratic
contemporaries, Jefferson embodied obvious contradictions and a
monumental hypocrisy that would be shocking, except that his
conscious duplicity exists in every American institution.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, rather than be shocked by proof that Thomas Jefferson
had sex with a slave, we should consider how the American academic
tradition of recording the ideal and ignoring the real has denied
realities we need to confront in order to build a true democracy.
</P>
<P>
   By denying the bad and ugly at the core of our culture to create
mythic heroes, we distort history and cancel its power to instruct
future generations.

 &HT;    A senior speaks out
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The aging human body is much like an old house or an old car.
It's constantly in need of repairs. This includes teeth, which have
a tendency to wear out.
</P>
<P>
   Lately I've been spending a lot of time with Dr. John Blanchard,
my friendly dentist. The biggest problem I have on my visits to his
office is trying to stay awake in his reclining chair. If those
things didn't cost so much I'd love to have one for my den.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the dentist used to be a horror. Now a filling is no
worse than getting a haircut, and patients have been known to doze
off during a root canal. If I had to pick the three things that
have improved the most in my lifetime I'd say automobile tires,
grocery stores and dentists.
</P>
<P>
   It's been years since I've had a blowout, had to patch a tube,
or go to Jake Mask's for a new set of tires after 12,000 miles.
Every time I wander down the aisle of a grocery store I'm awed at
all the stuff you can buy, like ready-made biscuits instead of a
25-pound sack of White Lily flour and a bucket of lard. It's been
years since I last heard grown men crying in a dentist's office.
That's progress.
</P>
<P>
   I wish we'd done as well in some other areas. Senior citizenship
for example. I remember my grandparents, aunt, uncles and elderly
neighbors being deferred to and honored, not condescendingly put in
their place as they are today. Nowadays people under 40 seem to
delight in making so-called senior citizens aware that they are in
a special used-up category.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I ran into this situation was checking into a
motel in Valdosta. At the time I barely qualified for senior
citizenship even by the most liberal definition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't you eligible for our senior citizens discount?'' asked
the desk clerk, who was about 15 years old and who obviously
thought I was trying to register under false and criminal pretense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose so,'' I answered. ``Will it also cover my girlfriend
who will be spending the night with me? She's only 25.''
</P>
<P>
   The young lady just smiled and gave me the look silly old men
get when they tell outrageous lies.
</P>
<P>
   When we go to the movies, the adolescent in the booth rings 10
percent off before I can open my mouth. Then she hands me a child's
ticket. If I go to the grocery store on Tuesday the checker suggest
that next time I wait until Wednesday so I can get my senior
citizen's discount. Passing the proverbial camel through the eye of
a needle is easier than avoiding a senior citizen's discount.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone with half sense can see, this isn't something nice
business people do for the elderly. It's plainly another marketing
ploy, like grandparents' day and phony going-out-of-business sales.
To expand the market, they keep moving back the qualifying age.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon people will qualify for senior citizens' discounts
as soon as they graduate from high school. To tell the truth I'm
getting pretty angry about the way senior citizens are being used,
abused and insulted just so companies can sell more things.
</P>
<P>
   I'm fed up with television commercials where a gray-haired man
and a gray-haired woman with their arms around each other talk
about how comforting it is to have a cemetery lot paid for and
plenty of stuff in the medicine cabinet to ``keep you regular.''
I've never thought of myself as being irregular, and where I'm put
away is going to be somebody else's problem, not mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a longtime senior citizen,'' suggested my child bride as
she scanned the paper over breakfast, ``you'll be interested in
this letter to Dear Abby.'' She read me the letter, written by a
senior citizen:
</P>
<P>
   ``Since those of us over the age of 60 are referred to as
``senior citizens,'' that must mean that people in their 40s and
50s are ``junior citizens.'' And if that's the case, it would
follow that those in their 30s are sophomore citizens and adults in
their 20s are freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is true,'' the writer continued, ``we would have a new
age grouping system that eliminates ``elderly'' from our
vocabulary. For those who ask what comes after ``senior,'' the
answer is, ``graduation.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, explained the senior writer, we wouldn't die. We
would ``graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not a bad suggestion, except that figuring up all the
money I can save on senior citizens discounts, I'm not nearly ready
to either die or graduate. Over a second cup of coffee, I came up
with a solution that's so obvious it's amazing someone hasn't
thought of it before.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors do graduate, but that's not necessarily the end. Many go
on to advanced degrees. The answer is to establish another category
called ``master citizen.'' Anyone over age 65 would be a master
citizen and receive an extra 5 percent discount at the movies, the
grocery store and the Holiday Inn in Valdosta. Those over 75 could
be given honorary doctorates and be allowed to go to the head of
the line when they go for flu shots. Maybe they can take this up in
the new Congress that's supposed to be kinder and gentler now that
Newt's back home in Cobb County.

 &HT;    Let dogs do business
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The grassy area around my mailbox is a designated
puppy potty for one or more neighborhood dogs.
</P>
<P>
   I was not consulted when this decision was made. Dogs, it seems,
don't care who pays the taxes or the bills for yard service in
their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   From a dog's point of view, all the world's a toilet. I've
occasionally felt the same way, especially since the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal broke.
</P>
<P>
   Let me hasten to add, however, that I don't care if the dogs use
this small part of my yard. They've been doing it, as it were, in
that spot for years.
</P>
<P>
   I'm philosophical about it. Dogs have to do it somewhere. Why
not in the grass next to my mailbox?
</P>
<P>
   I could waste time trying to identify the canine culprits and
waste even more time trying to change their well-established
habits. In the end, as it were, I could find that my efforts only
made matters worse. My poochie pals might designate a part of my
yard that I actually use, like next to the barbecue grill.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I also like to think that I am doing a favor for my
human neighbors who might not be so accepting of a pooch potty in
their yards.
</P>
<P>
   I like dogs. I've never really liked leash laws because I don't
think dogs like leash laws. But dogs don't get to call the shots in
this life.
</P>
<P>
   Most communities of any size now require that all canine
residents be kept fenced in or on a leash.
</P>
<P>
   Today's dogs are required to have proof of residency to be
registered and licensed, which is more proof than American humans
need to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Most city dogs also are required to carry with them at all times
current proof of residency and registration. They don't seem to
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, from a dog's point of view, are laws that encourage
the use of knives on their private parts to prevent them from
experiencing the joys of parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   When I was growing up, dogs were free to live the good life,
which is a dog's life. They were free to roam wherever they wanted,
sleep wherever they wanted, follow you to school and romp and play
with their friends.
</P>
<P>
   Free roaming dogs of yesteryear enjoyed checking their mail and
leaving their personalized messages on established doggie bulletin
boards, which to us appeared to be trees, telephone poles and fire
hydrants.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that the first doggie leash law was in New York
City. Lots of things get started in New York City and then spread
like a bad cold to the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure that the first pooper scooper law I ever heard about
came from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Only in New York City, I remember thinking, would people come up
with the idea of following their dogs around until they pooped and
then by force of law requiring them to pick up and carry away the
fresh droppings. This seemed to me a more compelling reason to rise
up and overthrow the government than taxes on Boston tea.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't live in New York City. I had no way of knowing how
disgusting and frustrating dog doo can be on sidewalks in a crowded
city until I visited Paris recently.
</P>
<P>
   Parisians also love dogs. In Paris, dogs accompany their masters
everywhere. Dogs are allowed in hotels, bars, brasseries,
restaurants, bakeries and stores.
</P>
<P>
   Parisian dog owners watch as their dogs do their business right
in the middle of a narrow sidewalk. They then casually stroll off
with relieved Fifi in tow.
</P>
<P>
   A Nov. 15 Washington Post news story reported that Paris
officials have launched an experimental program to build dog toilet
enclosures in one section of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   I think the Parisians will like it. It works for me. Every time
I pick up my mail, I remember Paris.

 &HT;    Austin gets big league lobbyists
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Think of them as the New York Yankees of the
lobbying big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The nine new lobbyists who will take the field for the City of
Austin when the Texas Legislature convenes in January offer a
little of everything. The team includes former state lawmakers and
former aides to governors of both parties, including Gov. George W.
Bush. It features longtime lobbyists and newly minted ones who
served in the Legislature as recently as the last session in 1997.
There are consultants to both Republican and Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   And like the Yankees, this powerhouse team doesn't come cheap:
Their combined salaries over the next two years will exceed $1
million _ more than twice as much as Austin paid for its lobbying
team during the past two years and considerably more than Houston,
Dallas, Fort Worth or San Antonio pay their squads.
</P>
<P>
   As Austin girds itself for the first legislative session since
it annexed 27,700 mostly resistant suburbanites at the end of last
year, it may need all of the firepower it can muster. Some
lawmakers say the formation of the all-star team _ coupled with
Mayor Kirk Watson's efforts to forge personal ties at the Capitol _
is evidence of thawing relations between Austin and the
Legislature. Others say the lobbyists can't sweeten their distaste
for the annexations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the City of Austin has done a good job of waving some
big bucks in front of some good lobbyists,'' said Rep. Ron Lewis,
D-Mauriceville. ``The only message I get out of this thing is that
they don't intend to do anything but fight the Legislature on every
issue there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson said the city assembled the team to deliver the opposite
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not be able to build relationships. But it won't be for
lack of trying and bringing on people who can help us build those
relationships,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin City Council on Wednesday added Neal ``Buddy'' Jones,
Bill Miller, Carl Richie, Cliff Johnson, Reggie Bashur, Karen
Johnson, Carl Parker, Froy Salinas and Hugo Berlanga to its roster,
approving contracts worth a total of about $1.2 millionover two
years. Austin will continue to employ lobbyists Donald Adams and
Angelo Zottarelli, who will be paid $368,000 over the two years, in
addition to in-house governmental relations chief John Hrncir.
</P>
<P>
   The new additions give Austin some of the most prominent
lobbyists and consultants in town and a wide range of political
connections _ a significant strength for a liberal city that is
often at odds with the predominantly conservative Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Watson says the size, scope and salaries of the new team reflect
the city's new commitment to working with state lawmakers, rather
than fears of a legislative backlash. He noted that he generally
agrees with the recently released recommendations of a Senate
interim committee on annexation, although he is troubled by some
details.
</P>
<P>
   But the so-called ``Austin-bashing'' session of 1995, during
which the Legislature passed numerous bills designed to thwart
Austin's water-quality laws and ability to annex, made clear the
potential for trouble. The courts have since struck down several of
the new laws as unconstitutional, but the victories have been
costly: City Attorney Andy Martin estimates that Austin has paid
outside lawyers about $3 million to win those fights and to
preserve city powers.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's lobbying payroll is now larger than that of Dallas
($75,000 this year), Houston (a little less than $500,000 over two
years), San Antonio ($348,000 over two years) or Fort Worth
($126,000 over two years). But City Manager Jesus Garza says the
city may save money in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent millions, given the results of previous
legislative sessions, going back and defending ourselves in the
courts because we didn't spend enough building relationships,''
Garza said. ``In the long run, I think this will be a good
investment for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Smith of Public Citizen, a government watchdog group, echoed
Garza's argument. Smith is a frequent critic of lobbyists'
influence at the Capitol, but he complimented Austin's new hirings
as ``a wise move _ although an expensive one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A team of this size and of this quality may help us to attain
many of our objectives as well as provide good defense,'' said
Smith, an Austin resident. ``The Legislature can carry a big bat
and hit us when we're not really looking.''
</P>
<P>
   With such a large and well-connected lobbying team, it's not
surprising that several of the new additions represent companies
and groups with interests that conflict with Austin's. At least
three of them represent telecommunications companies that are
likely to clash with the city over fees for rights-of-way, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   But Garza, Watson, the lobbyists and some of their other clients
downplayed the potential for problems. All noted that each
lobbyist's role will be limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them will have conflicts on some specific issues. That
naturally occurs when you're hiring people you haven't had a
long-term relationship with and who are of the caliber of the
people we're hiring,'' Watson said. ``We'll have to wall around
those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Capitol, prominent opponents of Austin's annexation
policies offered mixed reviews of the city's new lobbying team.
Rep. Mike Krusee, for one, expects to be a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, Austin's lobbyists have left a sour taste in many
legislators' mouths, just because of the way they dealt with
people. I don't think they worked very hard to forge a trusting
relationship,'' Krusee said. But the Round Rock Republican said he
knows and gets along with almost all of the new additions.
</P>
<P>
   Krusee suggested that Mayor Watson himself _ who has earned a
reputation as a consensus-builder by uniting Austin's famously
contentious business and environmental camps _ may be the city's
best lobbyist. Watson has tried to build personal relationships
with lawmakers through phone calls and visits to the Capitol, and
Krusee said he gets along well with the mayor despite their policy
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a likable person and he's easy to deal with,'' said
Krusee, who described his relationship with former Mayor Bruce Todd
as ``mostly adversarial.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, also appreciates Watson's
efforts to reach out. The mayor called to advise him of the new
lobbying team and the possibility of a newspaper article, he said.
But like Rep. Lewis, he said Austin's actions speak louder than
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the people of Austin elect members to the City Council
who do things in a fair and even-handed and equitable fashion,
they're going to have other folks around the state coming to the
Legislature asking for legislative relief from the sanctions of the
council,'' Wentworth said.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the senator's phone conversation with the mayor?
</P>
<P>
   ``I did ask Kirk if he left any lobbyists available for anybody
else to hire this session,'' Wentworth said.

 &HT;    Woodworker should master tounge-in-cheek technique
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time that I can remember, I am going to turn this
space over to a couple of unsung and unidentified comedians from
rec.woodworking on the Internet, who have skewered both the
pathetic and the pretentious of our craft. It begins with a query:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make a stick with one end sharpened. Does anyone
know of any plans for such an item? The stick should be about 4'
long. I want to put a point on one end, preferably the end that
points down. It should be able to penetrate the earth deeply enough
to stand on its own. Anyone have any plans?''
</P>
<P>
   The reply:
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to sharpen a stick is the way it was done a
hundred years ago by REAL craftsmen: use a Stanley 33 1/3
stick-sharpening plane. Of course the Stanley 33 1/3 isn't as good
as the Record 007, but those are extremely rare _ only two were
ever made and I own them both (I got them at a garage sale).
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you need to do is lap the sole of the stick
sharpening plane. Since the sole isn't flat, you'll need a special
jig. I like to use the horn of a 2-year-old mountain goat coated
with tripoli abrasive, but in a pinch a 3-year-old goat will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lap the plane on the goat horn until it is smooth. I mean
really smooth. I mean so smooth that it could be used as a mirror
for laser interferometry. Unless the plane's sole is smooth to
within a few nanometers it will be useless for anything other than
a paper weight. I can usually smooth a 33 1/3 in about 20 minutes,
but be prepared to work up a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the sole is smooth, you'll need to sharpen the blade.
First, take the blade that came with the plane and throw it out. It
was probably made in the 20th century and all tools (but especially
blades) made in the 20th century are utter garbage. The best blades
were made in the Bronze Age. You may think this is my opinion, but
it is utter fact and anyone who disagrees with me needs a frontal
lobotomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smelting bronze is relatively easy. It was covered in this
news group many times. Look it up in DejaNews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've made the blade, you'll need to sharpen it. I
prefer a flat bevel which I get by using a bewildering variety of
sharpening stones. To grind the blade to the proper angle, grasp
the flat of the blade with the index finger of your left hand while
simultaneously positioning the inner side of your right knee on the
leg of your workbench ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll know when the blade is sharp enough when it stops
reflecting light on its edge. The entire blade will become
invisible, and if you drop it edge-side-down, it will pass through
the floor of your shop and come to rest at the center of the Earth.
You'll know if it's sharp enough if the hairs on the back of your
arm fall off if you even THINK of cutting them with the blade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mount the blade in the 33 1/3 bevel side down unless you are
making a sharpened stick to be used in Australia _ in that case,
mount the blade bevel side up. Take a swipe at the stick with the
plane and make minor adjustments to the blade depth, your stance,
the frog, the skew of the plane, the angle of the bevel, downward
pressure, the direction of the cut, and tightness of the blade
clamp until you get a paper-thin curl. Waxing the sole with a
little ear wax sometimes helps. The joy of using a Stanley 33 1/3
is that using it is MUCH FASTER than setting up a power tool to do
the job. ``Rehone the blade often while sharpening the stick. If
you find that you have too much end grain tearout, switch to a
Stanley 3.145927 plane. It was especially designed for
stick-sharpening end grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck!''

 &HT;    The fabulous fashion independents
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jet, charcoal, midnight, ash, burnt
toast, whatever. No matter the name, the color black controls
fashion followers, to the point where shows look like a really hip
wake.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to the typical fashion editor look: There's the
ever-present long, sleek hair _ very often blond _ which seems a
prerequisite for employment at most major magazines. There's the
very minimal makeup _ just a bit of mascara and lipstick, maybe _ a
look that says I'm too serious and too busy for a beauty pageant
look. There are the sunglasses, often tortoise shell, pushing that
sleek hair back or guarding against those harsh runway lights.
</P>
<P>
   The look is understated, stark and somewhat chilly. Think
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy scorned.
</P>
<P>
   It's refreshing to see someone ditch the look and go out _
sometimes way out _ on a limb. Meet a few fashion editors whose
styles make noise.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques and Pascal
</P>
<P>
   Jobs: Editors, Creme and Sugar magazine
</P>
<P>
   Ages: Jacques: ``64.'' Pascal: ``410.''
</P>
<P>
   Well.
</P>
<P>
   These guys seemed to be on the fringe of every show. They were
even hanging out by the velvet rope at the door to Cynthia Rowley's
midweek party.
</P>
<P>
   At first taken for fashion groupies, they swore they were
working guys. Creme and Sugar is a small, New York-based, ``very
underground'' publication passed around in the discos of the world,
they said. It seems to have some clout _ actor David Keith was seen
at last year's shows taking notes for the magazine from the front
row.
</P>
<P>
   But no notebooks visible on these two. ``We came here to check
out babes,'' Pascal said.
</P>
<P>
   They refused to give straight answers, if their ``ages'' are any
clue. Their personal style? ``New York end-of-millennium,'' Jacques
said. ``I have no style,'' Pascal said. ``My style is freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He fingered Jacques' coat, which, like the rest of their outfits
screamed ``boutique geek.'' ``See this? He had them kill special
llamas to make this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw, it's fake turkey feathers,'' Jacques said. ``They're
called `faux feathers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Most important piece of clothing? ``My socks,'' Pascal said.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't see the socks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah,'' with a knowing look. ``Exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Yeager
</P>
<P>
   Job: Writer, The Village Voice
</P>
<P>
   Age: ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you know me,'' she asked. ``From the dots?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes.
</P>
<P>
   She was spotted by the Fashion Week snack table, with its $4
sandwich slivers. The red Raggedy-Ann circle on each cheek gave her
away.
</P>
<P>
   She copied the look from someone she saw years ago, she said.
``It's a 1920s, painted-lady kind of look,'' she said. ``Dollish.
Cinematic.''
</P>
<P>
   She spent years trying to get her blush to match her lipstick of
choice, a black and dark red shade. Finally she dabbed the lipstick
on her cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   She shaves the back of her neck to make her flapper-ish hairdo
sharper. She's been coloring it with henna in the bathroom sink for
20 years. ``Someone from Clairol said there's no way of getting it
out now.''
</P>
<P>
   Her eyebrows are hardly there at all, but that's natural, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She has strict rules of personal style. ``I never wear pants.
Never have.'' She never wears heels. Or belts. Too un-flapperly.
Only antique jewelry will do. The pin at the neck of her gray
sweater says ``Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The fashion world has strict style rules of its own, she said,
but they change with the city.
</P>
<P>
   London loved her look. Paris, to her surprise, did not. ``I
thought people were laughing at me. I thought they'd be bohemian,''
she sniffed.
</P>
<P>
   Moneca Casanova
</P>
<P>
   Job: Contributing editor, Spanish Marie Claire
</P>
<P>
   Age: 28
</P>
<P>
   She's also a designer. Drag queens dig her stuff.
</P>
<P>
   She's from Mexico, has lived in New York for two years and likes
to make coats from Mongolian lamb. ``It's the only fur in the
industry where people eat the animal,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   She came to the first day of shows with a couple dozen brightly
colored barrettes all over her head. No fashion statement there,
really. Just a new shampoo. ``My hair got so fuzzy, I kept putting
them in to keep it down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The look got wilder. She ran in just before the Daryl K show
wearing huge white-rimmed glasses and her baby (Amaneta, three
months) strapped to her chest.
</P>
<P>
   By that evening she had changed to an all-white ensemble with
thigh-high, 4-inch, mock-leather platform boots. Japanese
photographers begged her to pose.
</P>
<P>
   Her secrets are simple. The clothes are from the '60s and '70s.
She always wears one of her own pieces. And she never wears makeup,
just the critter-like fake eyelashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wears the opposite of what she sees,'' a friend, named
Marco, explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Ezersky
</P>
<P>
   Job: Writer, Paper magazine
</P>
<P>
   Age: 44
</P>
<P>
   In her clubbing days, she wore a G-string, bra and pantyhose.
The get-up got her past the snooty doormen.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's a TV personality with a show on the new Style channel,
``Behind the Velvet Ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   Every fashion follower has her own style, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone has so much style that a Japanese photographer
waits at her elbow. Snap. Snap. ``Very nice!'' he says, clicking
away as she talks.
</P>
<P>
   She likes to wear the latest looks, sometimes several at a time.
As if a fashion addict's closet attacked her.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-week, she wore a long leather coat (``Galliano _ I love
Galliano''), black pants and gold shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the long silver fingernails, the three antique
gold rings, the four piercings in each ear, the handful of
barrettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I don't want to be conservative,'' she said.
(After all, she has a career.)
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, she won't color her hair. ``It's so fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Her style secret: the makeup. Keep putting it on and never take
it off, she said. Her secret weapon: L'Oreal Voluminous Mascara.
``If I were on a desert island, that's what I would take.''

 &HT;    Study points up problems for elderly drivers
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Testing older drivers for depth perception and
ability to see traffic signals would be a better test of skills
than judging them on night vision, University of Utah researchers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing Utah traffic accident data from 1992 to 1995 involving
people age 70 and older, the study found no support of the common
perception that older drivers cannot see as well at night and,
therefore, cause crashes.
</P>
<P>
   That theory, as well as the belief that older drivers lose
control of motor vehicles at high speeds, has been floated in many
states as reasons for restricting senior citizens' driver's
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A difference in older drivers and younger drivers involved in
crashes at night did not pan out,'' said Larry Cook, a statistician
for the University of Utah team that presented its findings
recently at the annual American Public Health Association meeting.
``And the odds ratio for a serious crash at highway speed vs. other
speeds was no different for older drivers than younger drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger drivers for the study were defined as ages 30-39.
</P>
<P>
   Where older drivers are more likely to cause crashes is at
crowded intersections, making left-hand turns and failing to yield
the right of way. They are almost four times as likely as younger
drivers to cause a crash by failing to yield and 1.5 times more
likely to cause an accident by running a stop sign or red light,
the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests older drivers have trouble spotting traffic signs
and signals in a cluttered visual field at any time of day,'' Cook
said. ``Depth perception may also be a factor because we found many
T-bone-type collisions caused by turning left and running into
oncoming traffic. These are usually caused when drivers fail to
judge the speed of oncoming traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   T-bone crashes, in which one car broadsides a second car, can
seriously injure both drivers and their passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Senior drivers are also almost three times more likely to be
hospitalized after crashes, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, about 30 (percent) to 35 percent of people who are
wearing seat belts still require hospitalization,'' Cook said.
``But we found 68 percent of seniors involved in these crashes
needed to go to the hospital. That may be because of the severity
of these T-bone collisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Since depth perception and ability to properly see traffic
signals vary from person to person, the researchers recommended
such tests be done individually instead of making restrictions
based solely on age. The University of Alabama at Birmingham has
developed such a test for older drivers called the Useful Field of
Vision, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   While reaction time of the eye is known to decline with age, and
there is a diminished capacity for quick decision-making as the
years add up, the Utah study is the first to compare crash traffic
data among senior citizens against drivers almost half their age.

 &HT;    Austin City Limits launches 24th season
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Ed Crowell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's 3:30 in the afternoon, and Deana Carter, in
from Nashville with a platinum CD debut behind her and a second
album coming out, is telling the camera operators in Studio 6A what
she thinks they need to know. ``I'll be quite a bit shorter without
these shoes on during the show,'' she says, perched in stacked-heel
boots at the front of the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Come showtime at 8 p.m., the country singer will be in her
everybody-needs-a-trademark bare feet with toenails properly
polished. The camera crew will check cue sheets from director Gary
Menotti, noting the timing of shots he's planned for each song _
except for ``Brand New Key,'' an oldies number Carter added to her
set list without rehearsal. Menotti has it marked simply ``AD
LIB.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Carter heads back to her hotel close to midnight, 400
invited guests and local music fans lucky enough to have scored
free ticket-- will have enjoyed a near-perfect taping, interrupted
only once by an out-of-tune guitar that required a second take. The
veteran production staff of about 30 people will pronounce the
night typical, routine for a task well-practiced through 23
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ugliest buildings on the University of Texas campus
backs up to traffic-clogged Guadalupe Street without a hint of the
music made inside. Townies know this and impress visitors by
pointing to the nearly windowless communications edifice and
bragging: ``That's where `Austin City Limits' comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that everyone around the country, via PBS, has seen the
show produced by the local KLRU public television station at least
once. They've watched a new act or an old favorite playing in front
of an Austin skyline backdrop to an enthusiastic audience in
bleachers. To viewers, the show comes across as a live sampling of
Austin's eclectic music sensibilities, even if the performers are
from all over and are taped weeks ahead. The artists perform on a
small, usually bare stage (Carter imported lava lamps for decor).
With no on-camera host or other distractions, the acts get a
half-hour of air time, or a full hour in special cases such as the
fresh and photogenic Carter, whose sophomore release appears to be
supporting its title that ``Everything's Gonna Be Alright.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Austin City Limits'' formula that has given the show
staying power is none too complicated: Pick the right performers to
feature at the right time, and help them forget the cameras by
treating the studio like a cozy club
</P>
<P>
   As posted, Carter's taping Oct. 14 went like this:
</P>
<P>
   11 a.m. _ EQUIPMENT SETUP
</P>
<P>
   2 p.m. _ SOUNDCHECK
</P>
<P>
   3 p.m. _ CAMERA REHEARSAL (As the band goes through its set, the
camera operators see what they'll be shooting later, and a tech
plans the stage lighting. Menotti times each song with a stopwatch
and plots out directions for the four cameras on exactly when to
zoom in or out on which players.)
</P>
<P>
   6:45 p.m. _ MAKE-UP CALL (Carter gets fussed over by a makeup
artist she brought to town.)
</P>
<P>
   7 p.m. _ STUDIO OPENS (Ticket holders _ see Page 2 _ line up in
an outside courtyard, wait for elevators to take them up to the
studio, grab a free cup of beer and are directed to their seats by
one of 25 volunteers.)
</P>
<P>
   8 p.m. _ SHOWTIME (Producer Terry Lickona warms up the crowd,
warning them that the restrooms are three floors down and not to
get up during songs; then he introduces the act. Menotti is in the
control room, watching the camera monitors, waving his arms like a
conductor for different shots and speaking through a headset to the
studio crew.)
</P>
<P>
   9:30 p.m. _ PLAYBACK (It's 10:30 by the time Carter has
completed her set, taken a break and joined Menotti, Lickona and
other staffers in the control room to review the tapes.)
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at ease on stage, Carter is on the edge of her chair
in the darkened control room when the tapes begin playing through a
bank of monitors. She is ready to pick up on each flaw in her
vocals, her guitar and the sounds from her six musicians. ``We can
fix that, can't we?'' she asks before the first song is finished.
</P>
<P>
   She's told it's no problem and is reminded that this is a rough
mix, to which audio overdubs can be ``punched in.'' She'll be given
a tape to take home and is encouraged to make copious notes to
discuss with the editors later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin City Limits'' is known as an artists' show, one in
which the performers decide what stays in and what goes. It's part
of why so many acts, established and newcomers alike, want to be
invited to play.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after her taping, Carter chooses all but two of the
songs to put on the air. Because she is filling an hour, there
isn't much that can be tossed out. Menotti's editing job comes down
to selecting among the camera shots and deciding how much of
Carter's stage banter to use.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he estimates 20 hours of his time and two days of audio
work will go into this hourlong tape, which typically totals about
$55,000 to produce.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's show, the first of 13 installments for the coming
season, will be completed soon.
</P>
<P>
   It's not always so smooth (Lucinda Williams nixed her entire
taping and will get another), but after more than two decades, the
staff of television's longest-running contemporary music show is
confident it can pull off another entertaining season.
</P>
<P>
   Lickona said he is happiest when his favorite part of a taping
comes around: ``That's when the last note is played, and people are
applauding, and what could have gone wrong didn't.''

 &HT;    Author-illustrator Jan Brett creates magic worlds
 &HT;    By Julie Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When you cozy up with one of Jan Brett's exquisitely
detailed children's books, it's almost like you're being let in on
a secret: that you're really still a kid who yearns to believe in
the magic, in the fairy tale.
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely what the New England author-illustrator,
whose books have sold more than 12 million copies, intends. Through
whimsical books such as ``The Hat'' and ``The Mitten,'' Brett
provides light relief from the pressures of the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Leave the pain and the pathos to other authors, she says. ``I
don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   What she does is conceive fascinating, intricate images. ``I
have to show every hair, every leaf, every dancing raindrop.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett's creative process is ``dreamlike,'' she says. ``It takes
on a life of its own. It involves returning to my shy and innocent
6-year-old self.''
</P>
<P>
   In those days, she charged classmates a penny to draw them a
horse. Nowadays, at 48, she retreats to her childhood self daily.
It happens in her Norwell, Mass., studio, when she gets out her
pencils, brushes and watercolors and puts on a Mozart symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Music is a big part of Brett's life. She has been married for 18
years to Joe Hearne, who plays double bass with the Boston Symphony
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mozart is my absolute favorite music for working,'' she says.
``It orders my mind and makes me feel closer to my real self.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the symphony travels, Brett goes along, eager to
explore and sketch a new surrounding that might set the scene for
another book.
</P>
<P>
   A trip to Denmark gave her the snow-swept Scandinavian landscape
for last year's ``The Hat,'' about a curious hedgehog who gets
himself stuck in a sock. When the symphony hit Texas, Brett was
inspired to draw ``Armadillo Rodeo'' (1995).
</P>
<P>
   The couple also travel on their own to sniff out locations. A
trip to Bavaria proved just the spot for ``Berlioz the Bear''
(1991), a tale about a bear who plays _ surprise _ the double bass.
</P>
<P>
   Brett's new offering is one of the season's standouts: her take
on Clement Moore's classic poem, ``The Night Before Christmas''
(Putnam, $16.99).
</P>
<P>
   The author considers ``Night Before Christmas'' her tip of the
hat to Norman Rockwell. Rich in nostalgic charm, it's set in
Rockwell's home turf of Stockbridge, Mass. As is her custom, Brett
frames each page within a unique, picture-laden border. Her borders
tell a story within the story or provide hints of what's to come in
the main tale. For example, on a page showing that St. Nicholas has
come down the chimney into a home, elves in the border
illustrations are readying bags of toys for the next stop.
</P>
<P>
   Brett is fascinated by what she calls ``the basic human need to
create something beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   She explains: ``In places such as Norway, you learn of people
who would have no creature comforts and lead these very harsh
lives, but yet they had the basic need to make something beautiful
_ often something they would use, like a butter churn or a sleigh,
but beautifully carved. The poorest families would be responsible
for these beautiful objects. What is it about humans that gives us
that need? It's what separates us from the beasts.''

individual seminars. The program book is 350 pages. Some say that
the growth of the societies _ both based in a newly constructed,
secluded facility near the Emory University campus _ reflects a
broader interest in faith and spirituality in society. Others,
however, credit the affluence of academic communities and wonder
how much discussions at the annual convention affect life and
thought about faith at the practical level. (Turnbull, Atlanta

EVERYONE NEEDS A NICKNAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday Nov. 23)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lots of people are making a big deal over the fact that the good
citizens of Minnesota elected as governor a former professional
wrestler by the name of Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, whose real name is James George Janos, beat his
Republican and Democratic opponents with 37 percent of the vote.
While this would hardly qualify as a landslide victory _
particularly since only 61 percent of registered voters bothered to
vote _ Ventura won fair and square, which is not always the case
with professional wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   Voters have elected sports stars before (Bill Bradley and Jack
Kemp come immediately to mind, as does Ronald Reagan, who played
Knute Rockne once upon a time, but that probably doesn't count),
but this is the first time, to my knowledge, that voters have
elected a pseudonym to high office.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand how the name Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura
would stick in voters minds better than the name James George
Janos, which sounds like an architectural firm or, perhaps, the
name you might give to a Little League park.
</P>
<P>
   When you consider how little of American politics is substance
and how much is advertising, it's a wonder that more candidates
haven't adopted pseudonyms as a means of getting elected (or
staying elected).
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton might not be in the trouble he is today if he had
run as Bill ``The Eunuch'' Clinton, rather than waiting for Monica
to give him her own pseudonym, Bill ``The Jerkface'' Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Newt ``The Human Ferret'' Gingrich might have extended his
political career with a kinder, gentler pseudonym, such as Newt
``Teddy Bear'' Gingrich or, possibly, Newt ``The Big, Fat, Squishy
Jelly Doughnut'' Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates could also succeed by taking the more direct
approach. You've got to believe that Bob ``Your New City
Councilman'' Smith would be more electable than plain, old,
everyday Bob Smith. Once elected, Bob Smith might change his
pseudonym to Bob ``Indicted But Never Convicted'' Smith or Bob
``Don't Think of Them As Bribes, Think of Them as Campaign
Contributions'' Smith, depending on how things had panned out.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are a former professional wrestler or some other form
of tough guy, it would probably not be wise to advertise yourself
as ``The Body'' or ``The Hulk'' or anything else that draws
attention to the fact that your idea of exercise is sitting through
a zoning variance hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Once the novelty of Jesse Ventura's victory wears off, Minnesota
voters may wish that they had elected a governor who had more
expertise in balancing a budget than in applying a sleeper hold or
delivering a flying drop kick.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, professional wrestling and professional politics have
a lot more in common than some skeptics may wish to admit, and it
may turn out that Gov. Ventura scores another surprise third-party
victory when George Bush Jr. and Al Gore knock each other out in
the 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy issues, particularly those pertaining to the
Middle East, might be better solved if Yasir ``The Scorpion''
Arafat and Benjamin ``The Plague of Locusts'' Netanyahu simply
slugged it out in the ring while ``The Body'' acted as referee.
</P>
<P>
   And if one of the combatants bashed the other over the head with
a folding chair while ``The Body'' was looking the other way, well,
that's just the way professional wrestling goes.
</P>
<P>
   And politics.

   EXHIBIT-COLOR-REVIEW (Houston) _ ``Dan Flavin/Donald Judd:
Aspects of Color'' is a paean to pure color. The exhibition
spotlights 22 works by the pioneering artists of minimalism
selected by Marianne Stockebrand, director of the Chinati
Foundation in Marfa, Texas. By PATRICIA C. JOHNSON.
</P>
<P>
   VOICE-ACTOR (Albany, N.Y.) _ How often do you get a chance to
talk with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Plucky Duck, Ralph Kramden,
Grandpa Lou Pickles, Don Knotts and Yosemite Sam all at once? In
the same room? In the same person? Meet Joe Alaskey, voice actor
and impressionist. The man hears and speaks voices, lots of voices,
all rumbling around in his head. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-HISTORY (Undated) _ ``American History X'' is a
maddening, unnerving movie. A film about a charismatic skinhead and
the violence that defines his life is doomed to exaggerate,
particularly if its creator is a TV-commercial director and
conceptual artist prone to grand gestures. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   TV-REVIEW-RUGRATS (Undated) _ ``Rugrats'' is one of those
cartoons adults hang around to watch long after the kids have
wandered out of the room. But before the holiday season is over,
you'll come to the realization that, even if you wanted to, there
is no escaping these animated toddlers. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-ELIZABETH (Undated) _ Often riveting and
occasionally ridiculous, ``Elizabeth'' offers a fresh, highly
entertaining view of the storied Virgin Queen who presided over
England's golden age. The tale of how she got the crown and
consolidated her power is an infernal descent into religious,
national and international politics that's thick with intrigue and
death. By WALTER ADDIEGO.

<P>
   TAIKO-DRUMMING (San Francisco) _ To Seiichi Tanaka, 2,000 years
of taiko drumming can be expressed in one word. Heartbeat. ``We
listen to it before we are born _ it's instinctive,'' said Tanaka.
The grand master of San Francisco Taiko Dojo, or taiko school, was
explaining the essence of ancient Japanese drumming, whose
thundering sonic power has been called visceral, sexy, soulful. By
ANNIE NAKAO.
</P>
<P>
   PIGGY-BANKS (Albany, N.Y.) _ One of the most common and
cherished vessels for loose coins is the piggy bank, which was
widely used in the 16th century in England and other European
countries, and possibly earlier. Even though pigs are often thought
of as smelly, or as bacon or pork chops, the pig also has been
viewed as lucky. By FRANCES INGRAHAM. (For release Sunday, Nov.
22.)
</P>
<P>
   DRESSING-TABLES (Albany, N.Y.) _ One very important piece of
furniture in the 18th century, which aided men and women in their
daily grooming routine, was the dressing table. Many were designed
for men only, becoming even more complicated in design after early
Georgian designs as male dandyism spread. By FRANCES INGRAHAM. (For
release Sunday, Nov. 22.)

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)

<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ There were only three reasons to
watch Thursday's House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearing. To
collect a day's pay _ that's my excuse. To see how dumb the
Republicans in Congress are. To see if special prosecutor Ken
Starr's professorial cool would crack. By ROB MORSE.

   BIBLICAL-SOCIETY _ In the 1960's the Society of Biblical

Tuesday (Nov. 21-24), some 10,000 will gather at the Walt Disney
World Swan and Dolphin hotels in Orlando. The biblical society and
its partner, the American Academy of Religion, will conduct 650
individual seminars. The program book is 350 pages. Some say that
the growth of the societies _ both based in a newly constructed,
secluded facility near the Emory University campus _ reflects a
broader interest in faith and spirituality in society. Others,
however, credit the affluence of academic communities and wonder
how much discussions at the annual convention affect life and
thought about faith at the practical level. (Turnbull, Atlanta

   HARBOR _ Over the decades, the Georgia State Ports Authority has
steadily deepened Savannah Harbor to accommodate new bigger ships.
At the turn of the century, the harbor's depth was 20 feet to
accommodate steamships hauling cotton and timber, but by 1990 it
had been dredged to 42 feet deep to float Titanic-size container
ships. Now, the authority is forging ahead with a $260 million
project to deepen the harbor another six feet, and it has triggered
an uproar from conservationists and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, who say the project will irreparably harm the lower
Savannah River and the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge, one of
the crown jewels of the nation's refuge system and one of the
nation's places harboring extensive freshwater marshes for ducks
and migrating birds. (Seabrook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 70.

   JEWISH _ PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. _ Susan Ferrara is a
committeed Jew who married a Catholic, and as far as the rabbis are
concerned, that disqualifies her from being considered a positive
role model in a community increasingly desperate to lower a soaring
intermarriage rate. The opinion does not have the weight of
religious law behind it _ like the Pope's rulings _ and can be
ignored by rabbi's within the Conservative movement at no
consequence. But the very fact that it was written illuminates the
intensifying struggle within the Jewish community against
intermarriage and the two tacts Jewish institutions are taking to
combat it. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post). 22. WITH PHOTO.

intermarriage and the two tacts Jewish institutions are taking to
combat it. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post). 22. WITH PHOTO.

PREVIEW OF `STAR WARS' IS FORCE TO RECKON WITH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Six months from now, you'll be waiting in line to see
one of the most anticipated movies ever. But you won't have to wait
to see two minutes of it.
</P>
<P>
   The first theatrical trailer for ``Star Wars: Episode One _ The
Phantom Menace'' will be shown in theaters throughout the country
starting this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The two-minute-and-20-second trailer also is available on the
Internet and on TV. It will be shown Monday on ``Access
Hollywood,'' and it should also pop up on CNN and E!
</P>
<P>
   Although billed by Lucasfilm as a ``teaser trailer'' _ implying
it has little footage _ the new ``Star Wars'' preview is more than
that. With quick-cut editing and startling juxtapositions, it
brandishes grandly elaborate clips filled with dazzling effects,
important chunks of dialogue and tantalizing looks at many major
characters _ all scored with John Williams' rousing music.
</P>
<P>
   The first posters for the film also just appeared. These show a
young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) on the desert planet of
Tatooine, where the shadow he casts forms the outline of the man
he'll become: Darth Vader, chief villain of the original ``Star
Wars'' trilogy from 1977 to 1983. Those films actually were Parts
4-6 in creator George Lucas' envisioned nine-part space saga.
</P>
<P>
   Due May 21, 1999, ``Episode One'' _ directed by Lucas _ will be
the first of three prequels tracing events in the saga from
Vader's, or Anakin's, infancy.
</P>
<P>
   One scene in the trailer shows Anakin's father, played by Liam
Neeson, introducing him to the character of Obi-Wan Kenobi, played
by Alec Guinness in the original trilogy and now by Ewan McGregor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi,'' Neeson says. It's a
line as significant as any in the saga, considering that the
characters one day will fight to the death.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways, too, the trailer mixes icons from the original
trilogy with spectacular new images and characters. The tiny Yoda _
at a younger age _ and the droid R2-D2 both arise here, as well as
the droid C-3PO in an earlier form, without his golden shell.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also see glimpses of Jar Jar, an amusing new character,
and armies of ``battle droids.''
</P>
<P>
   Fan rumors indicate these invade the home planet of a queen who
flees for help and makes an emergency landing on Tatooine. (Sound
familiar?)
</P>
<P>
   The trailer also features fiery space battles, breakneck chases
and glimpses of other stars such as Samuel L. Jackson and Natalie
Portman.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, you can download the trailer from the official
Web site at www.starwars.com. Or you can see continuous showings _
but not download _ via www.houstonchronicle.com/movies.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has been buzzing with fan activity about the film
for months, and it's a good place to find information and
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is going nuts over this,'' said Scott Chitwood,
25, a civil engineer in Houston who's co-founder of the fan Web
site www.theforce.net. ``Everything we gossiped about _ what Darth
Maul (one of the bad guys) looks like, for instance _ is shown.''
</P>
<P>
   Chitwood said fans worried that today's computer-animated
effects would look ``cartoony'' compared to the models used in the
original films.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's amazing. It looks really good. And we've heard from
some people at ILM (Industrial Light and Magic, the effects'
producer), who say we haven't seen anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the trailer emerged, he said, ``every `Star Wars' Web
site basically locked up.'' His own site went from 3,000 hits a day
to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of sites, but we get a lot of traffic
because we update almost every day and we cover the prequels
through inside sources that leak information,'' he said. ``The
trailer showed everything we'd been posting for the last year, and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Some merchandise from the film also is appearing in stores _
briefly.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Battle Droid with STAP'' toy (a droid on a flying cycle)
reportedly has been snatched up from shelves within minutes of its
release.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, it's going to be a long six months.

BRIGHT, GLOWING HUES REFLECT IMPRESSIVE FLAVIN/JUDD WORKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATRICIA C. JOHNSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If color were a liquid, you could imbibe it, swim in
it.
</P>
<P>
   If it were a solid, you could shape it.
</P>
<P>
   But since sculptor Dan Flavin found a way to release it, you can
walk in it. And the way in which it was wedded to material by
sculptor Donald Judd allows you to touch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Flavin/Donald Judd: Aspects of Color'' at the Menil
Collection is a paean to pure color. The exhibition at the Menil
Collection spotlights 22 works by the pioneering artists of
minimalism selected by Marianne Stockebrand, director of the
Chinati Foundation in Marfa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to emphasize color,'' she said, ``because Judd and
Flavin carried it a step further than the previous generation. They
took color away from flat surfaces and let it expand
three-dimensionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Flavin and Judd discovered their road early in their lives.
Heirs to a long line of abstraction, from Kazimir Malevich and Piet
Mondrian in Europe at the turn of the century to Barnett Newman in
the United States at mid-century, they rejected the emotional and
spiritual properties attached to the art of the previous
generation, and embraced impersonal qualities in their stead.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, they shelved the classical debate between the
Rubenistes, followers of Peter Paul Rubens, who advocated color as
being ``more true to nature'' and appealing to the senses, and the
Pouissinists, who upheld Nicolas Poussin's emphasis on line, which
the master argued was based on reason and appealed to the mind.
With Flavin and Judd, the issue is moot.
</P>
<P>
   The works they created defy description except in the most basic
physical terms. Flavin's fluorescent fixtures and Judd's sharp
geometric shapes have size, scale and color; they occupy space and
have a material basis. It's possible to peel back each element like
the skins of an onion, measure them, turn them this way and that,
and even understand them.
</P>
<P>
   Just give them the facts, that's all that's needed, Flavin
advised.
</P>
<P>
   But the cold facts don't address their effect. It's the
complicity among the different elements that matters and remains
exposed, if unexplained. Installed in six contiguous galleries, the
Flavins and Judds develop a dialogue into which the viewer is
welcome. The complex, visual response to the work translates into
instantaneous sensual experience; and the wow factor at first
meeting becomes a meditative journey.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
XXXXXXX &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Donald Judd (1928-1994) studied philosophy at Columbia and
painting at the Art Students League, and grew increasingly
dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to give up painting,'' he said, because ``no matter what
you do, you still end up with a picture.''
</P>
<P>
   He rejected subject matter and contended that material and
content were one and the same. From the earliest work in
three-dimensions, he eliminated pedestals and emphasized volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shape, a volume, a color, a surface is something itself,''
he wrote. ``It shouldn't be concealed as part of a firmly different
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   His new art demanded a new context in which to exhibit it. In
Marfa, he created crystalline spaces where art by him and by
artists he admired, like Flavin, could be seen as he envisioned and
in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of his unique inside/outside museum, now called the
Chinati Foundation, is Judd's installation of 100 perfectly milled
aluminum cubes that both reflect and refract the incomparable light
of West Texas, and are dematerialized by it. It is considered by
many to be Judd's masterpiece. Indeed, seeing his work in this vast
and austerely beautiful context is crucial to understanding the
seamlessness he sought between art and architecture and their
environment. Stockebrand's installation at the Menil is an elegant
(and accessible) introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Judd's predilection was for lush materials, including Plexiglas
and polished metals such as brass and aluminum; and he favored
opulent colors like carmine, royal purple and forest green. The
hard-edge geometry and linearity of his sculpture approaches
sublime order, and every detail of construction, from the placement
of the smallest screw to the immaculate finish of the surfaces, is
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the industrial appearance of these inexpressive
shapes are what makes his primary structures seductive and
infinitely allusive with light, the life-force which animates them.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the untitled piece at the entrance to the exhibit. The
facts of this paradigmatic sculpture are simple: Five identical,
independent cubes fabricated from brass and red Plexiglas are
installed at equidistant intervals on a clear, white wall.
Illumination is both natural, from a side window, and from overhead
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The frontal planes of immaculate brass reflect the changing
light and passing shadows; the translucent plastic surfaces, on the
other hand, permit light's passage through them, painting the wall
and adjacent planes in a rainbow of mercurochrome red. The shifting
point of view, like the different light sources, affects the total
sculpture as the reflective and refractive properties of the
materials working in the environment create fugitive shadows and
interlocking planes of color.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Judd explored pellucid materials, real and illusory
voids, so did he work with opaqueness and solids. The 1989
arrangement alternates rectangular, open boxes fabricated from
aluminum left bare and enameled in industrial shades of red, blue,
yellow, black and white (and variations, including turquoise, rose
and pumpkin). They are stacked and riveted with mathematical
precision into a a configuration like a long, low bookcase. It is a
piece as intransigent as his canatilevered ``stacks'' sculptures
are translucent and Flavin's fluorescent works appear ephemeral.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
XXXXXXXX &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dan Flavin (1933-1996) had no formal training in art, and with
the exception of a group of so-called ``icons'' dated 1959-61, in
which he combined flat painted areas with light, he worked
exclusively with fluorescent tubes as his material.
</P>
<P>
   He used only manufacturers' standard fixtures, available in four
lengths _ 3-, 4-, 6- and 8 feet; and limited his palette to the 10
standard colors _ red, yellow, green, blue, pink, ultraviolet and
four tones of white (daylight, soft, cool and warm).
</P>
<P>
   With this pared down art arsenal, Flavin designed pieces that
redefine the spaces they inhabit. They dissolve the architecture
that contains them and infuse the atmosphere with nearly palpable
hues. In the present installation, the viewer stands in the center
of one gallery, surrounded by air tinted green by the zigging
untitled piece on the wall behind him, and see into the next
gallery where four corner pieces _ two blue horizontals and two
pink verticals _ transform normally clear air into a wash of
violet.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant piece is a magnificent corridor of colored light.
``Untitled (to Barry, Mike, Chuck and Leonard)'' is a rectangular
space with impeccable white walls and 8-foot ceiling separated into
two cubes by a grate of brilliant colored light. The grate is
constructed from 22, 8-foot fixtures, 11 pink ones, and 11 yellow
ones, aligned precisely back to back in upright position. Each bank
of lights saturates the space it faces with its intense color.
</P>
<P>
   The two halves of the corridor must be entered separately. The
viewer is immediately and thoroughly enveloped by color while his
gaze slips in, around and past its luminous source. Surrounded by
buttery yellow, the intense pink on the other side appears
diminished to a gentle rose; bathed in the brilliant strawberry
pink, the warm yellow looks chartreuse.
</P>
<P>
   Optical science explains the retinal response, the
transformation of hues, visual perception and so on. But the
painted air is a metaphysical cloak that defies such explanations.
</P>
<P>
   The permanent installation Flavin designed for the Menil's
annex, Richmond Hall, expands on both the physical and the wow
factor.
</P>
<P>
   This major piece, premiering tonight, was the last commission by
Dominique de Menil for the museum, and the final work created by
the artist.
</P>
<P>
   It is 82,000 cubic feet of glowing hues.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of it are 124, 4-foot fixtures in pink, yellow, green
and blue, installed vertically in two tiers of 31 fixtures each, on
two opposing walls, that are 126 feet long and 50 feet apart. These
glowing stripes of color are set in precise color order (pink,
yellow, green and blue) that is repeated down the length of the
wall, with a double row of ultraviolet fixtures set between them
and parallel to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all. The lights on the upper row are angled
slightly toward the back of the hall, while the the orientation on
the lower register is exactly the opposite. The result is an
illuminated grid and a fluid wave of color that washes across the
wall and is reflected off the polished floor, cresting at the
source and leaving rich echoes everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a luminous frieze of green outlines the hall's upper
edge as ``a gesture for the neighborhood,'' Flavin told the Menil.
Its discrete placement at the roofline two stories high and on the
side walls, quietly identifies the hall as separate and special in
this generally understated neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
XXXXXXX &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the Chinati Foundation, another closure is taking place. The
Flavin piece Judd wanted for his outpost of international art was
conceived and paid for in the 1970s when Chinati was part of the
Dia Foundation, established and funded by de Menil's daughter,
Philippa, but it was never realized.
</P>
<P>
   Flavin completed his design for Chinati shortly before his
death. The installation, his largest at an estimated 32,000 square
feet, and conceptually akin to ``Untitled (to Barry, Mike, Chuck
and Leonard),'' will occupy six of Chinati's U-shaped barracks. The
fixtures, in combinations of pink and green, yellow and blue, and
two with all four colors, will be installed at a 70-degree angle:
Four at the corners of the building, two others halving the U at
the short end.
</P>
<P>
   About $1 million of the $1.5 million needed for the project is
on hand, Stockebrand said. Bids are beginning to be solicited, and
hopefully, work will begin in the spring. &QL;

HOME NETWORKING GOING MAINSTREAM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Two and a half years ago, Bob Bennett had to be
careful about the language he used.
</P>
<P>
   When the co-founder of Sharewave approached investors about
funding his company, he was keenly aware that what his company was
working on _ home networking _ was a dirty word.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd say to me, `Why would anyone want a network in their
home?''' Bennett recalled.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference 30 months makes.
</P>
<P>
   At the sprawling Comdex trade show this week, Bennett no longer
had to be shy about what El Dorado Hills, Calif.-based Sharewave
does. ``Home networking'' has gone from being an object of derision
to becoming the hottest topic in the tech industry, the official
Next Big Thing in personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech prophets now believe that home networking is about to
move out of the realm of the hardcore computing enthusiast and into
that of the mainstream PC user. That's because technologies such as
Sharewave's have simplified the once-agonizing process of setting
up a network in a home.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DATA MOVE 70 TIMES FASTER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sharewave's solution is wireless. Companies that license its
systems can create devices that can move data through the air at 4
megabits a second, or more than 70 times faster than today's
zippiest phone modems.
</P>
<P>
   Personal electronics giant Philips has created the first product
using Sharewave's system. Without wires, the Ambi connects any TV
to a PC and turns that TV into the equivalent of Gateway's
Destination PC/TV or Compaq Computer Corp.'s now-discontinued PC
Theatre. With Ambi running, you can surf the Web, play a round of
Quake II deathmatch, work on a spreadsheet or print a document from
the comfort of your living room sofa.
</P>
<P>
   Philips isn't sure how much Ambi will cost when it ships in
January, but Bennett said it will be in the $500-$700 range.
</P>
<P>
   That may be a little pricey, given that for $700 you can buy a
full-featured PC. But Philips is banking on convenience and the
allure of the wireless aspect to drive sales. And, of course, as is
the case with anything having to do with computers, the price
likely will come down fast.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies showing home networking schemes at Comdex are
taking different approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Netgear, one of the first companies to market a traditional home
networking kit with two ethernet cards and a hub (see
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/98/04/24/compute.html), will
start selling next summer a kit that uses the existing telephone
wiring in a home. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Netgear is a division
of Bay Networks, which sells networking equipment to big
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Netgear's product, which will sell for about $200, will include
two cards you pop in a pair of computers. Using standard telephone
cables, you plug the cards into a phone jack. Using technology
created by a company called Epigram of Sunnyvale, Calif., the PCs
can communicate through the wiring in your home at 10 megabits a
second _ the same speed as traditional ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   The network connection doesn't interfere with standard phone
operations. You can place a call, or use your modem to connect to
the Internet, and run the network at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PACKAGES SELLING BRISKLY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lo, a vice president and general manager with Netgear,
said the company will continue to sell its regular home networking
package, though a faster version _ one that connects PCs at 100
megabits a second _ likely will replace the 10-megabit version.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the growing interest in home networking, Lo says
both the 10- and 100-megabit kits are selling briskly. In fact,
Netgear can't meet the demand for the faster kit.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest names in computing are also getting into the
action. 3Com has launched an initiative that will use the Epigram
technology. Diamond Multimedia is selling a 1-megabit home
networking kit that uses phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   And Houston-based Compaq next year will introduce a phone-line
solution based on technology by Tut Systems of Pleasant Hill,
Calif. Compaq already is ahead of the curve, placing ethernet
connections in most of its Presario PCs. Rod Schrock, Compaq's
senior vice president for the consumer division, said network
connections can be found in Presarios priced as low as $799.
</P>
<P>
   The question that Bennett was asked 30 months ago remains,
however. What are consumers going to do with home networks?
</P>
<P>
   Most think shared Internet and multiplayer games are the key. As
high-speed Net access becomes more widespread _ via cable modems
and the phone companies' Digital Subscriber Lines _ families will
want to have access to this higher bandwidth via all the PCs in the
home.
</P>
<P>
   And most new computer games produced today have some multiplayer
element to them. Other games are on the horizon that are
multiplayer-only, such as id Software's upcoming Quake III: Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are the coming ``information appliances'' _ small
devices that connect to a PC but perform specific tasks. For
example, you might have an e-mail device in your kitchen to check
messages or a Web browser device in your bedroom to check the news
and weather when you get up in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   At first, applications like these will be found in the homes of
the affluent and tech-savvy. But as prices come down and the
benefits become more obvious, the networked home may become a
common bit of magic in the new millennium.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a Hitachi Laptop with Windows 95, Microsoft Word 6.0
and Netscape Navigator 3.0. People have sent me e-mails with
pictures they have scanned into their computer. When I print the
e-mail right out of Navigator's mail, the text prints but the
picture doesn't. When I copy the file to Word, or to a floppy, and
then try to print it out of Word, all I get is a page full of
letters, numbers and symbols. Can you tell me how I can print out
these pictures?
</P>
<P>
   A: Depending on how Navigator is set up on your system, you may
be able to change a setting and print from the mail client. If that
doesn't work, you have other alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   First, click on the View menu on the mail client and make sure
that ``View attachments inline'' is clicked. This will show the
attachment on the same page as the e-mail text, and should print
the attachment this way as well.
</P>
<P>
   That is, so long as Navigator can see the attachment as a
graphic. Navigator can view GIF and JPG files, but not BMP files,
which are native to Windows and OS/2.
</P>
<P>
   If Navigator's mail shows the attachment as a link at the bottom
of the mail, right-click on it and choose Save. Then, use a
graphics program such as Paint Shop Pro (www.jasc.com) or a
graphics viewer such as LView (www.lview.com) to view and print the
file.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've purchased a new hard drive and want to install Windows
98. Can I get by with just the upgrade without reinstalling Windows
95, or do I have to install Windows 95?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, you don't have to have Windows 95 on that drive in order
to use the upgrade disk. But you will need a copy of Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   If the Windows 98 upgrade does not find Windows 95 on the
computer, it will prompt you for a Windows 95 disk. Insert either
the first Windows 95 setup floppy, or the CD, into the computer.
Windows 98 will then let you proceed with the installation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently purchased one of the Dell Inspirion 7000s with the
15-inch screen. The computer is wonderful, but the screen has a
small white dot in the lower left corner. When I contacted the Dell
tech support to inquire about this, they indicated that even though
there was a single dot, it was ``within the standards'' of the
screen manufacturer. He indicated that if I wanted, I could return
it and get a new notebook. However, he couldn't guarantee that the
new notebook wouldn't have one or more dots either. He indicated a
single dot was not uncommon. What is your opinion on this? Should I
go ahead and return the computer and get a new one, or should I
just deal with what I have? What are the chances of getting an
active matrix screen without faults?

   A: If it's not acceptable to you, it doesn't matter whether it
falls within industry guidelines. Return the computer and get a new
one. If that one has a white dot _ which is actually a defective
pixel on the screen _ then consider getting a different computer if
you can't live with it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, one or two bad pixels is a common occurrence with
active-matrix screens. And, yes, it's acceptable in the industry _
which means that if a PC maker receives screens that have a couple
of bad pixels, they can't return them to the screen maker. You can,
though.
</P>
<P>
   However, the technician is right. There's no guarantee any of
the machines you get _ from Dell or any other PC maker _ will have
perfect screens. But keep trying until you are a satisfied
customer.

RELIGION CLOUDS WORK BIAS ISSUES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Anita Hill accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence
Thomas of sexually harassing her, more women came forward with
similar stories.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as conservative religious groups have become more
politically active _ and consequently more visible _ employees are
more eager to take on what they see as religious discrimination at
work.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, religious discrimination complaints have focused
on accommodation issues, such as not getting time off from work to
attend religious services or being forbidden from wearing religious
symbols.
</P>
<P>
   But a new wrinkle has developed in religious discrimination
cases. Suddenly, workers are complaining that company policies that
prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians conflict with
their religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has surfaced because more companies are offering
same-sex domestic partner benefits, in addition to their pledges
against discrimination. Those moves, which have come largely from
America's biggest employers, which are seeking to attract a diverse
group of employees, have been applauded by the gay and lesbian
community.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TOLERANCE VS. BIBLICAL TEACHING &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People derive their beliefs on sexual behavior based on their
religious beliefs, said Kelly Shackelford, chief counsel for the
Liberty Legal Institute, a religious freedom and First Amendment
group in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It's become politically correct to be tolerant of gays and
lesbians, but people who feel homosexuality is against biblical
teachings are coming forward, Shackelford said. Some are being
punished for their opinions, which is a violation of the laws that
forbid religious discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   That comes as a surprise to many employers who never realized
that their new policies could spawn a religious discrimination
complaint, he said. Complaints are popping up when an employee says
something opposing the new policy or quotes scripture and,
suddenly, the company comes down on them like they've made a racist
or sexist remark, Shackelford said.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty Legal Institute is representing a former vice
president of then-Texas Commerce Bank in San Antonio (now Chase
Bank of Texas) who Shackelford said was fired a month after she
said in a bank diversity training seminar that she opposed its new
policy prohibiting discrimination against gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Shackelford said that Betty Sabatino, who worked in the bank's
trust department for 10 years, said she had a religious objection
to the homosexual conduct the bank was protecting when the speaker
asked the audience if anyone had questions.
</P>
<P>
   He said Sabatino, a Lutheran, got a call from her boss, who
complained she was embarrassed by Sabatino's remarks. Later,
Shackelford said, a corporate representative suggested to Sabatino
that she seek psychological counseling. About a month later,
Sabatino was fired, Shackelford said. The institute would not make
Sabatino available for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Chase officials said they couldn't comment directly on the
lawsuit but could speak about the bank's diversity policy.
</P>
<P>
   Chase expects its employees to treat each other and customers
with respect so people can feel that they can be themselves, said
Melanie McKittrick, senior vice president and director of corporate
diversity. The bank wants to ensure that everyone has a chance to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   It's critical to attract a wide range of people because they
offer different perspectives and can tap a broader customer market,
McKittrick said. Diversity is a business-driven initiative.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FREE SPEECH AT ISSUE, TOO &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Schans, regional legal coordinator with the Rutherford
Institute, said she isn't familiar with the Sabatino case but from
the facts provided, Schans said Sabatino has a right to free speech
under the civil rights law that forbids religious discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   She took a religious stance at the invitation of the bank and
that is protected activity, said Schans, whose Charlottesville,
Va.-based organization is better known for its representation of
Paula Jones in her sexual harassment case against President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Schans said she has heard of several cases in which employees
have quit their jobs because their employer offers same-sex
domestic partner benefits. That would be a more difficult lawsuit
to file because an employee who was offended by the policy would
have to prove he was discriminated against in some way by the
company.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: The case that wasn't there
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Ken Starr probably made some friends in his
appearance before the House Judiciary Committee. He was amiable,
diffident and respectful under rough handling by Democrats. He
seemed like the kind of guy who would mow your lawn if you came
down with a bad back.
</P>
<P>
   What was remarkable about his testimony was what wasn't there:
Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate, Vince Foster, sex, Linda Tripp
and her tapes. All gone.
</P>
<P>
   What counted, Starr insisted, was perjury and obstruction of
justice in the Lewinsky matter. Small lies were as bad as big,
Starr said. In other words, if you care to look at it this way, the
four-year, $40 million investigation had only turned up offenses
committed against the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Lewinsky mess went public, Bill Clinton was in hot
water, as much at home as in Congress. He started dissembling _ OK,
lying _ and dodging like crazy. He sent his lawyers into court to
hold things up, floating executive privilege as a defense. Starr
thinks delaying him with lame legal theories is obstruction. That
sets a high standard for American lawyers, for whom delay is a
comfortable source of income. If Starr's theory holds, we could
easily throw every lawyer in the country in the slam. It's
tempting.
</P>
<P>
   Another question emerged the other day: If all those primary
investigations came up empty, when did Ken Starr know it, and why
did he hold up saying so?

HOUSE CALL
</HEADLINE>
  TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR Nov. 20.  
 By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody leads with Kenneth Starr's House call and give up
about half of the rest of their fronts to various aspects of the
quote news unquote. Thursday the papers told you what he would say.
Today they tell you what he did say. They don't tell you it's the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today calls Thursday's proceeding ``marathon, heavily
partisan'' and says Starr ``generally kept his cool'' as he
personally made his brief against President Clinton. The paper sees
in the end-of-the-day exchanges between Starr and Clinton's
personal attorney David Kendall ``a dramatic prime-time showdown of
legal heavyweights.'' The Washington Post notes instead that Starr
seemed more professorial than prosecutorial.
</P>
<P>
   As USAT, the New York Times and the WP note, there was little
discussion of Starr's conclusions, the emphasis falling instead on
Starr's motives and conduct--the main issues there being whether or
not Starr had an antecedent bias against Bill Clinton, had
inappropriate connections to the Paula Jones defense team, whether
he had unlawfully detained Monica Lewinsky and/or violated her
right to an attorney and indeed, whether he had lied about his
treatment of her in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   There was also some discussion of whether or not Starr illegally
leaked to the press. The Los Angeles Times alone highlights Starr's
sole concession in the face of all this: that perhaps when
requesting from Janet Reno expansion of his charge into
Jones-related matters, he should have informed her of the
discussions he'd previously had with Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The WP notes that in contrast to the 453-page report Starr
served up in September, the day's discussions were distinctly
G-rated. The Post even quantifies the point, noting that in Starr's
opening remarks, he used ``sex'' or ``sexual'' just four times,
compared to at least 60 references to ``truth'' or ``lying.''
Everybody prints one of the day's few carnal references: Democratic
Rep. John Conyers' characterization of Starr as a ``federally paid
sex policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reports that on Wednesday night, the
Judiciary Democrats got their hands on General Accounting Office
figures on Ken Starr's office expenditures, which, a congressional
source is quoted as saying, are potentially embarrassing, in that
they detail payments for consultants and outside investigators. The
paper says that to keep the Dems from using the material during the
hearings Thursday, Henry Hyde declared it confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT and LAT say Starr testified Clinton could, after leaving
office, be prosecuted for perjury. But the WP and USAT say Starr
didn't answer the question. According to a USAT poll, respondents
give Starr positive reviews, but also want their House member to
vote against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for real Lewinsky spontaneity, you had to be in Japan
with the president, where, the papers all report, during a ``town
meeting,'' Bill Clinton was asked by an Osaka housewife how he
apologized to his wife and daughter for his affair. Clinton replied
that he did so ``in a direct and straightforward manner.'' The NYT
says Clinton expected such a question on the trip, primarily
dedicated to economic issues. The LAT says the White House did not
count on the scandal coming up, because of the ``Japanese people's
famous reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The WSJ runs a useful feature describing what signs to look for
to tell if the global economic crisis is coming to a close. The
list includes: When the financial markets yawn in the face of bad
news, when yields on emerging market bonds go down, when inflation
jitters return, when commodity prices rise, when emerging nations
start importing more, and when Japan's economy starts to expand
again.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a sign of how much money is washing around
this country is on full display in USAT's front-pager on expensive
toys. It seems that nowadays you don't have to go to FAO Schwarz to
sink serious money into silly stuff. According to the paper, 8
percent of the items at Toys R Us go for $100 or more, as do five
of the fifteen top-selling toys this year. Essentials like Kawasaki
Ninja Power Wheels and My Interactive Pooh.
</P>
<P>
   The fronts at the NYT, WP and LAT all feature stories about
alarming new research (to be published today in the British Medical
Journal) about the death toll in China from smoking. Right now, it
seems cigarettes kill 700,000 Chinese per year, most of them men in
their middle years. Unless the country's habits change, this rate
is forecast to multiply fourfold within 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly perjury, but the LAT observes that during
Thursday's proceedings, Ken Starr sat at the witness table on top
of a briefcase, ``which made him appear taller.''

 Order Out of Business Card Chaos  
 By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business cards are the bane of my existence. Everywhere I go I
collect them. I swear that I'll enter them into my database as soon
as I get back to the hotel. I'll do maybe one or two, but then
fatigue creeps in and sleep is more important. At the end of each
trip, I dump the stack of cards in a desk drawer with all the rest
of those that I've never typed into the computer. The desk draw is
full.
</P>
<P>
   The problem becomes especially acute during conventions and
trade shows. As you read this, I'll be at Comdex in Las Vegas,
where 200,000 of my best friends will all try to give me their
business cards. There is no room in my desk drawer.
</P>
<P>
   Something had to be done. The something is to take another look
at business card scanners. I had one several years ago, but I
quickly stopped using it because the Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) software just didn't work very well. The problem was that
companies and individuals try to make their cards distinctive. That
distinctiveness -- fancy fonts, intricate logos and sideways
printing -- caused real headaches for the scanning software.
</P>
<P>
   With the right software, you can use just about any
TWAIN-complaint scanner, but there are several companies that make
dedicated business card scanners. I tested Corex Technologies'
CardScan 300. The company was one of the first into the market and
is one of the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It took very little time to get up and running. It took exactly
22 minutes from the time I opened the box, including reading the
Quick Start Guide, until I scanned my first card into the system.
My only complaint about the process was that the A/C power brick is
as heavy as a real brick. I can't remember when I've seen a heavier
one. It weighs more than the scanner. I'm going to have to have a
really good reason to scan cards on the road before I lug that
thing around. Cards are going to get scanned when I get back home.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, the software has reached a point where it whips
through a variety of business cards without breathing hard. While
you have to feed the scanner one card at a time, it zips them
through fast enough that you can keep a steady flow going. The
software then processes them all at once -- what we old-timers call
batch mode.
</P>
<P>
   I fed through 156 cards and the software failed to read only 4
of them. Each one was really off the chart. One was gold leaf with
Old English script. Another had a black background with silver
letters. The third had a picture and the text wrapped around it.
The last one had all the text woven through the company's logo.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that all the cards were translated perfectly.
I had to edit about five percent of them. But even those edits were
minor. I had one from a professor whose titles ran on forever. The
software has a simple solution when it cannot figure out where to
put information. It dumps it all in a category called ``Other'' and
lets you figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   While the ability to accurately read, translate and properly
categorize business cards is the core of the product, I was most
impressed with how well it then moved that data into other programs
and devices. This is no mean feat. The CD-ROM comes with a version
with a version of Intellisync for all the popular personal
information manager (PIM) software products. It also lets you link
directly to Palm Pilot and Windows CE devices. I had it set to
update my address book in both Outlook 98 and my Palm III. It
worked the first time without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Card Scan software is quite good as a stand alone contact
manager. While it lacks the functionality of the full-featured
programs, I found it wonderful as a sort of clearing house for
database clean up. On occasions, a hot sync will fail during a
normal Palm Pilot transfer, and when it finally works again, I can
end up with duplicate entries. The Card Scan software has a ``find
duplicate'' function and it took no time to get rid of the excess.
A re-sync and all my databases matched.
</P>
<P>
   Two pleasant things developed during this evaluation, I found
the card of a missing friend and my desk drawer is now half empty.

ARTS(AT)LARGE 
 HIGH-TECH COMPANIES SLOW TO SUPPORT HIGH-TECH ART 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to Bill Viola, David Ross was able to play Andrew S.
Grove like a fiddle. But high-tech companies' support for
multimedia creativity still sounds more like a string trio than a
symphony.
</P>
<P>
   During a retrospective of Viola's video art at the Whitney
Museum of American Art in New York last spring, Ross, then the
Whitney's director, led Grove, chairman of the mammoth chip maker
Intel Corp., on a tour of the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was blown away by it,'' Ross, now the director of the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art, recalled in a recent telephone
interview. ``From that point on, the conversations with others at
Intel became a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Those conversations culminated in a late-September announcement
that Intel would commit $6 million to sponsor ``The American
Century: Art and Culture 1900-2000,'' a sprawling overview
scheduled to open at the Whitney in April before moving to SFMOMA
in May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy was impressed'' by the Viola tour, said Dana Houghton,
Intel's director of corporate affairs. ``Andy had been pretty
lukewarm. He's chairman of the company, and if he's lukewarm, it's
pretty hard to spend 6 million bucks without him knowing about it.
I don't know if it was Viola's work or Ross's salesmanship --
probably a combination of both.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the grant is believed to be the largest ever given
to an art museum for a specific exhibit -- and the $6 million
figure does not include another $2 million to $4 million for what
Houghton described as ``digital extensions'' to the show, including
an education-oriented Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant to those interested in digital art is Intel's
willingness to finance commissions if the museums decide they want
to complement the ``American Century'' exhibit with new work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got money to do those kinds of things,'' Houghton said.
``Those are not real high-budget programs. You could do quite a bit
for a couple hundred thousand bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if that amount seems small in context, it represents a
remarkable departure for the computer industry, which has been slow
in supporting the new-media arts initiatives that its own
technology has enabled.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the heart of Silicon Valley, known as a hothouse
for digital creativity, the San Jose Museum of Art has not
progressed as quickly as officials had expected in collecting funds
for a 900-square-foot multimedia center, bringing in just half of
its $1.3 million goal so far. Among the projects planned for the
space, scheduled to open in a year, are a computer-based
three-dimensional recreation of the avant-garde electronic-art show
in the Pepsi pavilion at the 1970 World's Fair in Osaka, Japan, as
well as an Internet database providing access to the work of Bay
Area new media artists.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after its Whitney pledge, Intel did make a donation of
$10,000 to the San Jose center. Josi Callan, the museum's director,
said she was pleased that the chip maker was finally supporting the
arts in a substantial way, but that it was a ``bit of a
disappointment that it wasn't closer to home.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that Silicon Valley denizens are not
always accustomed to encountering high-tech art, said Randall
Packer, the San Jose art museum's director of multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is also a contributor to the newly reopened Tech Museum of
Innovation in San Jose, which has a high-tech art gallery called
``Center of the Edge.'' During a recent visit, Packer heard an
attendant describe one virtual-reality piece, Michael Naimark's
``Be Now Here,'' as ``the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who work in the industry here are not particularly
interested in art,'' Packer said. ``They're interested in
technology, and they love the idea that there's a museum where you
can go see the latest technology -- and have fun. But in terms of
the sociocultural context of technology, that's just not what turns
them on. That's why I'm so impressed with David's work with Andy
Grove. He somehow managed to spark his imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hero, president of Community Foundation Silicon Valley,
which promotes philanthropy in the region, confirmed that ``there
aren't any really big corporate givers to the arts out here.''
</P>
<P>
   But a major factor that hinders arts giving in the area, Hero
explained, is that most of the companies are young, staffed by
employees who are relatively new to the region and managed by
executives who do not yet grasp that a strong cultural base can
help attract and retain workers. ``They just don't feel that
community obligation yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hero recalled a conversation several years ago with Bill
Hewlett, co-founder of the Hewlett-Packard Company, who he said
told him, ``Don't be so frustrated. These companies are so new. We
weren't really known for our charitable giving until we were 20
years old, but that was in 1964.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: some high-tech companies have supported, and
continue to support, traditional arts programs. While they are not
as closely associated with the arts as Philip Morris, Sara Lee,
Texaco and Reader's Digest, technology companies like IBM and
Hewlett-Packard actively support museums, orchestras and other
cultural institutions. Microsoft Corp. even has an art acquisition
committee that arranges for works to be displayed throughout the
software giant's campus.
</P>
<P>
   The largest gesture on this front was the Oct. 27 announcement
that five Dell Computer Corp. executives and their wives would
donate $13 million toward the construction of a new $35 million
home for the Austin Museum of Art, which is near Dell's home base
of Round Rock, Tex. Elizabeth Ferrer, the museum's director, said
one of the building's exhibit spaces would be designated as the Art
and Technology Gallery, devoted exclusively to artists who
incorporate technology into their work.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the National Endowment for the Arts is still
coping with budget cutbacks, this kind of support from the
high-tech community is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Jedlicka, president of the Business Committee for the
Arts in New York, said, ``High-tech companies are involved in the
arts; they just don't receive a lot of publicity for their
involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose art museum's Packer said: ``It's difficult to have
the opportunity to deal with highly educated people who are
interested in culture in Silicon Valley. Sometimes you wonder if
they really exist.''

FORMER PLAYMATE WINS ROUND IN FIGHT OVER WEB SITE LABELS 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terri Welles, a Playboy centerfold model turned Internet
entrepreneur, has won another significant round in court to protect
her right to use the magic words ``Playmate'' and ``Playboy'' to
promote her Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In a blow to her former employer, Playboy Enterprises Inc., the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Diego
recently affirmed a lower court ruling and refused to grant an
injunction that would have temporarily prohibited Welles from using
the bunny empire's trademarked words in her ``meta tags'' -- hidden
labels in a Web page that draw the attention of Internet search
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy, which claims that Welles' meta tags are sneaky and
unfair, is far from willing to give up the legal fight. The company
is seeking permission to add new charges to its $5 million
trademark infringement complaint and is preparing for a full-blown
trial in federal court in San Diego next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the intensifying legal scrapping, the case is helping to
answer a question that has important implications for electronic
commerce: What is the purpose of a meta tag?
</P>
<P>
   In general, meta tags provide information that is not intended
to be read by Web users. Some give instructions to users' browsers
on how a Web page should be displayed. The kind of meta tags at
issue in the Welles case provide information about the page's
content to the robots used by search engines to update their
databases. For example, the operator of an investment site might
include the words ``stocks'' and ``trading'' in the ``keyword''
meta tag of the site's home page.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy says a meta tag containing the word ``Playmate''
indicates that the site is authorized by or connected to the
Playboy empire. It says that Web users who type the keyword
``Playmate'' into a search engine could be confusingly diverted to
the Welles site, which is not affiliated with the Chicago-based
company.
</P>
<P>
   Welles's response is that a meta tag merely indicates the
contents of a particular Web site -- and that in her case, the
inclusion of the word ``Playmate'' is justified because, as her Web
pages accurately state, she is a former Playboy Playmate. Her view
has been endorsed by the courts so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Court of Appeals' ruling reaffirmed what my lawyers and I
have known all along,'' Welles said in a telephone interview. ``I
can use the words 'Playboy' and 'Playmate' as descriptive terms in
my meta tags because that was my title. That's who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Welles, a San Diego resident who was crowned Playmate of the
Year for 1981 and is now a single mother of a teen-age daughter,
said she will see the case through, despite the cost. She said she
has spent about $120,000 on legal bills to protect her Web
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so far into it, I can't see quitting,'' she said. ``This
is my livelihood. This is how I feed my daughter. And I'm right.''
</P>
<P>
   Welles's Web site, which was launched last year, features nude
photographs of herself and others, biographical notes about her
days at the Playboy Mansion and a personal appearance calendar. She
says she has 500 to 600 subscribers who pay $9.95 a month for
access to the photo collection. The site also features banners that
advertise more explicit sex sites. Along with the words
``Playmate'' and ``Playboy,'' the site's meta tags include other
keywords like ``Welles,'' ``model,'' ``naked'' and ``breasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Playboy filed a trademark suit against
Welles, claiming that her site unlawfully used its registered
trademarks, like ``Playmate'' and ``Playboy,'' in its text and in
the invisible meta tags. The company also sought a preliminary
injunction before trial -- a standard tactic in a
trademark-infringement suit.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, Judge Judith N. Keep denied Playboy's motion in
federal appeals court in San Diego. Concluding in part that Playboy
was unlikely to win its case on the merits, the judge said that
because Welles was a Playboy Playmate, she could state her title
and employment history in the text of her Web site -- a ``fair
use'' of Playboy's trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoning that a meta tag was similar to a card catalog entry
that describes the content of a book, Judge Keep said that Welles
could also use the trademarked terms in her meta tags because they
accurately reflected the contents of her site.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of the consequences of a Welles victory, Playboy
appealed the ruling to the Ninth Circuit, focusing its argument
more on the meta tag issue. But on Oct. 27, in a four-paragraph
decision that did not address the merits of the case, a three-judge
appeals panel said Judge Keep had not abused her authority in
making the decision. The case is now scheduled for a pretrial
hearing in April.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in what some legal observers have termed an
aggressive move, Playboy three weeks ago asked permission to amend
its original complaint to add a claim of trademark counterfeiting
against Welles -- a charge that, if proven, could result in
statutory damages and the seizure of her computer server, hard
drives and other alleged counterfeiting materials. The company is
also seeking to sue, as a new co-defendant, the man who originally
set up Welles' site and who actually placed the Playboy trademarks
in her meta tags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going after the webmaster puts one more degree of pressure on
Terri Welles,'' said Liam B. Lavery, an intellectual property
lawyer in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also chills the market,'' he said. ``It says, in a sense,
'Nobody ought to be doing this, otherwise we will go after you and
the person who helped you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lavery added that he believes Welles will eventually win. He
said that her situation is very different from other cases
involving meta tags, where unscrupulous Web site owners used the
trademarks of business competitors in a meta tag for no other
reason than to misdirect potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Oppedahl, a cyberspace law expert based in Colorado who was
involved in one of the first meta tag cases, agreed: ``If she was a
Playmate of the Year, how can it be wrong to tell people?''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Playboy says it is unfair and simplistic to
characterize the continuing lawsuit as a David vs. Goliath battle,
or as an effort by the company to protect the franchise of its
recently launched subscription Web site, which allows members to
view photos of past Playmates.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Francescani, a lawyer in New York who represents
Playboy, says the implications of a Welles victory are ominous for
all trademark holders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say a hard-core sex site out there posts a story about
Hugh Hefner and Playboy,'' said Francescani. Under the Terri Welles
theory, it could then embed the words ``Hefner'' and ``Playboy'' in
its meta tags because those keywords reflect the content of the
site. ``But that's not fair at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey R. Kuester, an intellectual property lawyer in Atlanta
who has written about meta tags, rejected the Playboy lawyer's
gloomy scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``What prevents a porn site from writing or posting an article
about Playboy?'' he asked. ``Nothing. It's free speech. And if
there is a legitimate editorial use of another company's
trademarks, if it's okay to use a word on a Web site from a
trademark point of view, then sticking that word in a meta tag
doesn't make it wrong.''

COLLEGE OPENS STUDENT RECORDS TO MOM AND DAD 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Deborah A. Dixon wants to see how her son, Eric, a freshman
at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania, is doing at school she no
longer has to pick up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she can power up the computer at home or at work and
visit the college's Web site. There, after punching in a user name
and a private password, she can find information ranging from
course descriptions and syllabuses to her son's grades and his bill
at the bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   It's all done with Eric's permission, via a novel computer
service launched recently at the small liberal arts college
situated about a mile from the Civil War battlefield. ``It's
wonderful, because I live so far from campus,'' said Dixon, a
Chicago resident. ``I can check on his classes and see how he's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The service is an addition to what the college has dubbed
``CNAV,'' a Web-based system developed by the school to give
students easy access to their transcripts, bills and other
information. Each student is given a password to see his or her
private records online as well as gain entry to other features,
like a computer matchmaking service that brings up courses or
extra-curricular offerings that match the student's interests.
Through CNAV, students can also see a list of names and photographs
of other students enrolled in the courses they are taking.
</P>
<P>
   It was an inadvertent misuse of the system that led college
officials to decide to open up portions of CNAV to parents,
according to Donald L. Redman, a programmer analyst who helps run
the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we'd notice that a kid would log on from campus and
then a half hour later log on from New Jersey, which, no matter how
fast you drive is just not feasible,'' he said. In other words, a
student excited about the system would invite Mom and Dad to take a
peek courtesy of his password -- and contrary to requirements that
he keep his password strictly to himself.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to the system administrators that parents might be
interested in some version of CNAV and they set about designing the
service that was unveiled at Fall Family Weekend in late October.
</P>
<P>
   About 140 parents have requested accounts with the system. They
are given their own passwords, which they use to access a number of
features, including the matchmaking service, which can call up
items that might be of interest to them. Their children decide how
much personal information they allow their parents to see. They are
given a list of six items, including grades and phone bills, and
check off which ones they want the folks at home to be able to
access.
</P>
<P>
   Eric decided to show his mother everything. ``I saw no reason
not to,'' he said. ``These are things she should see anyway --
bills, things like that. It's nothing incriminating.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say whether Gettysburg is the only college or
university to open up its student records to parents
electronically. Redman said he believes Parent CNAV is unique.
Kenneth C. Green, who directs an annual study of technology use on
campus, and Garret W. Sern, a policy analyst for Educause, an
organization that promotes the use of technology in higher
education, both said they were unaware of any similar service, but
added they could not say for sure that others don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Green said the project points to a larger trend in colleges: an
effort by administrators to use the Internet to reach the
non-campus community. ``You see more campuses looking at electronic
access for lots of different audiences, such as providing e-mail
services to alumni,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Redman said the project was launched to bring parents,
who may live hundreds of miles from campus, into the college
community. ``The point is to connect the parent to the student and
the general college atmosphere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some elementary and secondary schools are beginning to share
records with parents via the World Wide Web, too. For about a year
and a half the Uinta County School District in Wyoming has offered
parents access to everything from grades to attendance records as
part of a test of a product called PowerSchool. The product, which
is now in about 90 schools, mostly in Utah, will be officially
launched in January, according to a company sales representative.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the Gettysburg College system raises questions. Robert
Ellis Smith, the publisher of Privacy Journal, a newsletter
examining the impact of technology on privacy, said he believes the
Web is still not secure enough from hackers and other
mischief-makers to house sensitive student records, whose privacy,
he noted, is protected by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also said he hopes the system is set up so that students
fully understand what it is they are allowing their parents to see.
``Consent should be meaningful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Redman responded that administrators keep an eye on the system
to prevent unwanted intrusions. And, he said, he believes that at a
time when people increasingly conduct financial transactions over
the Web, the network can be kept safe from prying eyes. ``What we
are delivering is equal to the way that's done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Redman also said he believes that offering students a check-off
list of items to open -- or close -- to their parents helps build
informed consent into the system. ``Students have to be proactive
and say 'Yes, I want to show them that,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that not all students will be as liberal with their
check-offs as Eric. Redman recalled a comment made by one parent
during a demonstration of the system at family weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the fathers said: 'I don't think my son will let me see
his transcript. He likes to break that to me gently.'''

THE FED ISN'T DONE CUTTING 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fed's decision Tuesday to cut the fed funds rate by a
quarter point had been expected on Wall Street, and had that been
the Fed's only move it's unlikely that the stock market would have
responded to the decision as positively as it did.
</P>
<P>
   What investors may have seized upon was the Fed's decision to
also trim the discount rate--the rate banks charge each other for
overnight lending--by a quarter point, to 4.50 percent. That's the
second straight discount-rate cut for the Fed, and although the
rate itself is not of dramatic importance in the actual functioning
of the economy, it has real weight as a symbol of the Fed's ideas
about where the economy is going.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, what the discount rate cut suggests is that the
Fed may not be done trimming interest rates, and that it believes
the economy will slow substantially in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The cut is therefore a double-edged sword for the market, since
it suggests both that corporate profits will come under continued
pressure next year and that the Fed is on the case to keep that
pressure from becoming too great. The three successive fed-funds
cuts are pumping liquidity into the economy, and Alan Greenspan is
doing his best to avoid presiding over another recession. Trimming
the discount rate, then, was a way of signaling the Fed's resolve,
which itself should help consumer and business confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the Fed's general attitude is, as we've remarked
before, genuinely striking. For most of his career, Greenspan was
an inflation hawk, and the old-school Greenspan would hardly have
looked at an economy growing at 3.3 percent, with an unemployment
rate of 4.6 percent, and imagined that anything other than a rate
increase was in order.
</P>
<P>
   But the combination of Greenspan's conviction that productivity
is rising faster than the statistics measure, that turmoil abroad
will have a material effect on the United States, and that
investors have become unnecessarily risk-tolerant have all shifted
the Fed's bias toward easing at seemingly every opportunity. Bond
yields of close to 3 percent now seem completely within the realm
of possibility, and if interest rates do drop that low, stocks will
look more attractive than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who have been looking for any reason to buy just found
another one.

EXPLAINER: WHAT'S THE NAME OF SADDAM HUSSEIN? 
</HEADLINE>
  By BRUCE GOTTLIEB 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is some confusion over whom the U.S. didn't bomb last
weekend. We spared ``Mr. Hussein'' says the New York Times;
actually, it was ``Saddam Hussein'' says the Washington Post; no,
it was just ``Saddam'' say USA Today and the Times' William Safire.
Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   The name ``Saddam Hussein'' isn't like ``Bill Clinton'' or
``Jiang Zemin,'' which are both composed of a given name and a
family name (``Bill'' and ``Zemin'' are the given names).
</P>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein has no family name. Rather ``Hussein'' is the
name his parents gave the nascent dictator, and ``Saddam'' is an
epithet he adopted before he grabbed power, and is derived from the
Persian word meaning ``crush.'' ``Saddam Hussein'' is best
translated as Hussein-Who-Crushes-Obstacles or
Hussein-the-Destroyer.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Washington Post gets it right by
consistently using ``Saddam Hussein''. References to ``Mr.
Hussein'' or ``Saddam'' are as syntactically absurd as referring to
a certain late wrestler by ``Mr. Andre'' or ``the Giant''.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it uncommon for Near Easterners to have only a given name
and no family name. In this century, regional governments have
encouraged citizens to adopt place names as surnames--by this
system, the Iraqi dictator would be ``Hussein Tikriti'', because he
comes from an area known as Tikrit.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah. It's pronounced ``Sad-DAHM''.

THE LOST VIRTUES OF HEADGEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  By ANNE HOLLANDER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hats arouse fully as much feeling as hairstyles--or they would
if enough of them were being worn. For 30 years we have been living
in the Bareheaded Age, worrying intensely about our hair. Many of
us don't even remember the time when people would no more go
outdoors without a hat than they would without shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The exact character of your hat mattered a lot then, much as the
look of your hair does now. Your hat confirmed your outfit, putting
the final seal on whatever else you wore, crowning your image and
arming your ego for social and professional life--or just for
itself. During the summer in the country, my grandfather would put
on his hat to go down to the end of the driveway and get the
letters out of the mailbox. I would laugh at him, free of the
requirement myself; but in his youth, even kids wore hats whenever
they went outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Hair rose up and drove out hats in the 1960s--rose up, spread
out, and flowed down in merciless torrents, sweeping away
conventional hats as if they represented all that was loathsome in
civilized life. A few cute hats, most of them faintly satirical,
costumey, and historical, were worn by a few cute people for
momentary effect. But the old hat rule was swiftly abolished. Off
came the top hat at the opera and the elegant homburg or fedora for
street wear, along with the whole range of casual hats and caps for
men.
</P>
<P>
   Swept away, too, were all the charming, infinitely various
feminine hats that once made women feel charming and infinitely
various themselves. Common usage once allowed hat makers to find
markets for many heterogeneous styles, for much discreetly
suggestive fantasy in shape and trim. Absurdity was the obvious
risk then, given the vast scope of hat design for women. Danny Kaye
once sang of ``The little ones, the big ones, the sat-on-by-a-pig
ones,/ The foolish ones that perch, and the ghoulish ones that
lurch.''
</P>
<P>
   But a man might still be seduced by an irresistible feminine
brim, curving and dipping to offset a meaningful glance. The
desired effect appeared in the movies on the heads of Greta Garbo
and Marlene Dietrich and their glamorous colleagues, such as Gene
Tierney in Laura in her scene at the Algonquin with Clifton Webb.
</P>
<P>
   Along with much else, women's hats are no longer a normal part
of the mating game. Women's hats are out there, but they're all
optional, and the range has shrunk. They come in very few basic
shapes (like dresses), and nobody gets any basic training in hat
choice or hat management, since real allure is felt to reside in
hair, not in hats. Real absurdity, too, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But winter is coming. The Hair Revolution was no help in bitter
weather, and for a while everybody but Floridians and Californians
simply froze above the neck. Lately healthy, utilitarian hats have
returned in force, along with athletic footgear and down jackets,
and there's even a certain limited stylishness in recent examples.
Fur is back, too, as are delicious pile fabrics, so that luxury can
be combined with utility. Meanwhile thousands of watch caps,
ear-flap caps, and wool berets are available from street vendors to
provide instant warmth for passers-by without much regard for
expressive charm. In this day of virtual uniformity, it's curious
that whenever a woman wears any hat at all, somebody is bound to
say, ``I love your hat!''--as if out of subliminal nostalgia for
the truly great days.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody says this to men about their baseball caps, the ubiquity
of which has reduced choices for men just as general hatlessness
has diminished the possibilities for women. What are old-fashioned
hat-loving men to do? Classic hats appear pretentious and
dandified. But such men could never wear--can barely
stomach--headgear with the inelegance, the laddishness, the
rakishness, the nerve of a baseball cap, especially one worn
backward.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, let us hope that the Return of the Hat is at hand,
inaugurated by men in their baseball caps, just as the strongest
and longest-lasting fashion changes always have been inspired by
men. The hat itself was a male invention and a male privilege until
women got tired of coifs, veils and wimples in the Renaissance.
Then they daringly adopted hats to profit from the erotic charge
male elements always add to feminine modes. Many women have done
this again in the last decade or so, usually sticking to masculine
sports hat shapes, baseball caps among them, or east European
rabbinical effects to combat the cold blast.
</P>
<P>
   I bought a fine example of that kind of winter hat. It surrounds
my head in a warm nimbus of fake fur, my brow, ears, and nape
encompassed by golden foxy fleece, my pate upholstered with plushy
leopard pelt, my beardless face mitigating the rabbinical flavor.
I've also acquired a neat hat that makes a black, furry sphere out
of my whole skull, leaving some wisps of my hair to curl up my
cheeks and down my forehead, Russian heroine style. More risky,
since I'm not tall, is my cavalier hat in silvery, streaked brown
and black velvet, with a biggish mobile brim for folding up and
down at will, fore and aft or amidships.
</P>
<P>
   Short, small women have to remember that they can quickly
resemble a mushroom in anything too big or a child in anything too
cute. Medium-sized or large and tall women have no such problem and
tend to look good in any kind of hat. They only have to remember to
let enough of their face show and not to let the hat flatten them
on top, so that their full-sized, shapely head and speaking eyes
will support the hat's dashing impact, and the hat itself won't
appear to jam a lid on the body's expressive means.
</P>
<P>
   Advice to all: Study the older royals for the way they manage
good proportions, especially the British Queen Mum, and don't
forget to study your own full-length hatted reflection--front,
back, and profile--before hitting the street. Absurdity forever
lurks.

BROWSER: A HUNDRED YEARS OF LASSITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACOB WEISBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1963, Edmund Wilson published an ``interview'' with himself
in the second issue of the New York Review of Books. The subject
was why a new intellectual journal was needed and how it came to
be. ``The disappearance of the Times Sunday book section at the
time of the printers' strike only make us realize it had never
existed,'' Wilson explained.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what it means that this remark is quoted without
comment in the new anthology that commemorates 100 years of the New
York Times Book Review. Wilson was saying the Times book section
was relentlessly dull. Does the Times agree? The 650 page
greatest-hits collection, I'm afraid, supports the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   For all the effect it has had on the country's literature, the
Times Sunday book section might as well never have existed. Today,
35 years after Wilson's jibe, it remains the drab wallpaper of the
book world. If it vanished in another strike, it is hard to think
many people would miss it.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the NYTBR so dreary? Michael Wolff, the media columnist
of New York magazine, wrote an article a few weeks ago complaining
that the section fails to capitalize on the new commercial
environment in which books are marketed and sold. He thinks the
NYTBR could make more money by being less independent. I kept
waiting for Wolff to say he was joking, but apparently he wasn't.
The Times deserves to be congratulated, not scolded, for its
determination to avoid pandering to the trade by reviewing
self-help manuals or boosting Oprah's book club.
</P>
<P>
   But high-mindedness only gets you so far. The real problem with
the NYTBR, for the 15 years or so that I have been reading it
without much pleasure, is its aversion to argument and controversy.
Charles (Chip) McGrath, the editor since 1995, has elevated the
tone somewhat. More distinguished authors contribute longer reviews
about weightier books. But somehow, the section still feels
dutiful. It reads as if the people writing for it and editing it
aren't having any fun and don't think readers should either.
</P>
<P>
   People who write for the NYTBR all have stories about how the
section resists strong criticism and colorful writing.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a newspaper section avoid conflict, the mother's milk
of journalism? I think the instinct stems from the paper's not
unrealistic sense of its own power and responsibility. Though the
NYTBR can't hurt Tom Clancy and probably can't help most academic
specialists, for a lot of writers in between, not getting reviewed
in the Times or receiving a harsh review can nail the coffin shut.
Other publications can be cavalier without worrying about squashing
an author's budding career. The giant Times can't.
</P>
<P>
   It's instructive to contrast this with the approach of the
leading British papers. The book review sections of the Sunday
Times, Sunday Telegraph, and Observer, as well as the Times
Literary Supplement and the delightful London Review of Books, look
to conflicts to generate interest.
</P>
<P>
   The famous letter to the Times--''Sirs, of all the people who
might have reviewed my book, could you not find one who was not my
former wife?''--may be apocryphal. But it gets at the spirit of
British reviewing, which is that the sometimes petty clash of
literary opinion is good sport. Regular Sunday reviewers, on the
model of Cyril Connolly, the longtime critic for the Sunday Times,
become trusted guides. And the British book reviews are more like
publications revolving around literary life than mere reviews. They
contain diaries, poems, puzzles, and interviews. The best book
review section in an American paper at the moment--the Los Angeles
Times Book Review--is much closer to this variety model.
</P>
<P>
   The NYTBR could make itself more interesting by going halfway
British. Break the monotony of 25 sequential reviews with
full-length author interviews (which the Times used to have),
letters from abroad, debates, and a gossip column. Encourage a
feisty letters page. Blow off the brief reviews. Take chances.
Crusade. Quit being so damned responsible.

 SHADOW WARS 
 By Clyde Farnsworth 
 Donald I. Fine, $24.95  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What if, like the mythical ancient alchemists, you could
actually spin gold out of a common element? At first, it would seem
an irresistible gift _ but what about the potential social and
economic ramifications? And what if this magical ability wound up
in the wrong hands? Clyde Farnsworth, a former foreign
correspondent for the New York Times, has given this premise some
serious thought and has spun from it a thriller about greed,
political intrigue and murder. His story begins on Lake Baikal,
``five miles to the southeast of Olkhon Island,'' in the former
Soviet Union. It is here that a half-Jewish physicist named Dmitri
Sherbatov is plucked from his rowboat by two foreign agents, who
whisk him to Israel. There he is to serve his newly adopted country
by sharing his recipe for creating gold from bismuth by bombarding
it with tremendous bursts of energy. Unfortunately, Sherbatov falls
under the sway of an unscrupulous former Israeli general, now the
minister of energy and natural resources, who is not averse to
lining his own pockets with the synthetic gold, as well as using it
to augment his hard-line political agenda. Meanwhile, the CIA
recruits a physics professor of its own, Hillsdale Landover, to
investigate the matter. Yes, there's murder. Yes, there's
treachery. Yes, there's a love story between Landover and the
daughter of a Mossad agent. And yes, the story hopscotches across
the globe. But somehow, in the end, ``Shadow Wars'' falls flat.
Farnsworth is a deft writer and he has researched his subject well,
but, regrettably, he falls too often into overly familiar thriller
territory, and his characters aren't sufficiently charismatic or
interesting to lift the novel above the ordinary. _ CHARLES

   &UR; THE STILLEST DAY &QL; 
 &UR; By Josephine Hart &QL; 
 &UR; Overlook, $23.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Hart is obsessed with obsession. In her best-known
novel, ``Damage,'' a member of Parliament is drawn irrevocably to
his son's future wife. Hart's latest novel, ``The Stillest Day,''
has no such easily defined plot; this year's obsession is more
cerebral than that. Her narrator, Bethesda Barnet, looks back to
the turn of the century when she was a 30-year-old painter and art
teacher in a small unnamed English village. Unenthusiastically
betrothed, she lives a quiet life caring for her invalid mother,
for whom she has little feeling. She ``walks out'' with her beau,
Samuel Keans, and pays ritual visits to her mentor, Lord
Grantleigh, who acquaints her with decadent French art. When a new
teacher, Mathew Pearson, and his pregnant wife move into the house
next door, Bethesda becomes obsessed with him. From that day on,
she paints images of his face (and later his hands, feet and
shoulders) on mirrors in her bedroom. When she looks in them, she
and he are merged. As Bethesda's narrative unfolds, she emerges as
cold and often cruel; then, on what she calls ``the stillest day,''
she commits a shocking act that changes her life and the lives of
those around her forever. In mood, Hart is something of a
present-day Daphne du Maurier: she writes ominously, creating an
atmosphere laden with mystery. But her enigmas are far less easy to
interpret than du Maurier's. Hart is a seductive writer. Despite
unpleasant characters sent out on a gloomy voyage, despite as many
overblown sentences as carefully constructed ones, we still read
on, possessed like one of Hart's own protagonists. _ CAROL PEACE

<P>
   &UR; GIVING UP AMERICA &QL; 
 &UR; By Pearl Abraham &QL; 
 &UR; Riverhead, $22.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the opening pages of Pearl Abraham's second novel, two young
New Yorkers are renovating a neglected old house, sparring over
colors and furnishings. Beginning with these seemingly minor
disagreements, Abraham offers a painful account of the dissolution
of their marriage. Deena was raised in a Hasidic family. When she
married Daniel, an orthodox Jew, her father predicted disaster,
noting that the numbers assigned to the Hebrew letters of their
names added up to the word ``pain.'' But Deena ignored his
warnings, believing that ``patterns could be read and recognized,
or not.'' Years later, cracks in their marriage begin to appear
when Daniel invites Jill, a young secretary from his office, home
for dinner. Long a rigid penny pincher, he goes on a spending
spree, taking Deena and Jill out to clubs and on skiing holidays.
Initially pleased by the changes in Daniel's attitude, Deena soon
comes to suspect his motives. As Abraham describes this emotional
evolution, her prose is sparse and exacting, tracing the inner life
of a young woman caught between the Hasidic world of her ancestors
and the materialism of secular America. _ MAGGIE GARB

<P>
   &UR; ONCE AGAIN FOR THUCYDIDES &QL; 
 &UR; By Peter Handke &QL; 
 &UR; New Directions, $18.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the subjects it so carefully describes, Peter
Handke's ``Once Again for Thucydides'' is a small, seemingly simple
thing that grows in complexity the more closely it is observed.
Translated from the German by Tess Lewis, the book is an eclectic
collection of ``micro-epics'' from Handke's travels. Whether
visiting Japan, the Pyrenees, Croatia or a city park in Munich,
Handke delights in sublime detail. In one selection, he spends
pages poring over the trunk of a tree, cataloguing insects, lichens
and the varying grain of the bark itself: ``I was gripped with
excitement at knowing that if I slowly, continuously, circled and
examined the tree, much more would be revealed.'' He employs a
similar strategy, with similar fervor, throughout the collection.
Like the tree, his subjects are frequently from the natural world,
and even when they are not -- as in a brief portrait of ``The
Shoeshine Man of Split,'' whom he describes as the ``Saint of Small
Measures'' -- he describes them with the same studied
meticulousness. At their best, these vignettes have the power of
poetry, and this seems to be his goal. Nevertheless, Handke is
clearly after more, since he frequently, though obliquely,
questions his role as an observer in an inherently political
landscape. Though the answers he suggests require strenuous
squinting to discern, his effort alone rescues the book from fussy
preciosity. _ LIAM CALLANAN

<P>
   &UR; THE SAME EMBRACE &QL; 
 &UR; By Michael Lowenthal &QL; 
 &UR; Dutton, $23.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lowenthal's deeply felt first novel portrays the
conflict between 24-year-old twin brothers whose divergent passions
threaten to separate them forever. Jacob Rosenbaum is a gay
activist, yet he is more successful in accepting his sexuality than
in sustaining intimate relationships. In contrast, his brother,
Jonathan, has embraced the strictures of Orthodox Judaism at a
yeshiva in Israel. Although Jonathan expresses disgusted hostility
when confronted with his brother's life as a gay man, Jacob still
cares for him and mourns the loss of the closeness they once had as
children. Reconciliation becomes possible only when their beloved
grandmother falls into a coma after a severe stroke, precipitating
a family crisis and exposing secrets that have shaped the lives of
all her loved ones ever since she and her husband fled the
Holocaust for America. As he blends the past and the present,
Lowenthal uses luminous language that often imbues ordinary
gestures and events with deeper meaning. ``The Same Embrace'' is an
eloquent exploration of the nature of faith, the consequences of
judgment and the stubborn endurance of family ties. _ LINDA BARRETT

 THE CENTURY 
 By Peter Jennings and Todd Brewster 
 Doubleday, $60  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This ragtag century of ours is getting to seem like a garrulous
uncle who keeps coming back with his same old stories: his great
wars and his great depressions, evils daunted and lessons sorely
learned. Crowds cheering the troops into World War I, the folly of
the Treaty of Versailles, the masses on their feet in Nazi salute
at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin -- and on and on. THE CENTURY is
comprehensive, balanced, eminently readable and fairly onerous,
taken cover to cover. The narrative by Peter Jennings, the
broadcaster, and Todd Brewster, a former editor and writer at Life,
is a good textbook history of the American experience of the 20th
century, told from the perspective of the American 1990's, rather
than what might have been more interesting, the century as seen
from each of its successive eras. Important phases and events are
captured in a series of first-person accounts, most filling a
single page, with a boxed biography of the speaker and several
photographs, often snapshots; together these form an effective, and
in some ways more satisfying narrative, and are the real meat of
this book. The photo selection of Katherine Bourbeau is excellent,
with an eye for the unfamiliar image (John F. Kennedy and Richard
M. Nixon in a handshake that separates rather than brings them
together; students at Harvard mourning Kennedy's murder), while a
familiar image like Dorothea Lange's ``Migrant Mother'' is treated
as subject rather than illustration, and captioned with a quotation
from the photographer, describing the circumstances of the shot.
With so much to browse and relive, there will be something here for
everyone. _ DAVID WALTON

   &UR; THE SCIENCE TIMES BOOK OF INSECTS &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Nicholas Wade &QL; 
 &UR; Lyons, $25 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Insects preceded people on this earth by about 300 million
years, and may well survive mankind by longer than that. Such a
prospect deserves respect, and that is what insects (and a few
other arthropods) receive in THE SCIENCE TIMES BOOK OF INSECTS,
edited by Nicholas Wade (Lyons, $25), a selection of nature
reporting, from The Times's weekly science section, about insects
and the scientists who study them. Intriguing new findings concern,
for example, the recycling tactics of dung beetles, without whom
this planet would be a mess; the invasive habits of the Halloween
ladybug, an innocent aphid eater that can alarm whole suburbs with
its vast October swarms; and, perhaps best of all, research at
Cambridge University that appears to have determined how the
proverbially unairworthy bumblebee manages, in defiance of
conventional aerodynamics, to fly.

   &UR; THE BEATLES &QL; 
 &UR; An Oral History &QL; 
 &UR; By David Pritchard and Alan Lysaght &QL; 
 &UR; Hyperion, $23.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What used to be called a clip job now passes for ``oral
history.'' ``The Beatles,'' by David Pritchard and Alan Lysaght,
two Canadian radio and television producers, is a compilation of
twice-told tales culled from interviews with the Beatles and their
contemporaries and is more seriously in need of editing than the
``White Album.'' Far too much of this material has been told more
vividly elsewhere. However, there are a few gems: George Harrison's
sister, Louise, says their mother listened to Radio India on Sunday
afternoons when she was pregnant with George, so that he may have
been influenced by the sitar before he was born. There is a
wistfulness to those left behind by the Beatles' fame: a Hamburg
nightclub owner named Horst Fascher wishes he had ``collected more
things that they threw away, like drumsticks and guitar strings.''
For die-hard Beatlephiles, there are technical tidbits like the
fact that ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' one of the
most celebrated stereo rock albums, was largely mixed in mono.
Unfortunately, the book is shapeless and stuffed with filler. An
oral history of the Beatles should have been a lot more fun. _ ERIC

   &UR; THE LONG-WINDED LADY &QL; 
 &UR; Notes From The New Yorker &QL; 
 &UR; By Maeve Brennan &QL; 
 &UR; Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some writers hold your attention with grand tales of love or
war. Maeve Brennan had smaller goals. For nearly three decades she
wrote for The New Yorker's Talk of the Town section under the
woefully apt pseudonym the Long-Winded Lady. In her vignettes of
city life she natters about little things like yappy dogs, or
dinner at her favorite steakhouse, where a stranger had the veal,
or the weather, which came in three flavors -- heat wave, downpour
and snowstorm. Brennan is a distant observer of couples in the
park, loners on the roof and cats in the alley; she is always
watching, often conjecturing, rarely engaging her subjects in
conversation. Mixed with these ramblings is a bittersweet chronicle
of New York in transition in the 1950's and 60's as the residential
hotels of her beloved neighborhoods, Greenwich Village and Times
Square, are torn down for high-rises. Unlike that other chronicler
of old New York, Joseph Mitchell, who relished its odd corners and
people, Brennan keeps her neighbors at arm's length. _ LAURA GREEN

 &UR; A Signature Life &QL; 
 &UR; By Diane Von Furstenberg with Linda Bird Francke &QL; 
 &UR; Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is almost too easy to dismiss the designer Diane Von
Furstenberg as a socialite and dilettante whose once ubiquitous
wrap dress succeeded on the merit of her connections and title (her
former husband is a prince). Indeed, several passages in ``Diane,''
the autobiography she has written with Linda Bird Francke, would
support this assumption. Attending a White House dinner celebrating
the 1979 Egypt-Israeli peace accord, she writes that she would have
argued more strenuously with the pessimism of her table mate,
Yitzhak Shamir, if only the damp night hadn't left her so cold.
After a Secret Service agent lends her a raincoat, she laments,
``There was nothing anyone could do, however, about the terminal
damage done to my new Manolo Blahnik shoes by the wet White House
lawn.'' Since the moment the Belgian-born Von Furstenberg arrived
in New York in 1969, she has lived a rarefied existence. In
difficult situations, she consults with Barry (Diller), Ronald
(Lauder) and Bianca (Jagger), and when considering applying for
American citizenship, she remarks on the section requiring her to
list visits abroad: ``Reconstructing the hundreds of trips I had
taken was just too much.'' Such blithe commentary masks what is by
any measure a success story; Von Furstenberg did not inherit
privilege. Her mother survived Auschwitz and her father built his
own business that financed the boarding school education that
introduced Von Furstenberg to the people who introduced her to the
world of Andy Warhol and Studio 54. She persuasively illustrates
how her hugely successful clothing and cosmetics businesses were
nurtured by endless hours of hard work and hundreds of personal
appearances. Despite bouts of superficiality, Von Furstenberg is a
likable and surprisingly earnest figure. This is breezy reading for
anyone who enjoys columns with a plenitude of bold-faced names. _

   &UR; HISTORY IN OUR TIME &QL; 
 &UR; By David Cannadine &QL; 
 &UR; Yale, $25 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In these reviews of other historians' books, David Cannadine
works a provocative series of transformations -- taking new angles,
amplifying themes and giving his own acerbic voice the final word.
These pieces examine the last four centuries of British history,
from Henry VIII to Diana, Princess of Wales, lingering over
imperialism, Victorian culture, Florence Nightingale and Winston
Churchill (as well as second-rank figures like the English fascist
Oswald Mosley and John Buchan, the novelist and politician). The
heart of ``History in Our Time'' is 10 essays that focus closely on
the British monarchy. There is a fascinating sketch, based on a
study by Phillip Hall, of how the Windsors made their money (mostly
done since 1910, through the hoarding of public funds and the
careful negotiation of personal tax exemptions). Ironically, when
he turns to the Royal Family, Cannadine's withering glare is very
much a spellbound gaze. He sympathizes with kings who have honored
their duties -- notably George VI, a dull, decent figurehead who
worked hard at sharing his people's wartime hardships yet amused
himself by personally designing ``a new style of trousers to wear
with the Order of the Garter.'' Cannadine wants to overhaul the
monarchy, but only to adapt it to downscaled, postimperial times.
He repeatedly intimates that princes need broader experience and
better education. ``History in Our Time'' displays its author's
range as a historian and his skills as a working critic. _ ALLEN D.

 INGENIOUS PAIN 
 By Andrew Miller 
 Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This first novel focuses on an 18th-century doctor, a brilliant
surgeon whose skill and detachment are largely due to the strange
defect he was born with: an inability to feel pain. Last year our
reviewer, Patrick McGrath, called the book ``a mature novel of
ideas soaked in the sensory detail of its turbulent times.''

   &UR; THE DIARIES OF DAWN POWELL, 1931-1965 &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Tim Page &QL; 
 &UR; Steerforth, $19 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Never give a guest Dexedrine after sundown'' is just one of
the zingers that leap from these pages, which were written in the
last half of the life of a brilliant and, to her fans, still
unappreciated satirist. These journals reflect Dawn Powell's life
in Greenwich Village, where she married foolishly, gave birth to a
severely handicapped son and wrote her novels, many of which are
now being rediscovered. The diaries are ``one of the outstanding
literary finds of the last quarter-century,'' Terry Teachout wrote
here in 1995. Steerforth has also reissued much of Powell's
fiction. THE HAPPY ISLAND ($14), first published in 1938, is a
story of bohemian life in Manhattan, centering on Prudence Bly, a
nightclub singer, and Jefferson Abbott, a playwright; both, like
Powell herself, come from small-town Ohio. In The New York Times,
E. H. Walton praised Powell's ``sardonic wit.'' THE BRIDE'S HOUSE
($14), one of Powell's earliest novels, is about a young Midwestern
farm wife, torn between her dependable but boring husband and a
much more exciting stranger. ``There is flavor and richness in the
book, and the staunchness of honesty as well,'' one critic said in
1929.

   &UR; THE SECRET WAR FOR THE UNION &QL; 
 &UR; The Untold Story of Military Intelligence in the Civil War &QL; 
 &UR; By Edwin C. Fishel &QL; 
 &UR; Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $16 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The author argues that the Northern forces were actually more
adept than the Confederacy at gathering information about the
enemy, and that their systematic use of intelligence furthered
military advancement even when it did not win battles. Fishel's
``book breaks much new ground,'' Gary W. Gallagher wrote in The New
York Times in 1996. Mariner has also reissued CHANCELLORSVILLE, by
Stephen W. Sears ($16), a history that provides a new
interpretation of a Civil War battle usually judged to be an
example of Robert E. Lee's brilliance. Lee won the battle more
through luck than strategy, the author contends, and Joseph Hooker
lost it largely because of incompetent subordinates. ``For scope,
analysis, drama and richness of detail, there is no better book on
the subject,'' Daniel E. Sutherland said in the Book Review in
1996. Sears has also contributed a new introduction to A DIARY OF
BATTLE: The Personal Journals of Colonel Charles S. Wainwright,
1861-1865, edited by Allan Nevins (Da Capo, $17.95). The only work
of its kind -- the eyewitness account of a Union artillery officer
-- it covers most of the major battles of the Army of the Potomac.
``This action diary is the stuff of which published history is
made,'' Freeman Cleaves wrote here in 1962. &QL;

   &UR; EGGS FOR YOUNG AMERICA &QL; 
 &UR; By Katherine L. Hester &QL; 
 &UR; Penguin, $12.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This debut collection of short stories is set in the author's
native South, where her characters, mostly working class, struggle
fiercely but unsentimentally with the limitations of their lives.
This is ``a remarkably assured book by a wise and provocative
writer,'' Tom Drury said in these pages last year. &QL;

   &UR; GRACE NOTES &QL; 
 &UR; By Bernard MacLaverty &QL; 
 &UR; Norton, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This novel explores the emotional life of Catherine McKenna, an
Irish musician, composer and single mother whose personal loyalties
are as divided as her country's. Having left her family, home and
Roman Catholicism behind, she returns to Northern Ireland after her
father's death. The prose is ``lyrical and hypnotic,'' Courtney
Weaver said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WAITING TO FORGET &QL; 
 &UR; By Margaret Moorman &QL; 
 &UR; Norton, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What the author was supposed to forget was the birth of her
first child, a boy she had borne when she was 16 and given up for
adoption. This book is the record of years of turmoil that finally
culminated in contact with her grown son. '' 'Waiting to Forget' is
uniquely enlightening because the author has so effectively made
the connection between the personal and the political,'' Jane
O'Reilly wrote in the Book Review in 1996. ``Variations of
circumstance become unified by her questions.'' The other side of
adoption is explored in AN EMPTY LAP: One Couple's Journey to
Parenthood, by Jill Smolowe (Pocket Books, $14). The author, a
journalist, recounts her struggle with infertility and her
husband's ambivalence about fatherhood before the couple finally
adopted a baby girl from China. Last year our reviewer, Peter D.
Kramer, called her memoir ``eminently readable.''

 &UR; By Carl Friedman &QL; 
 &UR; Translated by Jeannette K. Ringold &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Set in 1970, this Dutch novel is narrated by a young student in
Antwerp who is trying to make sense of her own and her parents'
pasts. The daughter of Holocaust survivors, she questions religion
yet finds herself drawn to the Hasidic family for whom she is a
nanny. ``The author perfectly accomplishes the delicate task of
making unspeakable stories at once accessible and shocking,''
Katherine Alberg wrote in these pages in 1996.

 WHERE THE VOICE CAME FROM 
 By JAMES OLNEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the strangest experience,'' Eudora Welty told Anne
Tyler after reading back over her short stories in preparation for
their collected publication in 1980. ``It was like watching a
negative develop, slowly coming clear before your eyes. It was like
recovering a memory.
</P>
<P>
   With the appearance of the two Welty volumes in the Library of
America series -- comprising not only the short fiction but also a
handful of acute essays, the superb ``One Writer's Beginnings'' and
five books designated ``novels'' (``The Robber Bridegroom,''
``Delta Wedding,'' ``The Ponder Heart,'' ``Losing Battles'' and
``The Optimist's Daughter'') -- Welty's admirers have the
opportunity to watch with her as the body of her work gradually
emerges, indeed like a developing photographic image, a richly
varied yet single living entity, something always there, always
coming into being but wholly perceptible only now, when it can be
viewed through the lens of memory. I specify admirers (and who is
not one? her popularity no doubt accounts in part for Welty being
the first living author included in the Library of America) for, as
she describes the process, it requires a previous knowledge of the
work and a double doubling back. Memory is a first-stage recovery
of the past; recovering a memory is akin to remembering
remembering. Welty has always been prodigious in her remarks on
memory: ``Of course the greatest confluence of all is that which
makes up the individual human memory,'' she says in ``One Writer's
Beginnings.'' ``My own is the treasure most dearly regarded by me,
in my life and in my work as a writer. Here time, also, is subject
to confluence. The memory is a living thing -- it too is in
transit. But during its moment, all that is remembered joins, and
lives -- the old and the young, the past and the present, the
living and the dead.'' Joined and living, too, one might add, in
our reading are Welty's past achievement and our present
recollection, savoring, reconstruction and re-creation of it.
</P>
<P>
   What is at issue both for Welty and for the reader of ``Eudora
Welty: Complete Novels'' and ``Eudora Welty: Stories, Essays, &AMP;
Memoir,'' edited and annotated unobtrusively but meticulously by
Richard Ford and Michael Kreyling, is a memory of things written,
of things made, which locates the life of greatest interest firmly
and first and last in the writing. Focusing there, one shares
Welty's sense of wonder yet of inevitability at how it's all come
about: no one could have predicted it would be so, but in
retrospect it could not have been otherwise. Asked in 1989 how she
would describe the vision that has sustained and impelled her
throughout a career of more than 50 years, Welty responded that
such a vision ``lies only in the work. . . . It's what the work
shows, comprises altogether.'' What she desires, she continued, is
for ``the work to exist as the thing that answers every question
about its doing.''
</P>
<P>
   If the body of her work, in its parts and its entirety, contains
the story of its writing, then this renders a biography of the
``writer's life'' (in the phrase that supplies the subtitle to Ann
Waldron's biography, ``Eudora'') not only nugatory but an
impertinence. The word impertinence is intended in the double sense
of irrelevance and of rudeness (which one can find most tellingly
in Waldron's aggrieved tone at not being allowed every confidence
of Welty's private life and in her frantic search for explanations
of the fiction in what Waldron takes to be Welty's sexual
frustration and her despair at having had no dates -- no dates at
all! -- in high school).
</P>
<P>
   To ``explain'' the fiction, as Waldron does, as compensation or
sublimation, with unfounded speculation and reckless surmise as her
principal tools -- Welty seems to have been depressed at this time,
which was likely caused by (what else?) an unhappy love attachment,
and the depression (which Waldron takes for an established fact) is
the cause of such and such a scene in ``The Robber Bridegroom'' or
a character in ``June Recital'' -- consigns Welty's work to a
presumed starting point in the ``foul rag-and-bone shop of the
heart.'' It shackles her imagination to the detritus of a life when
the desire of that life has been to create a new world not on the
basis of day-to-day grievances but in the likeness of the visible
and audible phantasmagoria surrounding her and her readers.
Everything one needs to know biographically about Welty can be
gleaned from the Library of America chronology. Her autobiography
-- the story of a writer -- is written across the whole body of her
work.
</P>
<P>
   That story, as against the one retailed in Waldron's book, is of
a pervasive and inexplicable mystery at the heart of human
existence and relationships. It is also an account, by way of the
writing, of techniques for rendering that mystery a living presence
in fiction. The tale begins with the imaginative explosion of ``A
Curtain of Green,'' a collection of 17 stories that seem
individually like so many experiments in voice, perspective,
texture.
</P>
<P>
   The volume's tonal variety is astonishing: from the somber
``Death of a Traveling Salesman'' to the hallucinatory ``Flowers
for Marjorie,'' from the wonderment at the variety of human faces
of ``Clytie'' to the foreboding near-violence of the title piece,
from the jazzy ``Powerhouse'' to the satiric ``Petrified Man,''
from the wildly comic ``Why I Live at the P.O.'' to the dignified
``A Worn Path'' (the ``grave, persistent, meditative'' sound of old
Phoenix Jackson's cane tapping the frozen earth establishes the
tone at the outset).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-WELTY-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: the outset).) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Curtain of Green,'' with marvelous success, Welty tests
voice after voice, as if the lesson learned in one story were to be
put aside, perhaps for future use, while another lesson is worked
through. ``The source of the short story is usually lyrical,'' she
says in ``Writing and Analyzing a Story.'' But she immediately goes
on to assert that, however much the lyrical impetus, and therefore
the tone and mood, may change from story to story, each story
carries the author's ``signature because of the one impulse
characteristic of his own gift -- to praise, to love, to call up
into view.'' Welty seems to offer these impulses as separate, but I
should say that to call up into view, to praise, to love -- taken
in whatever order -- are ultimately a single desire driving her
work from the first published story (``Death of a Traveling
Salesman'') right through ``One Writer's Beginnings.''
</P>
<P>
   The short story is the medium in which Welty has always shown to
greatest advantage, and this is true both of the relatively brief
pieces of ``A Curtain of Green'' (1941) and of the more expansive,
slower-paced stories of ``The Wide Net and Other Stories'' (1943),
``The Golden Apples'' (1949) and ``The Bride of Innisfallen and
Other Stories'' (1955). When she moved on to the novel, as she was
urged -- against her instincts -- to do by publishers, Welty
recognized that she was taking on a form markedly different in its
demands and capabilities. Few enough writers have been brilliantly
successful at both modes, and though Welty's novels have much to
recommend them, the truth is that she never quite divested herself
of the ways of seeing and saying most appropriate to the writing of
short fiction. The novel can be and has been many things, but one
doubts it has ever been quite what we get in ``The Robber
Bridegroom'' (1942): a gallimaufry thrown together out of frontier
brags, Yeatsian folk fantasy and shape-changers, fairy-tale love
and adventure, the mock heroic and heroic mockery and high spirits,
blended with comic undercutting at every turn. There are a thousand
events in the book, but of plot hardly a hint. Much the same could
be said of plot in ``Delta Wedding'' (1946) and ``Losing Battles''
(1970) -- that there is not much more of it in those novels than in
``A Visit of Charity'' or ``Keela, the Outcast Indian Maiden'' or
``The Wide Net,'' wonderful stories all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Optimist's Daughter'' (1972) shows a fairly conventional
plot, but this is unique in Welty and achieved at the cost of being
drawn in large measure from details of her biography. And then
there is ``The Ponder Heart'' (1954), really a short story spun out
to something between novella and novel length, a pure exercise in
voice, nothing more, but a virtuoso performance and great triumph
as such (and very funny). Welty opens ``One Writer's Beginnings''
with a chapter called ``Listening'' and concludes with ``Finding a
Voice''; ``The Ponder Heart'' could be a textbook illustration --
but full of life and humor -- of how to listen to Edna Earl's voice
and reproduce it on the page.
</P>
<P>
   Edna Earl's is but one of Welty's hundreds of voices, all
different but all issuing from the artistry of one listener. In
this regard they are like the faces Clytie studies in the story
that bears her name. There were not more than 150 people in Farr's
Ginn, but ``the number of faces seemed to Clytie almost infinite. .
. . When she began to look at people's actual countenances there
was no more familiarity in the world for her. The most profound,
the most moving sight in the whole world must be a face. Was it
possible to comprehend the eyes and the mouths of other people,
which concealed she knew not what, and secretly asked for still
another unknown thing?'' That Clytie's maker shares an abiding
fascination with the infinite variety of nature, human and other,
is clear on every page of her work.
</P>
<P>
   The need to capture the otherness and the sameness in a voice,
in a face, is what accounts for the proliferation of similes and
metaphors in Welty. Such figures of speech are a reaching out to
bring that which is not us, yet is also us, within the ambit of our
emotional capacities. They are a way of bringing home the world's
mysteries without depriving them of any jot of their strangeness.
The words mystery and mysterious echo like mantras in Welty's
fiction, essays and memoir, referring to the endless oddity of the
world and of relationship (``relationship is a pervading and
changing mystery''). When, in ``Place in Fiction,'' Welty declares:
``Life is strange. Stories hardly make it more so; with all they
are able to tell and surmise, they make it more believably, more
inevitably so,'' we are reminded that there is an archaic meaning
for mystery, which is craft or trade. There has been in our time no
more assiduous practitioner of fiction than Eudora Welty, and for
the mystery that pervades her work and is her artistry there can be
no explanation (a la Waldron), only gratitude.

THE SHAMEFUL LIFE OF SALVADOR DALI
</HEADLINE>
  By Ian Gibson 
 Illustrated. 798 pp. New York: W. W. Norton &AMP; Company. $45 
 ------ 
 PARANOIA PERSONIFIED 
 By MICHAEL PEPPIATT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time he became a household name, Salvador Dali (1904-89)
was already perceived above all as a performer _ an outrageous
self-publicist and witty clown. In France, where he spent part of
the year, he could always be relied on to liven up any event or
public debate. But even in that role, he began to pall. I remember
almost bumping into him in 1971 at the Francis Bacon retrospective
at the Grand Palais in Paris. He was unmistakable, with his manic
stare, pointy mustaches and full-length fur coat. ``They're very,
very raisonnables,'' Dali repeated loudly to those around him,
pointing his silver-topped cane at the most alarming of Bacon's
images; and he was visibly annoyed when this bit of Surrealist
upstaging failed to turn more than a few heads.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Dali went from the subversive brilliance of his
youth to an increasingly hollow, money-making exhibitionism is told
with exemplary clarity in Ian Gibson's big new biography of the
Catalan artist. It is ultimately a depressing tale, because it
chronicles in great detail how Dali progressively cheapened and
squandered his enormous talent. Gibson concentrates on Dali's early
career, because it is far and away the most interesting.
``Two-thirds of this book,'' he declares, ``are devoted to
one-third of Dali's life. Such a structure was not imposed
artificially, but shaped itself irresistibly as my research
progressed. Dali's work, after he moved to America in 1940, grows
increasingly hackneyed and repetitious.'' And the man himself,
Gibson might have added, became increasingly grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of the ruthless manipulation and self-aggrandizement that
characterized the later Dali were discernible in his youth. When he
was barely 16, for instance, he announced in his diary: ``I'll be a
genius, and the world will admire me. Perhaps I'll be despised and
misunderstood, but I'll be a genius, a great genius, I'm certain of
it.'' Slim and strikingly handsome, he let his jet-black hair grow
down to his shoulders and began dressing in stylishly bohemian
clothes. Although paralyzingly shy, the adolescent Dali was already
firmly set on his conquest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson begins his book with a full description of Dali's
forebears and the area north of Barcelona, around Figueres and
Cadaques, to which the artist, forever conscious of being Catalan
rather than Spanish, was to remain so deeply attached. Dali's
childhood comes across as relatively normal (above all if one
discounts his own later, myth-making version of it), except that he
had an older brother, also called Salvador, who died some nine
months before Dali was born. His parents, who were comfortably well
off and relatively cultivated, made all the more fuss over him,
giving in to his every whim. But even at a very early age,
according to Gibson, Dali suffered intense feelings of shame,
making it ``extremely difficult for him to maintain normal
relations with the people around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Other signs that Dali was not just any boy growing up in
provincial, middle-class Catalonia were not long in coming. Extreme
timidity coincided with an array of obsessions, such as buttocks
(fascination with, both male and female) and locusts (pathological
fear of), that persisted throughout his life. In adolescence, Dali
also became fixated on his unusually complex sexuality. First, he
realized that he was poorly equipped for intercourse. However
disturbing the discovery, he related it with typical verve: ``For a
long time I experienced the misery of believing I was impotent,''
he observes in his ``Unspeakable Confessions.'' ``Naked, and
comparing myself to my schoolfriends, I discovered that my penis
was small, pitiful and soft. I can recall a pornographic novel
whose Don Juan machine-gunned female genitals with ferocious glee,
saying that he enjoyed hearing women creak like watermelons. I
convinced myself that I would never be able to make a woman creak
like a watermelon.'' The other discovery was normal _ except that,
for Dali, masturbation was to be the main, indeed almost the only,
sexual activity right through his life.

   These facts would hardly be relevant if they were not vital to
an understanding of Dali's subsequent behavior and his art. An
overriding sense of sexual inadequacy was surely one of the factors
that drove him to create with such single-minded intensity; and
most of the self-styled Great Masturbator's best paintings bristle
with erotic allusions. Gibson rightly emphasizes Dali's tortured
sexuality, and in an intriguing passage he examines what appears to
have been a protracted but unconsummated love affair with the poet
Federico Garcia Lorca, whom Dali later described as the greatest
friend of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   Dali's other close companion during this period was Luis Bunuel.
Gibson's account of the immediate bonding and rivalry of this
fabulously talented Spanish trio, who had come together as students
in Madrid, is one of the most exhilarating passages in the book. It
seems almost uncanny that the three most artistically gifted young
men in the country should have met and had time to share their
dreams, thus influencing one another for life. Gibson gives a
tantalizing glimpse of Garcia Lorca, whose biography he has already
written, and records with gusto how Bunuel and Dali came to make
their subversive first film together, ``Un Chien Andalou,'' which
was shown in Paris in 1929. The lively friendship of the three was
not to last. Garcia Lorca was put to death early in the Spanish
Civil War, and Bunuel was alienated by Dali's shameless volte-face
when, on his return to Spain in 1948 after 10 years in America, he
declared his unconditional support for Franco and Roman
Catholicism.

</P>
<P>
   Two events in the late '20s shaped the rest of Dali's life. One
was his conversion _ the word is not too strong _ to Surrealism,
which took place (if Dali's own unreliable memoirs are to be
believed) when he met the movement's leader, Andre Breton: ``I felt
at the time that I had been granted a second birth,'' Dali stated
many years later. ``The Surrealist group was for me a sort of
nourishing placenta and I believed in Surrealism as if it
constituted the Tables of the Law.'' As he describes Dali's new
involvement, Gibson also conjures up the effervescence surrounding
the movement, with its constant battles, internal and external, and
its fierce resolve to turn all preconceived notions about culture
and life on their heads. For a while Surrealism's ideology kept at
bay the egomania and self-serving cynicism that later claimed the
artist entirely.
</P>
<P>
   A different involvement, however, began from its outset to egg
them on. Helena Diakanoff Devulina _ familiarly Gala _ appears to
have dominated Dali, fascinating and terrifying him, from the
moment they met in 1929. She was then married to the poet Paul
Eluard, but the couple accepted and even encouraged each other's
infidelities, to the point where Gala felt that Eluard was pushing
her at his friend Dali. She left Eluard to live with the painter.
For Dali, the highly sexed, Russian-born Gala brought some form of
physical release and the promise of intelligent companionship; for
her, the artist seems to have been a career and a fortune waiting
to be made, as well as a husband who would tolerate all the lovers
she craved. In the end, they seem to have been a monstrous match
for each other, and much of the latter part of this biography
traces their mutual degradation.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, there are moments of respite. Dali's visit to Freud,
for instance, is a vignette that seems suddenly to speak volumes
about the 20th century. And with his incredible energy, Dali
carries even the growing weight of his empty clowning and
image-making before him. As the money poured in _ from paintings,
endless prints and all kinds of merchandising _ the artist
surrounded himself with a court of beautiful young people and
managed to meet virtually everyone who took his fancy, from Pope
Pius XII and Franco to Clark Gable and Bob Hope. Once Gala died in
1982, Dali went into rapid decline, and his own end was as gruesome
as this master of unpleasant fantasies might himself have devised _
preyed on by his closest advisers and abandoned by those who were
paid to look after him in his decrepitude. Nevertheless, one
wonders whether he was in fact as ashamed of himself as his
biographer claims. It hardly matters. The book provides not so much
a cautionary tale as a trustworthy, even-handed account of a life
that continues to haunt our imagination.

 SYMBOLS AT AN EXHIBITION 
 By PAUL ROBINSON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The occasion for this collection of 17 short essays (and one
comic strip, by Art Spiegelman) is the exhibition of Freud
artifacts currently on display at the Library of Congress.
Originally scheduled for 1995 or 1996, the show was delayed when a
group of mostly anti-Freudian scholars charged that the planning
committee had been stacked with Freud loyalists and that the
exhibition threatened to become an exercise in propaganda and
hagiography, ignoring the recent tide of revisionist writings about
Freud. The curator of the show (and the editor of ``Freud: Conflict
and Culture'') tried, with modest success, to appease the critics,
but for the fiercer anti-Freudians, like Peter Swales, an
independent scholar, and the literary critic Frederick Crews, the
result is still far too reverential. The essays don't offer a guide
to the exhibit (or the controversy), though Michael S. Roth
provides one in his introduction to the book. But their varied
evaluations of Freud's life, work and influence reflect something
of the troubled state of his reputation at the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The detractors are represented by two philosophical veterans of
the Freud wars, Adolf Grunbaum, a professor of the philosophy of
science and of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, and
Frank Cioffi, a fellow in philosophy at the University of Kent in
Canterbury, England. Grunbaum makes his familiar charge that
Freud's ideas, especially about repression, can be embraced only
when they are tested against data obtained from control groups, and
``no such data,'' he reminds us glumly, ``have become available
during the past century.'' Cioffi takes an even severer view:
Freud's ideas, he insists, are inherently untestable, on a par with
notions about flying saucers, and the famous case histories are the
products of either intellectual extravagance (the generous
interpretation) or outright lying. The friends of psychoanalysis
may find solace in learning that Cioffi and Grunbaum seem to
dislike each other almost as much as they do Freud himself.
</P>
<P>
   A more interesting case is Peter D. Kramer, the author of
``Listening to Prozac.'' Freud, he reports, first drew him to the
profession of psychiatry, but he now finds the Master's writings
largely unconvincing (because they ignore simpler, more obvious,
explanations for his patients' troubles) and his treatment of many
of his patients downright abusive. Kramer attributes his change of
heart precisely to the revisionist scholarship of the past two
decades. Yet he remains ambivalent and closes his essay by
admitting that many of Freud's ideas still appeal to him. He even
expects, hopefully, that future biographers will restore the
admirable truth seeker whom the revisionists have dethroned.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, several of the contributors
defend Freud against the recent onslaught. In a discussion of his
case notes, for example, Ilse Grubrich-Simitis, a psychoanalyst,
stresses the care with which he listened to his analysands, his
meticulous attention to detail and his cautious resistance to
premature interpretations. Similarly, Harold P. Blum, a clinical
professor of psychiatry at New York University and director of the
Sigmund Freud Archives, argues that Freud gave up hypnosis in favor
of free association to minimize the influence of the doctor on his
patients' reports of their thoughts or experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Even the essays sympathetic to Freud reveal an effort to shift
the grounds of defense. Most of their authors, for example, are
prepared to discard his now embarrassing ideas about women and his
fanciful phylogenetic theories, such as the Primal Crime. More
revealing, although they sometimes continue to deploy the language
of truth -- speaking of Freud's ``insights,''''discoveries'' or
``contributions'' -- they often retreat to the safer territory of
his historical influence, and the talk turns to his ``industry,''
``courage'' and ``genius.'' Indeed, four of the essays are devoted
entirely to the story of his impact on psychiatry, intellectual
life and culture, especially in the United States (his influence in
England and France, by contrast, is largely ignored). Edith
Kurzweil, a University Professor at Adelphi University, and the
child psychiatrist Robert Coles agree that the high-water mark came
in the 1950's and that exiles from Nazi Europe played a central
role in Freud's midcentury triumph. Coles in particular regrets
that as psychoanalysis grew in popularity it also became more
conservative, losing the critical edge it had boasted in the early
European years. Neither author mentions the most shameful
psychoanalytic legacy of the period: the homophobic analysts,
headed by Edmund Bergler and Irving Bieber, who terrorized
countless gay men into a vain effort to liberate their supposedly
innate heterosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Another tactic of defense is to shift the arena of debate. Thus
several contributors imply that Freud should be judged less as a
scientist than as an imaginative artist. The essay by Hannah S.
Decker, a professor of history at the University of Houston, notes
the importance of the Dora case in the ``discovery'' of the
transference, but emphasizes the case's dramatic qualities and ends
by comparing Freud to the ``great thinkers and poets.'' In the same
vein, John Forrester, the author, most recently, of ``Truth
Games,'' calls ``The Interpretation of Dreams'' a ``first-order
scientific achievement'' but reads it mainly as a gripping
autobiography, told through Freud's analysis of his own dreams.
Here Decker and Forrester follow in the footsteps of Harold Bloom
and Steven Marcus, who have urged that Freud be seen as heir not to
Newton and Darwin (his own preferred genealogy) but to Shakespeare
and Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-FREUD-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED:and Dickens.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An analogous defensive move informs the contributions by John E.
Toews and Jose Brunner, both of whom focus on the Oedipus complex.
For Toews, the author of ``Hegelianism: The Path Toward Dialectical
Humanism,'' the Oedipus complex is less a psychological fact than a
``moral fable,'' a story about achieving responsible adulthood and
thus becoming ``a subject in a world of other subjects.'' For
Brunner, the author of ``Freud and the Politics of
Psychoanalysis,'' it is an allegory of the dialectical tensions --
the ambivalences -- afflicting all communities. Freud, in this
view, is at bottom neither a scientist nor an artist but a
philosopher and political theorist. His intellectual forebears,
accordingly, are not Darwin and Newton but Plato, Kant and Hegel.
And the question of whether his ideas are true or false gives way
to a consideration of their richness, complexity and depth. Freud
himself, who was intensely hostile to philosophy, would not have
appreciated the compliment.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing strategy of defense is suggested by
Oliver Sacks, the author, most recently, of ``The Island of the
Colorblind''; Sacks, though never an anti-Freudian, was one of the
signatories of the petition that derailed the original planning for
the Library of Congress exhibit. His essay celebrates the
prescience of Freud's early neurological writings, arguing that
they anticipate many recent breakthroughs in neurobiology. He notes
in particular an affinity between Freud's 1895 ``Project for a
Scientific Psychology'' and the important work of Gerald Edelman,
who dedicates his latest book on neural Darwinism to the memory of
Freud and Darwin. If Sacks is right, ``the early Freud'' may
experience a renaissance comparable to that enjoyed by ``the early
Marx'' half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   By temperament I am inclined to side with those who want to
shift the argument from the register of truth to that of influence
(``influence peddling,'' an anti-Freudian might call it). As an
intellectual historian, moreover, I must confess to a practical
investment in Freud: he is one of those original, incisive and
eloquent thinkers who come along so rarely that we would soon be
out of business if we didn't protect them from their more virulent
critics. Still, I will be surprised if in the future he continues
to exercise quite the hegemony he has in the past, though I doubt
that he will be entirely retired from combat -- much as Frederick
Crews has wished and predicted it for over a decade. In the
meantime, with only two years to go, we may safely pronounce him
the dominant intellectual presence of our century.

  Secrets From America's Leading Critics, Chefs, and Restaurateurs 
 By Andrew Dornenburg and Karen Page 
 Illustrated. 343 pp. New York: John Wiley &AMP; Sons. Paper, $29.95. 
 ------ 
 KNIFE, FORK AND SKI MASK 
 By MICHAEL RUHLMAN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
   I almost couldn't finish reading ``Dining Out: Secrets From
America's Leading Critics, Chefs, and Restaurateurs,'' because
every time I lifted it, my fingers, against my will, began riffling
the pages for all the tasty sidebars and marginal quotations from
prominent critics and chefs. I couldn't stop; it was like eating
salted nuts. Yet it's almost impossible to do otherwise, I soon
realized, because the book is virtually composed of such random
blocks of text, plus artful (but maddeningly captionless)
photographs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all its disjointedness and design-over-content feel, though,
``Dining Out'' is a fascinating collage, a study of the profession
of restaurant criticism from the vantage point of scores of critics
and the chefs those critics review, and criticism's effect on the
booming restaurant business -- ultimately, a book-length panel
discussion on cuisine's growing prominence in our culture.
</P>
<P>
   This is Andrew Dornenburg and Karen Page's third book in a
trilogy that includes ``Becoming a Chef'' and ``Culinary
Artistry,'' and its method is to heap on information via quotation
after quotation, broken up by the ubiquitous sidebars. In the very
first chapter, in addition to the brief introductory text we get a
time line, beginning in 1765, of restaurants and influential
guides; references to two First Amendment cases involving critics
sued for libel; an extended quotation from the Chicago Tribune
critic William Rice; the Esquire critic John Mariani picking
America's most influential restaurants; a history of restaurant
critics at The New York Times; movies that prominently feature food
and cooking; a list of celebrity restaurateurs and their
restaurants; and more than a dozen pull-out quotations in gold
print.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for anyone serious about food, all of it is
interesting. I was enthralled to learn the tricks of the restaurant
reviewer's trade -- how critics maintain anonymity, what they do
when they're discovered, how they became critics, how they take
notes (one critic speaks throughout dinner into his tie, where,
presumably, a microphone is housed), whether they call the chef
afterward to check details and confirm guesses.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, few critics have professional cooking
experience or formal culinary education, according to Dornenburg
and Page. One unnamed chef grumbles, ``Sometimes I resent that
after working for decades in this business, I have to wait for
marks like a schoolboy, and from people who know barely one-tenth
as much as I do about cooking.'' Norman Van Aken, chef-owner of
Norman's in Coral Gables, Fla., offers a suggestion: ``Food critics
should, perhaps, be licensed.'' Even some critics agree. David
Rosengarten, who writes for Gourmet magazine and has a Ph.D. in
dramatic literature from Cornell, comments that ``there should
almost be some sort of diploma program before you can actually
start to write about food in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Reichl, once a chef and restaurateur, now the restaurant
critic of The New York Times, is arguably the most powerful food
critic in the country. She entertainingly describes how she works,
how she schedules her days, including managing all her
reservations, given that at any one time she is researching 20
different restaurants. And then there is the anxiety inherent in
her position: she says she didn't sleep for three days after she
decided to remove one of Le Cirque's four stars (she later returned
it). But some concerns of the reviewer's life are not intellectual
or critical. ``In many ways, it's a very wearing, difficult,
invasive job because it's something you devote your whole body
to,'' says Phyllis Richman of The Washington Post. ``And you eat a
lot of bad food -- probably more bad food than anybody who cares
about food would choose to eat!''
</P>
<P>
   Reichl was photographed (in semi-disguise) for the cover of this
book, and her words conclude it: ``The great thing about great food
is that it can bring people real pleasure and enjoyment, every day.
And for all of us who are committed to making food even better in
this country, that is ultimately the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   To dismiss this book as a series of articulate comments
tediously strung together, a hodgepodge of sidebars with no clear
progression or core, would be easy but unfortunate. Offering
insiders' knowledge and illuminating insights from some of the
country's best chefs and food critics, the moderators Dornenburg
and Page have brought a generous curiosity and balance to a subject
of compulsive interest to a growing number of people.

 ------ 
 AS ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT 
 By A. O. SCOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the course of investigating a suspicious insurance claim,
Lorimer Black, the hero of William Boyd's new novel, ``Armadillo,''
encounters an entirely minor character named Francis Home. Noting
Home's olive complexion and ``dark crinkly hair,'' Lorimer wonders
about his background: ``Cypriot? Lebanese? Spanish? Egyptian?
Syrian? Greek? Like himself, Lorimer knew, there were many types of
Englishmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Like himself: Lorimer Black, educated in Scotland and given on
occasion to appearing at dinner parties in a kilt, is not who he
seems to be. ``You're not Angus Black's youngest, are you?'' asks
Sir Simon Sherriffmuir, head of Fortress Sure, the insurance giant
with which Lorimer is affiliated, trying to place this outsider in
his own rarefied social world. Lorimer Black -- senior loss
adjuster, research subject at the Institute of Lucid Dreams, author
of a private memoir called ``The Book of Transfiguration,''
collector of antique military helmets and obsessive pursuer of the
mysterious actress Flavia Malinverno -- is not Angus Black's son.
He's not Lorimer Black at all, but rather Milomre Blocj, the son of
Bogdan Blocj. Milomre (Milo to those few who know his real
identity) comes from a large family of East European Gypsies who
run a prosperous car-and-van service on the outskirts of London.
</P>
<P>
   The multiculturalism of modern Britain -- and of London
especially -- has become a staple of British fiction and has
supplied it with new subjects and new energies. It's impossible,
for instance, to imagine most of Martin Amis's novels (some of
which ``Armadillo'' calls to mind) without the clatter and menace
of colliding versions of the English language. And indeed many of
the most inventive British novelists of recent years -- Salman
Rushdie, Hanif Kureishi, Caryl Phillips, Kazuo Ishiguro, James
Kelman -- have reinvigorated the idioms and widened the scope of
English literature by, in effect, colonizing it.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd's previous books have also contributed to what might be
called the globalization of the English novel. From early satirical
efforts like the comedy of postcolonial diplomatic manners ``A Good
Man in Africa'' and the American road novel ``Stars and Bars'' to
ambitious, unclassifiable mature works like ``Brazzaville Beach''
and ``The Blue Afternoon,'' Boyd has shown himself to be at ease
with a startling diversity of settings and subjects. With
``Armadillo,'' he has come home, after ranging from Africa to the
Philippines to the American South, and found his native ground as
haunting and strange as any of them. But in spite of his taste for
the exotic, all his work, including this book, manifests some
welcome English virtues: understated wit, graceful prose and an
expert sense of pacing and narrative complication.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd's blithe cosmopolitanism may confuse American readers who,
steeped in ``Masterpiece Theater'' and recent film adaptations of
Jane Austen and E. M. Forster, associate England and its literature
above all with class. But the system of rigid social codes and
carefully maintained hierarchies that defined British life (and
animated its literature) for so long has been replaced, at least on
the evidence of this novel, by something we ex-colonials may find
more familiar -- a hectic, polyglot urban world of getting and
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Lorimer Black's London -- a rendering, it seems, of the capital
of Tony Blair's ``Cool Britannia'' -- is a city on the make,
bursting with new construction projects, trendy cafes and other
signs of affluence. At first, it seems a perfect habitat for the
ironical, deracinated Lorimer, who listens to African pop music,
drinks cappuccino and reinvents himself for each social, business
and romantic encounter by subtle alterations in his mode of dress.
He is successful at his job, in spite of the psychotic bullying of
his boss, an old-fashioned Englishman named Hogg, and diverted by a
pleasant, if not exactly passionate, affair with a divorcee named
Stella Bull. He has money for exquisite clothes and his beloved
helmets. He pays regular, if somewhat strained and chaotic, visits
to his family, and looks after his aging downstairs neighbor. His
only real problem is persistent insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   But then, through a sequence of events too complex to recount
here (the connections between which, in any case, are never fully
explained), everything in Lorimer's life begins to go wrong. His
reversal of fortune is attributed to a principle defined in one of
the reflective passages from his diary that punctuate the action of
the novel:
</P>
<P>
   ``Serendipity. From Serendip, a former name of Ceylon, now Sri
Lanka. A word coined by Horace Walpole, who had invented it based
on a folk tale whose heroes were always making discoveries of
things they were not in quest of. Ergo: serendipity, the faculty of
making happy and unexpected discoveries by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what is the opposite of Serendip, a southern land of spice
and warmth, lush greenery and hummingbirds, seawashed, sunbasted?
Think of another world in the far north, barren, icebound, cold, a
world of flint and stone. Call it Zembla. Ergo: zemblanity, the
opposite of serendipity, the faculty of making unhappy, unlucky and
expected discoveries by design. Serendipity and zemblanity: the
twin poles of the axis around which we revolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Zemblanity in Lorimer's life takes many forms: a paranoid rock
star selects him as a confidant; his car is vandalized, either by
the subject of one of his insurance investigations or by Flavia
Malinverno's jealous husband; he inherits his elderly neighbor's
dog; his father dies. But if zemblanity could be personified, it
would assume the shape of Torquil Helvoir-Jayne, an erstwhile
colleague of Lorimer's who, when taken alongside the thuggish Hogg
and the unprincipled Sir Simon, may convince you that the only
thing wrong with England these days is the English.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-ARMADILLO-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: the English.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helvoir-Jayne (it's pronounced -- oh, never mind) is one of the
great comic creations of recent literature; he belongs in the
gallery of British grotesques alongside the best efforts of Martin
Amis (Keith Talent, say, in ``London Fields'' or John Self in
``Money'') and his dad, Kingsley. The spectacularly boorish
Helvoir-Jayne attaches himself to Lorimer like a leech. He
inveigles Lorimer into helping him cover up one of his tawdry
adulteries, and then moves in with Lorimer when his wife throws him
out. And Torquil seems to be involved in some suspicious doings
involving Fortress Sure and one of its clients, for which Lorimer
ultimately will take the fall.
</P>
<P>
   TORQUIL'S opposite -- Serendip to his Zembla -- is the elusive
Flavia Malinverno, first glimpsed through the window of a passing
taxi and then in a Fortress Sure advertisement. Of course,
Lorimer's pursuit of her precipitates complications of its own,
thanks to her violent-tempered husband and her propensity to shade
and amplify the truth.
</P>
<P>
   But Lorimer confronts it all with philosophical detachment: ``I
do not mind contradictions, paradoxes, puzzles and ambiguities.
What is the point of 'minding' something as inevitable and
entrenched in our nature as our digestive system is in our body?''
Such an attitude will help the reader of this novel as well.
``Armadillo'' is full of loose ends, unsolved mysteries and red
herrings. But it is also charming, unsettling and sneakily,
serendipitously profound.

THE HOURS
</HEADLINE>

 ------ 
 PARALLEL LIVES 
 By MICHAEL WOOD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a morning in June, a woman in her early 50's steps out into
the bright, busy city that she loves. She needs to buy flowers for
a party she is giving later in the day. She bumps into an old
acquaintance, remembers moments from her earlier life. Along with a
number of other people, she catches a glimpse of a celebrity, but
isn't sure who it is. She buys the flowers, goes home and her day
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Where are we? We could, of course, be in any one of a number of
days and cities, and the possibility itself is part of the answer
to the question. But we are quite definitely, recognizably, in two
novels: ``Mrs. Dalloway,'' by Virginia Woolf, and ``The Hours,'' by
Michael Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   There are differences. The city is London in one case and New
York in the other. The time is the 1920's; it is the 1990's. The
unknown celebrity is a prince, a queen or a prime minister in a
car; she is a movie star in a trailer. The woman in both novels is
called Clarissa, but in the later work Mrs. Dalloway is a nickname.
The chief difference, perhaps, is that no one in the first novel
can have read the second, whereas almost everyone in the second
seems to have read the first.
</P>
<P>
   There are eerie consequences of this impression. When ``The
Hours'' begins to repeat some of the darker events from ``Mrs.
Dalloway,'' is this a literary parallel, a hint at the limitations
of human plots and chances -- or a suggestion that the first novel
has caused the events in the second? When someone dies quoting from
Virginia Woolf's own suicide note, you think there must be even
further options. What's clear is that the relationship between the
two novels goes beyond allusion, and even beyond the modernist
habit of borrowing previous literary structures, which T. S. Eliot
called ``the mythical method.'' ``The Hours'' is haunted by ``Mrs.
Dalloway'' -- appropriately, because its theme is the haunting of
present lives by memories and books, by distant pasts and missed
futures, by novels and poems to be read and written.
</P>
<P>
   But so far I have described only one of Cunningham's story
lines, and there are three. Their final intersection is a thing of
such beauty and surprise that I can't reveal it here, but I can
sketch out the lines before their meeting. After the New York
Clarissa, we encounter a (fictional but entirely plausible) version
of Woolf herself in 1923. She and her husband, Leonard, are living
in Richmond, just outside London. The quiet is good for her health,
but she longs to get back to the city. She is writing ``Mrs.
Dalloway,'' at this point still called ``The Hours.'' Her sister,
Vanessa, arrives with her children. Virginia slips away, almost
takes a train to London, meets Leonard while she is waiting, goes
home. Somewhere along the way, she decides that Clarissa Dalloway
will not die in her novel; someone else will.
</P>
<P>
   This story is told in seven episodes, interspersed with eight
episodes of the New York day and with seven episodes evoking
another time and place and person. A young woman called Laura
Brown, pregnant for a second time, mother of a small boy, is
married to an amiable veteran of World War II -- the date is 1949
-- and lives a slightly bewildered life in a suburb of Los Angeles.
She has a moment of sudden, surprising sexual excitement with
another woman and takes off into a little fugue rather like Woolf's
projected one. She drives into the city, finds a room in a hotel
and reads -- ``Mrs. Dalloway,'' of course. Then she goes home to
her son and husband and a birthday celebration and sex. Goes home
this time, the implication is.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in New York, Clarissa thinks about her party. It
is for her friend Richard, an AIDS-stricken poet who is about to
receive an award. Clarissa lives with her lover, Sally, and has for
many years. An old gay friend drops by, aging, weeping. Clarissa's
beautiful daughter, involved with an older woman whom Clarissa
hates, also appears, apparently unfazed by the raging hostility
between her friend and her mother. Clarissa visits Richard to see
if he's ready for the party.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief prologue, the stories alternate in an intricate
sequence, rather like a rhyme scheme. The prologue recounts, mainly
from Woolf's point of view, the writer's stepping into an English
river to her death. The time of that event is 1941. I thought,
until I was a good way into the book, that this beginning was a
mistake: too heavy, quite apart from the stylistic risk. But what
happens to Cunningham's characters fully justifies this move. He
needs the shadow cast by Woolf's death, because it represents the
condition under which we find whatever light there is. The whole
book does sound a little fussy in description, an exercise in
echoes, but it doesn't read that way. Do we need to know ``Mrs.
Dalloway'' to get the gist of ``The Hours''? No, but ``need'' is
perhaps not the right word.
</P>
<P>
   We don't have to read ``Mrs. Dalloway'' before we can read ``The
Hours,'' and no amount of pedantic comparison-hunting will help us
understand it if we don't understand it already. But the
connections between the two books, after the initial, perhaps
overelaborate laying out of repetitions and divergences, are so
rich and subtle and offbeat that not to read ``Mrs. Dalloway''
after we've read ``The Hours'' seems like a horrible denial of a
readily available pleasure -- as if we were to leave a concert just
when the variations were getting interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham's two earlier novels, ``A Home at the End of the
World'' and ``Flesh and Blood,'' are remarkable for the intensity
with which their characters experience their own strangeness -- as
if to be ordinary were an accomplishment, only rarely within reach.
From such a perspective, Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway seems to be waiting,
like an older sister: ``She always had the feeling that it was
very, very dangerous to live even one day.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times in ``The Hours'' when Cunningham follows Woolf's
cadences too closely: ``Here she is then, Clarissa thinks'';
``Here, then, is the party.'' The effect is one of pastiche rather
than of being haunted. There are moments too when the writing
doesn't rise to its own challenges, merely gesturing toward the
feelings on offer: ``She is sad for him, and strangely moved. She
manages an ironic smile.'' But the overall impression is that of a
delicate, triumphant glance, an acknowledgment of Woolf that takes
her into Cunningham's own territory, a place of late-century danger
but also of treasurable hours.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a mother both understanding of and unnerved by her son's
love for her: ``He knows. He must know. . . . He is devoted,
entirely, to the observation and deciphering of her, because
without her there is no world at all. . . . He will watch her
forever. He will always know when something is wrong. He will
always know precisely when and how much she has failed.'' It is
only on reflection that we realize that the mother's fear is also a
legacy, a gift to the child, something he will always know. But
reflection is where many of our chances for happiness lie, in the
memory not of what happened but of what was promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had seemed like the beginning of happiness,'' the New York
Clarissa thinks of her early relationship with Richard, ``and
Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, more than 30 years later, to
realize that it was happiness. . . . There is still that singular
perfection, and it's perfect in part because it seemed, at the
time, so clearly to promise more. Now she knows: That was the
moment, right then. There has been no other.''

  An Irreverent Look Behind the Scenes at Thirty-eight well,
Thirty-seven) Seasons of New York Jets Football Futility 
 By Gerald Eskenazi 
 Illustrated. 333 pp. New York: Simon &AMP; Schuster. $25. 
 ------ 
 JET LAG 
 By ROY BLOUNT JR. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has any other New York institution enjoyed so little glory as
the New York Jets? There was the one great upstart moment in the
1969 Super Bowl, when their flamboyant quarterback, Joe Namath,
guaranteed that the Jets would beat the heavily favored Baltimore
Colts and then in fact they did. But although Namath himself, long
retired, remains an icon, the Jets have come to be known, for the
color of their jerseys but also for their tendency toward
mortification, as Gang Green.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say that the history of the franchise is
devoid of interest. ``I believe,'' says Gerald Eskenazi, who has
been a sportswriter at The New York Times for some 35 years, ``the
Jets are the most famous bad franchise in sports. But that doesn't
mean they are a team that cannot be enjoyed, even loved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets started out in 1960 as the Titans. Their owner was, as
Eskenazi tells us, the former sports announcer Harry Wismer, who
``once called The New York Times, where I had just started as a
copy boy.'' The conversation went like this:
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Hello, this is Harry Wismer. Who's this?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him my name. It was unknown to anyone outside of my
family and friends and a few people in the office, who were
impressed with the way I tore copy paper off the A.P. machine and
got the coffee order right. I had yet to have a byline.
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Jerry,' he shouted into the phone, 'you're doing a great
job!'
</P>
<P>
   ``His checks bounced, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The legendary quarterback Sammy Baugh, who coached the
profoundly unlegendary Titans for two years before moving on, tells
Eskenazi: ``The last time I saw Harry, I was coaching Houston and
we played the Jets in New York. And Harry called me and said,
'Could I ride to the game on the bus?' and I said, hell, yes. He
sat on our bench the whole first half, then he went up to the press
box. He came down a few minutes later and his nose was all bloodied
and he had blood all over his shirt. Someone had beat him up. It
was the last time I ever saw Harry, all bloodied.''
</P>
<P>
   New management, most notably the Hollywood talent packager Sonny
Werblin, rescued the Titans from bankruptcy in 1963 and renamed
them the Jets, not because ``jet planes were flying over Shea
Stadium every 45 seconds throughout a game'' -- the Jets played
their first season not at Shea but at the old Polo Grounds -- but
to celebrate the jet age and to rhyme with the popular Mets. When
the Jets did move to Shea, they found it necessary to practice at
least once in a vacant lot near the stadium because the Mets
wouldn't let them use the field. Weeb Ewbank, who was the Jets'
coach at the time, recalls kids coming to watch this practice
session: ``I said to one, 'Sonny, will you move your bicycle?' And
he said, 'No, it's as much my park as it is yours.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Werblin (who preferred not to discuss show business -- when
asked what Elizabeth Taylor was like, he said: ``Short. Very
short'') signed up Namath, supposedly for $427,000 over three
years, an extraordinarily high figure for the time. (Namath was
represented in the negotiations by a law firm called Bite, Bite &AMP;
Bite.) Eskenazi points out that the contract included the list
price of a Lincoln Continental and several bonus clauses. During
the festive announcement of Namath's signing at Toots Shor's
saloon, the Jets' team doctor took Namath into the men's room and
examined his much-injured knees for the first time. He emerged to
tell Ewbank, ``Hope we've got another quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   NAMATH'S gimpy legs didn't prevent him from developing into a
sweet-throwing, high-living wonder man, ``as he became the first
quarterback ever to throw for 4,000 yards in a 14-game season . . .
as he took the field wearing white shoes, sporting long hair,
growing a Fu Manchu mustache, wearing pantyhose in a commercial,
donning a mink, telling of his white llama bedroom rug.''
Unfortunately, that passage, which would suggest a considerable
delay of game, is not unrepresentative of Eskenazi's prose in this
book, which gives the appearance of having been written in
considerably more haste, or at least with less care, than his news
dispatches in The Times. ``The Jets I came to write about were like
life as Kafka or George Carlin might have pictured it -- only more
so,'' Eskenazi writes. Hard to know what to make of that.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as the years go by, the Jets' history becomes a bit of
a blur, but ``Gang Green'' includes a number of nice anecdotes.
There was a punter, Curley Johnson, who the night before the Super
Bowl dreamed that his punts went straight up in the air and landed
at his feet. A defensive back, Johnny Sample, who intercepted a
pass meant for a Baltimore receiver and then tapped him on the head
with the ball, saying, ``This is what you're lookin' for.'' A wide
receiver, George Sauer, who carried a copy of Camus's ``Myth of
Sisyphus'' in his pocket during training camp. A head coach, the
aforementioned Ewbank, who stepped on a LeRoy Neiman sideline
sketch with a muddy shoe, looked down and said, ``LeRoy, you're
improving.'' A defensive end, Mark Gastineau, who built up his abs
so that they could be counted through his tight jersey, because he
believed that ``all strength comes from your stomach.'' (``There
was a bit of the fourth dimension about Mark,'' Eskenazi writes.
``He was fascinated with American Indian lore.'')
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the book covers the early, crazy years. The
final stage, as Bill Parcells takes over as head coach and begins
to enforce severe professionalism, is relatively upbeat: ``Perhaps,
just perhaps, the long strange saga of the New York Jets would have
a happy ending.'' A Jet fan's spirits, presumably, are lifted. The
reader misses Harry Wismer.

THE VICTORS
</HEADLINE>
  Eisenhower and His Boys: The Men of World War II 
 By Stephen E. Ambrose 
 Illustrated. 396 pp. New York: Simon &AMP; Schuster. $28 
 ------ 
 THE MEN WHO BEAT HITLER 
 By NATHANIEL TRIPP 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen E. Ambrose's latest book follows the World War II Allied
campaign in Europe from the appointment of Gen. Dwight D.
Eisenhower as commander of the European Theater of Operations to
the final surrender of Germany, seven days after Hitler's suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose fans will have a distinct sense of deja vu; ``The
Victors'' is largely composed of huge blocks of text from five of
Ambrose's previous histories: ``Eisenhower,'' ``Pegasus Bridge,''
``Band of Brothers,'' ``D-Day'' and ``Citizen Soldiers.'' Still,
there is a lot to be said for having it all under one cover, for
combining Ambrose's compelling portrait of Eisenhower's leadership
with the vivid experiences of the infantrymen, and following the
campaign from conception to conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger obstacle for me is that although I am only 10 years
younger than Ambrose, we are of separate generations. While he was
teaching, writing and researching military history, I was leading a
platoon in Vietnam. Like many in my generation, I felt betrayed by
what had once seemed heroic. It has been painful for me to read
about war ever since. I am always horrified, and never inspired.
But then those of us who served in Vietnam are notorious for our
cynicism, our distrust of authority. His was the good war, ours the
bad one, and I read ``The Victors'' with the hope of narrowing what
became known as the generation gap.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose starts with Eisenhower, which narrows the gap for me.
Almost everyone loved Eisenhower, and he firmly set the standards
for leadership. Ambrose quotes a remark Eisenhower made on the
subject of pacifism -- ``I doubt whether any of these people, with
their academic or dogmatic hatred of war, detest it as much as I
do'' -- and when Eisenhower tells young lieutenants they must be a
father for their men it strikes a hauntingly familiar chord. The
quality of leadership, echoed down through the ranks, is a central
theme. So are unity of purpose and the unit cohesion that results.
</P>
<P>
   While I don't envy another man's war, we didn't have that in
Vietnam, and the lack of it led to poor morale, occasional
atrocities and defeat. So I can readily relate to these themes of
leadership. I also recognize the intimate details of the
infantryman's experience: digging in, using the terrain, firing and
maneuvering. I am fascinated by the similarity of tactics, the
characteristically American reliance on heavy firepower if the
infantrymen can be spared; even the logistics of preparation can be
mesmerizing, as they are in real life. But then the invasion is
launched and men begin to die, first by the tens, then by the
hundreds and thousands. As is always true, nobody is really
prepared for the enormity of war, and no text can fully capture it.
Here the generation gap begins to widen again.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose is a superb historian. He has the details and he has the
voice. When, however, he writes about the citizen soldier, he
himself all too often sounds more like the professional soldier. He
has an admirable Eisenhower-like loyalty toward the men and a
soldier's focus on the objective ahead. He assembles a huge array
of details to support his mission, drawing heavily from interviews
and unit histories. But in the compression of thousands of pages
from his earlier books into just under 400 here, many illuminating
and insightful details have been lost and jingoism comes more to
the fore. The highest praise he can deliver to one of his heroes is
to compare him to Sergeant York, and he does it twice.
</P>
<P>
   But war brings out the worst in people as well as the best, and
behavior that is considered heroic in war would often be considered
sociopathic if not totally insane in another setting. When Ambrose
allows the men to speak for themselves, they often express very
human feelings: terror, disgust and shame as well as the flush of
victory. ``Whatever you do in this book, don't go making me into a
bloody hero,'' a British sergeant he is interviewing says. But then
Ambrose replies: ``Sergeant Thornton, I don't make heroes. I only
write about them.'' Was he really listening?
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose has said elsewhere that war is a political act, and his
accounts here superficially avoid the politics of war, even as they
deliver the message that there is something innately superior about
the soldiers of a democracy. This is a familiar theme for me as
well, because this is what we, too, were told as young officers. It
may be true, but surely all armies send similar messages to their
troops. These are messages that can lead societies toward pretty
serious misadventures when politicians are added to the brew.
Ambrose's projection of such a militaristic view thins his book's
air of authenticity. I'm afraid that at such moments he contributes
less to the history of war than to the culture of it.

MADNESS ON THE COUCH
</HEADLINE>
  Blaming the Victim in the Heyday of Psychoanalysis 
 By Edward Dolnick 
 Illustrated. 368 pp. New York: Simon &AMP; Schuster. $25 
 ------ 
 TALKING CURE? 
 By DEREK BICKERTON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bleeding. Trepanning. Castration. Electroshock. Powdered unicorn
horns. Horse-blood injections. An ice pick through the eye socket.
Incarceration with snakes. Exposure to extreme temperatures.
Artificially induced epilepsy. Insulin coma.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a catalogue of ancient and modern tortures. All
these methods were used at various times, by supposedly expert and
well-meaning physicians, to treat sufferers from mental illness.
Small wonder, then, that when members of a respected school of
thought claimed they could cure psychoses by simply talking,
clinicians and the public responded with relief and approbation.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Madness on the Couch,'' Edward Dolnick, formerly the chief
science writer for The Boston Globe and now a contributing editor
for Health magazine, describes how, in the 1950s and '60s, Freudian
psychoanalysts sought to adapt their master's theories to treat
schizophrenia, autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The title
is potentially ambiguous: was the true madness that of the
patients, or did the doctors themselves, blinded by arrogance and
self-righteousness, embark on what now seems a course of lunatic
folly? Seldom has there been a more pungent illustration of the
adage ``The road to hell is paved with good intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by public acclaim and a virtual absence of critical
scrutiny, truly believing that all mental illness could be healed
if the patient could be made to confront its (purely mental)
causes, many of Freud's followers boldly entered fields where Freud
had carefully refrained from going -- even where he had warned
against going.
</P>
<P>
   Two fields were fraught with special pitfalls. Schizophrenia
affects mainly young adults; autism is diagnosed in young children.
If one rules out biology (and Freudians dismissed it on principle),
parental indiscretion is the only plausible culprit. The
possibility of ``a schizophrenogenic mother,'' casually mentioned
in a paper by a noted psychiatrist, Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, was
seized on and developed into elaborate profiles of
schizophrenia-causing families. Though it was the brainchild of a
clinical amateur, the anthropologist Gregory Bateson, the ``double
bind,'' a Catch-22 message from parent to child, received equally
enthusiastic acceptance. As for autistic children, their apparently
willful self-isolation must reflect the hostility and indifference
of ``refrigerator parents'' -- cold, mechanical creatures who,
according to Bruno Bettelheim, wished that their children ``should
not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The belief in parental cause soon passed into the popular
culture, resulting in untold agony to countless innocent people.
For Freudian psychotherapy had double binds, but no double blinds:
its devotees did not take the elementary precaution of comparing
parents of schizophrenics or autistic children with other parents,
let alone test whether ``blind'' observers, ignorant of which group
individuals belonged to, could correctly assign them on the basis
of objective data.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Freudians might have survived this lack of empirical
support, even the absence of any nontemporary improvement in their
patients, but for developments outside therapy altogether. Evidence
accumulated that biological factors did indeed predispose
individuals to schizophrenia and other disorders. Simultaneously, a
series of largely serendipitous discoveries by practicing
clinicians revealed that for many conditions, medication could do
far more, far more quickly, than psychoanalysis. Acclaimed
therapists suddenly found themselves facing huge malpractice suits
for failing to prescribe what were already proven treatments.
</P>
<P>
   This bare summary of Dolnick's theme, however, does his book
scant justice. He brings to his task a formidable array of
strengths. Interviews with Freudians, anti-Freudians and their
patients, as well as an exhaustive reading of relevant literature,
provide his persuasive account with vivid anecdotes, from the
bizarre ritual demanded by Howard Hughes (an obsessive-compulsive
in later life) before opening canned food to the naive excursion,
``akin to the idle speculation of nannies at the park,'' that the
renowned ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen made into autism. A diverse
cast of characters is captured in brilliant thumbnail vignettes:
the birdlike, charismatic R. D. Laing, who at the end delivered a
lecture ``drunk and stoned''; the dogged young doctor Leonard
Heston, who, when refused a Federal grant, did the research (on
children of schizophrenic mothers who were given up for adoption)
on his own time, money and barnstorming ingenuity; and many more.
Dolnick's narrative moves smoothly and effortlessly, never
lingering too long on any topic yet never leaving a topic until its
full significance has been explored. Despite its somber theme, the
book is a delight to read.
</P>
<P>
   But just what is its significance? In his prologue, Dolnick
limits his goal to describing the excesses of Freud's followers; he
explicitly disavows any intention of debunking psychotherapy, which
has helped people to ``cope with a divorce, or a child's death, or
a vague but oppressive feeling of inadequacy.'' But here, in a rare
misstep, he seems to confuse psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.
Freudian psychoanalysis is but one variety of psychotherapy; other
approaches -- behavioral, humanistic, cognitive -- eschew the
deep-analytic, symbol-chasing style of Freudians and Jungians for
more practical, problem-solving techniques. These alternative
therapies, which he never distinguishes, are far likelier than
analysis to be used, and useful, in dealing with grief, marital
problems and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Dolnick's disclaimer seems aimed at avoiding accusations of
Freud-bashing. His earlier chapters, where he lays the groundwork
for his assault on therapeutic hubris, show that all the errors of
Freud's disciples -- overconfidence, dogmatism, indifference to
empirical proofs, roseate evaluations of treatment outcomes,
willingness to interpret a patient's ``No'' as either ``No'' or
``Yes,'' whichever fitted the analysis -- were already latent in
Freud's own theory and practice. The excesses Dolnick recounts
sprang not from personal failings of individual therapists but from
the nature of their approach.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the book leaves one with a disturbing thought.
Practices that now seem reckless and sometimes downright cruel were
hailed in their day as pinnacles of medical achievement. Which of
today's lauded practices, one wonders, will stand condemned a few
decades hence?

CENTRAL SQUARE
</HEADLINE>
  By George Packer 
 348 pp. St. Paul: Graywolf Press. $24.95 
 ------ 
 THE LEFT BANK 
 By RAND RICHARDS COOPER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   American novelists love the city, and they love hating it, too.
From Theodore Dreiser to Jay McInerney, writers have plumbed our
ambivalence toward urban life so often, and so eagerly, that it's
tempting to call the American novel an urban art form. One doubts
cities always appreciate the attention. Cambridge, Mass., at any
rate, will not rush to embrace ``Central Square,'' George Packer's
mordant look at life along the left bank of the Charles.
</P>
<P>
   On display in ``Central Square'' is not upscale, Victorian,
boutique-and-cafe Cambridge but the grittier middle stretch of
Massachusetts Avenue, a no man's land of the benighted. Here the
raucous contrasts that novelists once discovered in urban life --
vice and hope, squalor and splendor -- have given way to
postindustrial anomie. Factories have closed down; rumors circulate
of a casino in the works; shelters and mental health centers
constitute the only growth industry.
</P>
<P>
   Packer follows a trio of characters into this drab panorama.
Paula Voorhees is a clinical social worker sliding into burnout.
The therapy she dispenses to the homeless and the battered strikes
her as farcically inadequate -- a Band-Aid applied to the gushing
wounds of the disenfranchised. In her own life, self-protectiveness
drifts toward cynicism; she fears being single (``a condition --
suppressed panic with a whiff of cat hair'') but sleeps with a man
she's careful not to risk loving. After work, back at her dingy
apartment, she and the super's needy, abused wife exchange blunt
insults, and she goes away refreshed: ``It felt like her first real
human contact of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   A different panic stalks Eric Barnes. A novelist, he has three
money-losing books on his resume and is stuck, dismally, partway
through a fourth. His career is stalled, his wife is pregnant, his
study is being remodeled into a nursery, and when he dares to
renegotiate his tiny advance, his editor humbles him with revenue
printouts. Increasingly, all Eric can see about his friends is how
successful they are -- like the lawyer who is ``deeply sentimental
in a way, Eric thought, made possible by money.''
</P>
<P>
   Packer excels at portraying the mired and anxious:
college-educated 30-somethings whose easy idealism is yielding to
bleak encroachments of failure. There's more humor to this than you
might expect -- like Eric's perception of what having children does
to one's parties (``The grown-ups discussed toilet training while
Zach smeared goat cheese on the leather ottoman'') or Paula's take
on a patient who confides homicidal feelings (``This was progress,
but it felt like training a drugged bear to perform tricks designed
to put her life at risk''). In his study, Eric soothes himself by
contemplating vengeance on a rat scratching behind the wall, even
as he conducts a running argument with a radio-show guest touting a
book called ``Hold On, You Can Have Everything!'' A generous irony
marks the best moments of ``Central Square.'' These are characters
whose last redoubt, in the face of despair, is a weary, rueful
verve.
</P>
<P>
   When Packer tries to figure out what to do with these
characters, however, things get a little dodgy. Through a chance
encounter in the Widener library at Harvard, Paula and Eric meet,
and soon become lovers. Their illicit trysts take up a lot of
terrain in ``Central Square,'' and it isn't very rich soil.
``Falling into an affair would be a . . . revolt, and yet he also
knew that the moment with Paula by the river was the best thing
about him -- cheerful, loving, generous in spirit.'' Packer seems
to lose sight of how steeply we will discount Eric's passion as
mere flight from the responsibilities of fatherhood. At times, the
novel turns you into a bad therapist, impatient with Eric's
self-deceptions; the narrative voice occasionally resembles that of
a colluding enabler.
</P>
<P>
   But the weakest part of ``Central Square'' is the plot Packer
weaves around his third character, an enigmatic African-American
named Joe. Returning from a stay as a volunteer in Africa, Joe
decides, obscurely, to pass himself off as Amouzou, a village
shaman. Soon he wins a reputation in Central Square. (``They say he
gets inside you,'' a man tells Eric, ``changes your shape or
something, fixes your problems.'') He joins a shadowy organization,
known as the Community, that has been papering the streets with
cryptic exhortations on blue fliers. Part encounter group, part
populist uprising, it is led by Paula's sleazy boss, Peter Fine, a
would-be ``therapeutic rock star'' with a talent for stoking the
resentments of the underclass. Packer seems to be making a point
about therapy's potential as a language of demagoguery. But Fine's
rabble-rousing is so banal (``You and I need to have the courage to
heal on the next level'') that you don't believe anyone could be
``mesmerized,'' or that Paula, watching a crowd of listeners, would
feel ``a shiver'' of fear. Such scenes seem contrived.
</P>
<P>
   The same holds for the portrayal of Joe himself. Though Packer
supplies him with distant memories of a childhood with foster
parents killed in a car accident, Joe seems almost entirely
metaphorical, deployed to play ironically against the other two
main characters. Is he the true healer? Or is he the true writer,
who can shape-shift into any new identity? Or perhaps he's a
sacrificial sufferer, bearing the burden of everyone else's
inauthenticity and pain? When Eric, having discovered the truth
about Joe, recognizes ``something of himself'' in the man's
masquerade and exhorts him to ``let them know who you are,'' the
encounter seems stage-managed in order to deliver the realization;
its meaning hasn't been earned on the ground but imposed from
above. The magic of fiction, William Gass once wrote, is that when
we read it, ``thought seems to grow a body.'' But as ``Central
Square'' boils away toward its overheated denouement, the
characters get thinner and thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Packer's novel can be read as a running argument with the
therapeutic culture -- its personalizing of the political, its
rejection of tragic and comic perspectives in favor of
``irony-free'' personal-growth platitudes. And yet as ``Central
Square'' proceeds, its own irony leaks away; the narrative voice
loses its edge. Eric finally comes before the Community to be
cross-examined about his shortcomings. ``He was glad they had made
him name his issues. He felt hopeful, he didn't know why or for
what.'' It's as if Packer has capitulated, lost the argument, been
swallowed by the monster he set out to slay. Fair warning, perhaps,
for irony in the age of therapy: novelist, heal thyself.

THE ESCAPE OF ALEXEI

  Son of Tsar Nicholas II: What Happened the Night the Romanov Family
Was Executed

 CZAR VASILY? 
 BY ORLANDO FIGES 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day in the summer 1983 Oleg Filatov, the son of a
schoolteacher in Orenburg, a town in the steppes of Russia, thought
he learned he was the grandson of Nicholas II, the last Czar of
Russia. He had been out fishing with his father, Vasily, when he
first noticed scars on the older man and began to question him.
``There was a revolution,'' the czarevich began.
</P>
<P>
   Vasily was then in his 70's -- he died five years later -- and
over the next several months he disclosed his secret history to his
family. On the night of July 17, 1918, when, according to the
historical record, the Czar and the Czarina, their five children
and four servants were shot dead by the Bolsheviks in
Yekaterinburg, the 14-year-old boy somehow managed to survive and
escape with the help of two friendly Bolshevik executioners.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to Shadrinsk, 100 miles away, where he was adopted
by a peasant family named Filatov. The czarevich was famously a
hemophiliac, and several times had nearly bled to death after minor
falls he had taken while playing. Yet his gunshot wounds
miraculously healed, thanks to herbal remedies and a diet of raw
meat prescribed by the tribal peoples of the north. For the next
few years he roamed as an orphan across the country, settling in
1930 in the Tyumen region of Siberia, where he trained as a
teacher. In 1967 Filatov and his wife moved to Orenburg.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Filatov is not the only person who thinks he should be
czar. Recently ``Blood Relative,'' by Michael Gray, was published
in London. That book, like ``The Escape of Alexei,'' which gives
Filatov's account, claims to be ``the true story'' of the czarevich
and ``written by his son.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new. Ever since the execution of the Romanovs
there have been pretenders to their nonexistent throne. Aleksei has
popped up in Siberia, Australia, New Zealand, Miami and Vancouver.
Today Moscow is home to several of his sons. And that's not to
mention the Anastasiyas. None of the claimants has not turned out
to be a crank. All their stories have broken on hard facts. First
there are the testimonies of the execution squad: that Aleksei was
shot several times and then bayoneted in the heart; that the
corpses of Aleksei and Mariya, his sister, were burned in a pit;
and that all the others, including Anastasiya, were buried in the
woods near Yekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the forensic tests that were carried out on their
skeletons after they were exhumed in 1991. By comparing their DNA
with that of relatives of Czar Nicholas II and the Czarina,
Aleksandra, scientists are as sure as they can be that the bones
reburied in St. Petersburg this summer are the bones of the
Romanovs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Escape of Alexei'' is fronted (to say written would be
flattery) by three Russian ``scientists,'' its publisher is at
pains to point out. But their scientific credentials are rather
dubious. Igor Lysenko (not to be confused with Trofim Lysenko,
Stalin's fraudulent biologist) is a nuclear physicist and graduate
of the Theological Academy who advised the Commission of the Holy
Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church on the canonization of the
Czar. Georgi Egorov is an engineer and a ``prize-winning skier,''
the preface tells us, so he ``is well qualified to answer the
question of how the czarevich, an adolescent suffering from
hemophilia, may have survived the execution to live another 70
years.'' And Vadim Petrov is called ``a candidate of medical
sciences'' who wrote his dissertation on identifying dead bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The science in their book does not amount to much. First, in
fact, they parade as historians, giving us, they claim, a ``fresh
perspective'' on the events, ``free from prejudice.'' But what
follows in their historical chapters is the familiar account of the
Czar's abdication, his family's imprisonment and execution -- which
has been recounted better many times before. Their only new idea is
patently absurd: that the deposed Czar was no threat to the
Bolsheviks, who therefore had a motive to let his poor son go. Much
of the book is then taken up with tedious homely reminiscences by
Oleg and his sisters about their father, illustrated with family
snaps from the Filatov album.
</P>
<P>
   The ``scientific evidence,'' when it finally appears, is
risible. First the authors claim to ``prove'' that it would have
been ``impossible'' to burn the corpses of Aleksei and Mariya --
largely on the grounds that it was wet that night and it takes a
long time to burn a human body. Then they wheel on two specialists
who testify that both the handwriting and the photograph images of
Vasily and Aleksei belong (``with a high degree of certainty'') to
the same man.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone can see that they are chalk and cheese. Filatov's
handwriting is obviously different, even though the writing style
of the class to which he claims to belong was extremely
standardized. Then there is the minor problem (which the authors
don't discuss) that, according to his birth certificate, Filatov
was born in December 1907 and the czarevich in July 1904.
</P>
<P>
   On this basis virtually anybody with a Russian grandpa could
make a claim to the Romanov throne. But there is one way for Oleg
Filatov to prove his genealogy -- a DNA test. Why has he not taken
one? More important, why did his publisher not insist on one before
agreeing to sell his story?
</P>
<P>
   When Filatov first told his tale in 1988 he was a worker at
Leningrad airport. Since then he has risen to become a bank
employee. But all the same, one can't help thinking that the lure
of money has played some part here. He may not win the Romanov
fortune, but if the publicity his publisher has lavished on this
book is anything to go by, he will make a fortune from book clubs.
</P>
<P>
   What makes myths more salable than history? Why do we persist in
believing fantasies in the face of all the facts? It is simply
inconceivable that anyone survived that brutal execution. Fifty
shots were fired at 11 people and all their bodies subsequently
bayoneted. Yet legends are retold of miraculous escapes -- first of
Anastasiya and then, when she was dug up along with the others, of
the Czarevich. Oleg Filatov or Michael Gray -- neither is
believable and neither is the last adventurer.

 &UR; INSIDE THE THIRD REICH &QL; 
 &UR; BY PETER GAY &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Aufbau-Verlag, a Berlin publisher once best known for
the cheap editions of the German classics it threw on the East
German market, brought out a two-volume diary covering the Nazi
years, 1933 to 1945, by Victor Klemperer, a professor of Romance
languages at Dresden Technical University. Despite its formidable
bulk (almost 1,700 pages) and steep price (well over $60), the book
became an astonishing best seller and has remained one -- hardcover
sales exceed 160,000 -- and has created a Klemperer industry, which
so far has produced an abridged edition designed for schools and a
prize-winning radio adaptation. An ambitious 13-part television
series is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   This extraordinary appeal to Germans is not hard to understand.
The Nazi tyranny has been thoroughly explored in general histories,
monographs, memoirs, lectures, films, exhibitions, television
programs. But even the reader familiar with Holocaust material must
be gripped by these pages. They offer a report from the interior
that tells the horrifying story of the evolving Nazi persecution of
Germany's Jews, and (though of course to a far lesser extent) of
Germany's gentiles, with a concrete, vivid power that is, and I
think will remain, unsurpassed. What is more, Klemperer's frequent
encounters with ``good Germans'' may serve to relieve part of the
guilt that responsible Germans continue to feel for the Nazis'
crimes. ``I Will Bear Witness'' is an intensely German document;
with Martin Chalmers's fluent, trustworthy translation, delicate
abridgment and informative notes, English-speaking readers now have
the first installment of a fascinating self-portrait and an equally
fascinating portrait of a regime whose consequences haunt the world
to this day. To read Klemperer's almost day-by-day account is a
hypnotic experience; the whole, hard to put down, is a true murder
mystery -- from the perspective of the victim.
</P>
<P>
   On March 10, 1933, Victor Klemperer summed up the traumatic
events of the past few weeks in the diary he had been keeping
faithfully for years: ``January 30. Hitler Chancellor. What, up to
election Sunday on March 5, I called terror, was a mild prelude.''
The day before that election, rigged by the Nazis with giant
propaganda and intimidation, Klemperer had heard Hitler speak and
wondered at his delivery: ``But the tone! The unctuous bawling,
truly bawling, of a priest.'' And he anxiously asked himself: ``How
long will I keep my post?''
</P>
<P>
   Klemperer had every right to be worried; the political shocks he
so tersely reported were a catastrophe for him. He was a liberal
citizen who voted for the small, ever waning party of
intellectuals, the Democrats; he was a sworn critic of doctrinaire
political systems, among which he included Nazism, Communism and,
rather perversely, Zionism; he was a cultural aristocrat offended
by Hitlerite vulgarity. He was also a Jew, if only by the
``racial'' reckoning the Nazis employed, for he had converted to
Protestantism as a young man. And his wife, Eva, was, in Nazi
jargon, a ``full-blooded Aryan.'' Indeed, a Nazi regulation, and,
later, the much criticized Allied bombing of Dresden, were to save
Klemperer's life: his wife's ``racial purity'' exempted her husband
from deportation to the east and almost certain death until early
1945, and amid the destruction and the chaos in Dresden, Eva
removed the yellow star on Klemperer's coat, allowing him to pose
as a German gentile who had lost all his papers. Who can deny that
history is full of unexpected, even tasteless ironies?
</P>
<P>
   Victor Klemperer was what the Germans call a problematische
Personlichkeit, a problematic personality. He was the youngest of
nine children, his father a modern Reform rabbi, his mother a
housewife whom he virtually ignores in his diary. Unlike his three
older brothers, especially his eldest, Georg, who became an eminent
surgeon, he long vacillated about what profession to adopt. He
tentatively explored several options: a commercial, a literary and,
in the end, an academic career. The first was an abject failure;
the second a surprising half success as he poured out articles,
fiction and anthologies and traveled across the country giving
lectures on literary topics; the third an incongruous mixture of
gratifying haven and grating disappointment. In 1920, at 39, he was
appointed to his chair at Dresden Technical University, recently
created and lacking the prestige of more time-honored institutions.
</P>
<P>
   One can see why he did not do better, quite apart from being a
Jew, or an ex-Jew, which was still a handicap in the academy during
the Weimar Republic: he wrote indefatigably, making voluminous
contributions to collective histories of French literature,
distinguishing himself mainly as a lucid writer and an opinionated
guide -- hardly the kind of serious, convoluted scholarship that
brought a German professor fame and promotion. And he lacked
originality; his most striking view was an insistent, quite
unhistorical, contempt for Rousseau, whom, as his diary testifies,
he dismissed as a proto-Nazi.
</P>
<P>
   Klemperer was a hypochondriac, certain that he was doomed to die
young. This made him greet the death of colleagues, preferably
younger ones, with a certain satisfaction. His frequent ``heart
troubles'' must have been innocuous palpitations: certainly the
doctors he consulted firmly assured him that he was perfectly
healthy. But he enjoyed his psychosomatic symptoms in the company
of his wife, who suffered from crippling depressions and often woke
up with screaming fits. Her impassioned insistence on building a
house outside Dresden, a project she pursued as though her life
literally depended on it, documents an almost demented
obsessiveness. Forcibly retired in 1935, robbed of most of his
pension, her husband thought the venture unaffordable but dared not
stop it. And so, under nerve-racking financial and emotional
difficulties, they built their castle for two. Eva Klemperer's
ailments condemned her husband to do most of the housework --
shopping, cooking, cleaning; if with his meticulousness he was the
image of the German professor lampooned in humor weeklies, as a
househusband Klemperer was certainly untypical. He frequently
complained how much time these domestic chores cost him, but
without resentment. He had just two loves to which he remained
utterly faithful: his wife and their cats.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-WITNESS-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: their cats.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of Klemperer's foibles make for involuntary, savage comedy.
In 1935, already in his 50's, he learned how to drive. The lessons
began as a nightmare. After he received his license, he noted
solemnly, ``This business is really two things for me, a victory
over my own nature, achieved with great difficulty, and a matter of
the utmost importance.'' That was not hyperbole: for a Jew trying
to navigate through the Nazi jungle, the most mundane matters
assumed critical weight. At first he was haunted by the ``worry
that I as a driver must not cause any mischief,'' and for some time
drove no faster than 30 miles an hour. Gradually, as he became more
competent behind the wheel, he started to enjoy himself -- and
wrote it down. The main mischief he caused was to the fenders of
his undependable second-hand car, as he could never manage to avoid
hitting his narrow garden gate. Learning how to type would be only
marginally less upsetting and, after a while, almost as rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   Klemperer's maddening patriotism, an element in his refusal to
emigrate even when opportunities offered themselves, seems to lend
some plausibility to the indictment of German Jews for
overidentifying themselves with a country prepared to kill them and
blindly failing to anticipate their fate. But Klemperer, as the
diary amply documents, was a special case. Members of his family,
and his friends, left Nazi Germany as quickly as they could. Like
other cultivated German Jews, Klemperer despised his country's new
masters as barbarian invaders. In addition, he could not visualize
making a living abroad. Though a professor of French literature, he
did not speak French. His English was abysmal and he made only
halfhearted attempts to improve it. Add a private neurotic impulse:
he would not be dependent on his brother Georg, who had prospered
in the United States. In short, his conflicts paralyzed him. One
does not read his diary to enter the life of a representative
German Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all discomfort fades before the cumulative power of the
record that Klemperer has left for posterity. His observations,
including pitiless self-examinations, are unblinking; his
reflections are remarkable for their precision and their
penetration. Even though one may balk at one or another of his
positions, his personal history of how the Third Reich month by
month, sometimes week by week, accelerated its crusade against the
Jews gives as accurate a picture of Nazi trickery and brutality as
we are likely to have. Nothing is too casual or too portentous to
escape him, including the increasing likelihood of a violent death.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Klemperer's entries report the minutiae of living. He
also has some breathtaking set pieces. In June 1941, after spending
eight days in prison, in isolation, for having failed to black out
a window at night, Klemperer celebrates his release by recalling
his imprisonment in chilling detail. ``I continue to write,'' he
was to note in May 1942. ``This is my heroics. I want to bear
witness, precise witness, to the very end.'' He exploited his flaws
-- his pedantry, obstinacy, self-involvement -- to make a
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Nazi nightmare deprived Klemperer of his
illusions about human nature. ``Man is bad,'' he observes early on
(April 1933). Yet important passages in his diary undermine this
verdict. For -- and this is the true surprise of this diary -- the
number of ``good Germans'' to whom he gives an honorable place is
astonishingly large. Some of his acquaintances, including
colleagues, became enthusiastic, or opportunistic, supporters of
Hitler's Thousand Year Reich. But, at least in Klemperer's
experience, episodes of meanness and cowardice are far outweighed
by moments of decency. The ludicrous Nuremberg Laws of September
1935, which deprived Germany's Jews of their citizenship and
prohibited gentiles under 45 from working as household help for
Jewish families, evoked a touching protest from the Klemperers'
invaluable Frau Lehmann, who was in her late 40's. She told them in
1938 that ``she had been summoned to an official: It was known that
she was a cleaner for a Jewish professor and a Jewish lawyer.'' But
did not the law allow this? The bureaucrat's response was ominous:
``Certainly, but your son will not get his promotion in the Labor
Service, and your daughter . . . will lose her post, if you do not
give up this work.'' In helpless rage, Frau Lehmann quit, but
continued to visit the Klemperers at night under cover of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Klemperer knew and met many such decent Germans,
even after the regime had make the risks of showing sympathy for
Jews painfully obvious. In late November 1938, shortly after the
officially sanctioned national pogrom known as Kristallnacht had
burned synagogues, smashed store windows and taken thousands of
Jews to contentration camps, Klemperer visited the Public
Information Office for Emigrants -- one of his halfhearted attempts
to get away from Nazi Germany -- and spoke to an elderly police
major: ``The old major said to me: Within these four walls you can
speak your mind. In recent days I have heard a great deal that is
very distressing, in my free moments I walk in the Great Garden in
order to calm myself down. -- I set out my situation. I said, a
regime that espouses banditry with such openness, must be in a
desperate plight. -- He: That is what every decent German thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Klemperer's diary records literally dozens of gems like these,
cumulatively refuting (as Chalmers notes in his preface) Daniel
Goldhagen's thesis that Germans, as a people, were infected with
``eliminationist anti-Semitism.'' As the Klemperers are expelled
from their dearly bought house, confined to two miserable rooms in
a ``Jews' house,'' their movements restricted and their rations
reduced to near-starvation level, local butchers, bakers and
fishmongers illegally supply them with food. One of his former
students brings them a Christmas gift: ``two big scallops of veal,
an egg, a tin of ersatz honey, a bar of chocolate, two
gingerbreads, a pair of socks, two tins of milk and half a liter of
opened skimmed milk,'' and a book on Klemperer's cherished
Corneille. Even after the obscenity inaugurated in late 1941,
compelling Jews to wear the yellow star on their clothes, some
Germans continue to demonstrate, quietly, their ``criminal''
decency. In November, Klemperer records an acquaintance telling him
that ``a gentleman had greeted her in a shop doorway. Had he not
mistaken her for someone else? -- 'No, I do not know you, but you
will now be greeted frequently. We are a group 'who greet the Jew's
star.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet we know that, brave as ``good Germans'' might be, the lot of
Germany's Jews, bad as it was, only grew worse. The deportations
were beginning. Volume 2 of the diaries, which takes the Klemperers
from January 1942 to the end of the war, takes up this part of the
tale; as moving, as brilliant, as Volume 1, it is scheduled to
appear in English next year. Together, they make Klemperer into one
of the greatest diarists -- perhaps the greatest -- in the German
language.

 MARILYN MONROE
<TEXT>

   By Barbara Leaming.

 &UR; ENGINEERING AN ICON &QL; 
 &UR; By Molly Haskell &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The old Hollywood folk tale of the pretty girl ``discovered'' at
a drugstore and turned into a star conjures up an image deeply
comforting to traditional notions of sexual behavior: a sleeping
beauty plucked from obscurity by a male power broker and catapulted
to fame. The myth buttresses the ideal of feminine passivity and
male agency at the expense of a more subversive truth: the hustle,
the drive, the shrewdness of those women, who among thousands of
wannabes rose to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, no one has slid more smoothly into the myth of
female dependency than Marilyn Monroe. By tying her fate to a
string of male rescuers and by dying young and alone, she left
behind an open-ended scenario of victimization, whose architect
could be supplied according to the onlooker's politics and
proclivities. (Fill in the blanks with your favorite malefactor:
the patriarchy, the studio system, male concupiscence, the
Kennedys.) Yet as we learn from ``Marilyn Monroe,'' Barbara
Leaming's engrossing new biography, no one worked the drugstore
scene (not to mention the prescription counter) more shrewdly than
Monroe, and no one displayed such a furious desire to live and
succeed in the face of greater, more overwhelming odds. The chief
virtue of this retelling of the oft-told tale is that the author
restores Marilyn's humanity, gives flesh and blood, intelligence
and initiative, to the archetypal dumb blonde.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she wasn't used and abused, manipulated and exploited.
But she was an intuitive strategist: she found willing champions,
ingeniously playing an ally like Spyros Skouras, the president of
20th Century Fox, against his enemy and colleague, Darryl Zanuck,
the studio's production chief. She also made brilliant use of
publicity and her own photogeneity -- she was inspired in her
handling of the nude photo episode -- to boost her career with Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Major revelations aren't the point here, and other biographies
have been more comprehensive, but Leaming, whose most recent book
was a biography of Katharine Hepburn, has a sure dramatic instinct
for illuminating overlooked material and re-examining the most
interesting episodes. I was initially skeptical: could there really
be anything new to say about this endlessly reproduced pop icon?
But following Leaming's lead, I soon found myself devouring other
material, particularly the autobiographies of Elia Kazan and Arthur
Miller, to see where Kazan, Miller and Monroe agree and (more
fascinatingly) when and how they differ. It's this three-way
relationship, with its political and artistic, hetero- and
homoerotic components, that Leaming explores in the book's richest
leitmotif.
</P>
<P>
   We begin in 1951, at a perilous moment in the young starlet's
career -- her contract with Fox is up, Zanuck loathes her and
Johnny Hyde, her agent and staunchest ally (as well as her ardent
pursuer), has just died. She is finishing ``As Young as You Feel,''
with Monty Woolley and Constance Bennett, weeping between takes,
when Elia Kazan, with Arthur Miller in tow, arrives on the set to
ask her out. Kazan has recently directed Miller's ``Death of a
Salesman'' on Broadway, and they are in Hollywood peddling a Miller
script.
</P>
<P>
   At first Monroe refuses Kazan's invitation, then, shrewdly
reconsidering (he is ``hot,'' having just finished shooting ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'' and now casting for ``Viva Zapata!''), she
goes after him and they become an item. By day, Kazan, Monroe and
Miller are high-spirited pals; by night, Kazan and Monroe occupy
one of the guest rooms at the agent Charles Feldman's, while Miller
sleeps fitfully down the hall. The playwright, whose marriage is
wobbly but still on its feet, is so taken with Marilyn that he soon
flees Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe, however, has been smitten with this man, who treats her
respectfully and represents everything that Hollywood is not. After
his departure, she continues to sleep with Kazan, but on the shelf
above her bed, watching their every move, are photographs of her
two idols, Arthur Miller and Abraham Lincoln. Miller -- the vital
absentee in a weird triangle -- is the major subject of Kazan and
Monroe's postcoital conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Thus does Monroe find herself partitioned, virgin and whore,
between two men: one, Kazan, an admitted philanderer, who
(according to his own autobiography) sees her as fun, a mistress,
not the type anyone would want to marry, and the other, Miller, the
repressed but honorable puritan, who takes her as seriously as he
takes himself, thus providing her with a reflection more to her
liking. It's a split that finally tore her apart, while both of the
men survived to work and flourish, and to tell their sides of the
story -- not only of the Hollywood days but of their early
association with the Group Theater and Communism, the split between
them over Kazan's friendly testimony before the House Un-American
Activities Committee and their reunion for the Monroe-inspired
play, ``After the Fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Monroe needed Miller to accept the Marilyn who
wasn't just a ``happy girl,'' but the demands of that darker, more
complex personality were more than he could handle. (Joe DiMaggio,
her husband before Miller, found himself enmeshed in a similar
paradox when, after marrying the blond sensation, he wanted her to
give up her career and live like a normal woman.) The line between
sexiness and parody was gossamer thin, and impossible to maintain.
Her most successful films -- ``Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,'' ``How to
Marry a Millionaire,'' ``The Seven Year Itch,'' ``Some Like It
Hot'' -- capture the innocence of her pose and its satirical savvy.
But it was all as fragile as a bubble, and for her, as the pills
and insecurity mounted, there was no second act.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-MONROE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: second act.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of her career, Monroe, with the help of Ben
Hecht, had advanced the idea that she was an orphan. It was a
cunning bid for the sympathy of women, who might be put off by her
sexual display (and who indeed would later turn against her).
Though the story was exposed as a hoax, the truth was worse: she
had been abandoned by her mother, Gladys, left with foster families
(who also abandoned her) and never knew who her father was. It was
one of her foster parents, ``Aunt Grace,'' who convinced her that
she could be another Harlow, and who encouraged her to use her sex
appeal, but who then turned on her when those charms attracted
Grace's own husband. Thus was enacted in microcosm the social
double bind into which all women are born but whose contradictions
the love goddess acts out on a high wire over the abyss: be
beautiful but not too beautiful; use your sex appeal, but forfeit
the right to be taken seriously; be childlike, but expect a
seriously reduced shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   Leaming underlines the importance of a moment when, while making
``How to Marry a Millionaire'' with Lauren Bacall and Betty Grable,
Monroe sees the handwriting on the wall: Grable, the leggy blond
oomph girl, is about to become a has-been at 36 and is gallantly
handing the torch to the new bombshell on the block. It was
Monroe's desire not to get caught in the same trap that fed her
often misguided ambition to play serious roles, to downgrade her
own enchanting comic temptress.
</P>
<P>
   She needed a grotesque parody of a woman's support group --
female monsters like her coach, Natasha Lytess, and the acting guru
Paula Strasberg -- to be present on the set running interference
for her. Reading the description of Strasberg, clad in black,
standing behind the director and waving hand signals like a catcher
at home plate, one can't help thinking of the tortured relationship
between Monroe and her mother -- who would suddenly surface from
time to time to express outrage over some flouting of propriety
perpetrated by her daughter. In response, Monroe would up the ante,
dressing even more seductively, provoking public outrage and
sabotaging her own success.
</P>
<P>
   If she has now become more famous as a photographic icon, in
black and white, than as a movie performer, there's a good reason.
She was as exhilaratingly at ease before the still camera as she
was paralyzingly insecure before the motion picture camera. Without
minimizing Monroe's hugely irritating and destructive behavior
toward the end, Leaming suggests heartbreaking moments when things
might have taken a different turn: if one of her numerous
pregnancies had come to term; if she and Laurence Olivier hadn't
got off to a bad start while filming ``The Prince and the
Showgirl''; if just one of the moguls in Hollywood had understood
that she was a woman who wanted, more than fame and money, credit
for her part in the creation of ``Marilyn Monroe.'' At least that
battle has been won in this gripping and corrective book.

 BILLY DEAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Lisa Reardon.
</P>
<P>
   260 pp. New York:
</P>
<P>
   Viking. $22.95.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; UNPLEASANTVILLE &QL; 
 &UR; BY LAURA JAMISON &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Reardon's first novel, ``Billy Dead,'' instantly brings to
mind Dorothy Allison's ``Bastard Out of Carolina.'' Both depict
poor, rural white families in which innocent lives are ravaged by
brutality and incest. But ``Billy Dead,'' if you can believe it, is
even more harrowing, and while Reardon possesses enough skill to
render any awful act believable, she does so at the expense of the
book's frail beauty. When you finish reading it, you're left with a
crowd of horrific images that overwhelm what the story is finally
about: the redemptive power of love, no matter how unconventional.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Allison's child narrator, the speaker in ``Billy Dead,''
Ray, is an adult who has the language and sexual knowledge to
describe the family's heinous history in graphic detail. Of the
three Johnson children, who grew up in Michigan, Ray was clearly
the least equipped to shoulder abuse; as a man, he is helpless and
dazed, given to hallucinations and physical self-torture. He lives
in a perpetual cringe, shrinking from memories that constantly
threaten to unravel him. But when he learns that his beastly older
brother, Billy, has been sadistically murdered, Ray can't help
flashing back to his freakish family life, a three-ring circus of
savagery in which the siblings all take turns in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Billy have a little sister, Jean, who not only suffers
her father's beatings as they do but also endures sexual abuse at
the hands of all her menfolk. But she is a mean, tough kid --
qualities that meek, sensitive Ray admires. When Jean is only 7,
Billy and Ray force her to perform fellatio on them, an act that
belies Ray's affection for Jean and underscores his fear of Billy.
A few years later, she pounces on her opportunity for revenge: as
Ray, now 14, lies weak in bed with chickenpox, she burns his sores
with a cigarette while bringing him to orgasm with her other hand.
``Do you love me?'' she asks, grinding the hot cigarette into his
wounds. ``Are you sorry?'' He appears relieved to submit to Jean's
punishment; he is also in awe of her spitefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and Jean remain allies in their house of horrors. After his
senior year, Ray spends the summer working in another town; Jean,
now 16, joins him. Away from their tormentors, they become lovers,
and, impossibly, you find yourself actually rooting for them. It's
a credit to Reardon's writing that their romance seems right and
tender. But everything goes wrong when they return home to find
that the whole town knows about them. In a flash of possessiveness,
Ray turns on Jean, and the two remain estranged until Billy's death
years later -- an event that prompts Ray to seek her out again.
Whoever got Billy ``must have been even meaner than him. Only one
person I know like that,'' Ray says as he begins a delirious search
for the love of his life, his baby sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Dead'' is quite well written, but its literary merits
are diminished by the relentlessness and intensity of its
atrocities. Billy throws a cat against a wall for fun, breaking its
neck, and his father then chops the dying pet's head off with a
shovel; after Billy molests her, Jean hangs his dog from a tree and
beats it to death with a baseball bat; during one particularly
violent episode of rape, Jean nearly bites her father's penis off.
Still, all this excess isn't just sensationalism, and most of these
scenes seem warranted by the larger story. Indeed, this is an
extremely powerful novel, but whether you want to read it depends
on your stomach for human -- or, better said, subhuman -- ugliness.

 THE END OF A FAMILY STORY
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Peter Nadas. Translated by Imre Goldstein.

 &UR; RATIONED INDENTS &QL; 
 &UR; By KEN KALFUS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   THIS is some tough book. It consists of 10 chapters, each of
which is a single very long paragraph. Within the paragraphs, there
is no unity of theme, mood or narrative. Stories or anecdotes are
begun but left uncompleted, to be replaced by other fragments. The
narrative, such as it is, shifts from the first person to the third
and then back again. (That's 3-5-3, if you're scoring at home.)
Speech is indicated by quotation marks that open in one chapter and
close pages and pages later in another. Parts of conversations are
paraphrased, often without reference to who's speaking. The novel's
tediousness is as profound as the themes it seeks to engage.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Nadas's first novel to be published in the United States
was ``A Book of Memories,'' which received much admiring attention
last year. It too is a challenging work, in part about a bisexual
Hungarian writer living in East Germany. But ``A Book of Memories''
is more accessible than ``The End of a Family Story,'' the first
novel Nadas wrote, which was originally published in Hungarian in
1977 -- at a time when the authorities in Budapest seem to have
been severely rationing paragraph breaks.
</P>
<P>
   As best I can make out, the central figure in ``The End of a
Family Story'' is a young Hungarian boy, Peter Simon, who is being
brought up by his grandparents sometime in the 1950's, during the
advent of the Communist era. His father, who is in the army, is
convicted eventually as a traitor. Peter's mother is absent, and
her memory uninvoked. In the course of the novel, his grandfather
tells the boy the mythic histories that, he says, he was told by
his grandfather. Most of the stories are about their family,
converted Jews who trace their ancestry back to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The comings and goings of the other people in Peter's life are
mixed up within his grandfather's stories. These characters include
a friend's mother, whom Peter once unforgettably saw naked; his
grandfather's friend, called Uncle Frigyes; and Peter's friends
Csider, Gabor and Eva. Creating their own mythic histories, the
children play at mama, papa and child
</P>
<P>
   in the neighborhood's secret spaces. Call me an American
philistine, but whenever the names Gabor and Eva collide in one of
Nadas's sentences, I hear the theme song from ``Green Acres.''
</P>
<P>
   The central motif of the Simon family myth concerns two brothers
who become separated or estranged and then find their way back to
each other. As Peter's grandfather tells these stories, we sense
his struggle to reconcile a mysterious division in his own life.
Perhaps it has to do with his rebellion against the passage of time
and his fear that the family history is at an end. When Frigyes
tells his friend about a community of Portuguese Jews that, after
converting to Christianity 500 years ago, has reconverted back to
Judaism, Peter's grandfather explodes: ``And in another 500 years,
what will happen 500 years from now, do you know? Five hundred
years! There is no such thing as time! that's the mistake, there is
no time! only me, me! Only I exist, the one actually present! Me!''
It's an interesting rant, but Nadas doesn't take the idea much
farther than that.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty -- no, impenetrability -- of this novel probably
cannot be laid to the translator, Imre Goldstein, who collaborated
on the more lucid translation of ``A Book of Memories.'' Here
Nadas's method of telling -- or not telling -- a story does not
seem to be dependent on the translator's choice of words.
Regardless of whose words they are, the structure that encloses
them fails to intensify their emotional charge -- as is
accomplished, say, by the American master of the long paragraph,
Stephen Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   By international convention, reviews of serious novels from
central Europe are required to employ the words ``tragedy,''
``truth,'' ``obsession,'' ``memory,'' ``identity'' and, of course,
``history.'' Having thus discharged my duty, I feel safe in hurling
this book across the room. Good luck to him who picks it up!

 ESCAPISM

 &UR; THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCIS I. KANE &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yi-Fu Tuan, you've just capped a long and eminent career with
the publication of your latest work, 'Escapism.' Where are you
headed to now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``To Disneyland, of course!''
</P>
<P>
   Yi-Fu Tuan is no Joe Montana with three most valuable player
awards in the Super Bowl and as many trips to Disneyland, but the
facetious scenario is not so far off the mark; for it was an
invitation to Disney's fantasy world that prompted Tuan, a
distinguished cultural geographer at the University of Wisconsin,
to write his latest work. Much to his surprise, he was charmed by
the place for the same reason that his academic colleagues loathed
it: it was unadulterated escape. That flight from the bleak
Wisconsin winter to sunny California led him to reflect on the
underestimated role that escapes play in our public and personal
lives.
</P>
<P>
   In his eyes, escape is everywhere -- whether we move from the
jangling chords of civilization back to a serenely pastoral nature,
or from that same nature now experienced as hostile and forbidding
to the covers of our warm beds in our well-constructed homes. In
fact, so pervasive is flight that Tuan proffers a rather startling
definition of culture: ``the totality of means by which I escape
from my animal state of being.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are we continually in flight? Well, we flee our bodies
because of their embarrassing demands -- for food, elimination,
sex. And we flee from our very selves into the social crowd,
because, as the author notes, uniqueness, however cherished, can at
times be quite intolerable. Once we have fled, however, we grow
disenchanted and escape in the other direction -- away from wispy
thought back to the ponderous body; away from the suffocating crowd
back to solitude. So inescapable are these flights that Tuan offers
one more definition of the human species: ``an animal who is
congenitally indisposed to accept reality as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Innovative as such claims seem to be, the reader might be
reminded of that groundbreaking book of a half-century ago, ``Homo
Ludens,'' in which Johan Huizinga argued similarly that play was
the central element in human culture. Both books persuade us to
adopt different angles of vision on culture and let us see such
familiar, mundane realities as play and escape in a more promising
light. For Yi-Fu Tuan, it is a case of getting us to see escapes
not as insubstantial diversions but rather as the very condition of
all that is good, and bad, in human culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Escapism,'' though, is not so much an argument as a tour --
sometimes a tour de force -- of cultural escapes with exotic stops
and unexpected twists and turns. And such a convivial tour guide!
Tuan is chatty, engaging, unpretentious and charming. The
atmosphere he creates is that of your friendly pub, where you are
regaled with captivating stories by a wise old man whose eyes still
betray a childlike wonder. This is decidedly not your old grade
school geography lesson. You indulge his sometimes professorial
locutions and even the occasional but maddening lack of conceptual
clarity (if everything is escape, then what distinctive meaning can
the word have?) because here is a geographer unafraid to bump up
against the ultimate human questions.
</P>
<P>
   His thesis, however, is clear. Escapes, those imaginative
reconstructions of reality, are indispensable. While flights from
our animal selves can be silly, preposterous, even cruel and
dangerous, they can also create new and more expressive ways for
humans to flourish. While romantic love, for example, may have
originated in a flight from our more bestial selves, it has become
over time just as real and decidedly more human than mere animal
couplings.
</P>
<P>
   For Tuan, it is the power of imagination that serves as the
mechanism of escape, and he pursues it down its labyrinthine ways,
noting both its destructive and creative impulses. Because of its
enormous power, imagination must be checked by the moral weight of
the good, and that, finally, is where his study culminates, on
moral grounds that are provided for by his Western (Greek) and
Eastern (Confucian) heritages. He is most at home in the proverbial
``middle way''; in fact, his favorite metaphor for an ethical
escape is ``landscape,'' both as nature and artifice. More
particularly, ``middle landscapes'' -- Chinese gardens and
cultivated fields -- serve as the geographical analogue for our
moral center; for Tuan they open up a world that is both at home
and in tension with nature. In these middle landscapes, we are
neither angels nor beasts, neither Icarus nor Caliban, but mortals
anchored in the earth yet borne aloft on the wings of imagination.
</P>
<P>
   I only wish that Tuan had argued more strenuously for these last
moral considerations, so sound and yet in such disrepute today.
Perhaps he does not because his method is not to argue the point
but to point long and hard enough until you see it. In the last
line of the book, he tells us that it doesn't take talent or status
to go off on flights that are truly good, just a ``willingness to
look in the right direction.'' But how do you know when you are
looking in the right direction? Indeed, what is the right
direction?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I confess that even after all that looking, I was
not persuaded that all culture is escape. The very same moral
considerations the author points to would, I think, require that we
discriminate between mere escape and authentic liberation. Two
older books responded to these questions rather more directly: a
scholarly work, ``Leisure: The Basis of Culture,'' by the
philosopher Josef Pieper, and a more popular book, ``The Decline of
Pleasure,'' by Walter Kerr, theater critic for The New York Herald
Tribune and later for The Times. Both authors admirably distinguish
between escapes that afford authentic leisure and genuine pleasure
-- reading a good book, for example -- and those mere diversions
that simply distract us from our workaday world, like building a
garage on our day off. Both of these books generously employ
another defining human characteristic, not developed nearly enough
in Tuan's otherwise praiseworthy book: the capacity to judge. If we
are going to look in the right direction, we will have to do more
than look. We will have to assess, evaluate and discriminate. There
is no escaping that.

 MIND OVER WATER: LESSONS FROM THE ART OF ROWING.

<P>
   Fourteen years ago, I spent an autumn on the Charles River in
Cambridge, Mass., learning to scull. This is no small feat:
maneuvering a single shell is like trying to stay upright on a
giant knitting needle -- a typical boat is 26 feet long and less
than a foot wide; balance is either assisted or impeded by the
oars, which measure about nine feet each. As sports go, it's like
aquatic tightrope walking, requiring both enormous precision and
guts, and I was terrible at it for years -- flailing, teetering,
nearly flipping the boat on every outing. But from the start, I was
also determined to master the craft. The esthetic beauty of rowing
-- the symmetry, the steady whoosh of water against hull, the
marriage of power and grace -- had captured me utterly, and I
wandered around that first season like a teen-ager giddy with love,
aware that I'd stumbled on something that would transform me,
change the way I looked at life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mind Over Water: Lessons on Life From the Art of Rowing'' is
Craig Lambert's thoughtful, lovingly drawn meditation on precisely
that brand of transformation: rowing on the Charles River, his
passion for the last decade, has become a path to self-definition,
a way to balance his brainy, straight-A boyhood with some
longed-for brawn, a vehicle for growth. ``We are out here . . . to
reveal ourselves,'' he writes, ``to discover who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowing attracts a certain personality type -- precise, intense,
a tad obsessive -- and Lambert writes like an oarsman. This is no
simple ode to the beauty of river and shell; nor, like David
Halberstam's book about elite competitors, ``The Amateurs,'' is it
a chronicle of the sport's physical rigors. Lambert covers both
those bases -- there are elegant descriptions of boats
(``fantastically long and narrow, a pterodactyl afloat''), and
there are nods to the rower's daily expenditure of blood and sweat
-- but his reach is broader. ``Lessons learned afloat,'' he writes,
``carry over onto dry land,'' and his book elucidates that point,
each aspect of the sport presenting fodder for reflection. An
account of learning to balance an eight-oared shell becomes a
meditation on intimacy (``As in other intimate relations, while
responding to each other, we need to maintain our own center of
gravity''); a reminiscence about coxing an eight becomes a
rumination on personal agency (``At every moment we have a choice:
to drift or to steer''); descriptions of racing and training become
explorations of everything from self-definition to the nature of
competition and success.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert, a staff writer and editor for Harvard Magazine who has
written for Sports Illustrated and other publications, is a
thinking man's jock -- along with profiles of world-class rowers
and coaches, you'll find quotations from Wittgenstein and
Kierkegaard, Einstein and Michelangelo -- and nonintrospective
athletes might find some of his parallels (balance in the boat as a
metaphor for balance in the ecosystem; an efficient crew as
analogous to the human immune system) either overly cerebral or
beside the point. But even the heaviest moments are offset by
light: there's the vicarious thrill that accompanies good
sportswriting (here and there, you can feel the speed of a single
gliding across water, the rapture of balancing atop a shell); there
are dashes of bemused self-depreciation (an early experience in an
eight is like ``thrashing around in a washtub full of bozos'');
above all, there's Lambert's unequivocal joy in rowing, its
provocative, sensual power. In his hands, the river becomes a
character in its own right, something to dip into for a time,
something transporting. ``Rowing,'' he writes, ``is such a
beautifully small, obscure sport.'' Perhaps, but viewed through his
lens, it becomes larger and more universal.

 &UR; By VICTOR NAVASKY &QL;

</P>
<P>
   This book reads as if Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, the black actors
and activists, talked it, in alternating chapters, paragraphs and
sometimes sentences. A conversation studded with anecdotes about
themselves, their families and people they knew, and also some
inspiration, wisdom and gossip. Take the turn-of-the century
exchange related by Davis's father, Kince, who has just been
released from the chain gang and goes to the little town of Argyle,
Ga., where he runs into an old friend:
</P>
<P>
   '' 'Good God Amighty, Kince, ain't seen you in a coon's age. How
you been doing, fellow? What you got to say for yourself?'
</P>
<P>
   '' 'White man still on top,' Daddy replied and laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``White man still on top'' -- the sad humor, wisdom, history,
sense of resignation-but-not-quite and total absence of bitterness
in that line encapsulates the spirit that pervades this quirky dual
memoir.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here are four interwoven stories. First, there are
Davis's experience of growing up in rural Georgia and Dee's in
Harlem; second, their love story -- starting with how they found
each other on Christmas Eve, 1946, dancing to Nat (King) Cole's new
release of Mel Torme's ``Christmas Song,'' while touring with the
comedy ``Anna Lucasta'' (Ruby played Anna, the prostitute lead).
Then there is the social history of the black experience in the
American theater and, to a lesser extent, Hollywood and television
in the last quarter of the 20th century. And finally there is the
story of what they call ``the Struggle,'' which has defined,
motivated, shaped their lives, their family, their art. All four
stories, as might be expected, have much to teach us about what
Gunnar Myrdal called ``An American Dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was only 6 or 7 years old when two white policemen picked
him up, took him down to the station house and poured a jar of cane
syrup over his head. They laughed ``as if it was the funniest thing
in the world,'' and Davis laughed too, but he never told his mother
or father about it. More than 40 years later, when his 16-year-old
son noisily summoned a white waitress in a Deep South restaurant to
take back his grits because they weren't hot enough, nothing made
him prouder. Only now is he able to philosophize about ``the
process of niggerization'' and what it does to all concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Right from the start, Dee, whose father was a waiter on the
Pennsylvania Railroad and who was 11 years old before she found out
that her mother was not her birth mother, wondered why the stores
on 125th Street did not hire any black people. She entered the
theater by way of the basement of the public library on 135th
Street -- now well known as the Schomberg Center for Research in
Black Culture, but then the birthplace of the American Negro
Theater. In 1950, when she and Davis arrived in Hollywood to film
``No Way Out'' and saw no black technicians, grips, electricians,
props or make-up people, she asked for (and got) a black
hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   Dee's identification with the underdog was not limited to race.
Davis tells of the time Dee had a part in Lorraine Hansberry's
``Raisin in the Sun.'' There is a scene in which the mother, played
by Claudia McNeil, who was built like a female Mike Tyson, slaps
her rebellious daughter, Beneatha, in the face. One matinee, after
McNeill had nearly knocked a hapless understudy into the second
row, the diminutive Dee said, sotto voce, ``You hit that girl one
more time like that, and I'll knock you flat.'' McNeill brought Dee
up on charges before Actors Equity for ``unprofessional behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dee and Davis were invited to speak at a rally on behalf of
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and were warned that it might cost them
their jobs, it was Dee who said, ``Hmmm, what jobs?'' They spoke.
If there was a ``committee to defend'' (be it the Rosenbergs, the
Black Panthers or Angela Davis), they were on the letterhead; if
there was a rally to oppose (the Vietnam War, nuclear testing,
apartheid in South Africa), they were on the podium; if there was a
Congressional subpoena (from a Congressional investigating
committee) to avoid, they were out the back door.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-OSSIE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: back door.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was all part of the Struggle. But for them the Struggle had
less to do with boring speeches and petitions than private (and
sometimes inspired) behind-the-scenes insurrections. As a drama
student at Columbia University, where he went after graduating from
Howard University, Davis objected to Marc Connelly's play ``Green
Pastures,'' whose version of heaven was simple, childlike black
people happily singing at a ``vast fish-fry celebration, presided
over by De Lawd.'' Yet in 1951, when a revival of ``Green
Pastures'' meant a job on Broadway, he took it. The part of De Lawd
was played by his friend William Marshall, whose booming voice was
matched only by his private political militancy, but since he
shared Davis's objections to the role he was playing, he had some
difficulty orating with conviction. So every night, just before De
Lawd castigates the world for its sins, Davis, who played Gabriel,
his right-hand angel, would whisper in his ear the name of the
latest brother who had dared to attack Paul Robeson (a roster that
included names like Jackie Robinson, Josh White and Canada Lee),
and, ``Bill would rise to such ear-shattering heights that nobody
sitting in the audience -- which was usually white -- could help
but feel the lash of his vocal venom.''
</P>
<P>
   As they approach the end of their unique journey, Davis, having
been married to Dee for 50 years, makes the mistake of dispensing
some advice: ``I say to my fellow husbands -- whose eyeballs may be
covered with lust -- the way to know all women is to know one woman
well.'' Which is O.K. but probably no more helpful as a guide to
the perplexed than were Dee's early ruminations on the matter of
black men like Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte and Walter White, a
former head of the N.A.A.C.P., all of whom left their wives and
married white women: ``How dare you white women raid the black
woman's nest, flaunt your perfumed, ivory skin, fling your flaxen
and raven hair in the eyes and noses and mouths of our beautiful
ebony men, assaulting all their senses?'' (Later she came to admire
several white women who ``literally and figuratively rescued from
the gutter men rejected everywhere.'')
</P>
<P>
   Memo to the F.B.I.: Despite their politically adventurous
activities, Dee and Davis never did join the Communist Party. As he
puts it, ``I was 'red' only when I thought it was a smarter way of
being black.'' The F.B.I. did, however, set one thing right. When
Dee and Davis retrieved their files under the Freedom of
Information Act, they discovered that the bureau had designated
Ossie a ``fellow traveler.'' His crime was that he ``was known to
associate with Ruby Dee.''

   One Summer With Lillian Hellman.
</P>
<P>
   By Rosemary Mahoney.

   275 pp. New York: Doubleday. $23.95.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; OPPRESSED BY AN IDOL &QL; 
 &UR; By SHARON O'BRIEN &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Blame is boring,'' I tell the students in my memoir-writing
classes when parents or siblings appear as one-sidedly nasty, child
narrators as long-sufferingly virtuous. And yes, shaping anger and
resentment into a text that, as Toni Morrison puts it, the reader
can enter, is hard -- and painful -- work. But we simply don't
trust narrators who project unresolved anger onto their characters.
Our instinctive response is to pull away.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what happened when I read Rosemary Mahoney's account of
the summer she spent working as a maid and cook for Lillian
Hellman, the employer from hell. The 17-year-old Mahoney, a
prep-school scholarship girl, had written Hellman, her literary
idol, asking for work; amazingly, Hellman responded with an offer
of a summer job at her home on Martha's Vineyard. Mahoney had read
``An Unfinished Woman,'' ``Pentimento'' and ``Scoundrel Time'' and
fallen in love. ``Imagining the Lillian Hellman I had read about,''
contrasting Hellman's bravery to her own timidity (``I never
trusted my own puny voice''), the narrator travels to the Vineyard
and meets not the young, fiery Hellman of the writing but the
aging, temperamental Hellman of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Unlikely Story'' records her disillusionment. Not only is
Hellman a demanding, irksome employer, expecting Mahoney to be at
her beck and call, brooking no back talk, criticizing her driving;
she also turns out to be a flawed human being. The Hellman of
``Scoundrel Time'' stood up to the House Un-American Activities
Committee and refused to cut her conscience to the fashion of
McCarthy's 1950's; this Hellman cheats at Scrabble, pours cheap
wine into expensive bottles and requires her maid to lie when she
doesn't want to talk on the phone. The Hellman of ``An Unfinished
Woman'' stuck up for her friends; this Hellman satirizes them
behind their backs. The Hellman of ``Pentimento'' stood up for the
oppressed and the downtrodden; this Hellman ``was always saying
Chink and Jap and nigger, which in 'Pentimento' she denied she
would ever say.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney wants a spiritual mentor: Hellman needs a servant.
Mahoney wants to talk about books and writing and ideas; Hellman
wants the kitchen floor washed, the dishes dried, the bathmat put
away, The New York Times picked up at the drugstore. Mahoney wants
intimacy; Hellman wants privacy, even as her physical limitations
make her dependent on live-in help. More than anything, the
narrator wants to be seen, but this is something the half-blind
Hellman, then in her 70's, is emotionally as well as physically
unable to do. ``Each day I woke thinking maybe this will be the day
that she talks to me, or asks me who I am, or tells me something
about myself,'' she tells us, and each day Hellman greets her with
a list of her duties and, from time to time, of her failings as a
housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Hellman's greatest sin is her failure to recognize the
narrator's specialness. It is natural for the 17-year-old to have
wanted this. What makes ``A Likely Story'' problematic is the adult
writer's continuing resentment. That Hellman could be a
self-absorbed prima donna and a tantrum-throwing hostess is no
surprise. What I found troubling is the malice underlying Mahoney's
portrait. The writing is saturated with comparisons to animals:
Hellman's hand is a ``paw''; her face is ``fishlike''; she has the
``big beaky face of a sea turtle.'' We are asked to regard the
decay of her flesh: her ``pruny arms and legs,'' her breasts like
``bladdery bags'' beyond repair by the usual feminine devices, for
Hellman's bras are like ``quahog shells.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Mahoney played the roles of voyeur and eavesdropper
as well as maidservant -- hovering behind doors when Hellman had
visitors, snooping in wastebaskets and leafing through discarded
manuscripts. Seeing the names of Woody Allen, Richard Avedon and
Warren Beatty in Hellman's address book was like ``peeping through
a golden keyhole.'' Although she felt silenced by Hellman's
autocratic manner -- ``she always had the final word'' -- the young
Mahoney had many opportunities to ``watch Hellman talking'' and
observe her unawares (``she was as fascinating to watch as a small
nocturnal animal'').
</P>
<P>
   The climax of the summer, and the memoir, is reached when the
narrator goes upstairs at the end of a dinner party to find
Hellman, naked and drunk, asleep on her bed with the door open.
None of the weekend guests have come up yet, and for a few
delicious moments, Mahoney ponders revenge: should she leave the
door open so that Mike Nichols and Hellman's close friend Peter
Feibleman can see their hostess in all her pathetic vulnerability?
Finally she closes the door, but this mark of decency is undercut
by our glimpses of the old woman's body, ``so skinny and old it was
like a scientific event looking at it this way, like finding . . .
the mummified remains of a 3,000-year-old man preserved in a bog.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for the memoir boom, but the most
important impetus has been the political and social movements of
the last 30 years that have given voice to marginalized or silenced
individuals and groups. On the face of it, ``A Likely Story,'' by a
once silenced young woman who is now herself a well-reviewed
writer, would seem to belong in the same category with Susanna
Kaysen's ``Girl, Interrupted'' or Toi Derricotte's ``Black
Notebooks.'' But it does not, because it never transcends the
personal sources of its writing. Too much of the writer still seems
to be 17, still trapped in that claustrophobic summer, demanding
that the reader witness the injustices and humiliations she
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The memoir's title calls attention to a larger issue, the
distinction between ``fact'' and ``truth'' in a genre that draws on
memory, a subjective and incomplete source, as well as imagination.
Recording the emotional truth of the past often means memoir
writers must use fiction writers' tools: inventing dialogue,
shifting chronology, constructing scenes. But memoirists have a
different contract with their readers than fiction writers do: we
trust them to be faithful to the historical realities of the past.
Mahoney herself raises the issue of the reliability of memoir:
hunting through a wastebasket she finds some discarded manuscript
pages, one of them titled ``Lillian Hellman, Notes to Follow
'Scoundrel Time,' '' Here Hellman is defending herself against
charges that she misrepresented herself in her HUAC testimony. ``As
far as I was concerned,'' Mahoney writes, ``despite all the books
and plays and committees for public justice, she was no more honest
than the rest of us. . . . What people stood for wasn't necessarily
who they were.'' Fair enough. And many readers will know that
Hellman has been accused of fabrication -- most famously by Mary
McCarthy, who called her a liar on ``The Dick Cavett Show,'' as
well as by critics who charged that her famous memoir piece
``Julia'' was wholly invented.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-HELLMAN-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: wholly invented.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Mahoney wants us to distrust Hellman as a writer and person,
all the while using literary techniques that suggest her own
methods and memory are objective. Her book is written in the mode
of realism, very particular as to weather, time, setting, action,
dress, dialogue and detail, positing an omniscient rather than a
limited narrator. (``A sheet of white sunlight fell across the
round wooden table between the two armchairs, and The Vineyard
Gazette lay rumpled and skewed on the footstool in front of
Hellman.'')
</P>
<P>
   An author of memoir must decide two crucial points, Annie
Dillard says: ``what to put in and what to leave out.'' What
Mahoney puts in is the 17-year-old girl's experience and
perspective; what she leaves out is the larger context of Hellman's
work and life. Hellman is dreading the approach of total blindness.
``You can't know what it's like not to be able to see properly,''
she confides to the narrator. Hellman also tells friends she is
``going through a depression,'' and we learn that she is afraid of
being alone in the house. A sympathetic look at this Hellman comes,
briefly, from the narrator's mother, herself physically limited by
polio. Her advice to her daughter provides a needed moment of
compassion and wisdom: ``Let Lillian play great lady,'' she
advises, ``she doesn't have much time left to preserve that
image.''
</P>
<P>
   The most complex portrait in the memoir, in fact, is that of
Mahoney's widowed mother, whose struggle to raise seven children is
partly glimpsed here. At times I wondered if the story of her own
mother, painful and loving, triumphant and sad, is the one Mahoney
needed to write but was not yet ready to attempt. Perhaps now that
her animus toward Hellman is cleared away, she can turn her sharp
descriptive eye and writerly gifts to a potentially more personal
and more universal family story.

<P>
   You've seen the ads. ``The Bose Wave Radio is no ordinary
radio.'' It's ``a sonic marvel,'' a ``genuine breakthrough.'' Such
a little thing _ barely the size of a shoe box _ yet it puts out
the ``full, rich sound'' of a ``primary music system.'' It costs
$349, startlingly high for a clock radio but not unreasonable if
the claims are not overstated. Are the claims overstated? Come on.
How could they not be?
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Bose is bad. In fact, it may be the second-best
tabletop radio out there. But just this month, what may be the best
tabletop radio hit the market. It's the Cambridge SoundWorks Model
88 and, at $199, it's very nearly everything the Bose Wave claims
to be _ at a little over half the price. The Cambridge delivers a
smoother, more coherent, more rhythmic, more dynamic, more tonally
true picture of the music.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on a Vladimir Horowitz piano solo, the keys sounded
clangy, a bit metallic, on the Bose; they were warmer, but no less
hammered, on the Cambridge. When the quartet Anonymous 4 sang a
medieval chant, I wasn't sure on the Bose if there were four
singers (were there three? five?) _ there was no doubt at all on
the Cambridge. When the Heath Brothers played a hard-bop jazz tune,
the hi-hat cymbal sounded smeared on the Bose. I couldn't hear the
accent on the beat. On the Cambridge, I got the percussive thwack
as well as the shimmering whoosh all around it. And though the Bose
hit the low octaves of the acoustic bass, the Cambridge caught the
finger-pluckings of the bass strings.
</P>
<P>
   The differences weren't night and day. But they were of the sort
that, over time, make you feel at ease or slightly tense _ and
which, in a moment of leisure, make you want to stop and really
listen or move on to something else.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, I hooked up each unit to a compact disc player.
(Both radios sport input jacks in the back for plugging in a CD
player, computer, tape deck, television, or VCR.) I used not some
humdrum portable but the Discovery/Pentagon CD-70, a
top-of-the-line machine that retails for $5,000. And I pulled out
two of my most sonically demanding discs _ Henryk Gorecki's Third
Symphony, by the London Symphony Orchestra, on Nonesuch; and Kendra
Shank's Afterglow, a chanteuse-plus-jazz-trio session, on
Mapleshade.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the Gorecki know that, on some full-size (if
not very good) stereo systems, the first minute or so _ bass
violins growling quietly _ comes off as a vague rumble, its melody
barely audible. Both the Bose and the Cambridge navigate this
passage clearly. However, the Cambridge gets more of the bowing on
the basses, more of their rhythmic inflections. When a second,
louder bass line starts in about a minute into the piece, the Bose
cracks up for a second. The Cambridge doesn't exactly keep
everything straight (teeny speakers and teenier amplifiers can do
only so much), but it keeps going _ it doesn't lose the thread.
</P>
<P>
   On the Shank disc, when she modulates her voice, accenting a
certain word or dipping another to a whisper, the Bose makes it
sound as if the engineer is sharply turning up or down the volume.
The Cambridge gets the subtleties right. How do these radios eke
such relatively big sounds out of such small boxes? The Bose isn't
exactly a technical ``breakthrough,'' but it is clever. In the back
of the speakers is a 7 foot tube that has been folded into a thin,
tight maze to fit inside the radio box. The frequency of a sound
wave is defined by its length: The longer the wave, the deeper the
bass. Such a long tube gives sound waves lots of room to enlarge.
Each speaker is also powered by an amplifier equipped with circuits
that boost the bass as you turn up the volume. However, once the
speakers get to the middle and upper octaves, their limitations
become more apparent; hence, the steely pianos, smeared cymbals,
ungainly dynamics, and the rest. The Cambridge SoundWorks 88, half
an inch taller but otherwise the same size as the Bose, takes a
different approach. Its bass comes from a 4 1/2 inch woofer cone,
which takes up two-thirds of the radio's internal space and is
powered by its own amplifier. The two smaller main speakers, each
of which has its own amp, are freed up to focus their energies on
the less burdensome middle and treble octaves. (The 88 also has a
separate volume knob for the woofer, so you can adjust the bass
level, which would otherwise depend greatly on room placement.)
</P>
<P>
   The 88 is designed by Henry Kloss, a hi-fi legend who made his
mark (with the KLH speakers of the 1950's and the Advents of the
'60s) by figuring out how to manipulate electronics so that a
speaker sounds smooth from octave to octave. He applied 47 years of
experience with this art to the rather skimpy components of the
Model 88, which explains how he gets such a smooth, coherent sound
from not only a small box but also a cheap one.
</P>
<P>
   Bose is the property of Amar Bose, a man long regarded as
hi-fi's most brilliant marketer but whose products tend to be built
around a technical fad. His Bose 901 loudspeakers, the company's
premium line for 30 years, have nine speaker cones, positioned all
over the cabinet, so that the sound bounces around your room ``just
like in a concert hall.'' One problem, among many, is that most
people's living rooms aren't Carnegie Hall; as a result, the music
just sounds muddy. His methods also encourage high prices: The 901s
cost $1,400 a pair (some companies make $300 speakers that sound
better) because nine cones cost more than two or three; the Wave
radio costs $350 because that 7 foot tube was a bear to design. The
Wave is one of Bose's better devices. But he stretched too far, in
his price tag and his claims, and now Kloss' Cambridge has
delivered his comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   (Both radios are sold through mail-order, the Bose from
800-681-BOSE, the Cambridge SoundWorks from 800-FOR-HIFI.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you noticed how everyone wants to get their hands on your
new baby?
</P>
<P>
   Of course the attention and affection showered on the baby are
nice, but what's nice isn't always the same as what's needed, and
what new moms need is a no-holds-barred buddy who wades into the
trenches, rolls up her sleeves and asks, ``How can I help?''
</P>
<P>
   For the times when you're moved to ask others this question (and
the times when you wish someone would ask it of you), consider this
a ``clip- and-save'' guide to making life a little easier for a new
mom and dad.
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring (real) food.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping off a home-cooked meal (or great take-out) is an act of
friendship every new mom and dad dream of. A devoted friend might
even cook the meal, bring it over, serve it (holding the baby so
the new parents can actually eat it), and clean up afterward,
leaving nothing but happy, full bellies in her wake.
</P>
<P>
   Milk, juice, bread, fruit, and other staples are always
appreciated. After all, food is love.
</P>
<P>
   2. Come bearing brooms.
</P>
<P>
   A baby creates an avalanche of chores. After baths, diapering,
spit-up removal and laundry, there's no time (or energy) for much
else. Like many a new parent you shudder as the constant stream of
well-wishers wades through unread newspapers and dust balls in what
used to be a tidy home.
</P>
<P>
   New parents fantasize about buddies showing up, bucket and mop
in hand, cheerfully tackling the kitchen, shower, living room and
cluttered corners until they sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   For loving friends who live too far away for the do-it-yourself
approach and want to give a baby shower gift that will really make
a difference, how about three months of prepaid cleaning service?
It's guaranteed to earn the sponsor a spot in the Helper's Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   3. Hold a crier (and don't complain).
</P>
<P>
   No matter how deeply a new mother adores her baby, she needs a
break sometimes (yes, even when the little sweetie is screaming for
all she's worth). In this ultimate test of friendship, people fall
into one of two categories: heroes who are willing to hold a crying
child and wimps who sing out ``Here, Mom!'' at the first squawk a
newborn makes, holding her at arm's length as if she were about to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   So the baby is crying. It's only a little voice, after all, and
a new mom will be eternally grateful if she can finish going to the
bathroom, just this once. Giving Mom time away from baby (crying or
not) is a necessity, not a luxury. It means she can have a minute
to herself to relax in a hot bath, take a walk or catch a nap.
</P>
<P>
   4. Offer on-the-spot childcare.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how a new mom ``runs out'' to pick up a quart of milk:
Feed the baby; change the baby; pack the diaper bag; feed the baby;
change the baby; change the mom; feed the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? Two hours later you're finally on your way, but
the minute you enter the store, the little guy begins to wail.
</P>
<P>
   The probability of task completion increases tenfold with the
help of another adult who can hold the baby, change a diaper or
finish errands while Mom nurses. For new parents who don't get out
much, walking into a store with free hands, knowing that the baby
is nearby, safe in the care of a trusted friend, is liberating.
Moms might even complete two errands in one outing!
</P>
<P>
   5. Polish your penmanship.
</P>
<P>
   New mothers who send out thank-you notes for all the baby
presents before their child is 3 months old are either developing
an obsessive-compulsive disorder, getting a head start on the
supermom complex or lucky enough to have family and friends who
help them organize a mass mailing in between feedings and diaper
changes or during the baby's naps.
</P>
<P>
   New moms need buddies who seize the
thank-you-for-your-lovely-gift mission as their own, bringing over
stamps and addressing envelopes while Mom writes the notes, or
putting their best penmanship forward as Mom dictates.
</P>
<P>
   With all the other intense emotions of new parenthood, you can
at least keep guilt over unwritten thank-you notes out of the mix.
</P>
<P>
   6. Roll up your sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors whom dads and moms love most are those who stop by
not just to shoot the breeze or offer unsolicited advice but also
to fix the banging screen door. Or hang new curtains, recycle the
newspapers, take the dog for a walk, rake leaves, water the
houseplants, brush the cat and clean out the litter box.
</P>
<P>
   These little extras are acts of love in their best form:
hands-on care.
</P>
<P>
   7. Be a ``big sister'' to the new big sister.
</P>
<P>
   When a second child is born, mothers are confronted with a
knife-in-the-heart feeling, certain that in showering attention on
the new arrival they are ruining their firstborn's childhood
forever. Fortunate are those who have family and friends to push
big sister on the swings, take her to the park or library, build
block towers, play tag and hang around for the sole purpose of
helping with her bedtime routine.
</P>
<P>
   It's the people who show up at the door with barely a glance in
the new infant's direction, calling out, ``Where's my big girl?''
with their arms flung wide, who show they know what real help is
about.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, new moms need encouragement and congratulations as well,
but when it comes to changing diapers, running errands, cleaning
up, or finding a moment to themselves, kind words can't do the job.
But friends and family can, by showering new moms with love in the
form of tangible help.

<P>
   If you like to exercise with a group, you've probably attended
more than a few aerobic classes over the years, from dance to
hip-hop to high energy to low impact.
</P>
<P>
   You may also have tried the popular ``step'' classes offered at
health clubs, where exercisers step up on a plastic bench in a
series of choreographed movements.
</P>
<P>
   But what about weight-lifting? Does the thought of heaving
barbells put you off? What if you were able to do that in a class
where the atmosphere was fun and high energy, and the whole routine
was set to music?
</P>
<P>
   That's the concept of BodyPUMP, an increasingly popular new
exercise program that was developed in New Zealand in 1990 and
introduced in U.S. fitness clubs this year.
</P>
<P>
   BodyPUMP will ``breathe new life into the group fitness
market,'' says Rich Boggs, president of the Step Co. in Marietta,
Ga., which brought the step aerobic program to health clubs in the
early '90s and is marketing the new BodyPUMP program.
</P>
<P>
   Instructors can become certified in the method after attending
three-day workshops, then going through quarterly workshops to
learn new choreography and ensure their workouts are being taught
safely and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are often held in fitness centers' aerobics rooms.
Participants use a specially designed barbell system that allows
them to adjust weights for intensity and fitness levels. They lift
the barbells through a set of choreographed routines that are
designed to work every major muscle group, Boggs said, including
squats, presses, lifts and curls. The bar ranges from 3 pounds
without weights to a maximum of 91 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The focus: correct lifting using light to moderate weights with
high repetitions. ``You don't get big,'' Boggs says. ``Just toned
and strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The user-friendly format is attracting females, who
traditionally shy away from free weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``BodyPUMP is the first opportunity for women to strength train
to music,'' says Debbie Lee, general manager at the Fitness
Connection for Women in Gainesville, Fla. ``You don't have to be a
body builder to do it. It's attractive to all groups, from novices
to advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Classes on average can accommodate 50 participants and last from
45 to 60 minutes. While the routine is not aerobic, the
weight-lifting helps build lean muscle mass, reversing bone loss,
which is increasingly important to women with concerns of
osteoporosis, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs recommends using BodyPUMP as part of a balanced exercise
program, two to three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, see Bogg's company Web site at
www.bodypump.com, or call the Step Co. at (770) 859-9292.

GO AHEAD AND CONTACT DAD
</HEADLINE>
  By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: I grew up in a foster home, but years ago _ I'm 60 now
_ I found my mother. I've been trying to track down my father ever
since. Now I know where he is, but when I telephoned a stepsister
to ask about him, she said he's 82 and dying. She told me to leave
him alone. Should I listen to her? _ Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: The decision is not up to her. Brothers and sisters are
often rivals for parental attention. All of a sudden you're coming
out of the ozone and saying, ``Hey, I'm going to come talk to
Dad.'' That means more people at Thanksgiving and a smaller
inheritance. Dry your tears and send your Dad a card, saying you'd
like to come to Florida to see him. Send pictures of your children
and grandchildren. That always helps.
</P>
<P>
   Get in there with Dad and do it quickly. You don't need your
stepsister's permission. If you don't have his number, check the
telephone book in his city or go online. If you don't know how to
use the Internet, ask your grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I just came back from one of those corporate retreats
on leadership. I thought I was the perfect executive, a creative
woman with enthusiasm who cared for her staff. I even lecture on
leadership! Now I find I was all wrong. The feedback is that I'm a
penny-pincher and my meetings are a waste of time. How can I make
my image of me the one people recognize? _ Dayton, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Thank goodness for this revelation. You've had a
wonderful window into who people really think you are.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you look at yourself and at the person other people see,
you'll find some overlap. Clearly you're authoritative. Clearly
you're able to make decisions. But it sounds like your decisions
are very bottom-line oriented rather than people-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just focus more on having people give you feedback BEFORE
you make decisions, which will make them more enthusiastic team
players. They will feel they are being consulted; you will feel you
are a much more enlightened boss who is listening better. The whole
thing about leadership is figuring out where people want to go and
getting there first.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, stop beating yourself up. Leadership styles
have changed significantly. Make a couple of the people you feel
are the bravest and have the best ideas your boardroom cabinet and
get some consensus from them. You can still make your own decisions
but you'll have a little more thumb on the pulse of the employees.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My wife is always testing me. She asks me questions
and I know she has an answer in mind, like what I'd like to do for
the weekend or what I'd like for dinner, but I'll be darned if I
can figure out what she wants. My mother did the same thing to my
father and that's what finally killed him. How can I get her to
understand how much this bothers me? _ Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Always being under pressure to come up with the right
answer is like taking a quiz you haven't studied for. If you look
for the question rather than the answer, you will find fewer
battles at home and be more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask your wife what she wants from you, perhaps you can
determine your specific request _ or that she doesn't know. Asking
others for their questions allows them to tell you what's important
and true for them. Worst case scenario: Tell your wife what she
thinks and if she disagrees you can at least have an interesting
conversation. When in doubt, offer an opinion. Maybe her Spanish
Inquisition routine is her way of trying to get SOMETHING out of
you.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My brother has five step-grandchildren under age 12. I
always remember their birthdays with a card and $10, but I never
get a thank you and they don't acknowledge my birthday. It really
makes me mad, but should I complain to my brother or their parents?
_ Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Hey, let's lighten up here. First, it's not your job to
raise your brother's step-grandchildren. Second, go out and buy
five birthday cards and address them. Send them out next year --
just the cards. Then when the kids ask why they didn't get any
money, say you haven't received a thank-you note. Third, put that
$50 aside to buy yourself a present.

CLINTON SEEKS JOINT APPROACH TO NORTH KOREA BY ASIAN ALLIES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL _ President Clinton arrived in wintry South Korea late
Friday, hoping to bridge a dispute between South Korea and Japan on
how to react to North Korea's new long-range missiles and possible
nuclear weapons research.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was expected to urge South Korean President Kim Dae Jung
on Saturday to forge a common approach to North Korea that can be
followed by the United States, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Strains have developed among the three Pacific allies since
North Korea test fired a 3,300-mile range missile over Japanese
territory on Aug. 31 and began digging an underground complex
capable of serving as a secretive nuclear weapons facility.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and South Korea have taken a wait-and-see
approach, attributing the missile firing to the ``evolution'' of
North Korea's burgeoning missile program. The two nations also have
withheld judgment about the nature of the underground facility
until making an on-site inspection.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan has adopted a tough stance toward North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi pointedly warned Clinton
during a joint news conference in Tokyo Friday that Japan cannot
accept a second missile firing by North Korea or continued
ambiguity about the purposes of the underground facility. U.S.
officials say the facility has come under suspicion because it is
located near North Korea's nuclear research center and because
North Korea has been building it with unusually speed and
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean missile firing ``was a very shocking experience
for us,'' Obuchi told Clinton. Japanese authorities harbor ``some
doubts'' about the purpose of the underground complex.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese leader said neither the Japanese parliament nor
public opinion will support a Japanese government promise to donate
to the $4.6 billion international effort to persuade North Korea to
abandon its nuclear weapons program by building a pair of
non-weapons capable nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that respect, we would like to ask for the understanding of
the United States,'' Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan also has signaled its displeasure by halting famine relief
to North Korea's 24.3 million people and delaying resumption of
negotiations for full diplomatic relations that were broken off at
the outset of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vowed to press allied efforts to persuade North Korea to
cease ``destabilizing things like this missile flight over Japan
which disturbed us greatly'' as well as getting Pyongyang to permit
U.S. inspection of the mysterious underground site.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered conflicting assessments of North Korea's
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some disturbing signs there,'' Clinton told the news
conference in Tokyo. ``We need to continue working together with
our friends in South Korea _ hopefully with the support and good
wishes of the Chinese _ to try to restrain hostile developments in
North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also offered a benign explanation for North Korea's
actions, saying that North Korea might be developing a long-range
missile for possible export.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has insisted on payment of a large fee before
allowing inspections of the underground site. Clinton suggested
this may merely reflect the nation's economic desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can be absolutely sure of whether the North Korean
position is simply a product of economic difficulties so they're
attempting to get more money out of various countries for doing
that they ought to be doing anyway or whether they really are
moving toward a more hostile posture,' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials will raise the inspection issue during a visit by
North Korean officials to New York in December to discuss U.S.
troops missing since the Korean War and during scheduled Korean War
peace talks in Geneva on Jan. 18 between North Korea, South Korea,
China and the United States. The Geneva talks reflect the fact that
a peace treaty has never been adopted by the belligerents although
hostilities ended when a truce was agreed to in July 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emphasized that the United States is launching a
comprehensive review of U.S. policies toward North Korea at the
behest of Congress. Clinton asked former Defense Secretary William
Perry to lead the review.

 &HT;    ``I can't imagine life without my kids,'' says Hollywood's
finest actress Meryl Streep, ``yet if I didn't make movies I'd need
pills and therapy. It keeps me sane.''
 &HT;    In ambition-driven Hollywood where actors regularly sell their
souls as well as their private lives for stardom, Meryl Streep is
unique.
 &HT;    Streep, one of the finest actresses the screen has produced in
the last quarter-century has turned down millions of dollars to
continue a role she calls the most important of her life: mother.
 &HT;    ``The kids come first,'' says Streep of her four children:

hair falling to her shoulders.

live without my work,'' she says, ``And I can't imagine my life
without my children. Sometime I can't believe my extraordinary good
fortune. I keep waiting for that sword to fall on my neck.''
 &HT;    Not likely. Despite her love for making movies Streep married to
sculptor Don Gummer since l978 still turns down movie roles. ``I
have turned down incredible roles because they would take me away
on location too long,'' she notes. ``I have it written into my
contract that I will never be away from my family for more than a
couple of weeks at a time. There are studios and directors who
simply will not employ me. They are shocked that I insist on having
a life outside the movies.''
 &HT;    On this year's film ``One True Thing,'' in which she plays a
woman dying of cancer opposite Renee Zellwegger, she took daily
helicopter rides to the film set--and then home again so she would
be with the children at night.
 &HT;    ``My kids thought it was great fun that I got to ride in a
chopper every day. I thought it was a terrifying experience. I hate
helicopters.
 &HT;    ``But I was also able to bring my kids to the set--something
many working mothers don't get to do. I try to work primarily in
the summers when the kids are on vacation so they can go with me.
If a film role takes me away from my kids I say no. Today, every
movie I decide to do is because of my children. I choose films
based on how I think my kids will view them and how it will enhance
or affect the soul of their future.''
 &HT;    Last summer they all jetted to Donegal, Ireland, where she shot
the movie ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' (which opens in Los Angeles and
New York in late November and nationwide in mid-December). The film
is based on Brian Friel's play and has Streep delivering an
impeccable Irish accent as one of five spinster sisters whose lives
are disrupted when their priest brother (Michael Gambon) returns to
their country home.
 &HT;    ``I had no problems convincing them to come with me to Ireland.
Everybody wanted to be in on that big, free trip,'' she laughingly
recalls.
 &HT;    Now with the kids growing up fast, Streep says her children have
become a lot more interested in what she does in front of the
camera. ``They're quite proud of me and they're no longer annoyed
when I go away on a movie. My oldest Henry is a beautiful artist
and a very good actor, I'm sorry to say,'' she laughs, ``and the
girls are definitely showbiz all the way.''
 &HT;    The star, who won Oscars for ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' in l979 and
as the tortured mother in ``Sophie's Choice'' in l982 is tipped for
an Oscar nomination for her cancer victim portrayal in ``One True
Thing,'' which is based on Anna Quindlen's l995 novel, as well for
the stern schoolteacher Kate Mundy, who lords it over her sisters
in ``Lughnasa.''
 &HT;    She insists she's not sacrificing her career for her family. ``I
always wanted a family more than anything else including a career.
I wanted both and I have them.''
 &HT;    These days you won't find her out there beating the Hollywood
bushes for work or lobbying for roles. ``My biggest problem in life
is managing my time,'' she says. ``Now my career choices are made
on what will make my family happy and not necessarily what's best
for my career.''
 &HT;    At 49 she still decries the shortage of good lead roles for
actresses her age: ``There aren't many good things available to
women over 40. It has to do with the market thing--the
demographics.''
 &HT;    Still she has lots of scripts coming her way. She is learning to
play the violin for ``50 Violins,'' the story of a woman who
teaches the music to inner-city children. The role is for director
Wes Craven, who is switching from his usual horror film movies. She
was chosen over Madonna, which evens things out as Madonna landed
the ``Evita'' starring role after Streep was keen to do it.
 &HT;    She will also star opposite Michael Douglas in ``Still Life,''
in which they play a couple forced to raise their grandchildren.
And she also hopes to star with hot actress Cameron Diaz in
``Success,'' about two TV network executives in a film reminiscent
of the classic oldie ``All About Eve'' (1950).
 &HT;    In the early '90s Streep tried Hollywood as a permanent home
base. But after three years she moved the family back to their
Connecticut estate set on 54 acres with its very own private lake.
 &HT;    She smiles, her cobalt blue eyes lighting up the room: ``Henry
was dragged kicking and screaming back to Connecticut. He had made
lots of friends. But I was worried they'd all get caught up in that
`Beverly Hills 90210' stuff. Now they know it was the right
decision.''

   In this colorful and informative piece, Rodgers, a popular
cooking teacher known as Mr. Thanksgiving, offers facts and lore
about three staples of the holiday dinner: turkey, cranberries and
pumpkin. A few tidbits: Israelis eat the most turkey of any
nationality. Farm-raised turkeys are so chest-heavy that they
cannot get close enough to mate, so females must be artificially
inseminated. Colonial Americans called cranberries ``bounce
berries'' because bounciness was an indication of a cranberry's
freshness. (slugged:

   Why do we celebrate Thanksgiving on the last Thursday of
November? Because of the 19th-century crusade by Sarah Josepha
Hale, editor of ``Godey's Lady's Book,'' who persuaded Abraham
Lincoln to proclaim the holiday, history buff Malehorn tells us.
Before that Thanksgiving was a haphazard celebration _ in fact, in
colonial times the word ``celebration'' was not quite apt. It was a
somber, religious occasion, spent in prayer in chilly village
churches. (slugged:

 By HAL MALEHORN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Nearly all American schoolchildren learn the standard
Thanksgiving story: how the Pilgrims survived their first miserable
winter, and how the following fall they feasted with friendly
Indians to celebrate a successful harvest.
 &HT;    But many of us are unaware that the holiday is rooted in
European tradition, that it was a somber, religious holiday in
colonial times and that it was through the efforts of one
determined 19th century woman that it became celebrated on a fixed
day in November.
 &HT;    Many misconceptions surround that first Thanksgiving. It is
indeed true that the Pilgrims' tables were spread with nature's
bounty that 1621 autumn. But the foods were quite different from
those on which we feast today. Turkey might well have graced the
boards, but there likely was other wild game as well, so readily
available from the woods nearby.
 &HT;    Bee-tree honey and native fruits, berries and nuts also likely
satisfied appetites at that banquet, along with fish and shellfish
that abounded close to shore.
 &HT;    Corn, native to the New World, was probably prepared either as a
pudding or baked into cakes. Pumpkins (or pompions, as they were
called) were eaten boiled, for there was little molasses or flour
to bake them into pies.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving in America actually had its origins in Europe well
before any westbound voyagers from that continent ever hoisted
sail. In many parts of the Old Country, in fact, residents had for
centuries held observances of ``Harvest Home,'' a time when farmers
joined forces with neighbors to bring in their crops. This shared
labor was usually followed by festive dancing and food and drink.
 &HT;    Sometimes European governments decreed days of rejoicing among
the populace in thanks for a major victory in battle, or for the
end of a plague or for deliverance from some natural disaster.
 &HT;    In the early decades of American colonial life, Thanksgiving Day
did not always call for making merry. To the contrary, some church
fathers took a dim view of too much jollity. Attendance at worship
was required, where thanksgivers endured hours-long sermons and
prayers in chilly village churches.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving long ago was not uniformly observed on a single
date. Sometimes two or more Thanksgivings were announced within the
same calendar year. For example, during our War of Independence
special days of gratitude were proclaimed following our major
victories on the battlefield.
 &HT;    Similarly, the Continental Congress ordered a day of thanks
after our military alliance with France was signed. Several years
later there was a call for a national celebration of the British
surrender at Yorktown. On each such occasion grateful citizens
thronged to churches to express their thanks.
 &HT;    When the Constitutional Convention gathered in 1787, one
delegate proposed mandating an annual day of thanksgiving across
the land. However, as most of his fellow delegates saw the matter
as rightly belonging to the 13 states-to-be, that provision was
omitted from the landmark document.
 &HT;    In spite of this early congressional reluctance, Presidents
George Washington and James Madison each proclaimed a nationwide
thanksgiving observance. For his part, though, Thomas Jefferson,
viewing the presidency as a strictly civil post, found himself ``in
no position to direct the religious exercise of constituents.''
 &HT;    Since most thanksgiving observances early in our nationhood
occurred only at the discretion of the governor of the various
states, the time chosen for such an event ranged from September
through January. The success in fixing a single date on which to
observe Thanksgiving can be attributed to Sarah Josepha Hale,
editor of ``Godey's Lady's Book.''
 &HT;    In 1846 she began a crusade to set aside the last Thursday in
November as an official national holiday. Each autumn thereafter
she published in her magazine's pages an enthusiastic editorial on
the desirability of such an event.
 &HT;    Each year her November issue focused on that special day,
relating warm stories of family reunions. Mrs. Hale encouraged her
readers to urge their governors to agree on just one date.
 &HT;    When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Mrs. Hale's campaign
faltered for a while. But after the Union victory at Gettysburg,
President Abraham Lincoln set aside a day of thanksgiving and
prayer. Relieved at the recent repulse of Robert E. Lee's rebel
forces, Northern citizens had ample reason to rejoice.
 &HT;    Six weeks later the persistent Mrs. Hale wrote to Lincoln,
urging him to establish Thanksgiving as an annual national event.
Because the last Thursday was already being so proclaimed by
governors of most of the northern states, Mrs. Hale argued, Lincoln
should make it official.
 &HT;    And so, on Oct. 8, 1863, Lincoln decreed a national Thanksgiving
for the last Thursday in November _ not in honor of military
success, but rather ``for a year filled with blessings of fruitful
fields.''
 &HT;    The following year Lincoln renewed his proclamation, and ever
since our nation has seen fit to continue the tradition. And so
today millions of Americans gather each November to enjoy families,
friendships and abundant food _ the same blessings so important to
the Pilgrims in 1621.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TURKEY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is only assumed that wild turkeys were served at that first
Thanksgiving in 1621. The firsthand accounts of the menu simply
mention ``fowl.'' We do know that the Pilgrims had venison, cod and
lobster on the table, so why don't we have surf and turf or fish
cakes instead of turkey?
</P>
<P>
   The turkey is an impressive bird, with its bronze feathers,
unusual head markings and showy tail. Even a hardened critic like
Brilliat-Savarin _ a French gourmand who, in 1825, uttered the
phrase, ``Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are'' _
said, ``The turkey is certainly one of the handsomest gifts the New
World made to the Old World. ... [It] is the largest and, if not
the most subtle, at least the most tasty of our domestic birds.''
Just looking at its corpulent figure it gives one a feeling of
abundance and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The wild turkey is native to North and Central America and was
domesticated by the Aztecs. No one knows when the first turkeys
traveled to Europe, but they seem to have been brought to Spain by
conquistadors in the early 1500s. The turkey quickly established
itself as the bird to serve at festive occasions, especially in
Italy, France and England, and was bred into a plumper version.
</P>
<P>
   This new improved turkey was brought back to the Americas, where
it was crossbred with its wild cousin to make the breed we know
today. The turkey was not a strange bird to the Pilgrims _ they
were well acquainted with it, and must have been relieved to find a
familiar food in this strange land.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows how the turkey got its name. There are many
explanations, none definitive. Some think that early explorers,
believing they were close to India, misidentified the bird and
called it tuki, an Indian name for peacock.
</P>
<P>
   Because it also resembled the guinea fowl, which came from
Africa via Turkish merchants, it could have picked up the name by
another misappropriation of origin. (Guinea fowls were also called
turkeys.) Or it could have gotten its name from one of its calls,
which sounds like ``turk, turk, turk.''
</P>
<P>
   Because turkeys were so abundant in Colonial America, they were
a major source of nourishment for our country's forefathers. In a
well-known letter to his daughter, Benjamin Franklin expressed his
dismay over the eagle's being chosen as the official United States
bird.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the eagle's ``bad moral character,'' he went on to
say, ``I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the
representative of our country! The turkey is a much more
respectable bird, and withal a true original native of America.''
</P>
<P>
   While about 675 million pounds of turkey are served each
Thanksgiving, in recent years its healthy profile and versatility
have changed the turkey from a holiday bird to one that competes
with other meat and poultry on a year-round basis.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Americans do not eat the most turkey. In 1997, it
was estimated that Israelis ate about 25.7 pounds per capita, while
we weighed in at 18.7 pounds. Runner-up was France, at 13.4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Most turkeys are of the White Holland variety, which have a lot
of the white breast meat that more than 70 percent of Americans
prefer. In fact, farm-raised turkeys are so chest-heavy that they
cannot get close enough to mate. All farm-raised female turkeys are
artificially inseminated.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CRANBERRIES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure that cranberries were served at the first
Thanksgiving, but the cranberry was a very important food to the
Pawtuxet Indians, so historians assume that they would have offered
it as a contribution to the feast. Instinct must have taught the
Indians that the tart berries are an excellent source of Vitamin C,
because they used them in many dishes.
</P>
<P>
   They ate them raw and boiled with maple syrup, but perhaps the
most common use was in pemmican, which was a kind of low-tech
energy bar made with berries, dried venison meat and melted animal
fat. Pemmican kept well, and went with the Indians on long
journeys.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilgrims probably referred to cranberries as ``fenberries,''
a common fruit in old England which they resembled. The cranberry,
however, gets its modern name from the Dutch and German settlers,
who called it a ``crane berry.'' When the cranberry vines bloom,
the blossom looks like the head and bill of a crane. Eventually,
the name became cranberry.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial Americans called them ``bounce berries,'' referring to
their bounciness. Bouncing berries are an indication of freshness;
bruised, old berries don't bounce.
</P>
<P>
   A recipe for cranberry sauce is included in the very first
printed American cookbook, Amelia Simmons' ``American Cookery,''
which appeared in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   Canned cranberry sauce first hit the shelves in 1912, a product
of the Cape Cod Cannery Company, which eventually became the Ocean
Spray Preserving Company. The president of the company was a Boston
lawyer, Marcus L. Urann. In 1930, Urann organized a merger between
his company and two other cranberry canneries to form the Cranberry
Canners, Inc., a cranberry farming cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative, which eventually acquired Urann's former
company name after a few months of squabbling, now provides more
than 70 percent of the world's cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever wondered how many cranberries are in a 12-ounce
bag, the number is 360, give or take a few berries.
</P>
<P>
   PUMPKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin pie was certainly not included in the first feast. The
Mayflower's stores of wheat had long been depleted, and the first
planting had failed. No wheat, no pie crust. As with so many other
foods, the Indians taught the Pilgrims about pumpkin. Along with
beans and corn, it was one of the three major foods in the Native
American diet throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
   There is some argument over the pumpkin's origin. Some botanists
say it is a New World vegetable, and others claim it was known in
Europe before the Exploration Age. It is likely, however, that the
European ``pumpkins'' in the pre-Columbus era were really gourds,
and that we can truly claim the pumpkin as an American native that
deserves a place of honor at the Thanksgiving meal.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians probably roasted pumpkin over an open fire or boiled
it with maple syrup. Pumpkin pudding became one of the favorite
dishes of the Puritan era. The pumpkin flesh was scooped out, mixed
with milk, spices and syrup, then returned to the pumpkin shell,
where it was roasted for hours in hot ashes. It is easy to see
where the basic recipe for pumpkin pie filling came from.
</P>
<P>
   Known to the settlers as pompion _ the name given by French
explorers in the late 1500s _ pumpkin saved them from starvation in
the lean early years of their colony.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first recipes for pumpkin pie appeared in 1655 in a
British book called Queens Closed Open. This version represents the
then current taste for highly seasoned foods and includes thyme,
rosemary, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, cloves and apple. Amelia
Simmons included ``pompkin pie'' in the first American cookbook,
published in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the modern pumpkin pie can be dated back to 1929.
In that year, Libby, McNeil and Libby bought a small pumpkin pie
cannery, Dickinson Canning Company. The little cannery's pride and
joy was its special eating pumpkin, now called the Dickinson
variety. Eating pumpkins, very different from the jack-o'-lantern
varieties grown for their size and appearance, are elongated and
buff-colored with thin walls. The Dickinson is noted for its bright
orange color, creamy texture and fresh taste.
</P>
<P>
   Libby's took years to develop its own strain, improving upon the
Dickinson, called ``Select.'' Today, Libby's, a division of Nestle,
Inc., plants more than 4,000 acres of pumpkins annually.

 By ELIZABETH LEVANG  
 From ``Holiday Hope: Remembering Loved Ones During Special Times of
the Year,'' published by Fairview Press 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The holiday season calls up wistful memories and returns us to
faraway places, to scenes filled with the scents and sounds of
warmth and happiness. No other time of year evokes such strong
images of family togetherness.
 &HT;    For all its nostalgia and sentimentalism, however, the holiday
season is a difficult and often debilitating period for those who
are bereaved. More than anything, the holidays seem to accentuate
what others have and they have lost.
 &HT;    A time of year that once was joyous now often becomes almost
unbearable. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year's are
days to endure rather than enjoy.
 &HT;    A friend whose 17-year-old son died in a car accident once
confided, ``I'd like to rip Dec. 25 off my calendar forever.''
 &HT;    Those with loved ones who have died experience a special pain or
burden during the holidays. Your lives have been altered, and your
family togetherness has been disturbed forever. Trying to reconcile
your reality with the idealized picture of the holidays projected
by the media causes even more emotional pain.
 &HT;    The expectations put on the bereaved, both socially and
emotionally, can feel overwhelming. You may have parties to attend,
gifts to purchase and a tree to be bought and trimmed. You are
expected to get in the spirit and join in the festivities just like
everyone else, yet in your heart is a gnawing pain and the constant
fear that you won't make it.
 &HT;    A close friend once remarked how much she had come to hate
Thanksgiving. ``The family focus hurts me,'' she said. ``I feel
somehow out of place. It's a depressing and lonely time for me.
Both my parents are dead and I don't really feel like I have much
to give thanks about.''
 &HT;    Comparing yourself to others, isolating ourselves, feeling
jealous, lonely, depressed or angry are some of the reactions that
you may experience during the holiday season. Many also feel guilt
from time to time, or are totally overwhelmed with sorrow.
 &HT;    Still, there are ways to survive the holidays, and with a change
in attitude and a bit of planning, they can become tolerable, and
even enjoyable. How can you better handle your grief during the
holidays?
 &HT;    First, acknowledge your pain. You miss your loved one. It is
agonizing not to be able to spend this joyous time with him or her.
Feel free to share your pain with friends and family. By
acknowledging and sharing your feelings, you allow others to
support and care for you. Rather than pushing your feelings down
and hoping they will stay hidden, you need an opportunity to
resolve them. Only by letting the hurt out will you make room for
healing.
 &HT;    Second, take charge of your life and don't leave things to
chance. This does not mean putting yourself on a rigid schedule,
but rather deciding in advance what you would like to do and with
whom. By taking charge, you give yourself things to look forward to
rather than things to dread. Occupying yourself lends a purpose to
your days and keeps you from feeling sorry for yourself.
 &HT;    Third, think more realistically and positively. What you think
has a dramatic effect on how you feel. When you form positive yet
realistic expectations for the holidays and accept your own
limitations, you reduce the tensions and pressure you face. Now,
how do you put these three new attitudes into practice? Here are a
number of specific coping strategies:
 &HT;    + Be honest. Your feelings are legitimate. Trust that you know
what is best for yourself. If a gathering of family or friends is
too painful, make your apologies and leave.
 &HT;    + Accept and seek support. Let your family and friends know how
they can be of assistance. If hanging ornaments on the tree feels
overwhelming, ask a friend to lend a hand. If neighbors offer to
bake cookies or wrap gifts, graciously accept their help and good
intentions.
 &HT;    + Be kind to yourself. Look for ways to nurture and care for
yourself throughout the holidays. Perhaps buy yourself a special
gift, sign up for a massage or do that something you've always
wanted to do. And at the very least, treat yourself to an
occasional smile.
 &HT;    + Have a plan. Talking with friends and family about what you
want and don't want to do during the holidays can be very helpful.
Being prepared lessens anxiety.
 &HT;    + Alter traditions. Since circumstances have changed, old
traditions may need replacing. Even simple changes, like serving
another dish instead of turkey or opening gifts later in the day,
may make you more comfortable.
 &HT;    + Start a new tradition. Start afresh by adding one new
tradition each year. Attending a seasonal play, decorating a
special tree outdoors or reciting a favorite poem before opening
gifts are some examples.
 &HT;    + Shop early. Avoid the holiday atmosphere by completing
shopping early. Rely on catalogs or the telephone, or enlist the
aid of a supportive friend.
 &HT;    + Decrease your commitments. Grief saps energy, so you may need
to pare down your commitments. Consider buying instead of baking
cookies, cutting down on the number of cards you send or having an
artificial rather than a fresh tree.
 &HT;    + Cherish your memories. Religious services, Christmas concerts
or other holiday events can trigger memories of your loved one.
While some may be painful, memories need to be cherished, for they
are an enduring and intimate connection to your loved one.
 &HT;    + Give tribute. The holidays can be a special time to honor your
loved one. Donating money to a special cause, offering to help
someone in need or volunteering your time and talents to a local
charity are some ways to do this.
 &HT;    + Be hopeful. The pain and stress of the holidays is very real.
Still, with some trial and error, things will get better.
 &HT;    + Remember the life of your loved one. More than anything else
at this time of year, you may feel a strong need to know that your
loved one has not been forgotten. Setting a plate at the table,
hanging a stocking on the mantle or retelling stories about him or
her are just a few ways to reassure yourself that the spirit of
this special person lives on.

 By RICK RODGERS  
 From ``Thanksgiving 101,'' published by Broadway Books 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Rick Rodgers, often called Mr. Thanksgiving, gives holiday
cooking classes nationwide. Below he answers questions about
choosing from among the myriad types of turkey on the market.
 &HT;    + Other than gender, are there any differences between hen and
tom turkeys? Is one more tender than the other?
 &HT;    Hens are female turkeys, weighing from 8 to 16 pounds. Male
toms, bred to yield a high proportion of the white breast meat that
most Americans prefer, weigh 14 to 26 pounds. The size of the bird
relates to its age. Turkeys are often labeled ``young,'' because no
commercial turkey is much older than 26 weeks.
 &HT;    Thanks to modern animal husbandry methods, there is no
difference in flavor or tenderness between toms and hens. In the
old days, a younger bird meant a more tender one, and while an old
tom had plenty of flavor, it was also tougher.
 &HT;    + What are the differences between fresh and frozen turkeys?
 &HT;    There are actually three designations for fresh and frozen
turkeys.
 &HT;    _ ``Frozen'' turkeys have been deep-chilled at 0 degrees or
below. They are at their best if defrosted and cooked within one
year of purchase. (If you've ever wondered how your supermarket can
give away free frozen turkeys as premiums at Thanksgiving time,
it's probably because they are using up last year's surplus.)
 &HT;    _ ``Fresh'' birds have never been chilled below 26 degrees, and
have a correspondingly short shelf life. (Turkey freezes at eight
degrees lower than water does.) Fresh turkeys are readily available
at supermarkets or butchers. You rarely have to special order them
anymore, unless your butcher requires that you do so or you are
concerned about getting a certain size. Buy fresh turkey no earlier
than two days before roasting, even if the ``sell-by'' date on the
label is later. I always buy a fresh turkey.
 &HT;    _ Turkeys kept at temperatures between 0 and 26 degrees are
considered ``hard-chilled.'' You won't see turkeys labeled
hard-chilled, though, as each turkey producer is allowed to create
its own name for this designation, as long as it isn't misleading.
Holding turkey at this temperature range prolongs shelf life and
has little effect on quality.
 &HT;    + What about frozen turkeys?
 &HT;    Frozen turkeys are the least expensive, but freezing dries out
the meat, and more moisture is lost down the drain during
defrosting. Good turkey producers always inject the birds with a
moistening solution to replace the lost liquid. The best frozen
turkeys have been injected only with wholesome ingredients like
broth, vegetable oil and seasonings.
 &HT;    Also, frozen birds require advance planning to defrost. I hardly
have enough room in my refrigerator at holiday time as it is,
without a huge turkey taking up all the space while it thaws for
three to five days.
 &HT;    Considering the minor difference in price between frozen and
fresh (or hard-chilled, which is almost as good as fresh) turkeys,
why not get the best you can afford?
 &HT;    + If I do buy a frozen turkey, how do I defrost it?
 &HT;    First and foremost, never defrost a turkey at room temperature.
 &HT;    Allow enough time for the turkey to thaw. It takes a full 24
hours to defrost each five pounds of turkey in the refrigerator.
So, if you want a 25-pound turkey to be thoroughly defrosted by
Thanksgiving morning, you must buy it by the preceding Sunday at
the latest. (I'd buy it on Saturday, just to be sure.)
 &HT;    If you are in a hurry, a second-best option is to defrost the
bird in a large sink of cold water, allowing 30 minutes per pound,
changing the water and turning the turkey often. Do not add warm
water to hasten the process.
 &HT;    Don't defrost a turkey in the microwave oven. The turkey is
irregularly shaped, and some parts of the bird will cook while
others are still defrosting. Besides, most microwave ovens won't
hold a bird larger than 12 pounds.
 &HT;    + What about self-basting birds?
 &HT;    Self-basting birds, available fresh and frozen, have been
``enhanced'' (in the eyes of the producer) with flavorings, some
natural and some artificial. They purport to make the turkey moist
_ I say these make the turkey soggy and wet, and predisposed to
fall apart when lifting it from the pan.
 &HT;    They say the basting liquid makes the turkey taste better _ I
say a turkey tastes good enough without fake flavorings. I want to
promote turkeys that taste like turkey, not canned soup.
 &HT;    And I like to baste the bird, so the concept of ``self-basting''
leaves me cold. Not only does opening the oven and basting give the
cook an idea of the turkey's progress, but the hot basting liquid
helps to brown and seal the skin and hold in the juices.
 &HT;    + My farmers' market has organic, free-range birds. Are they
worth the price?
 &HT;    The terms organic and free-range are not recognized by the USDA.
Butchers, farmers and restaurants can use them as marketing terms,
but they cannot use them in labeling (although they can be written
on signs advertising the product).
 &HT;    Generally, ``organic poultry'' has been raised on organically
grown, antibiotic-free feed. ``Free-range'' turkeys, which are
often organic, have been raised in a relatively spacious
environment that gives them access to open spaces.
 &HT;    Many turkeys that are not called free-range may have been raised
in henhouses with the same amount of space. The term free-range may
make you think of wide-open skies, but it's no guarantee that the
birds have ever been outside _ it just means that the door to the
henhouse is open and they can go out if they want to.
 &HT;    These birds can be excellent, but, again, they still need to be
cooked carefully for fine results. They are significantly more
expensive than ordinary fresh turkeys, and whether they are worth
it or not is up to you.
 &HT;    + My specialty butcher carries wild turkeys. What are they like?
 &HT;    Today, most wild turkeys are actually farm-raised. They are very
full-flavored, but not gamy like hunter-bagged wild turkeys. Most
true, wild turkeys are so tough that cooks roast only the tender
breast and stew the dark meat. I like to say they are to regular
turkeys what sourdough bread is to white bread. Some people just
like the complex flavor of the former better than the latter.
 &HT;    Wild turkeys look much different from regular ones, with a high,
humped breastbone and freckled white skin. While wild turkeys may
look meaty, they actually have a very low meat-to-bone ratio. Their
weight ranges from only six to 12 pounds. Allow about 1 1/2 pounds
per person.
 &HT;    Wild turkeys are very lean and should be roasted only to 170 to
175 degrees, or the meat will dry out. The dark meat may be a
little pink, but it is safe to eat. If you prefer your dark meat
more well-done, just pop the sliced meat back into a 400-degree
oven for a few minutes _ it will probably be cooked by the time you
get around to serving the mashed potatoes.
 &HT;    + My neighbor swears by kosher turkeys. What makes them
different?
 &HT;    Kosher turkeys are raised free-range in a manner similar to
organic turkeys and are fed antibiotic-free feed. They are
slaughtered and salted according to Jewish dietary laws. Some cooks
feel that the method of slaughtering gives the birds a fresher,
cleaner taste. The salting seasons the turkeys and makes their meat
somewhat firmer than that of regular birds.
 &HT;    These extra steps are labor-intensive, so kosher turkeys always
cost more. Many kosher turkeys are frozen, so be sure to defrost
them properly to protect your investment.

SIGNS ALONG BORDER TO WARN OF MEXICAN GUN LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ The Texas Department of Transportation plans
install more highway signs warning travelers that taking weapons
and bullets into Mexico is strictly illegal, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to lenient U.S. laws, Mexico has tough gun-control
laws and is rigid in dealing with people who cross into the country
with handguns, hunting rifles and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 Americans are in Mexican jails on weapons charges. Many
of those imprisoned say they did not realize they had weapons in
their vehicles or that they didn't know Mexican law prohibited them
from entering the country with guns and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Some warning signs already have been posted in border cities,
but the Texas Transportation Commission approved $600,000 to
install 54 signs from Brownsville to El Paso, Transportation
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Chandler said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials intend to post the black and red signs in locations
that will give motorists the opportunity to turn around before
crossing into Mexico. The warning signs will be mounted on poles or
suspended from overpasses.
</P>
<P>
   All cities with border crossings are scheduled to get the signs.
</P>
<P>
   Four men from Louisiana were released from prison in Nuevo
Laredo, Mexico, earlier this month after spending more than two
months behind bars. A car dealer from the Beaumont area recently
spent eight months in the prison in Mexico on a weapons charge.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Secretary of State Alberto Gonzalez applauded the
Transportation Commission's decision. ``These signs should greatly
aid our effort to educate Texans about Mexican firearms laws,''
Gonzalez said. ``If Texans choose to travel in Mexico, they must
comply with Mexican laws pertaining to firearms and ammunition,
including any that may be used for hunting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana men told the authorities that they did not know
they were heading into Mexico. By the time they realized they had
crossed the border, they had no place to turn around, according to
Jaime Stewart, a Laredo lawyer who specializes in Mexican law.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mexican law, people charged with smuggling weapons face up
to 10 years in prison and heavy fines.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is such a sensitive one that officials in Laredo
recently began distributing information to travelers to warn them
about the gun laws across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time people on international bridges know of the
severe consequences,'' said Laredo City Councilman Louis Bruni, who
earlier had vowed to put up a sign with his own money if necessary.
``If you get caught in Mexico, it will be the worst experience of
your life,'' he said.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Paper currency is convenient, but it often leaves
us holding on to small change that eventually weighs our pockets
and purses down.
</P>
<P>
   It's often emptied into all kinds of receptacles, such as jars,
bottles, baskets, covered tins, pails, coffee cans, dresser tops
and drawers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common and cherished vessels for loose coins is
the piggy bank, which was widely used by Europeans in the 16th
century and possibly earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Even though pigs are often thought of as smelly, or as bacon or
pork chops, the pig also has been viewed as lucky.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger pig means more money in the pocket of the owner when
the animal is sold at market. Therefore, putting your change in a
piggy bank would make your savings grow.
</P>
<P>
   In a national currency poll conducted in 1998 by Coinstar Inc.
of Bellevue, Wash., earthenware piggy banks ranked as the second
most popular coin receptacle. Coinstar, maker of coin-counting
machinery, found that glass and plastic jars constituted the most
popular place to save coins.
</P>
<P>
   Piggy banks come in a variety of styles and poses _ from sitting
pigs to dressed-up pigs to festively painted pigs, as well as the
traditional solid pink standing pig.

   ``Piggy banks are the most popular type of banks we sell,'' said
Nancy Richman, owner of Pearl Grant Richman outside Albany. ``We
had a man come in the other day and purchase a piggy bank for
himself, because it reminded him of when he was young. People also
buy piggy banks as baby and christening gifts, especially the
silver-plated ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Small silver-plated piggy banks can cost $35 to $40, while
pottery, bisque, porcelain and cast resin pig-shaped banks cost
approximately $30 to $50 and up, depending on the number of colors
and complexity of design.
</P>
<P>
   So that you don't have to give yourself a case of carpal tunnel
syndrome shaking the change out of the deposit slot of your piggy
bank, most come today with a handy trap door under the belly.
</P>
<P>
   But if it is your bent to smash the piggy bank open, you may
want to have it appraised before taking it to market. A 4 1/8-inch
Pennsylvania folk art piggy bank dressed in work clothes dating to
1890 has been valued at between $350 and $450. An older bank just
might be worth more than what's saved inside.

LEE, FIDELITY INVESTMENT WIN NO RAVE REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Talk about your Broadway bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Now it seems Livent Inc., the New York/Toronto firm that filed
for bankruptcy protection this week, will be remembered for its
fishy accounting rather than its extravagant theatrical
productions.
</P>
<P>
   One oddity: Some of the savviest investment shops in Boston had
front-row positions in Livent stock. After the company's two fired
principals, Thomas H. Lee Co. and Fidelity Investments rank as
Livent's largest investors.
</P>
<P>
   Livent has become a show unto itself. This week, it fired
founder Garth Drabinsky, restated financial results for the last
two years to increase losses by $61 million as a result of
``massive'' accounting irregularities, became caught up in nasty
lawsuits, and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and Fidelity each own investments that are worth, or would
eventually become worth, about 5 percent of Livent. Both Lee
himself and deputy Scott Sperling are directors. There are plenty
of other big names involved in the company, including former Walt
Disney president Michael Ovitz and Furman Selz cofounder Roy
Furman.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, we are talking about very short money. Livent may
be well-known for its productions, including ``Ragtime'' in New
York, and theaters owned by the company. But as a stock, Livent was
off-off Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Lee invested $17 million in Livent in 1993 or 1994, for the same
private equity fund that made huge profits on investments in
Snapple Inc. and General Nutrition Corp. The fund may ultimately
lose $10 million to $12 million on Livent.
</P>
<P>
   By way of comparison, Lee paid $300 million for 15 million
shares of Metris Co. within the last week and that position is now
worth $540 million.
</P>
<P>
   But losing money on such a public stage still stings a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're far from perfect,'' said Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, the world's largest mutual fund company, would barely
notice its Livent setback either. Most of the investment doesn't
even involve US investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very small holding as a  &QC; 
percentage of assets in a very small number of funds, mainly in
funds offered exclusively to Canadian investors,'' a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Livent turmoil may not amount to much money, but it's great
theater.

Investor seeks Celtics debt
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who is Jim Riley and why is he trying to buy up all of those
Boston Celtics debt securities?
</P>
<P>
   If you are among the 80,000 or so owners of Boston Celtics
investment units, you may have received word through your broker
this week about an offer from a fund called Riley Bower Equities I.
</P>
<P>
   Riley Bower, based in Irvine, Calif., makes its real money
managing apartment complexes in California, according to Jim Riley.
But it does a bit of investment on the side through the fund,
usually buying obscure and illiquid securities, often connected
with real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Now Riley Bower is offering to buy up to 4 percent of the 2.7
million outstanding Celtics debentures, issued as part of the
partnership's restructuring over the summer, for $8 apiece. The
catch: Those same debentures trade for about $12 each in the open
market. Don't laugh yet.
</P>
<P>
   When the Celtics' public partnership re-structured for tax
purposes, it exchanged old units for two new securities and $1 cash
per unit. Now those investors own new publicly traded equity units,
which is worth less than their old securities, plus debentures that
yield $1.20 a year per unit.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad deal, as it turned out. The old Celtics units traded
around $16 before the change. The new units were trading at 10 1/2
Thursday. Add the $1 per unit in cash and a $12 debenture unit and
the package is worth something in the range of $23 to $24.
</P>
<P>
   But most Celtics investors bought their units as souvenirs
instead of investments. The Celtics estimate they have 40,000
investors who own 10 units or less.
</P>
<P>
   Those tiny investor-fans could get about $12 each for their
debentures, but the brokerage commission would devour a huge
portion of the take. Why bother?
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Riley Bower offer gets more interesting. Small
investors could have their debentures tendered to the Depository
Trust Corp., an organization owned by brokerages, without the usual
commission.
</P>
<P>
   We're still not sure why a basketball fan with five units would
go to the trouble of cashing in his debentures for a mere $40, and
larger investors who want to sell are still better off going to the
open market.
</P>
<P>
   But it's clear why this offer makes sense for Riley Bower.
Celtics debentures purchased for $8 each would yield a nifty 15
percent. That's a slam dunk.

HAILED AS A HERO, KRAFT STILL SEEMS OUT OF PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ It was close to noon and people, most of them
men, were smiling and cheering. It was the happiest I've seen
politicians in a while. They almost made you forget that you were
packed in a room under a capitol building's golden dome, hanging
out with legislators in corny blue and gray suits.
</P>
<P>
   But if you could have exchanged those dull uniforms of political
America for more fashionable gear, you would have been correct to
argue that the Connecticut pols turned a press conference into a
concert scene. They got a glimpse of the day's hero, Bob Kraft, at
about 11:30 a.m. Thursday. They began to yell and applaud. I was
waiting for someone to flip on the instrumental version of Puff
Daddy's ``The Benjamins'' and work in some new lyrics that would
fit the Patriots owner.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Connecticut, Kraft will have Benjamins, or $100 bills,
spilling out of his pockets by 2001. He will have a new $350
million, 68,000-seat stadium here. He will have loot. He will have
cash. He will have bank. He will have cake. He will have paper. He
will have Dead Presidents. He will be able to float you a few
dollars and not have to worry about you paying him back.
</P>
<P>
   So he should have been happy as he stood at a podium, officially
announcing that he planned to move his team here from Foxborough
after the 2000 season. He should have been relieved that after
planning to spend $220 million of his own money on a stadium, he'd
been told by local lawmakers to relax because they were going to
pay for his dream home. Imagine what you would do if someone told
you that. Imagine how you would feel if Connecticut committed to
spending $600 million for your stadium and infrastructure costs and
all you had to give the state up front was $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Well, excuse me if I sound like a journalistic Judge Judy here,
but I looked into Kraft's eyes several times Thursday and he did
not look happy. He looked uncomfortable. He looked awkward at
times. He looked like a man who was worried about the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to cry,'' he said, long after his
cheering section had dispersed. ``I'm an emotional guy. To get a
response like that was a little overwhelming for me. I didn't
expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   I think something else was just as overwhelming and unexpected
for Kraft: The fact that he will have everything he wants _ in
Connecticut. Everyone who knows Kraft understands that he didn't
want it to come to this. He is a Boston man. He went to Brookline
High. He overpaid for the Patriots in 1994 to keep them from going
to St. Louis. He thought he could get some love from Massachusetts
because he had shown its residents love nearly five years ago. He
tried to build a stadium in South Boston. He wanted to investigate
building a stadium in Roxbury. He wanted to do something. In or
closer to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Hartford? Nothing against that city, but Hartford is the lover
that Kraft went to on the rebound. He was jilted in the romance he
truly wanted with Massachusetts and went running to Connecticut,
which would whisper nice things in his ear, let him vent about
House Speaker Thomas Finneran, and, of course, feed his bank
account. Hartford also is the home of the hobo sports fan, people
who swing from Patriots to Jets to Giants to Red Sox to Mets to
Yankees. If the Patriots win, they will have no problem filling
their stadium. If they win.
</P>
<P>
   No one in Massachusetts should be upset with Kraft for leaving.
And please, let there be no editorials about how this is another
example of a sports owner holding up a city for ransom to get a new
stadium. That was the case with the despicable Art Modell, who was
simply looking for a payday when he moved the Cleveland Browns to
Baltimore. That was the case when cash-obsessed owners Georgia
Frontiere and Bud Adams took their teams out of Los Angeles and
Houston, opting for St. Louis and Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The facts now are that Kraft offered to pay for the bulk of his
expenses (with no annoying personal seat licenses) and the state
couldn't accommodate him. That means the Patriots were not stolen
from Foxborough; they were dared to leave. They took the dare. When
they do leave, they will take about $1 billion in payroll taxes
with them over the next 10 years. Think about it: Their players,
coaches, and staff earn about $80 million in salaries right now. If
you add 8 percent interest to that over 10 years, you're talking
about $1 billion the state could have leeched for tax purposes. Not
now. That privilege goes to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft in Connecticut. It doesn't sound right. It doesn't look
right, either. Kraft did a few live shots with local television
crews and, several times, tried to persuade everyone that the
99-mile drive here won't be that bad when you compare the
soon-to-be-improved roadways of Connecticut to the makeshift
three-lane setup along Route 1 on Patriot game days. But he didn't
look right saying it. His team will now jump from last in NFL
stadium revenue to the top of the class. Apparently, money grows on
political trees in Connecticut. Kraft should be pleased about that.
He will also be 99 miles closer to New York, making the
Patriots-Jets rivalry even more intimate and intense. He should be
pleased about that, too.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't look it. While Connecticut politicians high-fived and
said they couldn't believe that Massachusetts couldn't come up with
a few million dollars to keep the Patriots, Kraft appeared to be
subdued. Some will say he sold out. I don't believe that. He could
have truly sold out long ago and taken the team 2,999 miles away to
Los Angeles instead of 99 to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   And yes. Hartford. Although you probably would have to pay me a
lot more than $600 million to live in Hartford, I am not arrogant
enough to say the little city on the Connecticut River is not part
of New England. Try getting that one by a sixth-grade geography
class. You can bring out all your Hartford jokes and mention how
the Connecticut State Police need to ease up on the radar, but the
fact is that legislators there came up with the cash when they
needed to. They may be small-time but they can now put ``Home of
the New England Patriots'' on all their ``Welcome to Connecticut''
signs.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, meanwhile, doesn't seem to be handling the role of
Connecticut messiah too well. He will be much richer in three years
than he is now. But privately, underneath all that cash, he'll
still be longing for Massachusetts. And in three years, with its
absence of Patriot cash, Massachusetts will finally long for Kraft.

WITH ECONOMY IN PERIL, HONG KONG PRESSES LEADER FOR VISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.  R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ A local pundit recently compared Hong Kong's
embattled chief executive to the captain of a ship in a storm. Yes,
he must hand out seasick pills, but he can't just reverse
direction. He must set a course and stay it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but there is widespread disagreement over the course he
should set. When shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa became Hong Kong's
first post-colonial leader 16 months ago, Hong Kong was a booming
business center and Tung was under pressure to maintain the status
quo. Today, with the Chinese territory reeling from Asia's
financial free fall, Tung is once again under pressure _ this time
to offer a radical new vision for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   This month, he was dealt an embarrassing blow when the
Legislature voted down a ``motion of thanks'' for the chief
executive's annual policy speech. The gesture amounted to a vote of
no confidence by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   With the local economy slipping from bad to worse, residents of
this traditionally laissez-faire financial center are looking to
the chief executive for hands-on direction. Last month's policy
address, critics say, was a squandered opportunity to prove his
leadership mettle.
</P>
<P>
   No one denies Tung has studied the problems; in his 2 1/2-hour
speech, he ticked off proposals covering everything from tourism to
Chinese medicine. But many say he has offered specific solutions to
small problems, while failing to inspire the public in a time of
crisis or make the government run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over leadership has echoes across Asia, where
financial chaos has undermined governments in Thailand, South
Korea, Indonesia, and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   For a man who has to answer to two masters, leaders in Beijing
who chose him and the people of Hong Kong, the challenge is to
forge a management style that satisfies both.
</P>
<P>
   Tung's speech ``demonstrated a lack of leadership,'' said Danny
Gittings, associate editor of the South China Morning Post.
``People wanted inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislator Emily Lau called his proposals, which came amid a
13-year high in the jobless rate, ``a rehash of what he said last
year'' even though ``the situation has changed drastically. She
voted not to endorse Tung's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Leong Che-hung, sponsor of the motion, said the vote was a
message that ``public confidence is hanging by a thread.''
</P>
<P>
   The disillusioned are people like Ho Wai-ming, 36, a computer
programmer who says Tung ``represents the business people, not the
little people,'' because he was handpicked by China and supported
by tycoons, not elected by locals. Ho said Tung's speech neglected
``rice bowl'' issues such as job creation.
</P>
<P>
   But others point out that the grandfatherly, 61-year-old Tung
has focused far more on the social-welfare issues of public
housing, education, and the elderly than his British predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   To those who say the chief executive lacks vision, his press
secretary, Au King-chi, counters that ``Mr. Tung's vision is to
have a compassionate, caring society. ... I think the community has
started to share this view.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey showed that while the public largely is unhappy
with Tung's speech, it is divided over the Legislature's rejection
of it, perhaps because few politicians have offered credible
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although only 20 percent of respondents were satisfied with
Tung's speech, 38 percent would have endorsed a ``thank you'' vote,
while 34 percent would not, according to the University of Hong
Kong's Social Sciences Research Center. The poll also showed that
despite unhappiness with the economy and daily harangues against
him on talk shows, support for Tung is at a respectable 58 percent,
down from a high of 70 percent in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Tung's defenders include Wu Yuk, a 68-year-old retiree, who
reasons that ``the financial crisis is everywhere. ... He's not the
only one to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Tung ``is not corrupt, he's honest,'' Wu said. ``What's to
criticize? The other parties should suggest some good ideas,
instead of proposing motions of regret and protesting all the time.
It's like one person planting the flowers while everybody else
keeps plucking them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the disputes lie in which flowers to plant and which
to pluck. Tung has received both praise and scorn for the
government's unprecedented stock market intervention in August,
when it spent $15 billion of taxpayers' money to buy shares to fend
off speculators. He also has been attacked from both sides after
proposing, then suspending, plans for 85,000 affordable-housing
units.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Cheung, a finance professor at City University of Hong
Kong, praises Tung for ``taking more initiative in the future
development of Hong Kong'' than Britain did. But he warns that Tung
should not become overinvolved. ``The right balance of
encouragement and intervention, maybe that's the right way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan Oi Ping, a 31-year-old accountant, is sympathetic to Tung
the man, but disappointed with Tung the politician. ``I know he's
hard-working and has his heart in the right place. But he's not a
good politician, he is not decisive, he is not a good
communicator.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan said the Legislature's decision not to endorse Tung's
speech is proof that lawmakers are paying attention and doing their
job. ``It's not shameful. It's just a sign of a democratic
society.''

INQUIRY SIGNIFICANT FOR WHAT IT DIDN'T FIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr says he had
concluded ``some months ago'' that President Clinton had no role in
the improper gathering of FBI files on Republican officials,
raising complaints from Democrats that Starr could have publicly
exonerated the president earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's admission is the latest fodder for Clinton's allies to
argue that the independent counsel, who is a Republican, has gone
out of his way to damage the reputation of the Democratic
president.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation, Thursday before a House panel considering
impeachment charges against the president, came as Starr also
acknowledged that his four-year, $40 million probe had turned up no
offenses by Clinton in two other matters: the Whitewater land deal
and ``Travelgate,'' as the 1993 firing of the White House travel
office staff has become known.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Whitewater, Travelgate and the 1996 appearance of
confidential FBI files at the White House spawned thousands of news
reports and put a cloud of impropriety over the Clinton presidency
almost from its start.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign that Starr would acknowledge that he had
insufficient evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton in the three matters
came Wednesday night, when reporters obtained an advance copy of
the testimony he gave Thursday to the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, under sharp questioning by Representative Barney
Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, Starr acknowledged that he had
known for several months that Clinton had no role in the diversion
of confidential FBI files to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In a testy exchange, Frank noted that Starr had omitted news of
the president's exoneration when he gave the House in September, a
few weeks before the Nov. 3 election, a 445-page report and 17
boxes of supporting evidence on the president's liaison with Monica
S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you withhold that before the election, when you were
sending us the referral with a lot of negative stuff about the
president ... and only now you give us this exoneration of the
president several weeks after the election?'' Frank asked.
</P>
<P>
   Starr responded that the Travelgate and FBI file investigations
are continuing, and his job is to give Congress evidence only of
possibly impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said: ``The silence with respect to anything else means
necessarily that we had not concluded ... .''
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, you don't have anything to say unless you have
something bad to say,'' Frank said, cutting him off.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's comments Thursday provoked criticism from Clinton
allies, as well as from those not in his camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been lots of allegations out there in the public
domain against the president on these issues, a continuing cloud of
suspicion,'' said James Kennedy, a White House spokesman. ``One has
to wonder why this exoneration didn't take place sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph diGenova, a Republican and former federal prosecutor,
said Starr should have publicly cleared Clinton earlier, though he
said the independent counsel was acting consistently with Justice
Department policy. ``Prosecutors have an ethical, moral duty to
show it when they are not going to bring charges, to put it on the
record,'' diGenova said. ``The Justice Department doesn't do it,
and it's outrageous. Independent counsels ought to do the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Craig Livingstone, a former White House security
official investigated in the FBI files case, said Livingstone had
been told about a year ago that he would not face criminal charges
in the matter. Further clearing Livingstone, Starr Thursday said
for the first time that he had no evidence of information from the
files being used for any ``improper'' purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Livingstone would have been more pleased if it had been
made public last year,'' said the lawyer, Randall Turk.
</P>
<P>
   In the Whitewater matter, Starr said he found no evidence of
impeachable offenses by Clinton, but he fell far short of
exonerating the president.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the independent counsel gave a lengthy recounting of
the dead ends he reached in investigating the president's actions,
and he implied that useful evidence remains to be uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Starr, in a surprising revelation, said that his office
late last year drafted an impeachment report for Congress on the
president's role in the complex land and banking deal. But he held
back the report for two reasons: He was not sure he had the full
truth from witnesses, and he still hoped at that point to obtain
evidence from several people.
</P>
<P>
   Starr suggested that evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton may still
exist. He noted that Susan McDougal, a partner of Clinton in the
Whitewater deal, was jailed for refusing to answer questions before
a grand jury. Among other things, Starr said, prosecutors wanted
her to testify about a $300,000 loan from Madison Guaranty Savings
and Loan of Arkansas, which later went bankrupt, that benefited the
Whitewater project.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to McDougal, longtime Clinton friend Webster Hubbell
may have important evidence about Whitewater, Starr said. He noted
that after Hubbell's 1994 resignation as US associate attorney
general, several companies and individuals paid him nearly $550,000
``for little or no work.'' Starr suggested the payments may have
been arranged by the White House in exchange for Hubbell's silence
on matters under investigation by the independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr gave mixed signals about when his investigations would
conclude. While telling Frank that the Travelgate and FBI files
matters were still under investigation, he suggested that both
could be closed soon.
</P>
<P>
   The travel office investigation ``is not terminated, but we
expect to announce any actions and decisions soon,'' he said. ``As
to the FBI files matter, there are outstanding issues that we are
attempting to resolve with respect to one individual.'' He did not
elaborate.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lack of any bombshell revelations in Thursday's
House impeachment hearing has reinforced the post-election
impression that President Clinton will survive the historic inquiry
and stay in office, legal analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Like a story unfolding in reverse, the House Judiciary Committee
hearing began after many members of Congress and other political
observers already had concluded Clinton has weathered the worst of
the storm. Former federal prosecutor Joseph diGenova, a Republican
and Clinton critic, Thursday called the case for impeachment
``over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they can enliven it,'' diGenova said, referring
to the Republican strategy for the impeachment proceedings. ``I
don't see any groundswell in the House for this.''
</P>
<P>
   DiGenova proposed that Republicans quickly drop the matter and
let Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr indict the president,
something many legal scholars say is not possible while Clinton
remains in office.
</P>
<P>
   For months, analysts have predicted Clinton would survive the
impeachment process ``barring any new revelations.'' Thursday,
several of these analysts said Starr lobbed no bombshells to change
their view. To the contrary, Starr announced that he did not find
impeachable offenses in his investigation of Clinton's action on
several matters, including the Whitewater land deal, the firing of
the White House travel office, and the use of FBI personnel files.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bizarre episode in American political history
because the conclusion has already been reached by Congress, and
they are in a sense going through the motions,'' said Bruce
Yannett, a former federal prosecutor. ``Absent significant new
factual information, nothing Ken Starr says will change the
result.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the Judiciary Committee outnumber Democrats and
are expected to approve articles of impeachment. It's less clear
whether the full House will move the process forward. The
impeachment vote is expected to be taken by the outgoing House,
which has an 22-seat GOP majority. The incoming House, which takes
power in January, has only an 11-seat GOP edge.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the most important target of Thursday's hearing may have
been a handful of moderate Republicans who don't sit on the
committee, such as Representatives Christopher Shays of Connecticut
and Connie Morella of Maryland. These swing-vote Republicans, who
have expressed deep reservations about impeachment, likely could
determine the outcome of the House vote.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Shays strongly indicated he would vote against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my judgment, the impeachable offenses were not proven, and
the proven offenses are not impeachable,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut congressman, who has long doubted whether
Clinton should be impeached on sex-related matters, noted that
Starr Thursday ``cleared the president of the potential high
crimes'' with respect to the FBI files, the travel office, and the
Whitewater land deal.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the House has the votes for impeachment, the Senate may
not. Senate Republicans had hoped they would pick up enough seats
in the midterm elections to convict the president, but the GOP
ended up with a status quo majority of 55-45, meaning that they
need 12 Democrats to join them in the two-thirds majority needed to
convict Clinton. Republican leaders have said that is not likely to
occur unless there are major new revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's hearing detailed a mass of evidence that Clinton
misled the public and may have committed perjury in denying that he
had a sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky. Indeed, many of
the basic facts of the case were not disputed by committee
Democrats, who instead spent most of them time Thursday attacking
Starr's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   But impeachment is a political, not a criminal, procedure. With
Republicans hurt by the Lewinsky case in the midterm elections, the
incoming GOP leadership is anxious to dispense with the issue
before the new Congress is seated in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly nothing to suggest that there will be a
twist at the end,'' said Laurence H. Tribe, a professor of
constitutional law at Harvard Law School. Tribe called Starr's
testimony ``a very skillfully packaged version of what we have
known the independent counsel is alleging. If anything, it was a
definitive announcement that no other shoe would drop in terms of
impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, however, argued that the
existing information was more than enough to warrant impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common sense and reality are conspicuously absent,'' said
Representative Howard Coble, a North Carolina Republican, noting
reports that some Republicans are anxious to ``wriggle out'' of the
Lewinsky hearings.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of revelations Thursday may have played into the
hands of Democrats. During the Watergate hearings in 1974, the
nation was riveted to a nationally televised hearing in which
revelations came daily, building the momentum to oust President
Nixon. By contrast, Thursday's hearing featured the testimony of a
second-hand source _ Starr _ with no sign that Lewinsky herself
will testify in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Starr and the committee members seemed anxious to
avoid dwelling on the lurid details that were spelled out in
Starr's September report, often focusing instead on technical
aspects of the law. The result was a lawyerly summation rather than
the sort of drama that has the potential to electrify the country,
as happened during Watergate and also with the testimony of Oliver
North during the Iran-contra hearings.
</P>
<P>
   DiGenova said he would not have called Starr as a witness. ``I
didn't need his testimony,'' diGenova said, adding however that the
independent counsel performed well and ``the Democrats didn't lay a
glove on him.''
</P>
<P>
   But diGenova said that as long as the public remains indifferent
about impeachment, the best thing for Republicans to do is to let
Starr try to indict the president on the grounds he cited in his
report _ perjury, witness tampering, and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go to trial on this any day,'' diGenova said.

LACK OF COMPUTER SPECIALISTS LOOMS AS CRISIS TO RIVAL Y2K 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer

<P>
   While fears of a global computer crash at the turn of the
century have commandeered the attention of the public, another less
visible, but equally dramatic problem, has been building quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Come the year 2000, there won't be enough people to support, run
and develop the nation's computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there is a national shortage of about 346,000 people
to fill information technology jobs at all levels from customer
support to programming, said Gord Stein, vice president of
marketing for CNC Global, a Toronto-based information technology
company with offices in Bellevue. The company helps provide both
permanent and contract workers for companies in search of
information professionals.
</P>
<P>
   But it's getting increasingly difficult to do, he said. The gap
has widened since last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Information Technology Association of America,
there was a shortage of about 191,000 people to fill jobs last
year.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of factors driving the demand, Stein said.
The Y2K (year 2000) problem has usurped a lot of talent, he said.
Many companies have cannibalized workers from other information
technology projects to prepare for the conversion to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the country isn't turning out as many trained
technology workers. In 1997, for example, the United States
produced about 26,000 university graduates in computer science,
compared with 48,000 in 1984. Enrollment in information technology
programs is flat or declining, Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid change in the industry also forces continued retraining,
he said. That means a certain segment of the information technology
work force is unavailable at any given time because the workers
have gone back to school to keep up their skills.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the demand for trained technical talent continues to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   Companies increasingly are turning to information technology to
give themselves a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   With their payrolls at historically lean levels, many companies
are focusing on improving profitability through increased
automation. For example, banks have moved away from in-person
transactions toward banking through computer, the Internet and
automatic teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   Many other industries, such as retailers, airlines and catalog
producers, have increased needs for information technology as new
ways of reaching customers.
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of industries _ cable, telephone, computers _
also is generating new information opportunities, Stein said. ``But
without the people to fill them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's putting pressure on companies to get and keep good
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening now, people are getting incredibly outlandish
signing bonuses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one computer company gives every new employee a BMW,
including the secretaries, he said. ``It's cheaper than having high
turnover.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a Silicon Valley company took out a full-page ad and
didn't get a single resume, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In that kind of climate, companies have to get creative, and
aggressive, about keeping the people they have, said Maria Walters,
manager of CNC's Bellevue office.
</P>
<P>
   She sees companies making many new accommodations for workers,
including letting them bring their pets to work, or offering
flexible hours.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that compete most effectively for scarce
information technology workers have learned to treat employees like
family, said Walters. ``They want to make it a whole environment.''
</P>
<P>
   That could mean anything from providing on-site day care, to
providing allowances for clothing, discounts on software or
well-stocked refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that attract and retain workers also have built a
team environment, said Walters. ``In the old school, sales people
were like God.'' Today, successful companies recognize that all
levels of information professionals _ from receptionists to
customer service _ are critical for success.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the work environment is more critical than salaries
for keeping those workers, Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a myth that you can throw money at people and make them
change jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Money is a ``hygiene factor,'' he said. If the money is not
competitive, it can be a deterrent for employees, but by itself
increasing pay won't guarantee increased success in keeping people.
</P>
<P>
   Stein paraphrased his own boss to explain why:
</P>
<P>
   ``People will quit a company,'' he said. ``But they won't quit
their family.''

STARR FAILS TO MAKE HIS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Republicans had put Kenneth Starr on national TV for two
hours before the last election, the Democrats could have carried
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Earth to Ken: Life is not a bar exam. Abstruse asides about
ethereal concepts such as ``inchoate criminality'' were sprinkled
throughout the case Starr presented.
</P>
<P>
   Is Starr the only man in America who doesn't understand why a
shifty gent with a roving eye would prefer not to be unmasked as a
horny hubbie groping a more-than-willing female subordinate?
</P>
<P>
   Where did they get this guy? The man leading the Republican
charge to crowbar Clinton out of office put his wares on display
yesterday before an occasionally dysfunctional House Judiciary
Committee and a national TV audience. Starr made an erudite,
detailed, elaborately constructed case. But good politics is not
necessarily good law.
</P>
<P>
   And by coming across as he did, it was another huge Republican
miscalculation. To put forward as the face of this Republican
Congress this unctuous, prissy, prosecutorial nit-picker further
erodes political support of a GOP leadership broadly discredited in
the recent elections. Water-tight case? Or bag-job for the GOP? My
initial reading on the day's events was that public opinion will
hardly move as a result of the Hammerin' Henry Hyde Show.
</P>
<P>
   If so, that would leave unchanged the basic 2-1 division of
public opinion against impeachment. Starr's elaborately crafted
snares to entrap a popular and twice-elected presidential lothario
amount to a mountain of trivia. The GOP's hired hitman came across
just as advertised: formalistic, evasive, tendentious, long-winded.
In short, the Starr-man is long on the innards of the law, but
short on his grasp of human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was tripping in Asia as Starr's bill of particulars
unrolled on Capitol Hill. The image of the heavy-breathing Arkansas
homeboy hugging Little-Miss-Eye-Makeup in the beret has now been
displaced by the image of a stern, professorial, pedantic,
argumentative lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The line score on the House Judiciary Committee's half-baked
unveiling of Starr's impeachment case, based on consentual sexual
encounters that everyone agrees stopped well short of intercourse,
is: nothing new beyond what is already leaked, exaggerated,
analyzed ad infinitum, digested by the electorate, and then
disposed of by the Nov. 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr slid before the microphone after a bitter half-hour
of partisan committee wrangling that left the hapless Chairman Hyde
tongue-tied, Starr abandoned his natural turf and entered the risky
Plain of Politics. Big Mistake, Kemo Sabe. When Starr is in court,
or in his lair, marshalling his hundreds of taxpayer-funded aides,
FBI agents, lawyers, consultants, technicians, public relations
specialists, and political counselors, he is operating from the
high ground, lobbing his tidbits, leaks, subpoenas, depositions,
and rubber-hose sessions to an omnivorous press corps.
</P>
<P>
   But once flushed out into the open, where he has to take return
fire, dodge live ammo, and expose his backside to the artillery of
his enemies, Starr is a lot less secure.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders, controlling congressional investigations
on dozens of fronts, had the opportunity with Clinton's objectional
behavior to make a substantial and dignified case for some sort of
formal rebuke of the nation's highest official. But they
overreached, as they seem always to do: shutting down the
government, toppling into the budget-busting pork tank,
nationalizing the House election campaigns with $10 million worth
of anti-Clinton advertising that backfired so badly.
</P>
<P>
   The election cost the GOP five House seats, the golden
opportunity to pick up any new Senate seats, and forced the
Republican Moses, Newt Gingrich, to walk the plank. Yesterday's
impeachment proceedings continue down that same self-destructive
path. It is a tribute to the political perspicacity of
Representative Bob Livingston, the Speaker-elect, that he sent an
emissary to Hyde this week reportedly warning the impeachment
chairman to end this charade before the New Year, in order to limit
the damage to the GOP's overall standing.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's lengthy explication of his impeachment case strung
together a complicated skein of witness interviews, presidential
press conferences, senatorial opinion-tossing on TV shows, stuff
out of the papers. In the newspaper game, it's called ``a clip
job'' _ a hastily concocted narrative based largely on all the
stuff you can lay your hands on at the moment that supports a
preconceived point of view.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr is no match for Clinton as a TV performer.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats cut him up some. The Republicans propped him up
some. Nothing happened to make Clinton suddenly impeachable. Bottom
line? Waste of time.

FINNERAN SCORES A TOUCHDOWN FOR MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If Massachusetts House Speaker Thomas Finneran would be
so kind as to donate his blood to science, we might find out what
special properties allow him to survive Staphylostadia.
Staphylostadia is that terrible affliction that sends politicians,
the same keepers of the coffers who tell low-income women that they
have to get off welfare in two years or else, into paralytic
delusions and slurred speech. Death comes as they mumble the
combination for state and city vaults to owners of sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran, so invulnerable to Staphylostadia that it makes you
wonder if he would be laughing with the roaches in a nuclear blast,
was utterly unnmoved even as Patriots owner Bob Kraft marched
toward his deal with the state of Connecticut for a $350-million,
publicly funded football stadium in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pleas from Governor Paul Cellucci and Senate President
Thomas Birmingham to keep the Pats in Foxboro, Finneran responded
by asking out loud, ``I'm going to give tax (breaks) to some
fat-ass millionare and screw our kids?''
</P>
<P>
   No, Hartford is. Kraft finally understood that Finneran would
not let Massachusetts be another victim of corporate welfare for
the National Football League, getting cities and states to divert
funds from schools to skyboxes.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft took his germs elsewhere. Connecticut fell ill upon
contact. Its politicians are promising gold, despite the fact that
stadiums, even the highly attended structures in Baltimore and
Cleveland, are massive money losers for taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be an agreement where the state loses
money,'' said Dean Pagani, spokesman for Governor John Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has already lost its common sense. In Massachusetts,
Kraft had already been forced to come up with private funds for a
new Foxboro stadium. But Kraft wanted more. The Senate offered $72
million in land and infrastructure. Finneran refused to go above
$57 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's wealth did not keep Connecticut from letting him play
welfare king. In the case of Hartford, Kraft should be ashamed of
how he has so twisted that city's priorities to his benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The $350 million stadium is twice the $184 million budget of the
city's public schools. In 1994, then Superintendent Paul Sequeria
pressed for funding by showing slides of crumbling schools. ``Look
at Hartford,'' Sequeria said. ``That's what happens when you
abandon your investment. What is destroyed is equal opportunity for
children.''
</P>
<P>
   No one listened. In 1996 a court ruled the Hartford schools to
be de facto segregated. The schools were taken over by the state.
Last year, the system's barebones finance department returned
$300,000 in federal education grants because the system missed the
deadline for spending the money.
</P>
<P>
   While Kraft will get a state-of-the-art field with highway
improvements, Hartford's school budget last year allowed for the
repair of only five of nine schools with leaking roofs. As to not
blow its budget, the air conditioning was turned off in the spring,
even during statewide achievement tests.
</P>
<P>
   Another school used the funds from a candy sale, funds normally
used for school functions, to purchase copier paper. While Governor
Rowland dreams of an autographed Patriots football for his office,
one Hartford school held a fundraiser so its golf team could buy
golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   While Connecticut gives Kraft a new house to keep up with the
Joneses, as in Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, the state this
summer announced that plumbing and bathrooms less than adequate in
13 of Hartford's 32 schools and heating systems less than adequate
in 17. To fully update its school buildings, the city needs about
$400 million, about the same as the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, Finneran will endure tremendous ire from Patriots
fans. In reality, the fans who can afford season tickets will still
find their way to Hartford, as sure as fans across the country
drive two and three hours to see their favorite college and pro
teams. Actually, the Pats being out of the Boston area means more
televised NFL games in Boston, benefiting far more fans of lesser
means.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger issue is that finally, a politician stood up to
Staphylostadia, the disease that has cities and states paying out
$7 billion over the next decade to house teams and their millionare
and billionaire owners. One would think Connecticut would know
better, having heavily subsidized the hockey Hartford Whalers only
to see the team bolt last year to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran told Dan Shaughnessy of the Globe, ``These owners gouge
our fans, overpay their employees, then the solution is to turn to
the taxpayer and say, `Save us from ourselves.' It just doesn't
pass a rational economic analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is about to rejoin that inglorious infirmary of
governments that promise that a team will spur an urban revival and
end up draining taxpayers of $10 million a year per city. If
Connecticut wants to fatten Kraft and screw the kids, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, it should not be forgotten that Finneran saved
this state from such an orgy. Rational analysis tempered feverish
delusion. Massachusetts has survived Staphylostadia, at least until
the Red Sox come calling for help for a new Fenway.

IN ALABAMA, THE DEBATE ON A COMMUNE RAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EMELLE, Ala. _ A black dog crouched under a hackberry tree
Thursday, guarding the ruins of a children's dormitory at this
religious commune where four of the smallest followers died in a
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the charred rubble of toys, beds, and baby food jars, tiny
red flags flapped quietly near a collapsed metal crib, each flag
marking where a body was found. The fire has been deemed
accidental, caused by a 10-year-old girl who knocked an electric
lamp onto bedsheets, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The flames are out, but criticism is more persistent than fire.
Attention paid to Tuesday night's blaze has reignited complaints
about the commune called ``Holyland,'' and its leader, Luke
Edwards, known as ``The Bishop.''
</P>
<P>
   Condolences over the loss of two boys and two girls, ages 3 to
5, were quickly replaced by charges that tragedies were inevitable
on this rural 54-acre site Edwards calls sanctified land of
salvation and entreprenurial spirit. Detractors call it the
headquarters of a mind-controlling cult built on fraud and
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, the 72-year-old Edwards responded to
critics with resolve and indignation, in a voice heavy with grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fire has hurt us deeply because the heartbeat of what we
are doing is to protect our children,'' Edwards said. ``We are
proud people, we are a strong people, we are bound together by the
word of God and we will overcome this. It will be a struggle, but
we've been struggling all our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly three decades since Edwards took over a church 40
miles west of here in Meridian, Miss., he and several hundred
followers _ many of whom were once welfare or food stamp recipients
_ have established a broad assortment of businesses valued in the
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The properties held by Holyland's corporate arm, Reach Inc.,
include three motels; two restaurants; a convenience store, and gas
station; a meat processing plant; a ranch with more than 200
cattle; a feedlot with another 100 head of cattle; a hog-raising
operation; a strip mall; and 4,000 acres of land, said Denise
Chapman, a Holyland resident who serves as office manager.
</P>
<P>
   The operations also include a farm that raises ostriches and
emu, a single-engine plane, and a limousine service with five cars,
including a shiny white stretch limo that was parked near the
entrance to Holyland Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman said Reach also recently built new housing for Holyland
members, including what she described as a ``mansion'' for senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we're a cult. But if we were, you couldn't come in
that front gate like you did. We're wide open to the world. We see
ourselves as a family,'' said Chapman, who said she moved here 18
years ago to escape drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Racism, she said, plays a role in the criticism: ``People think,
`How can so many black folk get along so well without killing each
other, people who were drug users, from all different places,
except if somebody put something crazy in our heads.'''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards began amassing business enterprises in the early 1970s,
winning permission from government agencies to open a collective
food pantry where his parishioners could use their food stamps.
Success was immediate, and he plowed the profits back into the
operation, eventually opening a grocery store that was later sold.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Edwards' communal vision, all wealth and belongings
are shared by Holyland members. Borrowing an idea from the Israeli
kibbutz system he has never seen, Edwards requires that adults live
separately from their children, who are cared for largely by
unmarried women and teen-age girls. Some 56 children, nearly half
under the age of 6, lived in the 180-foot-long, barracks-like
building that burned to the ground Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-acre Holyland compound also includes a school for grades
K-12, a preschool, a clinic, and single-unit housing for married
couples. Edwards and his wife live in a double-wide trailer on the
property.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said the purpose of all his business enterprises and his
communal teachings is to allow his followers to provide for
themselves, rather than taking government handouts, and to teach
their children the value of hard work and business skills such as
how to run a motel or work on a ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a group of Pentecostal people who love the Lord and
are trying to do some things to change the way of life that the
black man has chosen _ not as a whole but too many _ depending on
the federal government and anything of that nature to survive,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Edwards' critics say he has built an empire out of something
akin to slave labor. They charge that much of the income comes not
from entrepreneurial hard work but from members' city-by-city
panhandling, a practice known as ``The Route.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing holy about that place,'' said Obie Clark,
president of the NAACP in Meridian. ``When a man twists the
Scripture and twists people's minds and makes them believe their
only way to salvation is through him, not through Christ, then it's
a cult, and that's what he has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he was an early supporter of Edwards' preachings of
self-help for poor blacks, even setting up a meeting that resulted
in Edwards' purchase of the grocery store. But that support turned
to opposition when Clark began hearing complaints from Holyland
followers about children put to work and families torn apart.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said state authorities' lack of interest in the welfare of
blacks has been Edwards' biggest ally. ``I just know in my mind,
knowing the governments of Mississippi and Alabama, if these where
white children and families, the system would not tolerate it,''
said Clark.
</P>
<P>
   One of Edwards' daughters from his first marriage, Brenda
Garris, has also criticized her father publicly as a power monger,
as have a number of former Holyland followers. One, Phillip
Williams of Meridian, said he spent 10 years there before leaving
in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They claim they give you economic independence and freedom,
but that's a lot of crap,'' Williams said Thursday. ``Most people
who leave that organization leave empty-handed. I think that's why
a lot of people stay. They don't want to go out of there without
something to show for their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Branch, vice president of the Watchman Fellowship in
Birmingham, a Christian organization that monitors cults, said his
organization began reviewing Holyland about six years ago upon
hearing complaints from Edwards' daughter and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He engages in deception, manipulation, and exploitation of
people in the name of religion,'' Branch said. ``Luke Edwards has
these people working for him in all these businesses that he owns.
They're all led to believe they all own it, but they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the US Labor Department levied $43,500 in fines for 82
illegal child workers at Holyland businesses. A state investigation
cited Holyland for 129 child-labor violations. Edwards said those
violations resulted from innocent mistakes, and Holyland now
follows all labor guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in a day now when people use these kind of
things to deal with complaints about us,'' Edwards said. ``If 5
percent of what people are saying about us is true, then we have no
law enforcement in this country. How could we do this, being black
especially, when we are lowest ones on the totem pole, if we were
doing anything wrong?''

CONVERTING TO MUTUAL FUND IRA SEEMS APPROPRIATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 22, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am now 41 years old, in the military service, and due to
retire in four years with a monthly income of $3,000. My wife is
now 37 years old and was just recently hired at a new job with a
$64,000 annual salary. She was enrolled in a former employer's
401(k) plan, and has a $7,995 balance, of which $1,165 is in an
aggressive strategic allocation fund and the balance in a
fixed-interest fund. She plans to save $500 a month until she
qualifies for her new employer's pension plan. Our only other
savings is a $10,000 CD paying 5.5 percent interest. Our goal is to
retire at age 65 with at least $800,000. Do you have any
suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   R.S., Oceanside, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's put it this way: If you continue as you have been
doing, with less than 15 percent of your retirement savings in
stocks, you will need to contribute $1,163 a month to achieve that
$800,000 target in 24 years. On the other hand, if you moved
entirely to stocks, you might cut that contribution level to $649 a
month. Does that difference sound sufficient to make you willing to
accept the risks of the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   To make those calculations, I assumed an average annual total
return of 6.5 percent for a portfolio that's dominated by money
market holdings and similar investments, and I presumed a verage
total returns of 10 percent for a stock portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly on the stock side, these are the kind of
assumptions that can certainly look pretty iffy if you have a
relatively brief time horizon -- say anything under ten years. But
when you stretch the time horizon out to 24 years, you can put a
lot of confidence in the stock market. You can be confident that in
such a period it will go through some sickening slides, and
confident as well that the upturns will more than compensate for
the slides.
</P>
<P>
   Thus I suggest you roll the 401(k) money into a mutual fund
rollover IRA, putting about half of the money into a solid
large-cap fund such as one which seeks to track the Standard and
Poor's 500 Index. I would divide the balance evenly among an
international stock fund, a small-cap stock fund, and a health care
sector fund that concentrates on health care equipment and
pharmaceutical issues rather than on health care delivery
companies. (Fidelity Select Health Care and Vanguard Specialized
Health Care funds are two excellent examples of the kind of fund I
have in mind.) As for your wife's savings until she is able to join
her current employer's retirement savings plan, I would put the
first $2,000 a year into a separate IRA account (a Roth IRA if you
can afford to pay the taxes on the money now) and the balance into
a variable annuity plan with a mutual fund company. Variable
annuities are basically mutual fund accounts with a tiny dollop of
insurance added on top. The tiny dollop, which tends to eat about
1/2 of 1 percent of the expected returns annually when compared to
a similarly-invested traditional mutual fund account, is just
enough to allow these investments to qualify as tax deferred
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Once your wife qualifies for retirement savings with her new
employer, you can consider whether you want to transfer the
rollover IRA into that plan or leave it as it is -- that option
will be open to you as long as you do not make contributions beyond
the initial rollover amount.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 65 years old, single, and have $150,000 in cash from a
real estate sale in September. The money is now in a money market
account earning 5.25 percent, but I would like to transfer the
whole amount to something such as a Vanguard mutual fund. The
Vanguard Star fund was suggested by a very conservative friend.
From this money, I will need to retain $5,000 to $10,000 of the
money for emergencies. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   R.B., Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The Vanguard Star fund doesn't seem to get a lot of respect
from writers such as myself, but in the end I suspect that it's
more because it's fairly boring rather than that it doesn't do what
it was designed to. Vanguard Star is a fund of funds, calculated to
provide one-stop shopping for an investor who wants a conservative
balanced portfolio and doesn't want to spend a lot of time
analyzing or tracking different funds.
</P>
<P>
   Currently the fund holds 62 percent stocks and the rest of its
assets are in bonds and other fixed-income holdings. Its stock
assets are spread among a half-dozen of Vanguard's stock funds --
Windsor, Windsor II, U.S. Growth, Morgan Growth, Explorer, and
Primecap. On the fixed income side, it holds Vanguard Long-Term
Corporate Bond fund and Vanguard GNMA. While I would set up a
different portfolio to achieve similar goals, there's no question
that Vanguard Star has a long-term record of delivering the goods.
Over a decade it has produced average annual total returns of 12.72
percent; over five years, the figure is 13.78 percent. In this
year's choppy markets, it has demonstrated the virtue of its
conservative approach, producing a 7.0 percent year-to-date gain
entering this week, compared to a 6.5 percent gain for the average
domestic stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   So certainly Star has built a solid record, and indeed it should
get more respect than it does. But the bigger question is whether a
fund with 62 percent stocks is right for you.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly you should make no such investment unless you're
fairly sure you'll be able to leave the money alone for at least 10
years. Second, you should hesitate if you are the kind of person
who will worry or get upset if you find that your $140,000
investment is suddenly worth less than $130,000 -- because when you
have 62 percent stocks, that's certainly the kind of thing that
could happen.
</P>
<P>
   If it were my money, and if I were fairly leery of putting too
much money into the stock market, I think I'd build my own
Star-like fund, adopting more conservative principles. I'd put 40
percent of the money into Vanguard GNMA fund, and 20 percent each
into Vanguard High Yield Corporate Bond, Vanguard Index Value, and
Vanguard Small-Cap Index funds. Such a portfolio would reduce your
stock market exposure to 40 percent, and boost your yield from the
3.1 percent of Star to 5.04 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, whether to go with Star of Hooker's Star-like, I'd
suggest you use dollar cost averaging, which is a technique for
spreading investments out over the course of several years, seeking
to protect yourself from sudden market downturns. If you went with
Star, I would start with a $4,000 investment in the fund, putting
the other $136,000 in Vanguard Prime Money Market fund with
instructions to transfer $4,000 a month to Star. If the money fund
averages a 5 percent yield, that would get you fully invested in a
little more than 366 months. On the other hand, if you decide to go
with Hooker's Star-like, I would go ahead and make the entire GNMA
and High-Yield bond investments right away. I'd then make the
$3,000 minimum initial investments in Index Value and Small-Cap
Index, putting the remaining $50,000 in the money fund. You could
then move $750 a month to each of the two stock funds, again
becoming fully invested in about three years.

THE STARR CHAMBER VISITS THE REPUBLICANS' COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There were only three reasons to watch
Thursday's House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearing.
</P>
<P>
   _ To collect a day's pay _ that's my excuse.
</P>
<P>
   _ To see how dumb the Republicans in Congress are.
</P>
<P>
   _ To see if special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's professorial cool
would crack.
</P>
<P>
   I had to sit through eight hours of excruciating legalese before
it happened. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., nailed Starr with a
multipart question.
</P>
<P>
   After asking Starr when he knew about Linda Tripp's tape,
Lofgren delivered the sucker punch: ``On Page 36 of your statement,
you said, `We go to court, not on the talk show circuit.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it true, Mr. Starr, this very morning you were on `Good
Morning America'? Isn't that a false statement under oath?''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who hadn't missed a semicolon until then (yes, you could
hear the semicolons) began fumbling. He asked to hear the question
about the tape again. ``I will have to search my recollection,''
Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren asked if Starr would be willing to return and answer
under penalty of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, we never found out whether perjury about talk
shows is indictable _ you know, like perjury about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Starr makes a terrible television star, but he was perfectly
cast for a $40 million ennui-a-thon.
</P>
<P>
   He was RoboLawyer, soft on the outside and subpoena cyborg on
the inside. He was the nice, quiet guy you never thought would do
anything like that. He was the professor whose course you took for
one day, then dropped for something easier. He was the kid who was
picked on at recess, the one whose mom made him wear rubbers on
damp days, the one who was never chosen for the team.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has the dirt on the popular kid, even if no one cares.
</P>
<P>
   Starr spoke slowly and precisely, slightly drawing out words. I
don't know if this was for emphasis or to make the impeachment
process last even longer.
</P>
<P>
   He numbered and lettered his thoughts. He never used
contractions.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to questions, he used words like ``inartful,''
``perjurious'' and ``germane.'' Where Monica Lewinsky would break a
sentence with ``like, I mean,'' he'd say ``shall I say.''
</P>
<P>
   The only emotion he showed was when he argued with David
Kendall, Clinton's lawyer, about who had done the most leaking to
the news media. It was like an argument between the Lusitania and
the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's presentation was legally impressive, if you didn't know
he was talking about pizza deliveries gone wrong. Too bad we heard
all the stuff about cigars and presidential hot lines months
before.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to follow that with the goody-two-shoes act.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons should be very, very scared, though. This is the
prosecutor you never, ever want to have on your case.
</P>
<P>
   If lawyers are sharks, this is the great white one who'll chase
Bill Clinton right onto the beach in Martha's Vineyard in
retirement. Impeachment isn't in the cards, but Starr will chase
Clinton through the courts until he gets him for anything _ even
unpaid traffic tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Starr noted that federal law specifies up to five years
imprisonment for perjury, and then spoke the words Clinton probably
heard even in Japan: ``As the Supreme Court stated in a 1993 case,
`The framers recognized that most likely there would be two sets of
proceedings for individuals who commit impeachable offenses _ the
impeachment trial and a separate criminal trial.'''
</P>
<P>
   But you know what? Americans don't care. Let Clinton do time in
Danbury. At least we don't have to play the impeachment game
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The game was rained out by the voters two weeks ago, even if
Starr is still in right field wearing his rubbers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The kangaroo impeachment hearings would be scary if they meant
anything.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats on the committee opened with a resounding attack
on the unfairness of the proceedings _ specifically the
micro-moments allotted to the president's lawyer and allies to
respond to grave charges.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Melvin L. Watt, D-N.C., said the president was being
railroaded. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said the president
was being gagged and bound. She compared it to the literal gagging
and binding of Bobby Seale in the trial of the Chicago 8.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 40 minutes, it almost looked like the hearing
would be interesting. Then Starr began his near-seamless drone, and
later all too many Republicans got to talk.
</P>
<P>
   They all kissed up to Starr, congratulating him on surviving
demonization by the Democrats. They read quotes from late Watergate
prosecutor Leon Jaworski that would support Starr, just as
Democrats read Jaworski's lines that would condemn Starr.
</P>
<P>
   One toady Republican even read back part of Starr's opening
statement, just because he found it such a powerful document.
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to a question from a Republican was from Rep.
Mary Bono of California, who had trouble reading her script: ``How
difficult is it to do your job when you're up against this
onslaught?''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said it was difficult, and said he was glad she asked the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Me, too. It made me realize how glad I am the people took charge
of impeachment proceedings on Election Day.

THE MILLENNIUM BUBBLE IN THE CHAMPAGNE BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just two days ago I reported how Pope John Paul II is preparing
for the millennium. Now, here's how you can prepare for Jan. 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Buy your champagne now.
</P>
<P>
   This is what you need to know. There are three grades of real
champagne, from the Champagne region in France: nonvintage blends,
vintage, and tete de cuvee (top of the cask) _ the really good
stuff like Dom Perignon, Pol Roger, and Cristal. Champagnes are
released five to seven years after bottling, and, unlike still
wines, do not improve with age. Some of the prod-uct from the
legendary 1990 vintage first went on sale this year, and it is
flying off the shelves. ``Everybody wants to celebrate the
millennium with a champagne that has a zero on the end of it,''
says George Bardis, wine buyer for Martignetti Liquors. Starting
next year, he predicts, champagne prices will rise 20 to 30
percent, ``and the tete de cuvee 1990s you won't even find.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. ``We're all taking price increases on January 1,''
says Kathleen Cornelia, regional manager for Perrier-Jouet and Mum
champagnes. As for the deluxe 1990s, ``we'll be out of them pretty
shortly,'' she confirms. What about the supply of 1990 blends and
vintages? ``That's up in the air,'' she says. ``After all, who has
lived through a millennium before?''
</P>
<P>
   And remember: only 407 champagne shopping days till the
millennium!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
God and man at BU
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it just a few weeks ago that I was prattling on about
Boston University becoming the nation's ``premier liberal arts
university''? And now this ... &UR;  &LR;  Here's the skinny on the latest
byzantine maneuvering over at SilberWorld. After three years of
negotiating, the School of Theology and the university's religion
department thought they had landed a prize catch for their Religion
and Literature program: Jack Miles, the Harvard-trained Bible
scholar who won the Pulitzer Prize for his 1995 book, ``God: A
Biography.'' Not only had they reeled in Miles, they had the moolah
to hire him; professors Robert Neville and Ray Hart scored a
$600,000 grant from the New York-based Henry Luce Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The hire was proceeding normally. Provost Dennis Berkey had
attempted to land a BU job for Miles's wife, and referred the
California couple to the relocation firm BU uses for senior
appointments. Then Something Happened.
</P>
<P>
   What happened, the divines explain, is that my friend
Christopher Ricks put the shiv to Miles. Hart had arranged for
Miles to meet English professor Ricks _ the brilliant, donnish, and
militantly antireligious devotee of T.S. Eliot and Bob Dylan _
during a campus visit. The meeting occurred on Sept. 17, the day
the Globe published an op-ed piece by Miles, ``Forgiveness for Our
Prodigal President.'' The article (``He has confessed to us. We
must forgive him. There is no other way'') rubbed Ricks the wrong
way. ``I thought it was a very bad piece,'' says Ricks, who
declines to say with whom he shared that opinion. ``Internal
discussions shouldn't be newspaper stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, c'mon, Chris _ lighten up! I'm told that Ricks tipped off
his pals, BU chancellor John Silber and prexy Jon Westling. BU
spokesman David Lampe says, ``John Silber made it clear in writing
that he would not interfere with the decision,'' washing his hands,
as it were, of the troublesome Miles.
</P>
<P>
   You know how one thing leads to another. Suddenly Berkey is
telling Miles he isn't welcome. ``We have decided not to proceed
with a formal offer to you,'' says Berkey. ``Following your campus
visit, I told you that there had arisen unanticipated skepticism
about the appointment. Initially this seemed to have been
stimulated by your op-ed piece, which appeared in The Boston Globe
the very day of your visit.'' Then Berkey complains that there
might be ``fit'' problems for Miles at BU, blah blah blah.
</P>
<P>
   Miles has moved on. He's writing, and has a job at the J. Paul
Getty Trust. I wonder how the Luce Foundation feels about its
$600,000 investment, now that it sees how the game is played at
what Silber likes to call the Third Great University on the
Charles? For the nonce, they're standing firm. ``The foundation
made the grant to BU,'' a spokesman says. ``It's their business
whom they select.''

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ How often do you get a chance to talk with Bugs
Bunny, Daffy Duck, Plucky Duck, Ralph Kramden, Grandpa Lou Pickles,
Don Knotts, the brother from ``Out of this World,'' Jack Lemmon,
Yosemite Sam, Marvin the Martian, Sylvester and Tweety all at once?
</P>
<P>
   In the same room? In the same person?
</P>
<P>
   Meet Joe Alaskey, voice actor and impressionist. The man hears
and speaks voices, lots of voices, all rumbling around in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please add I need help,'' Alaskey said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   He's kidding. Alaskey has his act together, and the acts of Mel
Blanc, David Doyle, Jackie Gleason and other memorable voices.
Alaskey is best known as a voice actor, bringing characters alive
in a studio. While lucrative, the job does not come with the
trappings of Hollywood fame.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tough job, one made more confusing when you take over
the voice of an existing cartoon character. When you are doing a
Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck known to several generations, you are not
only doing the character, but also replicating the voice of the
person who originally played him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intimidatin' ain't da woid, Doc,'' Alaskey answers in a
perfect Blanc-as-Bugs. ``It's like bwain soigery. Ya have to
rememba all da tings Mel did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doubly hard,'' Alaskey says later, as himself, ``to get
into the skin of another actor.''
</P>
<P>
   This season Alaskey took over the role of the irascible
narcoleptic Grandpa Lou on the runaway animated hit ``Rugrats'' on
Nickelodeon, after David Doyle (best known as Bosley on ``Charlie's
Angels'') died in March of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Alaskey stars as Grandpa Lou in ``The Rugrats Movie.'' The movie
could be like the show, a cross-over hit with adults and kids, even
though it's about, as the tormenting 3-year-old character Angelica
likes to say, ``a bunch of babies.''
</P>
<P>
   A former stand-up comic and impressionist on the Boston circuit
(his Don Knotts is very good), Alaskey moved to California in 1986.
For four years he was Beano Froelich on the syndicated ``Out of
this World,'' a mediocre teen sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1969 LaSalle Institute graduate, while still doing
on-screen work (he can be seen now as the guy giving cookies to the
man in a body cast in the ``Got Milk'' commercial), has focused his
career on being heard, not seen.
</P>
<P>
   He has become one of the main supplier of voices for Warner
Brothers characters (the movie ``Space Jam'' excluded). He also
does voice-overs of actors. For example, in the mid-1980s he
impersonated Jackie Gleason so some Ralph Kramden lines could be
dubbed into some lost episodes of ``The Honeymooners.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaskey, who is single and lives outside of Burbank, is also the
guy to call when curses have to be dubbed out of movies so they can
air on television. You would be surprised how often Jack Lemmon
cursed in ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' or how many times Alaskey has to
say ``forget you'' to replace more offensive dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Alaskey can also be heard as Tweety and Sylvester in MCI
commercials which feature Michael Jordan. In addition to ``The
Rugrat Movie,'' Alaskey can be heard in the films ``Forrest Gump''
(the voice of Richard Nixon) and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?''
(Yosemite Sam).
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to approach acting voice-first,'' he explained.
``It's like acting for the radio. You have to put your whole
performance into your voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is where Joe Alaskey has also put his career.

UNFINISHED PINE HARD TO KEEP CLEAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 22, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have a very old cobbler's bench I use for decor. It is
unfinished, dingy and dirty, but a little shiny where the old
cobbler sat. How can I clean it? I tried Fantastic, and a lot of
dirt came off, but it still looks pretty tired.
</P>
<P>
   MARY RAUCHER, Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Unfinished wood will not only take on dirt but it will be
ground in as well, making cleaning even harder. Continue using the
Fantastic. Or, try paint thinner, which might dissolve more dirt
and will not raise the grain as water will. That is the best you
can do; it would be a sin to varnish it or to sand it. It is more
valuable unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My new porch is made of pressure-treated wood, and now the 4
x 4 posts are cracking, and there are cracks in the floor boards.
What can I do about them?
</P>
<P>
   MARY, Dorchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You can't do a thing about those posts. Anything bigger than
a ``2 by'' (2 x 6, 2 x 8, etc.) will crack, indoors or outdoors,
because the wood expands and contracts as it takes on and loses
moisture, and wood cannot take much of this without cracking. With
pressure-treated wood, the situation is aggravated because the wood
is green (full of water) when it is installed, and when it dries
out, whap! cracks appear. So live with the cracks in the post.
</P>
<P>
   The floor boards are another matter; such boards do tend to
spall (lose little shards of wood), splinter, split, and crack. The
cure there is to seal the wood with a wood sealer, which will make
the wood water resistant and less liable to spall, splinter, split,
and crack. The trouble with the sealer that it has to be reapplied
every year or two.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to a clear sealer is semitrans-parent stain,
which will give the floor a color and will last longer, three to
five years. And since it is too cold to apply sealer or stain now,
wait until spring.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I noticed some peeling around the eaves of my house that I
just had painted. I called back the painters, who said it was not
peeling paint but squirrels chewing on it. Now what can I do?
</P>
<P>
   CAROL PERRY, Duxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I smell punky wood. Squirrels love to find ways into warm,
dry attics, but usually will work on punky (soft) wood that is just
beginning to decay. No use chomping on sound wood; that is a lot of
work.
</P>
<P>
   If that is so, the painters should have noticed it, because
paint will not stick well or for long on such wood. Their excuse
was interesting, but they should have mentioned that soft wood
before they painted it.
</P>
<P>
   Your ownly choice, in my opinion, is to replace the fascia (the
facing board of the eave) and possibly the soffit (the under part
of the the overhang (eave). This will not only allow paint to stick
properly but also deter the squirrels, which will eventualy find
their way into the attic if the punky wood remains.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a built-in tiled seat in my tiled shower stall with a
nice bull-nosed edge. Trouble is, some of the bull-noses have came
loose. Even more trouble, they later tightened up and are no longer
loose. What can I do in case they become loose again? If I reset
them, should I use caulking between the tiles, or grout?
</P>
<P>
   KATHY STARK, Newtown, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I suspect the tiles are set in a mud job, meaning they are
set in mortar rather than with adhesive. They may have tightened up
so they do not move perceptively, but they are still loose. And if
they did loosen originally, some of the grout might be broken up.
</P>
<P>
   As long as they are tight to the feel, you can probably live
with them. But you can do this now or when they do loosen up more.
Lift them carefully, scrape off mortar from the backs of the bull
noses and some off the surface they were mortared to. Scrape off
any grout remaining on the sides of the bull noses and any on the
original surfaces. Reinstall the bull noses with thin-set mortar, a
strong, grout-like mortar that will hold wonderfully, and can be
applied in thin layers. If the replaced bull noses set higher than
their neighbors, remove more of the mortar surface. The replaced
bull noses should line up with their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   After a day or so, apply grout to the joints. If the joints are
very narrow ( 1/8 inch or narrower), apply sandless grout. If the
joints are wider, install sanded grout. To answer one of your
questions, do not use caulking between the tiles; grout works much
better.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The metal casters on my kitchen chairsripped the sheet vinyl
floor. Can I put one of those clear plastic office chair mats on
the floor to protect it? I can't put nylon glides on the chair
legs.
</P>
<P>
   HELENE FISHER, Stoughton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, but a carpet would look better and give equal
protection. Or, check the caster to make sure they move well enough
to roll rather than plow up the vinyl. Or, install new casters that
work; you could also get rubber ones that would be much gentler.
</P>

O'BRIEN MUST FIND THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One game left in a losing season, his second in two years at the
helm. Not the best resume for a college football coach, but that is
what Boston College's Tom O'Brien is facing as he prepares his team
for Saturday's season-ending game at West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The question that must be asked is one that former New York City
mayor Ed Koch used to make essentially a campaign slogan: How'm I
doing?
</P>
<P>
   Good question. Is BC football better than it was a year ago?
Unless the Eagles pull off an upset in Morgantown, the record would
suggest: Not really.
</P>
<P>
   1997 record: 4-7, with wins over West Virginia, Rutgers,
Pittsburgh, Army. Quality wins: probably just West Virginia. Near
misses (losses by 7 or fewer points): Temple, Miami, Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   1998 record: 4-6, with wins over Georgia Tech, Rutgers, Temple,
and Pittsburgh. Quality wins: just Georgia Tech. Near misses: Navy,
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Records in October: 1997 _ 0-4; 1998 _ 0-4.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the difference?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with this season's near misses. The Navy and Notre
Dame games came down to a matter of inches. One wide field goal
attempt against Navy and one more inch forward by Mike Cloud
against Notre Dame, and the Eagles would be playing for their
seventh win Saturday and a better bowl bid instead of wrapping up
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at injuries. The Eagles were decimated, especially on
defense. By the crunch-time games against Syracuse, Miami, and
Notre Dame, O'Brien was so deep in his defensive backfield depth
chart that the Eagles probably had to introduce themselves in the
huddle.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you can make some second-guess judgments about play
selection, such as running Cloud all those times in the Virginia
Tech and Notre Dame goal-line-stand situations.
</P>
<P>
   You can question O'Brien's conservative approach in some of his
game plans, his gambles in other situations.
</P>
<P>
   But that's ticky-tacky stuff.
</P>
<P>
   If you look ahead to next year, you see a recruiting class that
may be the class of the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   Having said all of that, it also seems obvious that there must
be some sign of progress next season or it will be fair to question
whether O'Brien is a right fit.
</P>
<P>
   Right now there isn't a doubt in anyone's mind. Nor should there
be ... at this time.
</P>
<P>
   But another 4-7 season next year cannot be _ and should not be _
explained away. All good programs find ways to overcome adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is O'Brien's turn.
</P>
<P>
   No one snickers anymore when BC football is mentioned. The
gambling scandal is history. Top-notch recruits are listening when
O'Brien and his staff come calling.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens Saturday, it will not be a winter of
discontent at The Heights. There are too many positives around.
</P>
<P>
   Tom O'Brien is a good man. He is the right man for BC. But his
grace period is now over.
</P>
<P>

   Some people are saying that the Big East is getting a free ride
in having its champion receive an automatic berth in the Bowl
Championship Series bowls. Looking at the latest rankings, it's
hard to argue: The Big 12 has five teams ranked higher than the
highest Big East team (Miami, at No. 24), and the Pacific 10, Big
Ten, and Southeast Conference all have four teams ranked higher
than Miami. The Big East champion is one of six league champions
guaranteed a slot in the BCS games ... Auburn interim coach  &UR; Bill
Oliver  &LR; has told people that he will retire if he doesn't get the
job on a permanent basis. ``I'll go hunting, do some fishing, play
golf, or whatever,'' said Oliver. If Oliver's team can beat Alabama
Saturday afternoon, he'll most likely ``whatever'' himself right
into the job. Beating Alabama is always the No. 1 requirement for
an Auburn coach ... A Wisconsin win over Penn State Saturday would
be the Badgers' 10th this season. No Wisconsin team has ever won 10
regular-season games ... Here's the way the Big Ten Rose Bowl bid
is going to work: A Michigan win over Ohio State Saturday would
give the Wolverines the berth; an Ohio State win and a Wisconsin
win would give the Badgers the berth because of the tie-breaking
last-appearance rule. The only way Ohio State can make it to
Pasadena would be to beat Michigan and have Penn State beat
Wisconsin. The Buckeyes would win the tiebreaker over the
Wolverines because they won head to head and also because Michigan
went more recently (last January) ... I saw a newspaper report
listing the athletic earnings of schools in the Big Ten. According
to the report, Minnesota had a profit of $4.2 million to lead the
conference, while Indiana, with a profit of $7,761, and
Northwestern, with $0 profit, were on the bottom.
</P>
<P>

He's at a loss
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've got to admire Nebraska tight end Sheldon Jackson's
approach, despite an 8-3 record, the most regular-season losses for
the Huskers since 1976: ``I believe the best team in the country
has three losses and it wears an `N' on its helmet,'' said Jackson.
Hmm. Could he mean 6-3 North Carolina State, which has beaten
Syracuse and Florida State? That is more more than Nebraska has
done; the Huskers can only count their victory over Missouri as a
quality win ... So the Huskers are 8-3? From 1993-97, they were a
combined 60-3 ... Kansas State coach  &UR; Bill Snyder  &LR; reversed a
mistake when he relented and made quarterback  &UR; Michal Bishop
 &LR; available to the media on Tuesday after barring him from talking
to reporters for a month, including after K-State's 40-30 win over
Nebraska. Snyder compounded the error by giving special access to
Sports Illustrated, which prompted some local writers to feel that
Snyder had taken an elitist attitude. Snyder apologized on Tuesday
... Speaking of Bishop, don't be surprised if this happens: Texas
running back  &UR; Ricky Williams  &LR; winning the Heisman Trophy as the
best player in the country, but not being voted the best player in
the Big 12. Bishop might win that award.

   Big East bowl situation looks like this. The winner of next
weekend's Syracuse-Miami showdown (providing the Hurricanes won
their game against Pitt last night) is the BCS representative. The
Syracuse-Miami loser probably winds up in the Gator Bowl, while
Virginia Tech goes to the Insight.Com Bowl. It looks like West
Virginia will get a spot in the new Music City Bowl against a team
like Alabama ... Notre Dame would become a Big East factor if the
Irish don't make it into the BCS bowls. In that case, the Irish
would go to the Gator Bowl and everyone would move down a notch ...
More bowl news: It looks like Florida can earn a BCS at-large slot
even if the Gators lose to Florida State Saturday. At 9-2, the
Gators would still be more attractive to the Sugar and Orange bowls
than any other at-large team ... The same can be said about Notre
Dame. Word has it that even if the Irish lose one of their last two
games _ Louisiana State, at Southern California _they are going to
a BCS game.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Robert L. Kraft has finally found what a number of
NFL owners are finding with regularity, and with much less effort _
a city willing to pay a substantial price to host his team.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to what Kraft was offered to keep the New England
Patriots in Massachusetts, the tentative agreement he struck
Thursday to move the team to Hartford is enormously generous, but
far from unusual. Across the country, NFL owners _ and owners of
other sports franchises _ have been able to call the tune while
communities do all they can to join the dance.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the context of a national building boom in sports
stadiums and the pitched, costly battles among cities to attract
professional teams, the deal Connecticut officials are using to
lure Kraft is merely one in a growing line of incentive-laden
packages funded almost entirely by public dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the direction in which all of these deals are headed,''
said Robert Caporale, a lawyer and partner in Game Plan Inc., a
Boston firm involved in negotiating several stadium deals.
``Someone else pays for the stadium, and the owners of the team get
all of the revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, St. Louis, Jacksonville, and Tampa, among other
cities, the story has been the same _ new stadiums built for
hundreds of millions of dollars to attract NFL franchises, but with
comparatively small contributions from the owners. The city of
Birmingham, Ala., is so intent on getting an NFL franchise that it
recently agreed to fully finance construction of a $280 million
stadium on the mere prospect that the Minnesota Vikings might move
there.
</P>
<P>
   For the owners, the deals hold out the promise of steady revenue
streams from luxury boxes, naming rights, concessions, and parking.
For the host cities, the economic payoff appears much less certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a purely financial perspective, I do not know if it makes
sense,'' said Mark Rosentraub, a professor of public affairs at
Indiana University, who specializes in public expenditures on
professional sports and vigorously opposes the current trend. ``But
the fact of the matter is that everyone that successfully attracts
an NFL franchise is doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   In return for moving the Patriots to Hartford, keeping the team
there for 30 years, and returning 10 percent of ticket receipts to
the state, Connecticut has pledged to build a 68,000-seat stadium,
including 125 to 150 luxury boxes and club seating, at a cost of
$280 million. According to a list of NFL stadium rents compiled
last month by Street &AMP; Smith's Sportsbusiness Journal, the 10
percent figure would amount to one of the lowest rents in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft will keep the remainder of ticket revenues as well as
profits from concessions and parking. Like other stadium deals
around the country, the Hartford package would also give Kraft
revenues from other events staged in the stadium as if he owned it
himself.
</P>
<P>
   While Kraft would have to pay $50 million to build a hotel for a
planned Hartford convention center, $20 million for an NFL
entertainment complex, and $5 million for a sports training center,
he would operate all three venues and could profit significantly
from the revenues they earn.
</P>
<P>
   The only other major expense Kraft would risk is cost overruns
on the construction of the stadium. Under the prospective deal,
Kraft would have to pay for cost overruns because of design
changes, while the state would be required to cover overruns
resulting from construction delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, on its face, appears to be Christmas early,'' said Larry
Moulter, chief operating officer of Woolf Associates in Boston, who
is generally credited with bringing the FleetCenter to Boston.
``This, on its face, appears to be Santa, the elves, and all of the
other gift givers all wrapped up into one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at this in Massachusetts terms, it appears to be
the ultimate giveaway,'' Moulter added. ``If you look at this in
terms of the NFL, it is simply what a community pays to get an NFL
franchise. That doesn't make it right, that doesn't make it wrong.
It's just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the deal should enhance the Patriots's value. Kraft
bought the team in 1994 for $170 million _ at the time, the most
ever paid for an NFL franchise. With the Cleveland Browns franchise
sold by the league three months ago for a record $530 million, it
is clear that the value of the Patriots has risen. With a new
stadium in Hartford, observers say, the Patriots franchise could
now be worth $300 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stadium enhances the whole thing significantly,'' said
Michael Megna of Megna Valuations in Milwaukee, which estimates the
value of sports franchises. ``A beneficial stadium deal like that
can make all the difference in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the financial benefits to Hartford and the state of
Connecticut, a spokewoman for Governor John Rowland said the state
will release a report next week by KPMG Peat Marwick outlining the
economic advantages of the Patriots deal. But those familiar with
NFL stadium deals say that the monetary payoffs for host
communities are often relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports teams have an enormous cultural primacy; they are
culturally central,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College
professor who writes frequently about the business of sports. ``But
they don't have an economic presence that is anything like that.
They essentially have almost no anticipated revenue. They may have
a small positive impact, or a small negative impact, but basically
it is a wash.''
</P>
<P>
   For Connecticut and Hartford, the intangible benefits of landing
the Patriots _ the cachet and community pride of hosting a
professional sports franchise _ may be far more valuable than for
Massachusetts and Boston, home to three other major professional
teams. Hartford is still smarting from losing the Whalers, the
National Hockey League team that was the state's only professional
sports franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some sports teams do bring a tremendous sense of excitement, a
sense of cohesion and a dynamism that tends to galvanize a
community,'' Zimbalist said. ``The Whalers did not really do that
for Hartford. Time will tell if the Patriots do.''
</P>
<P>
   That Massachusetts is poised to lose one of its teams is bound
to be greeted with a sense of betrayal and resentment. Some
officials and businessmen made great efforts to try to keep the
team here, through a succession of owners.
</P>
<P>
   One person who might genuinely feel betrayed is Chad Gifford,
chairman and chief executive of BankBoston, who is a veteran of
attempts to keep the Patriots in Massachusetts. Kraft and Gifford's
banks have done a lot of business over the years, and when it came
time to buy the Patriots in 1994 and keep them from perhaps moving
to St. Louis or somewhere else, Gifford put together the huge
financial deal that garnered Kraft, the hometown guy, his hometown
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Boston resident and so from that point of view, I am
saddened. To me, it's a bit of a blow,'' Gifford said. ``But we do
have business in Hartford, and at BankBoston so many of my
associates are celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have, I have, a long history of dealings with the Krafts,''
he said. ``So, no, I do not feel betrayed at all. We _ and I
really, really mean we _ have tried very hard to keep this team
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are such a great city. Maybe we're a little too selfish.
We're a little parochial. And we are all to blame for this, to some
extent.''

MOVIE AUGMENTS INVASION OF THE `RUGRATS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Rugrats'' is one of those cartoons adults hang around to watch
long after the kids have wandered out of the room. But before the
holiday season is over, you'll come to the realization that, even
if you wanted to, there is no escaping these animated toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon is already wall-to-wall ``Rugrats,'' 19 half-hour
episodes a week on the cable channel. Now comes ``The Rugrats
Movie,'' an entertaining film version with enough inside adult
humor for mom and dad, and potty jokes for the 6-year-olds, to
guarantee repeat holiday business.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the ``Rugrats'' work is point of view: The stories
are told through the eyes of the kids (ages 1-3) and their
simplistic but clarified takes on the world. Their lives, while
filled with mystery, make sense in a warped way. It's the adults
who are clueless.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, the Pickles family grows with the arrival of
Tommy's little brother, Dylan (Dylan. Dil. Get it?). The
surrealistic birthing scene is worthy of Tim Burton, yet is still
suitable for young viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of the colicky little bro' throws the status quo of
the household, and Tommy's view of the world, into chaos. The
solution to the rest of the gang (Chuckie, Phil, Lil)? Get rid of
Dil.
</P>
<P>
   But Dil and the gang are all together on a wild joyride that
leaves them lost in the woods. The only way back, in their minds,
is to get to a distant house, where ``the Lizard lives.''
``C'mon,'' they say, ``we're off to see the lizard.''
</P>
<P>
   Just another tidbit for the adults. In addition to ``The Wizard
of Oz,'' look for references to ``The Fugitive,'' ``All Dogs Go to
Heaven,'' ``2001: Space Oddysey'' and a great sendup of ``Raiders
of the Lost Ark,'' where a giant boulder hurtling toward the kids
turns out to be the stomach of Tommy's pregnant mom.
</P>
<P>
   Three-year-old Angelica, aided by the family mutt Spike, also
gets lost in the woods as she sets out in search of not the missing
babies, but Cynthia, her doll. Eventually, the two lost parties,
and frantic searchers, will hook up, but not before the toddlers
deal with a host of dangers real and imagined, accentuated by their
close-to-the-ground perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this is a touching little story of the balancing of
responsibilities and sibling rivalry. Those lessons learned far
outweigh skeptics' cries of the precocious tykes like Angelica
being negative role models.
</P>
<P>
   At 87 minutes, ``The Rugrats Movie'' is close to the right
length for such a film. However, young viewers used to 30-minute
doses of Tommy, Chuckie and the gang may be squirming before the
closing credits.
</P>
<P>
   A parental warning is warranted here: While ``Rugrats'' targets
itself at the 2-11 age group, kids under 3 _ and anybody still
freaked out by the flying monkeys in ``The Wizard of Oz'' _ will be
scared by some of the scenes in the movie. Then again, the idea of
a bunch of toddlers lost in a dense forest overnight might be too
much for some parents.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you can't escape the ``Rugrats'' now, prepare to
truly bunker down. Because while the movie will be omnipresent in
advertising and theaters, it won't compare to the merchandising
push that is already flooding the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the regular cast of voices from the television
show, cameos include Tim Curry, Whoopi Goldberg, David Spade and
Buster Rhymes. The music is provided by Mark Mothersbaugh, late of
the 1970s new wave group Devo.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, look for the sound track at a store near you.

HOW COULD THE CURTAIN FALL ON `RAGTIME' PRODUCER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As attempts are being made to rescue the Boston tour
date for ``Ragtime'' in January from the financial woes of the
producing company, the questions mount about how such a
high-profile organization could fall so far so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Livent, though, has been living on the edge since its inception.
Few theatrical ventures have followed the credo, ``You have to
spend money to make money'' as lavishly as its founder and deposed
creative director, Garth Drabinsky. When the bills came due he
saved Livent from going under by bringing in Michael Ovitz, the
former head of the Walt Disney Co. to invest $20 Million. According
to Ovitz, when he got a closer look at the books Drabinsky and his
partner Myron Gottlieb had spent far too much money to make far too
little money and is now suing them for cooking the books.
</P>
<P>
   This could, of course, be part of an Ovitz power play to rid
himself of a partner, as Drabinsky is claiming, but the sense in
the theater community is that Drabinsky has been living on borrowed
time.
</P>
<P>
   While that may be true, it all proves another adage: Hindsight
is 20/20. While Livent was turning out hit after hit _ ``Phantom of
the Opera,'' ``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,'' and
``Show Boat'' _ it seemed as if the Canadian and his company were
reinventing the way Broadway does business. He spent huge amounts
of money on advertising, enriching the coffers of both this
newspaper and its parent company, The New York Times. As a result,
enough of a buzz was created around ``Ragtime'' that it could
survive the negative reviews in the Times.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Drabinsky tried to establish a vertically integrated
company, building theaters like the beautifully remodeled Ford
Center for the Performing Arts, which houses the New York
production of ``Ragtime.'' Even more costly, he spent the company's
own money to mount productions rather than seeking outside
investors.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Livent's shows were successful, things were in decent
shape _ but not much more than decent. ``Joseph,'' for example, had
a successful run in Boston, but sources in the theater community
think he barely covered expenses. Drabinsky has been proved right
about the wisdom of strong promotion campaigns, but the sense is
that you don't have to spend nearly as much as he did. ``Ragtime''
is reportedly selling very well in Boston, but so is ``Titanic,''
which is spending a fraction of the money on advertising. And when
a show isn't a hit _ like the Broadway revival of ``Candide'' from
a couple of years ago _ that was Livent's money going down the
drain.
</P>
<P>
   There is something depressing, though, about all these
I-told-you-sos coming from Drabinsky's competitors, like Rocco
Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters. Little has been said
about the quality of the work that Livent produced under Drabinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom'' and ``Joseph'' may not be anything more than
standard Broadway fare, but ``Ragtime'' has been such a success for
more reasons than advertsing. Drabinsky stayed true to the spirit
of E.L. Doctorow's great novel by bringing in Frank Galati of
Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre to direct it, Tony-winner Terrence
McNally to write it, to choreograph it. The musical has proved to
be a launching pad for Audra McDonald's career and Drabinsky took a
chance on little-known songwriters Stephen Flaherty and Lynn
Ahrens, who paid dividends with the soaring melodiousness of the
score.
</P>
<P>
   Would Ovitz, Disney, or Landesman have taken such a chance on
``Ragtime'' or ``Parade,'' about the lynching of Leo Frank, which
opens in New York next month? And for all the negative reviews of
``Candide,'' it was a thoroughly creditable attempt to give the
high-spirited combination of Leonard Bernstein's music and several
lyricists, particularly Richard Wilbur, another chance with a
Broadway audience. (As was noted on the recent PBS Bernstein
special, the original couldn't reconcile Lillian Hellman's dark
political allegory with Bernstein's upbeat music.)
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for Drabinsky there would never have been a
``Ragtime,'' at least not one of such quality. No one concerned
with strong musical theater should feel anything but sorrow that
Drabinsky's empire turned into a house of cards.

SCHOTTENHEIMER SHOULD BE SACKED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - That sound you heard Monday night was the door
slamming on the most overrated coach in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Schottenheimer, who has long tortured fantasy owners with
his schizophrenic game plans and senseless substitutions, should be
on his way out after the Chiefs' meltdown on national television
against the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   After that performance, Schottenheimer's shelf life will be
shorter than Monica Lewinsky's ``tell all'' book. (What possibly
could be left to tell? That they had anchovies on the pizza?)
</P>
<P>
   On top of everything else, he shows up at the press conference
sobbing. Crying? There's no crying in football.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Schottenheimer has won plenty of regular-season
games but always found a way to lose in the playoffs. That's
because his players aren't in the game long enough to get their
uniforms dirty.
</P>
<P>
   His running-back rotation is something out of junior high
school, where every kid gets to play. He's ruined just about every
running back he's touched. This may explain his acquisition of Bam
Morris, who is pre-disastered.
</P>
<P>
   Schottenheimer apparently played in the days when they taught
you to use your head _ as a battering ram. His game plans are like
Shakespeare's plays.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody gets killed in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of ``Monday Night Football,'' is anybody else tired of
announcer Al Michaels whining about fan polls that call for a
quarterback switch? For two weeks, Michaels has railed against what
he calls ``goofy'' polls _ after one such survey targeted his
sacred 49ers and Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels is laboring under the delusion that football is some
sort of separate nation-state that exists outside the realm of the
fans and the media. That we should simply be happy to watch every
Sunday and keep our big yaps shut.
</P>
<P>
   Last time I checked, if not for the ``goofy'' fans, there would
be no football. The NBA has disappeared, and I was careful to note
that the sun still rises in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the fans have a right to call for a quarterback switch,
even if it's plenty dumb. Some guys in my section at the Cardinals
game Sunday actually started chanting for Dave Brown in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   I think they were kidding. Dave Brown is to quarterbacks what
Spam is to fine dining.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad to see Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin is still chairman of
the standing ``Let's miss the playoffs'' committee. How else could
you explain his opposition to the no-huddle offense, which only
produced the most passing yards (begin ital) ever (end ital) by an
NFL player in Sun Devil Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   The no-huddle definitely would increase Jake Plummer's fantasy
value. He seems comfortable in that setup, and the defensive
linemen get all tuckered out chasing him around.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what do I know? All I see are the touchdowns, the
hundreds of passing yards, the team marching up and down the field
like the University of Arizona band.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure there's a downside. Like, if the Cardinals score too
many points, Tobin might run out of room on that clipboard he keeps
hugging.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Plummer's one-game revival could also increase the
fantasy value of Frank Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Tobin goes to the flying wedge. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tip of the week &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I like Giants running back Gary Brown to have a nice game
against the Eagles. After their thrashing by the Redskins on
Sunday, Ray Rhodes is a lame duck, and the Eagles are being sold to
the Colonel. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kerry ``Tom'' Collins emerged from jail to lead the Saints over
the Rams, so he might be a nice pickup. Redskins wide receiver
Albert Connell seems ready to break out. Now that the Oilers are on
a roll, take a look at wide receiver Willie Davis. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
One-hit wonder &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week, it's ``Touchdown'' Tommy Vardell of the Detroit
Lions. Vardell is a nice player inside the 5-yard line, but Sunday
night's three touchdowns were a fluke. &QL;

WITH MCKELLEN, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A WHALE OF A TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
GODS AND MONSTERS 
Written and directed by: Bill Condon (based on Christopher Gram's
novel, ``Father of Frankenstein'') 
Starring: Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, Lynn Redgrave, Lolita
Davidovich, Kevin J. O'Connor, David Dukes 
Running time: 105 minutes 
Rated: Unrated 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' is a flawed biopic with a brilliant
performance by Ian McKellen as British director James Whale, who
went to Hollywood and elevated ``Frankenstein'' and a few other
horror movies from genre claptrap to poignant studies of sensitive
noble savages. The psychodrama that writer-director Bill Condon
puts onscreen in an effort to skirt the usual fictionalized biopic
route is frankly less interesting than the events of Whale's life,
which ended when his body was found floating face down in his
Pacific Palisades swimming pool in 1957, a la ``Sunset Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few stilted World War I trench warfare inserts and
some boyhood flashbacks from Whale's grim childhood in grimy
Dudley, there's little emotional contact made with his formative
years, such as, for instance, the fact that he began acting while a
German prisoner of war. The traumatic loss of his comrade and lover
during the war never comes to us as felt knowledge, despite
McKellen's fondling of a war souvenir gas mask. Nor does the
bitterness of the boy yanked out of school and sent to work in a
factory when he was 14, despite a narrowing of the eyes as
McKellen's Whale recalls, ``Hate was all that kept me going.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Whale went on to act in ``Journey's End,'' the
British antiwar play that launched his Hollywood career when he
journeyed there to direct the film version. But of these seminal
events in his life there is virtually nothing. Most of ``Gods and
Monsters'' takes place in the weeks before Whale's death. Returned
home following a stroke, his frail condition leaves him only enough
strength to ogle boys and meet life with a sense of mischievous
style.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing, and what we feel the absence of, is the
interesting stuff that happened before Whale's terminal state. We
want details of his life over its full span. Instead, we get
gamesmanship with his dumb, hunky gardener played with more than a
hint of ``Frankenstein'' earnestness by a boxed-in Brendan Fraser.
Although the mind games Whale plays with his gardner and sometime
model are more complex and labyrinthine than homosexual come-ons,
they comprise too slender a conceit on which to hang the narrative.
The ``Frankenstein'' resonances and parellels are disappointingly
pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
   A meatier look at Whale's interesting career would have provided
more sustenance than this fictionalized speculation, which, like
``Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,'' provides brief glimpses of
actors appearing as notables _ Boris Karloff, Elsa Lanchester,
George Cukor, Elizabeth Taylor, Princess Margaret and the like. A
far from immediately recognizable Lynn Redgrave, avoiding
sentimentality, is first-rate as Whale's caring Hungarian maid. And
Fraser provides all the galumphing earnestness one could hope for
as the rudderless and homophobic ex-Marine brought to a boil over
Whale's manipulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' is most on target when it comes to
conveying how lonely and isolating life in LA can be, especially if
you're regarded as a has-been. And it really is a treat to watch
McKellen's arsenal of feline subtleties and listen to his
sophisticated inflections. His balancing of face-saving snobbery
against physical and emotional vulnerability reminds us how
entertaining it can be to savor a master at work. Ironically,
McKellen gives us just enough of Whale to make us wish he had been
provided with enough material to give us more.

ALLEN'S `CELEBRITY' ONLY SKIN DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
CELEBRITY 
Written and directed by: Woody Allen 
Starring: Kenneth Branagh, Judy Davis, Joseph Mantegna, Leonardo
DiCaprio, Winona Ryder, Charlize Theron, Famke Janssen, Bebe
Neuwirth, Hank Azaria, Melanie Griffith, Michael Lerner 
Running time: 113 minutes 
Rated: R (language, sex and some drug use) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Celebrity'' is Woody Allen's ``La Dolce Vita.'' Where
Fellini's film opened with a statue of Christ being flown over Rome
by a helicopter, ``Celebrity'' opens with a burst of Beethoven's
Fifth on the soundtrack and a plane skywriting ``HELP'' over a
Rockefeller Center fashion shoot. Allen's alter ego on this
occasion is Kenneth Branagh, as a blocked novelist who turns to
journalism and then, given the weakness of his character, chases
and sucks up to the celebrities he writes about in the ever more
desperate hope that he can insinuate himself into their exalted
world.
</P>
<P>
   Given his lack of any solid center, it's not surprising that he
should drift from woman to woman to woman, too, unable to make up
his mind, but drawn by the aura of celebrity. Spurred by midlife
crisis into dropping his drab English-lit teacher wife (Judy Davis,
in jangly repressed mode), he segues from Famke Janssen's editor to
a one-afternoon stand with Melanie Griffith's adenoidal actress to
a (literally) crashing evening with a stunning model played by
Charlize Theron, who's willing to be amused by him, but not
seriously inconvenienced, to a chase after Winona Ryder's actress.
</P>
<P>
   Both Griffith and Theron (especially the latter) are more
interesting to watch than Anita Ekberg was when she pranced through
the Trevi Fountain in ``La Dolce Vita.'' Fellini's point, of
course, was that La Dolce was anything but Vita for Marcello
Mastroianni's leaf-in-the-wind journalist and Fellini surrogate,
Guido. But there are a few significant differences between
Mastroianni's Fellini figures and Branagh's ambitious but unfocused
journalist, Lee Simon.
</P>
<P>
   Mastroianni loved playing weak men, and he was always able to
project alongside the weakness a gentleness and refined sensibility
that suggested something noble gone astray. Branagh and Allen _
mostly the latter _ have simply made a wrong aesthetic decision
here, and that is to have Branagh essentially impersonate Allen.
Branagh does a great Allen, but that in a way compounds the
problem. We hear Allen (who, after all, put the words in Branagh's
mouth), but we see Branagh. It's as if Branagh is doing a party
number, and it's distracting.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, I think, rightly sensed that he can no longer play
variations on his own persona in his films (he's great in ``Antz,''
where we can hear but not see him). He's too old, and these days
brings a little more baggage than his usual hapless schlep roles
can bear. When he tries to be tough on himself, as he did in
``Deconstructing Harry,'' it comes out too sour. He hasn't put a
sympathetic spin on his persona since ``Everyone Says I Love You.''
He'd have done himself _ and Branagh _ a big favor by having
Branagh speak in any voice but Allen's.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this miscalculation, ``Celebrity'' _ which has some
funny stuff, even some hilarious stuff in it _ never quite jells.
Much has been made of Allen's prescient casting of Leonardo
DiCaprio as a rising young star who trashes his hotel room and
behaves boorishly _ riffs, I'd have thought, on Johnny Depp's
headline-grabbing trashing of an Upper East Side hotel room a few
years ago. DiCaprio brings both subtlety and vividness to the young
hotshot Branagh's journalist self-servingly chases so he can hustle
a film script he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the few episodes that gathers comic resolve and will,
the journalist allows himself to be swept into the star's entourage
as they fly a private plane to a fight in Atlantic City. After a
night of debauchery, Branagh wakes up to find he owes the actor
$6,000. Meanwhile, Davis's discarded wife undergoes a pilgrim's
progress through several layers of New York silliness before
meeting a solid and reassuringly ethnic family-oriented TV producer
played by Joe Mantegna. One thing leads to another, although
Davis's way of distrusting love and remaining poised for flight
represents one of the film's successful balancings of comedy and
pathos.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, ``Celebrity'' is at its best when Allen does quick
hits, my favorite being a TV talk-show greenroom stuffed with
skinheads, Ku Klux Klanners, a rabbi, a Mafia don, and a hooker.
Bebe Neuwirth's scene in which Davis's character goes to her for
sexual advice and is put through the paces with a banana would
probably be puerile even if it didn't arrive in the wake of
Monicagate. But Neuwirth's matter-of-factness makes her character
one of the few that actually seems a worker in what is often called
the sex industry.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Janssen and Ryder shine briefly as the women being
ushered out of and into the journalist's rootless life. As he
drowns in the glitz to which he becomes addicted, Branagh's
journalist seems to vanish before our eyes. Quite likely this was
Allen's intention, but this sad fake's progress is curiously
lacking in impact and affect. Despite Allen's familiarity with the
territory, and not infrequent moments of comically connecting with
it, ``Celebrity'' seems, finally, a misfire.

<P>
   CHARLESTOWN, Mass. -- To the millions of viewers of MTV's Real
World Seattle, which came to a close this week, David has been the
passionate, streetwise hunk with the thick Boston accent, a smart,
swaggering guy's guy with a thing for black leather jackets and
hair gel, the guy with the puppy dog grin who threw fish for a
living, and had his big ``haht'' broken in a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   But to the young people of Charlestown, MTV's David is David
Burns, 22, a local kid whose loving, single mom raised him in the
Bunker Hill projects, the bright, outgoing townie who escaped on a
tennis scholarship to Virginia Military Institute, a man so local
he knows who murdered his friends, but will never tell.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the Tavern on the Water, where David's pals watch the Real
World each week, and you realize he's also much more than a
reality-based soap opera star. He's the handsome, funny homeboy who
has shown the world to Charlestown, living proof of the
possibilities life can hold, no matter where you're from.
</P>
<P>
   As David hiked across Nepal, Charlestown went with him. As he
relaxed in the Seattle jacuzzi, so did many an impoverished kid who
has watched a parent search the sofa cushions for lunch money. And
as white David fell madly and publicly in love with a black woman,
the oft-maligned white community of Charlestown grew, and learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave's more like the real us than anything you see in the
papers,'' said Mike Santosuosso, who has known Burns since they
were 10 years old. ``He's just a good, smart kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, David has come home again, with a modeling contract from
the Ford agency, and Harvard graduate school on his radar screen,
drawing an obvious comparison everywhere he goes: ``He's like Good
Will Hunting, with a difference,'' said Tom Desmond, Burns's
mentor, tennis coach, and father figure. ``The difference is that
Will Hunting was fiction. And David is real.''
</P>
<P>
   David, from a cell phone in the Baltimore airport en route to
Boston after speaking at a college in Florida, said Tuesday that he
hears the comparison to the Matt Damon character all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one sense, I'm flattered,'' he said. ``I think that
screenplay is symbolic, that everyone can do something with their
lives, that every kid has the potential to be great.''
</P>
<P>
   The real David Burns arrived 22 years ago, born to a Charlestown
native named Karen Burns, then 17, at St. Elizabeth's hospital in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   David's father has been mostly absent since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never paid child support or anything,'' said Karen Burns,
now an electrician with Home Depot. ``It was just me and David
against the world. That's exactly how it felt. But where a lot of
kids might hate their dad, David has never said anything negative.
He prays for his father.''
</P>
<P>
   While David's father stayed away, his mother worked full-time,
studied to be an electrician at night for five years, and struggled
to give her son a loving home in the Bunker Hill housing
development. Her mother and two sisters watched him when she wasn't
around, and while ``we may not have been rich, we never lacked for
love or humor,'' said Karen.
</P>
<P>
   David's outgoing personality and quick wit were apparent to his
mother when he was 2 years old. ``He used to do comedy skits for
me,'' she said. ``I'd be sitting in the kitchen and he'd come in
and make me laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Though money was tight, Karen found enough to send David to
parochial school. In their free moments, Karen and David would go
fishing together on the pier, or go out to dinner, which Karen made
sure they did once a week, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up together,'' Karen said. ``We had a lot of fun.
That's what they didn't show you on the Real World. They edited
everything so it looked like David had a terrible childhood. He had
it rough, I'm not going to lie, we weren't rich, but you don't need
money to have love, and we had a lot of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the show, Charlestown often comes across as a dangerous
ghetto. It's the one thing young people in Charlestown say they
resent about David's visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was all bad, like a slum of Boston,'' said Kelsey
Barrett, 13. As she spoke, her friend Brenda Black, 10, listened,
then objected.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's all true,'' she said. ``I see people doing drugs
around here all the time. All he did was tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett frowned. ``I know,'' she said. ``But he shouldn't go
around saying it on national TV.''
</P>
<P>
   David knows about the criticisms, and is hurt by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one thing I really want people in Charlestown to
understand,'' he said. ``I took MTV all over Charlestown for two
days. I showed them the Monument, my best friend's son's birthday
party. I took them to the Boys and Girls club. I walked them all
over town. We did hours of interviews. I'm proud of being from
Charlestown. I'm so glad I grew up there. I love the people there.
And in the end, all they showed was a dumpster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``TV plays up the rags to riches story,'' David added. ``Like
every kid in Charlestown, or Southie or Dorchester, I flirted with
trouble. And I got over it. But TV really dramatized it because
they had a white kid from the projects _ ooooh _ and they
overplayed it. The Real World is run by rich white men, and that's
not the real world. The real world is I had a very strict mother,
and by the grace of God I was lucky enough to go to college, and
I've been lucky to travel, which has spawned a world of
opportunity. I've been to Israel, the Czech Republic, Paris,
Morocco, I've touched Mount Everest.''
</P>
<P>
   David said traveling opened his eyes to the stupidity of racism.
``If there are any racists left in Charlestown, it's because
they've never left Charlestown,'' he said. ``But I don't think
you'll find many anymore. It's not the '70s.''
</P>
<P>
   Desmond, David's mentor, believes that his ultimate contribution
to Charlestown will be in helping change stereotypes _ both of
Charlestown, and, in some cases, those held by people in
Charlestown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's helped get rid of the mislabeling these kids in
Charlestown have been stuck with about racism,'' said Desmond. ``I
told David he can contribute to the race issue more than anybody
else, because if any white kids identify with the urban black
experience of poverty and projects, it's kids in Charlestown.''
</P>
<P>
   Desmond, an accountant who volunteers with youth, met David when
David was in the eighth grade at St. Catherine's School, and
stopped by the first tournament in Desmond's Charlestown Against
Drugs tennis program for disadvantaged kids.
</P>
<P>
   Through the tennis program, David said, he began to realize his
potential. His skill at tennis landed him a partial scholarship to
the Virginia Military Institute after he graduated from Pope John
High School in Everett.
</P>
<P>
   David expects to graduate from VMI in May. He's living with his
mom in Everett for now, because the courses he needs to graduate
are not offered until January. In the meantime, he is taking some
classes at Harvard Extension School, and making plans for
post-graduate life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take some years off,'' before graduate school,
said David. ``I'm going to hit the islands this summer. I'm going
to take off to Tahiti to work on sailboats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is very David,'' said Desmond.
</P>
<P>
   David agreed, but said ``I'm basically just a regular guy who
does very irregular things.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tahiti, David hopes to get a law degree from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about channeling street smarts,'' David said. ``If
you could creatively channel all the street smarts in Charlestown,
my God.''

ABC'S `REAR WINDOW' IS A CLOUDED VERSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
REAR WINDOW 
Starring: Christopher Reeve, Daryl Hannah, Robert Forster, Ruben
Santiago-Hudson 
Directed by: Jeff Bleckner 
On: ABC, Sunday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't bother rolling over, Hitchcock. The new ``Rear Window'' is
about as comparable to your 1954 suspense classic as dime-store
beef jerky is to filet mignon. This made-for-TV movie, which airs
Sunday night at 9, is more like a quasi-biopic of quadriplegic
Christopher Reeve, who is making his first acting appearance since
his 1995 equestrian accident. Long before the famous peeping-Tom
plot of ``Rear Window'' kicks in, we are given a slightly veiled
version of Reeve's post-accident recuperation, with his character,
Jason Kemp, flat out in a hospital bed facing other people's
discomfort as they urge him to ``look on the bright side.'' ``Do
you have any idea how expensive it is to be disabled in this
country?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Oh well. It's hard to criticize Reeve and the makers of ``Rear
Window'' for using the story of a man confined to a wheelchair to
score some points for the disabled, even if it does leave their
movie a little compromised in the plot department. Really, the idea
here is to welcome Reeve back to acting, to honor his bravery and
persistence since 1995, to give a glimpse of the incredible (and
expensive) gadgetry that helps him get around, and maybe to toss an
easy-to-follow suspense story on top of it all for good measure.
While the original ``Rear Window'' is one of Hitchcock's more
masterly efforts, a piece of cinematically vital storytelling
that's a neat study of voyeurism and obsession, the ABC remake is
mostly a small cultural event in the guise of a tepid thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve does a perfectly fine job as the newly paralyzed
architect, using his big eyes to maximum effect and wisely
underplaying some of the script's emotional moments. When he finds
a surprise party waiting for him in his slick new apartment, his
flustered response is touching because it is so slight. With his
sometimes irritable affect, he even manages to make these lines,
about a possible affair with Daryl Hannah's Claudia, bearable:
``I'm damaged goods. Contents broken during handling and shipping.
Why would she want that?'' Claudia, an architect working with Kemp
on a building project, may just want it after all _ but first, some
heavy-duty armchair private-eye-ing.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp's new apartment is all windows, of course, and he begins
spying on his neighbors across the way, none of whom have very
effective blinds _ if any at all. ``Call me Citizen Voyeur,'' he
says, forever parking his wheelchair in a spot with a view. Looking
into one unit, he sees a tough-guy sculptor knocking his
heavy-drinking wife around, and soon afterwards the wife appears to
have disappeared. He's convinced she's dead, but no one except
Hannah believes him, including a detective played by Robert
Forster. And so it goes, with a climax involving Kemp's oxygen
supply, the apartment's high-tech monitors, and finally Claudia's
romantic choice. Hannah doesn't bring much authority to the role,
but she's got sweet naivete to spare. ``Maybe she's just trying to
stay out of his way this morning,'' she wonders about the
disappearance of the woman across the way. ``Relationships like
that are far too complicated to understand from the outside.'' But
wait _ is this the Daryl Hannah story, too?

HBO'S `WINCHELL' OFFERS SCANT INSIGHT  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
WINCHELL 
Starring: Stanley Tucci, Glenne Headly, Paul Giamatti, Christopher
Plummer 
Directed by: Paul Mazursky 
On: HBO, Saturday at 8 p.m.  
Rated: TVMA 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unfortunately, now is the perfect time to look back at Walter
Winchell, the crude figure credited with ushering in American
tabloid culture. It was largely thanks to the petty wiles of
Winchell that gossip and news began shacking up in the 1930s, as he
twisted the lives of celebrities and politicians into his own sort
of media vaudeville act. And it is with Winchell as presiding
spirit that TV shows like ``Inside Edition'' and papers like the
National Enquirer continue to erode the discretion and objectivity
of the media and the trust of the public.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad HBO's biopic of the infamous snoop, ``Winchell,'' which
premieres Saturday at 8 p.m., brings so very little insight to its
hugely relevant subject. Despite an energetic performance by
Stanley Tucci, the movie neither captures the many shades of
Winchell's mean-spirited nature nor the role he played in the
direction journalism has taken in this century. It's a mostly flat
outline of the man, with a script that fills in the public rise and
fall of his career with familiar biopic moves and all but ignores
his private life, giving us only two or three token scenes of his
bitter wife and ghoulish children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winchell'' begins as the portrait of a shrewd populist hero.
The scrappy young Walter is seen bribing his way into an exclusive
party in order to expose two senators and five congressman drinking
from a bathtub filled with champagne and a naked lady. ``Nobody's
supposed to know about it,'' the naked lady, played by Glenne
Headly, says to him later during their sexual liaison. ``Let me
tell you something,'' he responds with noble affect. ``There's no
such thing as nobody. There's only everybody.'' To bring
celebrities down from their pedestals, Winchell develops his own
jerrybuilt poetry of the people, a now familiar tabloidspeak that
substitutes words like ``playbore'' for ``playboy'' and introduces
phrases like ``Adam-and-Eveing it.'' He also creates a distinct
voice for radio, with a clicking telegraph in the background and a
tommygun delivery that he forces upon himself by guzzling water and
staying out of the bathroom until after broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   As he gains national influence, paying cozy visits to the White
House for chats with FDR, Winchell is portrayed as dizzy with his
own power. He wages a campaign against Hitler, he supports
McCarthyism, and he fumbles with race relations, notably a supposed
snub of Josephine Baker when she's not served at a restaurant. But
the movie doesn't bring us inside his various and contradictory
impulses, it simply presents them in tones that range from the
respectful to the removed and the mystified. The same goes for his
cold treatment of his chief ghostwriter, Herman Klurfeld (who wrote
the book on which the movie is based). Is that tough love, or just
tough booties? It's never quite clear whether the movie is
portraying Klurfeld, played by Paul Giamatti, as a coward, or as
the loyal sidekick to a great but difficult man.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci, who has been so memorable in TV's ``Murder One'' and
movies like ``Big Night'' and ``The Daytrippers,'' gives it a full
go in ``Winchell.'' His dark, opportunistic eyes speak volumes, and
he seems to be channeling Winchell in the radio-broadcast scenes,
firing off items with controlled ferocity. But he is let down by a
script that hasn't fully found itself, one that shamelessly peters
out. Perhaps Martin Scorsese, who is developing a script based on
Neal Gabler's biography of Winchell, will fare better. But it may
be that, at this point in time, our culture is too lost in the
boundary-blurring between news and entertainment to come up with a
smart, crystallizing movie about one of its pioneers.

SMITH IS GOOD WILL HUNTED IN `ENEMY OF THE STATE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
ENEMY OF THE STATE 
Directed by: Tony Scott 
Screenplay by: David Marconi 
Starring: Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Regina King, Loren
Dean, Jake Busey, Barry Pepper, Gabriel Byrne, Tom Sizemore, Lisa
Bonet, Jamie Kennedy, Ian Hart, Scott Caan, Jack Black, Jason Lee,
Jason Robards 
Running time: 127 minutes 
Rated: R (language and violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How's your paranoia? ``Enemy of the State'' will give it a shot
in the arm, or some other body part. It's two entertaining hours of
pumped-up action as Will Smith and Gene Hackman dodge Big
Electronic Brother, in this case Jon Voight's rogue National
Security Agency bureaucrat, whose hit squad murders a congressman
in order to engineer the passage of a law permitting vastly
increased levels of electronic spying.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to Will Smith's labor lawyer. One minute he's unwinding in
his Georgetown row house, pooh-poohing the concerns of his lawyer
wife (Regina King) about the erosion of civil liberties implicit in
the proposed new surveillance law. Next, he's running for his life.
A naturalist, who through a fluke caught the assassination on
video, pops a copy into the lawyer's shopping bag of Christmas
gifts during a chance encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the biggest problem faced by Smith's labor lawyer,
Robert Dean, is mob involvement in a union election. But when the
videotaper is killed, Dean finds himself on the run and
increasingly isolated. The bad guy's henchmen cut off his credit
cards, smear his reputation, and drive a wedge between him and his
wife by making it look as if he's having an affair with an old
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   All the while they're tracking him electronically, using
orbiting satellites, planted bugs, and a van full of computers.
Every now and then, the camera cuts to space and we see the
satellite spinning above Earth. The camera then cuts rapidly
between overhead shots quickly magnified to keep the innocent
quarry in view. It's punctuated by crisp successions of video and
graphics displays that impart an electronic game quality.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid cutting between the spy cameras provides the tempo
that director Tony Scott imposes on the action. It doesn't always
follow the tenets of logic, as when a car full of heavies pursues
Dean through a tunnel air vent. How did it get there? But ``Enemy
of the State'' is unflaggingly propulsive. Hurtling breathlessly
from moment to moment, it's a big chase movie that never lets up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's smart enough to wait until about halfway through
before unleashing its secret weapon _ Gene Hackman's NSA superspy
gone underground when the NSA cut him adrift after the Iran embassy
disaster. We first become aware of Hackman's shadowy presence at
precisely the time we begin to wonder how an amateur like Dean
could elude the highly proficient death squad pursuing him.
</P>
<P>
   Casting Hackman as the superspook was inspired. Essentially,
he's reprising one of his great roles, that of Harry Caul, the
hollowed-out surveillance whiz in Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 film,
``The Conversation.'' Hackman acts with such easy economy these
days that he's able to get away with kidding the cranky disposition
of so many of his characters. When Hackman's bane-of-Washington
character named, in tongue-in-cheek fashion, Brill, snaps at Dean,
``You'll blow my life,'' Dean snaps back, ``What life?''
</P>
<P>
   But don't let the veiled playfulness attached to Hackman's
character lead you to think of ``Enemy of the State'' as one of
those wisecracking buddy action comedies. It's a skillfully
engineered blast that sticks to business, which in this case is
hard-driving forward motion. Hackman's Brill suggests a Harry Caul
as obsessive and tunnel-visioned as ever, but wilier, tougher, more
grizzled, more lethal.
</P>
<P>
   A few other performances transcend the high-speed cat-and-mouse
games, too. I'm thinking of Gabriel Byrne's contact man, highly
focused, nothing extraneous, and the underrated Tom Sizemore's mob
underboss, filled with freshness, a loose-cannon quality, and a
total avoidance of cliche. Smith engages audience sympathy as the
Everyman running for his life. But Hackman's eccentric spy who'd
just as soon not come in from the cold is the one who lingers in
your memory long after the last bullets are spent and the last
explosion turns to ashes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund is out of dough. Politicians
from Tokyo to Moscow lack the mandate or the will to fix their
economies. Intervention has failed the central banks and
speculators.
</P>
<P>
   All that now seems to stand between the world and a slide into
global recession are U.S. consumers, armed with wallets full of
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh at this unlikely superhero _ these notoriously
casual savers who already strain under a mountain of debt are
stronger than they look. But don't overestimate what they'll be
able to pull off, either.
</P>
<P>
   At best, U.S. consumers can buy the global economy some time and
prevent a worldwide panic. But they won't be able to stop the Asian
flu from infecting Latin America, and they can't, by themselves,
turn the situation around.
</P>
<P>
   How did the global economy get to this pass? More than a year
after the collapse of the Thai baht triggered an avalanche that
buried all of Asia, the International Monetary Fund's program of
huge loans, higher rates, and big cuts to government spending
hasn't stabilized the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   That medicine did indeed stop the feverish descent of Asia's
currencies (particularly the South Korean won, which is worth more
today than it was in January), but overall, the economies of the
region have become sicker, not healthier.
</P>
<P>
   High interest rates, for example, have helped choke off growth.
Indonesia's gross domestic product will fall an estimated 15
percent this year. (For context, Mexico's GDP sank 7 percent in
1995 after the peso crisis.)
</P>
<P>
   And Japan is, even its traditionally optimistic bureaucrats
admit, officially in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Now the IMF is almost out of money. The bankers are so close to
the bottom of the vault that in mid-August they elected not to
throw more cash into Russia. A bailout, the IMF felt, would have
depleted reserves without offering the slightest chance that
Russia's problems would be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled Latin American countries such as Venezuela and Brazil
aren't likely to get a warmer welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The standard remedy for recession is to generate spending,
either by running budget deficits to pay for public works or by
cutting taxes to stimulate private demand.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, that extra money soaks up the supply of unsold goods
and services, stimulates new capital investment, and creates jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But even when governments in Asia have been able to muster the
political will to take these steps, the program hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   Asia isn't in the grip of your standard-issue, plain-vanilla
recession. Nope, this is the deluxe model that combines falling
economic activity, constantly shrinking asset values, and a
seemingly endless credit crunch. Efforts to stimulate growth
disappear into these devastated economies without a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, for example, has poured trillions of yen into
infrastructure projects and cut taxes _ albeit timidly _ without
noticeable effect. Consumers are too afraid to spend _ the Japanese
and Koreans are clearly saving more in response to the crisis _ and
who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   The official unemployment rate in Japan, the land of lifetime
employment, is now at 4.3 percent, and the real rate is probably
closer to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. consumers are spending every dollar they have
and then some. Personal income rose 0.2 percent in June, according
to the Department of Commerce, after an increase of 0.4 percent in
May. Personal expenditures rose 0.6 percent in June, after a 0.9
percent climb in May.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. consumers are doing exactly what their counterparts in Asia
aren't willing to do. In June, the U.S. trade deficit with the ten
major Asian nations totaled $15 billion _ that's up more than 40
percent from the deficit in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty clear where at least some of the dollars headed to
Asia are coming from. U.S. consumers are saving less and running up
more debt. In the first quarter of 1998, according to the
Department of Commerce, U.S. consumers saved just 0.6 percent. At
the same time, consumer debt grew at an annual rate of better than
6 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are now paying a record 15 percent of after-tax income
in interest and principal, according to Economic Analysis
Associates of Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   If you judge from those trends, the U.S. consumer sounds pretty
tapped out and poorly cast as the hero who will save the world
economy. But these numbers ignore the ``wealth effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve estimates that since 1994 the stock market
has added $12.5 trillion to the assets of U.S. households. Using
traditional estimates of the way this wealth effect flows from the
financial markets into consumer spending, that asset explosion will
add about $600 billion annually to consumer purchasing power in the
U.s.
</P>
<P>
   That number is both reassuring and scary. Reassuring because it
suggests the United States will be able to continue its role as
consumer of last resort into 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Scary because it suggests that U.S. consumers will play this
role only as long as a buoyant stock market makes them feel
wealthy. No one has any real idea, unfortunately, of how far the
market would have to fall before consumers would stop feeling
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of buying by U.S. consumers can fix the structural
problems in the Korean, Japanese, or Brazilian economies. But it
can buy time for those economies to right themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It can pump liquidity into cash-starved companies in these
countries. And it can give countries _ China most importantly _ an
incentive for working to help fix the global economy rather than
pursuing a ruinous policy of beggar thy neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it offers the hope that hard-pressed countries have
a way out of this fix. That's pretty important in a world that, for
the moment, seems to be out of alternative ideas. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund is out of dough. Politicians
from Tokyo to Moscow lack the mandate or the will to fix their
economies. Intervention has failed the central banks and
speculators.
</P>
<P>
   All that now seems to stand between the world and a slide into
global recession are U.S. consumers, armed with wallets full of
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh at this unlikely superhero _ these notoriously
casual savers who already strain under a mountain of debt are
stronger than they look. But don't overestimate what they'll be
able to pull off, either.
</P>
<P>
   At best, U.S. consumers can buy the global economy some time and
prevent a worldwide panic. But they won't be able to stop the Asian
flu from infecting Latin America, and they can't, by themselves,
turn the situation around.
</P>
<P>
   How did the global economy get to this pass? More than a year
after the collapse of the Thai baht triggered an avalanche that
buried all of Asia, the International Monetary Fund's program of
huge loans, higher rates, and big cuts to government spending
hasn't stabilized the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   That medicine did indeed stop the feverish descent of Asia's
currencies (particularly the South Korean won, which is worth more
today than it was in January), but overall, the economies of the
region have become sicker, not healthier.
</P>
<P>
   High interest rates, for example, have helped choke off growth.
Indonesia's gross domestic product will fall an estimated 15
percent this year. (For context, Mexico's GDP sank 7 percent in
1995 after the peso crisis.)
</P>
<P>
   And Japan is, even its traditionally optimistic bureaucrats
admit, officially in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Now the IMF is almost out of money. The bankers are so close to
the bottom of the vault that in mid-August they elected not to
throw more cash into Russia. A bailout, the IMF felt, would have
depleted reserves without offering the slightest chance that
Russia's problems would be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled Latin American countries such as Venezuela and Brazil
aren't likely to get a warmer welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The standard remedy for recession is to generate spending,
either by running budget deficits to pay for public works or by
cutting taxes to stimulate private demand.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, that extra money soaks up the supply of unsold goods
and services, stimulates new capital investment, and creates jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But even when governments in Asia have been able to muster the
political will to take these steps, the program hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   Asia isn't in the grip of your standard-issue, plain-vanilla
recession. Nope, this is the deluxe model that combines falling
economic activity, constantly shrinking asset values, and a
seemingly endless credit crunch. Efforts to stimulate growth
disappear into these devastated economies without a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, for example, has poured trillions of yen into
infrastructure projects and cut taxes _ albeit timidly _ without
noticeable effect. Consumers are too afraid to spend _ the Japanese
and Koreans are clearly saving more in response to the crisis _ and
who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   The official unemployment rate in Japan, the land of lifetime
employment, is now at 4.3 percent, and the real rate is probably
closer to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. consumers are spending every dollar they have
and then some. Personal income rose 0.2 percent in June, according
to the Department of Commerce, after an increase of 0.4 percent in
May. Personal expenditures rose 0.6 percent in June, after a 0.9
percent climb in May.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. consumers are doing exactly what their counterparts in Asia
aren't willing to do. In June, the U.S. trade deficit with the ten
major Asian nations totaled $15 billion _ that's up more than 40
percent from the deficit in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty clear where at least some of the dollars headed to
Asia are coming from. U.S. consumers are saving less and running up
more debt. In the first quarter of 1998, according to the
Department of Commerce, U.S. consumers saved just 0.6 percent. At
the same time, consumer debt grew at an annual rate of better than
6 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are now paying a record 15 percent of after-tax income
in interest and principal, according to Economic Analysis
Associates of Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   If you judge from those trends, the U.S. consumer sounds pretty
tapped out and poorly cast as the hero who will save the world
economy. But these numbers ignore the ``wealth effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve estimates that since 1994 the stock market
has added $12.5 trillion to the assets of U.S. households. Using
traditional estimates of the way this wealth effect flows from the
financial markets into consumer spending, that asset explosion will
add about $600 billion annually to consumer purchasing power in the
U.s.
</P>
<P>
   That number is both reassuring and scary. Reassuring because it
suggests the United States will be able to continue its role as
consumer of last resort into 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Scary because it suggests that U.S. consumers will play this
role only as long as a buoyant stock market makes them feel
wealthy. No one has any real idea, unfortunately, of how far the
market would have to fall before consumers would stop feeling
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of buying by U.S. consumers can fix the structural
problems in the Korean, Japanese, or Brazilian economies. But it
can buy time for those economies to right themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It can pump liquidity into cash-starved companies in these
countries. And it can give countries _ China most importantly _ an
incentive for working to help fix the global economy rather than
pursuing a ruinous policy of beggar thy neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it offers the hope that hard-pressed countries have
a way out of this fix. That's pretty important in a world that, for
the moment, seems to be out of alternative ideas. &QL;

lawyers were playing brief excerpts of Bill Gates's testimony,
culled from 20 hours of questioning over a three-day period last

judge criticizes Gates for being evasive. By Joel Brinkley.
</P>

maker, says group earnings slumped 20 percent in the fiscal first
half as shrinking sales in Japan offset strong demand in the United
States and Europe. By Stephanie Strom.

known San Francisco dojo, the father of taiko drumming in America _
as Tanaka is called _ was also busy making final preparations for a
celebratory taiko festival this weekend at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in the hush of the soundproofed warehouse that serves
as the dojo's practice headquarters, Tanaka hardly seemed affected
by his growing recognition. A spare figure, Tanaka, at 55, exudes
simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind is always on taiko _ it starts with my breathing and
exercise,'' he said. ``I eat good quality food, a little sake, no
smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Mind, body and spirit form the nexus of Tanaka-style taiko, a
blend of athleticism, martial arts training and musical rhythm that
is so unique it has revitalized taiko drumming in its homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Tanaka taiko has been recognized by the Japanese government as a
National Abstract Cultural Treasure and was performed before the
late Emperor Hirohito.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of redefining taiko in his native land is not lost on
Tanaka, who trained with Grand Master Daihachi Oguchi of Japan's
Osuwa Daiko.
</P>
<P>
   Oguchi was among the visionaries who revived taiko drumming from
its status as a relic performed only during festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Regarded as sacred, the barrel-like taiko drum was first used to
drive away evil spirits and pests that could harm crops. It was
also believed the sound of the drum _ like thunder _ could cause
rain to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the awesome power of that thunder has drawn a whole new
audience. Tanaka, the first to introduce taiko to the United States
in 1968, has been instrumental in creating that following.
</P>
<P>
   As a newcomer from Japan in 1968, Tanaka noticed that San
Francisco's Cherry Blossom Festival had no taiko drumming.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing a drum from a local Buddhist temple, he began
practicing in the basement of the old Kabuki Theater. He was the
sole taiko drummer in the festival that year.
</P>
<P>
   Tanaka went on to found his dojo, which has grown over the years
and gained worldwide attention. San Francisco Taiko Dojo has
performed at Carnegie Hall as well as in Europe and Israel. The
dojo also has been featured in four major Hollywood films.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Tanaka's students _ he numbers them at about 10,000 _
have gone on to found about 200 taiko schools in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the dojo's success is traced to Tanaka's style, which is
highly improvised. Playing taiko, for Tanaka's drummers, is an act
of communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people just listen,'' he said. ``I want people to watch
the sound, see the sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanaka said physical strength is critical. He puts his students
through a strict regimen of push-ups and other grueling exercises.
They spend hours pounding on round practice drums made of wine
barrels. The real drums from Japan, made of keyaki wood, are
extremely expensive and are used only for performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This costs as much as a Lexus,'' said Tanaka, pointing to one
drum stretched with cowhide.
</P>
<P>
   The dojo's pride is a 1-ton drum _ hand-painted with a colorful
dragon. It is the largest taiko drum outside Japan.
</P>
<P>
   More than physical strength makes these drums thunder, Tanaka
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big muscle can produce a big sound,'' Tanaka said. ``But
quality sound comes from ki.''
</P>
<P>
   Ki, to any student of martial arts, is the life energy source,
located about three fingers' breadth below the navel.
</P>
<P>
   Ki, Tanaka said, must flow from the performer to the drum. Blend
that with rhythm and respect and the result is an old-fashioned art
form unique even in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Japan is losing its culture,'' Tanaka said. ``Japan is
too modernized. I'm doing a very traditional, old-style philosophy.
So my students are even more Japanese than modern Japanese in
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tanaka has opened up taiko drumming to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very important that it not be too exclusive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tanaka is so exacting his strictness is renowned. He claims to
have mellowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have a very heavy reputation, but now I am as soft
as tofu,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still Tanaka doesn't plan to put down his drumming sticks any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until my heart stops, I keep moving,'' he said. ``If you don't
keep moving, you won't reach any place. To me, there is no
summit.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiko groups from Los Angeles to New York will participate in
the festival at Berkeley, as will the Nihon Taiko Dojo, a group
founded in Tokyo, supported by the Japanese emperor's drum maker
and led by Tosha Kiyonari, a master of the tzusumi, or hand drum.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: A new member of the Family of Dog
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several months ago my wife brought home a little lost puppy,
blind and deaf. We took her to the vet, but he wasn't very
optimistic. It appeared she was suffering from distemper, or a
similar virus that attacks the brain.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he'd do his best.
</P>
<P>
   That he did, and then some! Within a week or so the little puppy
had totally recovered.
</P>
<P>
   My wife named her Beauty. That's how ugly she is _ sort of a
Desert Storm dog, such are her dark and light brown markings.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, she has taken her place among the Family of Dog
that makes up our household. And Beauty makes eight.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she's beginning to grow on us. And grow ... and grow
... and grow.
</P>
<P>
   I'm told she's what you call a cow dog. That's about the size of
it. She'll grow to about the size of a cow.
</P>
<P>
   The breed, I'm told, is a Catahoula, which is considered the
national dog of South Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   You can certainly discern a measure of Louisiana heritage in her
makeup and demeanor. Got a snout on her like an alligator, she
does. If there's anything she can't gnaw through, she hasn't come
to it yet.
</P>
<P>
   Catahoula, indeed, are very expensive dogs. So far she's chewed
up two pairs of my eyeglasses. She'd sneak into our bedroom during
the night and snatch a pair from my bedside table.
</P>
<P>
   Now when I go to bed I stow everything _ keys, billfold, glasses
_ in the drawer of the table. But that's a temporary measure. The
other night I woke up to find her puzzling over the handle of the
drawer. It's only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't be surprised if she figures out how to open the
refrigerator as well. Heaven knows she's hungry all the time.
</P>
<P>
   She's a smart thing. We have a swing set out back for the
grandchildren, and, as it turns out, for Beauty.
</P>
<P>
   She lies across the seat of the swing on her belly and pushes
herself with her dangling paws. Next thing, I imagine, she'll be
going down the slide.
</P>
<P>
   The other dogs don't know quite what to make of Beauty, but they
know trouble when they see it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the others _ Lamb Chop, the miniature poodle; Jag Wire,
the schnauzer; Buster, the rat terrier; Peanut Patty, the little
border collie mix; Maggie, the big shaggy dog; and John, the old
yellow dog _ choose to ignore her whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   Only Lily, a black-mouth cur and the biggest of the bunch, has
taken to Beauty. I think Lily sees her as one of her own kind,
canine kinfolks of some sort. I expect Beauty will grow up to be at
least as large as Lily, 80 pounds or more.
</P>
<P>
   All of our dogs have come from the pound or the side of the
road. It's not that we go looking for them. Just the opposite. They
seem to come looking for us.
</P>
<P>
   My standing rule is that you take all the dogs God sends you.
</P>
<P>
   But how many, oh Lord, how many?
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping eight is enough.

<P>
   The U.S. Federal Reserve is the most powerful central bank in
the world. It can send stock markets around the world soaring or
crashing with merely a word, and wipe out or create billions of
dollars with a hint. But it cannot fix what ails Japan with any
number of interest-rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   That spells continued global economic trouble, since Japan is
the key to ending the economic slump in Asia. But the Fed believes
the current global financial and economic crisis is so serious that
even the recovery of the world's second-largest economy isn't the
most pressing problem of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the dilemma. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and his
colleagues know that Japan is the key to global economic recovery.
But they also know that there's almost nothing they can do in the
short run to pull that country out of its paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   So the Fed has decided to put its muscle to work simply holding
the line in places like Brazil and the U.S. The hope is to prevent
a global recession _ even if that makes problems in Japan more
intractable.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is caught in what's called a liquidity trap, a kind of
economic black hole that shrugs off interest-rate reductions, huge
public-works programs, and even direct infusions of trillions of
yen.
</P>
<P>
   To fix the run-of-the-mill economic slowdown, a country's
government and central bank throw money at the problem. The
government adds to the country's money supply by running a budget
deficit _ funded by printing more dollars or yen or reals _ and
then puts that cash into the hands of businesses, which use it to
build roads or aircraft carriers or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   That creates demand for products from tar to tarmacs and, later,
for tires and shoes when the money trickles down to consumers in
the form of wages.
</P>
<P>
   An interest-rate cut by the central bank has much the same
effect. Lower rates makes it more attractive for banks to borrow
funds from the central bank _ which increases the money supply.
Lower rates encourage companies to borrow and expand and consumers
to put a few more dollars on their credit cards. That increases
demand and keeps the economy humming.
</P>
<P>
   Despite enough foot-dragging and posturing to get any sumo
wrestler booed out of Tokyo, the Japanese government has generally
followed that prescription recently. The government has thrown
trillions of yen into building roads.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent interest-rate cut by the Bank of Japan took the
official number down to a minuscule 0.25 percent: Banks can borrow
for what is effectively nothing. And last year the Bank of Japan
increased the country's money supply by more than 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But throwing money at the Japanese economy hasn't worked.
Business investment in the quarter that ran from April to June fell
by 9 percent from the same period a year earlier. The economy,
measured by gross domestic product, shrank by 0.8 percent in the
quarter and shows no signs of bottoming.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening to all the money that's being pumped into the
Japanese economy? It's getting stuffed into mattresses. Consumers,
for example, have increased their savings rate during this
downturn. This is characteristic of a liquidity trap.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are so scared about the future that they save every
cent they can. Businesses use every cent they can find to pay back
debt, since they worry that lenders will demand their money back
tomorrow. This behavior, of course, creates the very situation
businesses and consumers fear.
</P>
<P>
   The liquidity crunch has virtually paralyzed Japan's banking
system. What does a bank do right now when, thanks to the growth in
the money supply, it gets a credit to its account from the Bank of
Japan? It could make loans or even pay off some debt. Instead, most
Japanese banks are just keeping the money in reserve to meet the
demand for cash by Japanese households.
</P>
<P>
   A cut in U.S. interest rates won't fix Japan's liquidity problem
_ in fact, a cut could actually make it worse.
</P>
<P>
   Lower U.S. interest rates weaken the dollar and increase the
value of the yen, giving Japanese hoarders of yen one more reason
to hold on to their cash. And the Federal Reserve knows a U.S. rate
reduction makes it easier for the Japanese to avoid the painful
fundamental reforms needed to get the Japanese economy started on
the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But those are minor issues for a Federal Reserve that is staring
at a global financial and economic crisis. Rate cuts may not help
Japan, but they should prevent the U.S. economy from slowing
further.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed cannot take the slightest risk of having the U.S. slide
into recession. The U.S. is one of only two growth engines left in
the world _ and is also the crucial market for the struggling
economies of Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   An interest-rate cut is the Fed's line in the sand _ the
recession stops here.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. interest-rate cut will also increase the pressure on
reluctant European central banks to follow suit. Greenspan would
prefer to make coordinated cuts with the Europeans. The Europeans,
however, have been resisting.
</P>
<P>
   Lower U.S. rates mean a cheaper U.S. dollar against the deutsche
mark, for example, and a more expensive currency spells trouble for
a country such as Germany, which is so heavily dependent on
exporting.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, preoccupied with their monetary union, may still
hold out, but they know the Federal Reserve is willing to act
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   There's no guarantee that even rate cuts by the Federal Reserve,
the Bundesbank, and the Bank of England can stop the spread of
crisis. Interest-rate cuts in the U.S. could re-ignite inflation
here and re-inflate the stock market bubble.
</P>
<P>
   If the Federal Reserve moves and the crisis deepens, the bank
will lose crucial psychological capital. But when you run the most
influential central bank in the world, you really don't have the
option of sitting out a crisis like this. &QL;

   The U.S. Federal Reserve is the most powerful central bank in
the world. It can send stock markets around the world soaring or
crashing with merely a word, and wipe out or create billions of
dollars with a hint. But it cannot fix what ails Japan with any
number of interest-rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   That spells continued global economic trouble, since Japan is
the key to ending the economic slump in Asia. But the Fed believes
the current global financial and economic crisis is so serious that
even the recovery of the world's second-largest economy isn't the
most pressing problem of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the dilemma. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and his
colleagues know that Japan is the key to global economic recovery.
But they also know that there's almost nothing they can do in the
short run to pull that country out of its paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   So the Fed has decided to put its muscle to work simply holding
the line in places like Brazil and the U.S. The hope is to prevent
a global recession _ even if that makes problems in Japan more
intractable.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is caught in what's called a liquidity trap, a kind of
economic black hole that shrugs off interest-rate reductions, huge
public-works programs, and even direct infusions of trillions of
yen.
</P>
<P>
   To fix the run-of-the-mill economic slowdown, a country's
government and central bank throw money at the problem. The
government adds to the country's money supply by running a budget
deficit _ funded by printing more dollars or yen or reals _ and
then puts that cash into the hands of businesses, which use it to
build roads or aircraft carriers or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   That creates demand for products from tar to tarmacs and, later,
for tires and shoes when the money trickles down to consumers in
the form of wages.
</P>
<P>
   An interest-rate cut by the central bank has much the same
effect. Lower rates makes it more attractive for banks to borrow
funds from the central bank _ which increases the money supply.
Lower rates encourage companies to borrow and expand and consumers
to put a few more dollars on their credit cards. That increases
demand and keeps the economy humming.
</P>
<P>
   Despite enough foot-dragging and posturing to get any sumo
wrestler booed out of Tokyo, the Japanese government has generally
followed that prescription recently. The government has thrown
trillions of yen into building roads.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent interest-rate cut by the Bank of Japan took the
official number down to a minuscule 0.25 percent: Banks can borrow
for what is effectively nothing. And last year the Bank of Japan
increased the country's money supply by more than 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But throwing money at the Japanese economy hasn't worked.
Business investment in the quarter that ran from April to June fell
by 9 percent from the same period a year earlier. The economy,
measured by gross domestic product, shrank by 0.8 percent in the
quarter and shows no signs of bottoming.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening to all the money that's being pumped into the
Japanese economy? It's getting stuffed into mattresses. Consumers,
for example, have increased their savings rate during this
downturn. This is characteristic of a liquidity trap.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are so scared about the future that they save every
cent they can. Businesses use every cent they can find to pay back
debt, since they worry that lenders will demand their money back
tomorrow. This behavior, of course, creates the very situation
businesses and consumers fear.
</P>
<P>
   The liquidity crunch has virtually paralyzed Japan's banking
system. What does a bank do right now when, thanks to the growth in
the money supply, it gets a credit to its account from the Bank of
Japan? It could make loans or even pay off some debt. Instead, most
Japanese banks are just keeping the money in reserve to meet the
demand for cash by Japanese households.
</P>
<P>
   A cut in U.S. interest rates won't fix Japan's liquidity problem
_ in fact, a cut could actually make it worse.
</P>
<P>
   Lower U.S. interest rates weaken the dollar and increase the
value of the yen, giving Japanese hoarders of yen one more reason
to hold on to their cash. And the Federal Reserve knows a U.S. rate
reduction makes it easier for the Japanese to avoid the painful
fundamental reforms needed to get the Japanese economy started on
the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But those are minor issues for a Federal Reserve that is staring
at a global financial and economic crisis. Rate cuts may not help
Japan, but they should prevent the U.S. economy from slowing
further.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed cannot take the slightest risk of having the U.S. slide
into recession. The U.S. is one of only two growth engines left in
the world _ and is also the crucial market for the struggling
economies of Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   An interest-rate cut is the Fed's line in the sand _ the
recession stops here.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. interest-rate cut will also increase the pressure on
reluctant European central banks to follow suit. Greenspan would
prefer to make coordinated cuts with the Europeans. The Europeans,
however, have been resisting.
</P>
<P>
   Lower U.S. rates mean a cheaper U.S. dollar against the deutsche
mark, for example, and a more expensive currency spells trouble for
a country such as Germany, which is so heavily dependent on
exporting.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, preoccupied with their monetary union, may still
hold out, but they know the Federal Reserve is willing to act
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   There's no guarantee that even rate cuts by the Federal Reserve,
the Bundesbank, and the Bank of England can stop the spread of
crisis. Interest-rate cuts in the U.S. could re-ignite inflation
here and re-inflate the stock market bubble.
</P>
<P>
   If the Federal Reserve moves and the crisis deepens, the bank
will lose crucial psychological capital. But when you run the most
influential central bank in the world, you really don't have the
option of sitting out a crisis like this. &QL;

AMERICAN HISTORY ISN'T PERFECT IN `X' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``American History X'' is a maddening, unnerving movie
infuriating because of its hyperbole, unnerving because of its
power.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is surprising. A film about a charismatic skinhead and
the violence that defines his life is doomed to exaggerate,
particularly if its creator is a TV-commercial director and
conceptual artist prone to grand gestures. Tony Kaye tried, while
haggling with the studio, to hack his name from the credits and
replace it with ``Humpty Dumpty,'' a move so histrionic that some
accused him of trying to drum up extra publicity.
</P>
<P>
   If so, he needn't have bothered. ``X'' isn't perfect, but it
runs well enough _ and hot enough _ on its own dramatic steam.
</P>
<P>
   Blowing the biggest gusts is Edward Norton, who solidifies his
reputation as one of the fiercest young talents in film. Norton is
that rare actor who can believably play both good and evil; as
anyone knows who caught his debut in ``Primal Fear,'' his moral
arrow can twirl from north to south with extraordinary (and
shocking) alacrity.
</P>
<P>
   Here he plays Derek Vinyard, a hate-filled neo-Nazi who goes to
prison for murder and emerges three years later a transformed man a
warmer, fuzzier fellow with a full head of hair and the resolve to
give up his racist ways. His main concern on his release from the
pen is his kid brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), who reveres Derek,
admires Hitler and has just turned in a history paper titled ``My
Mein Kampf.''
</P>
<P>
   As punishment, an African-American principal (the
always-persuasive Avery Brooks) forces the younger Vinyard to write
a new essay tracking the roots of his white supremacism (``American
History X''). Excerpts from the paper run in voice-over throughout
the action, adding a touch of narrative coherence to a resolutely
non-linear film. It's structured like a braid: color sequences
starring the new, sweet Derek alternate with violent
black-and-white flashbacks to the old Derek and his Nazi cohorts.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is jolting at best, disorienting at worst, an
inconsistent jumble of squishy heart-to-hearts and scenes of
sickening brutality.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say what Kaye would have done with this rumbling
beast had he been allowed to control the final edit. One wonders
what David McKenna's screenplay originally looked like. But as it
stands, the film offers two clear messages and one mixed. The
first, and clearest, is that hatred is a seed best not planted; as
the name ``Vinyard'' indicates, Kaye's movie dwells heavily on the
fruits of racism. (Nowhere is this more apparent than in the final
scene, which shocks but fails to surprise.)
</P>
<P>
   The other clear message concerns Danny's essay, his ensuing
scrutiny and the implied belief in the power of self-knowledge. If
he just looks within, the movie seems to say, he'll give up all
this nasty Nazi business.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But what disturbs most of all in ``American History X''
is its mixed message on race in America. What exactly is Kaye
saying here? Beyond the obvious lessons _ racism bad; kindness good
_ the movie is infuriatingly murky in its depiction of
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There are two _ two _ positive black characters in this film,
and one of them's a convict. The rest are gang-bangers.
</P>
<P>
   There's something iffy, too, in Kaye's over-the-top
cinematography, which reserves its most majestic devices (lots of
slow motion) for the skinhead flashbacks. Featured here are scenes
of hideous violence, including one shot of a young man's head being
smashed on a curb. Equally unsettling is a white vs. black
basketball game in which the whites' victory is accompanied by
slo-mo high fives and rapturous swells of strings from Anne
Dudley's triumphal score.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the coldest shivers come straight from Norton, whose
riveting turn as Derek ought to give everyone gooseflesh. On paper
his tirades against minorities and illegal immigrants don't get
beyond tired isolationism (``everybody's turning and looking the
other way while this country rots from the inside out!,'' etc.,
etc.), yet he delivers them with mesmerizing, half-smiling
conviction. He doesn't make sense, but he makes an attractive
skinhead. And that's terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of itself, the film has a few moments of subtlety.
Besides Norton and Furlong, who spews invisible fumes as the
younger brother, the cast features Elliot Gould in a sympathetic,
mercifully understated role as a suitor to Derek's mother (Beverly
D'Angelo). And Stacy Keach, in his latest incarnation as a
character actor, plays an older Nazi guru with icky exactitude.
</P>
<P>
   But the most quietly compelling scenes are virtual throwaways:
those few brief bits, buried amid the flashbacks, that show Derek
in the prison laundry room with a black inmate named Lamont (Guy
Torry). These are gentle scenes, these tete-a-tetes with Lamont,
and they float on Torry's dignity and easy humor. They're buoys on
the crest of a raging movie.

STRESS TO IMPRESS

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

   LOS ANGELES _ Dinner for a few friends _ how hard can that be?
</P>
<P>
   A few containers of Chinese takeout, a six-pack of beer, and
everybody has a great time. No muss, no fuss, no big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   But here come the holidays, with the (mostly self-imposed)
pressure to be especially festive, to decorate, to offer enormous
spreads of home-cooked food, to invite small armies of people _
some of whom you haven't seen since last winter _ to your spotless
home.
</P>
<P>
   Demands like that can send the most social creature looking for
a place to hide until after New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those who can afford party planning starting at
$100,000 a pop can place a call to international caterer, party
planner and lifestyle artist-to-the-stars Colin Cowie, who has
designed lavish events ranging from Hugh Hefner's wedding to
parties for Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, from corporate to-do's
for Fortune 500 companies to elaborate balls for megabucks
charities.
</P>
<P>
   But most folks, who live paycheck to paycheck, can have just as
good a time taking Cowie's free advice on how to make a home a
welcoming haven for family and friends on a budget of both time and
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Style has got nothing to do with money,'' declares Cowie, who
has homes and offices in both Los Angeles and New York. ``You can
take a great casserole and some wine and make a great evening out
of it. I sometimes entertain five evenings a week, and that's how I
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick to successful entertaining, Cowie is convinced, is
planning and thought _ and an unofficial motto: ``Keep it simple;
keep it easy; do it early; keep it organized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you leave everything to the last minute, ... it becomes
an effort rather than a pleasure to have friends over,'' said
Cowie, who has written two books on entertaining and has another on
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be frazzled and exhausted when your guests arrive, and
when the host or hostess spends the evening in the kitchen, nobody
has a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to plan every detail well in advance so when your
guests arrive, everything is taken care of. Then all you've got to
do is open the door and smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Planning for a holiday event includes picking a date for your
party, deciding what kind of event to have (a casual dinner, formal
dinner party, open house, tree-trimming party), figuring out how
many guests you can comfortably host, and compiling a guest list.
Issue invitations, then plan the menu and make shopping and to-do
lists: one for perishable items; one for nonperishable items and
staples; one for wine or liquor; one for flowers or other niceties;
one for needed serving pieces, chairs and other items you may need
to rent or borrow.
</P>
<P>
   Shop early, leaving only truly last-minute items until the last
minute, Cowie advises. And take care of housecleaning chores
several days in advance so all that's needed on party day is a
quick swipe with a sponge, a dust cloth and the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy a centerpiece for your dinner or buffet table, but
it's almost always cheaper to make it yourself using fresh flowers,
fresh fruits, nuts, candles and other items you may have stashed
around the house, Cowie says.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate, he quickly lined a trumpet-shaped glass dish
with moss, piled in a half-dozen pomegranates covered in glued-on
copper leaf from an art store, then filled the bowl with red pears
and apples. As a finishing touch, he tucked in a few brick-colored
roses, kept fresh in tiny water-filled vials hidden among the
fruit, and sprinkled copper-painted unshelled walnuts over the top
and spilling onto the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now then, that wasn't rocket science, was it?'' Cowie inquired
with a grin. ``That took 10 minutes, and it's beautiful. Anybody
could do that. It cost probably not over $20. And it'll last for
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The table setting was completed with simple placemats,
chocolate-brown and gold china, silverware and brick-colored cloth
napkins folded atop the plates, each topped with a single
copper-painted walnut as a kind of visual exclamation point. A
small army of votive candleholders, each ringed at the top with a
glued-on strip of copper leaf, marched down the center of the
table, the flickering of the candles reflected in a giant wall
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The effect, in just a few minutes, was warm, welcoming, not too
fussy and perfect for a fall dinner _ maybe Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about presentation,'' Cowie said. ``I think the key
is to make it look effortless. You should never look like you're
trying too hard, because that makes people uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowie has become expert in making people feel at ease. Born in
Zambia and raised in South Africa, with no television and few
outlets for entertainment, ``we learned to entertain ourselves, and
we did that by giving dinner parties,'' he said. ``My parents
entertained a lot, and I learned from them.''
</P>
<P>
   He was style-conscious from an early age, a precociousness his
parents indulged.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the other kids were out playing, I was rearranging the
furniture,'' he said with a laugh. ``That was fun for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Grown up, he worked as general manager of a hotel and spa in
South Africa, and as food consultant for a variety of restaurants
in the United Kingdom and Holland. He created his catering
business, Colin Cowie Lifestyle, and moved its headquarters in 1984
to Los Angeles, his base of operations for planning parties,
weddings and other celebrations thrown for Kenny G, Lisa Kudrow,
Charlie Sheen, Placido Domingo, Bloomingdale's, Champagne Veuve
Clicquot and A&AMP;M Arista Records. He also produced the Council of
Fashion Designers of America awards presentation in 1997 and the
last two Elton John AIDS Foundation Oscar parties.
</P>
<P>
   In between parties, he has served as a style consultant to the
Regent Hotel Group's Australian properties and to the private
island resort of Wakaya in Fiji. In his spare time, he appeared on
``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' ``48 Hours'' and other shows, hawking
his laid-back attitude toward style and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   And in July, the man many term ``the male Martha Stewart'' began
appearing in a half-hour television show _ ``Everyday Elegance With
Colin Cowie'' _ on AMC's Romance Classics (10 p.m. Thursdays),
showing reluctant hosts and hostesses that entertaining at home
isn't that hard to do.
</P>
<P>
   Many people don't entertain because they fear it'll cost too
much, they don't have time and they don't have any special cooking
or decorating ability, Cowie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people want is a formula for entertaining, and that's
what I give them,'' he said. ``I just love entertaining. It's fun
to create and make people feel special in your home.''
</P>
<P>
   For the holidays, that might mean picking a color scheme or
theme and carrying it out in your decorations, which you can make
yourself with scraps of fabric, spray paint, glitter, greenery and
even burnt-out light bulbs; baking special cookies or traditional
family dishes; putting special thought into buying personal, but
less-than-lavish gifts; using a special flair in wrapping packages;
and sharing your skills _ and your holiday spirit _ with friends
and family.
</P>
<P>
   As for worrying that whatever you do won't be perfect, forget
it, Cowie counsels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertaining's not about being perfect,'' declares Cowie.
``Perfect sets too-high expectations and takes away the fun. You
always try to do your best, and that's enough. Remember,
entertaining your friends isn't about impressing anybody. It's
about having a ball.''

slightly weakened Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and

   BRAZIL-ECONOMY _ MIAMI _ The massive multi-billion-dollar aid
package put together by the United States and other countries to
help shore up the Brazilian economy, was motivated far more out of
fear than altruism. In the year since the Asian financial crisis
began trickling into other regional economies of the world, the
global powers have waited anxiously for it to reach South America.
But will the generous economic stimulus cause stocks to rally back?
Will depleted foreign reserves increase? And if not, will Brazil _
and the rest of Latin America _ be able to avoid a recession?

   STATE-MASTERCARD-MISUSE _ With state charge card in hand,
workers at the Texas Department of Health went shopping for
computer printers. They charged so many to the state budget that
almost every cubicle in some regional offices had a private
printer. And computer scanners? Those were charged, too, even when
they weren't needed. Eight months later, some were still in their
original boxes. The purchases were made on Mastercards used by
state employees but billed to the State of Texas. Just after state
officials cracked down on misuse of American Express cards by state
employees, new documents show similar abuse of Mastercards by state
employees. A recent audit at the state health department found that
nearly one quarter of all Mastercard purchases violated rules.
Auditors found that employees, who are limited to $1,000 a
purchase, were swiping the card several times in order to buy
things that cost $6,700, and using the card to get around General
Services Commission contracts. The misuse of Mastercards more
directly affects taxpayers because the state picks up the tab,
unlike the state-issued American Express purchases, which are
billed to the employees. (Gamino, Austin American-Statesman).

A DOGGONE PAGE-TURNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Don't you just hate it when people treat their
dogs like, well, dogs?
</P>
<P>
   Miz Hot Tips has observed that the French take their four-legged
friends out to dinner with them, and in Italy entire shops are
devoted to designer doggy duds _ from richly embellished coats with
matching hats and boots to custom-made leather goods in pastel
colors.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that a dog can be every bit as endearing as a child
(maybe more, since they never talk back, ditch school or whine
about the size of their allowance), Westwood author Ellen Sinaiko
has created ``Puppy's First Book'' (Vantage Books; $16.95). It's
just like a baby book, with space for family tree, paw prints,
puppy pictures and important events like first vet visit, first
home, first bath and first trick.
</P>
<P>
   Sinaiko says she wrote the book with the help of her dachshund
Ernestine, because she'd learned how many people think of their
dogs as their babies.
</P>
<P>
   She's recently enlisted the aid of her feline friend Jezebelle
to begin working on ``Kitty's First Book.''
</P>
<P>
   You can buy the book at book and pet stores, as well as Neiman
Marcus in Beverly Hills, but if you'd like to meet the author and
Ernestine, stop by Brentano's Book Store, 10250 Santa Monica Blvd.
in Century City, at 1 p.m. today. She'll be signing copies of the
book and donating 20 percent of the proceeds to the Amanda
Foundation for animals.
</P>
<P>
   Since the holidays are coming up, pet lovers also may want to
check out the new book ``Cooking With Dogs'' (Two Dog Press;
$19.95). Author (and dog mom) Karen Dowell has written a collection
of vignettes and anecdotes that will appeal to puppy parents
everywhere. But there aren't any recipes.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S SUPERMAN: He may not be wearing the ``Superman'' costume
anymore, but Christopher Reeve is a real-life hero to those with
spinal cord injuries. Not only is he still acting _ he stars in the
remake of the Hitchcock classic ``Rear Window'' Sunday night on ABC
_ but he's selling neckties to raise money for the Christopher
Reeve Foundation, which is searching for a cure for spinal cord
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion-forward silk ties are manufactured by Stonehenge
Ltd., and feature the designs of Reeve's friends, such as Paul
Newman, Ted Danson and Glenn Close, as well as those of paralysis
victims. They're $27 at J.C. Penney stores beginning today.
</P>
<P>
   SHOPPER'S ALERT: Miz Hot Tips thinks one ought to wait until the
Thanksgiving turkey is picked clean before thinking about
Christmas, but the Panorama Mall in Panorama City thinks otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 a.m. today, there will be 15 tons of snow for kids to play
in, the ARC Handbell Choir of North Hollywood performing, plus the
arrival of Santa Claus. Not only is all the fun free, but the mall
is giving free Beanie Babies to the first 200 children to visit
Santa and share their wish list.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley mall has other events coming up, including a program
by the Rainbow Children's Choir of the First Baptist Church of
North Hollywood and the Wood/Wind Duo at 6:30 p.m. Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   FITS LIKE A GLOVE: Cold nights are a rarity in Los Angeles, but
it does happen. And those with long fingernails know it's a pain to
find a glove that fits.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of hearing his wife and sister complain (they're both
named Wendy), Lloyd Cohn of Pocketec Inc. designed a leather glove
with holes to accommodate long nails. Nail-Vu gloves are $29.95,
come in a choice of sizes and colors (black, brown, burgundy and
gray), and can be found in department stores or by custom order.
For more information, call (800) 669-5239.
</P>
<P>
   FREE PARKING: The Beverly Center, 8500 Beverly Blvd., Los
Angeles, has plenty of cool stores and is a great place for star
sightings, but parking can be pricey.
</P>
<P>
   So, Miz Hot Tips was impressed that there's free parking today
and Sunday if you stop by the mall's information desk for parking
validation. While you're there, see California's first DKNY store,
as well as the new A/X Armani Exchange, Williams Sonoma Grand
Cuisine (with an oil and vinegar tasting bar), and the Montblanc
boutique that carries so much more than just pens.

STRESS TO IMPRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dinner for a few friends _ how hard can that be?
</P>
<P>
   A few containers of Chinese takeout, a six-pack of beer, and
everybody has a great time. No muss, no fuss, no big bucks.
</P>
<P>
   But here come the holidays, with the (mostly self-imposed)
pressure to be especially festive, to decorate, to offer enormous
spreads of home-cooked food, to invite small armies of people _
some of whom you haven't seen since last winter _ to your spotless
home.
</P>
<P>
   Demands like that can send the most social creature looking for
a place to hide until after New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those who can afford party planning starting at
$100,000 a pop can place a call to international caterer, party
planner and lifestyle artist-to-the-stars Colin Cowie, who has
designed lavish events ranging from Hugh Hefner's wedding to
parties for Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, from corporate to-do's
for Fortune 500 companies to elaborate balls for megabucks
charities.
</P>
<P>
   But most folks, who live paycheck to paycheck, can have just as
good a time taking Cowie's free advice on how to make a home a
welcoming haven for family and friends on a budget of both time and
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Style has got nothing to do with money,'' declares Cowie, who
has homes and offices in both Los Angeles and New York. ``You can
take a great casserole and some wine and make a great evening out
of it. I sometimes entertain five evenings a week, and that's how I
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick to successful entertaining, Cowie is convinced, is
planning and thought _ and an unofficial motto: ``Keep it simple;
keep it easy; do it early; keep it organized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you leave everything to the last minute, ... it becomes
an effort rather than a pleasure to have friends over,'' said
Cowie, who has written two books on entertaining and has another on
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be frazzled and exhausted when your guests arrive, and
when the host or hostess spends the evening in the kitchen, nobody
has a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to plan every detail well in advance so when your
guests arrive, everything is taken care of. Then all you've got to
do is open the door and smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Planning for a holiday event includes picking a date for your
party, deciding what kind of event to have (a casual dinner, formal
dinner party, open house, tree-trimming party), figuring out how
many guests you can comfortably host, and compiling a guest list.
Issue invitations, then plan the menu and make shopping and to-do
lists: one for perishable items; one for nonperishable items and
staples; one for wine or liquor; one for flowers or other niceties;
one for needed serving pieces, chairs and other items you may need
to rent or borrow.
</P>
<P>
   Shop early, leaving only truly last-minute items until the last
minute, Cowie advises. And take care of housecleaning chores
several days in advance so all that's needed on party day is a
quick swipe with a sponge, a dust cloth and the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy a centerpiece for your dinner or buffet table, but
it's almost always cheaper to make it yourself using fresh flowers,
fresh fruits, nuts, candles and other items you may have stashed
around the house, Cowie says.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate, he quickly lined a trumpet-shaped glass dish
with moss, piled in a half-dozen pomegranates covered in glued-on
copper leaf from an art store, then filled the bowl with red pears
and apples. As a finishing touch, he tucked in a few brick-colored
roses, kept fresh in tiny water-filled vials hidden among the
fruit, and sprinkled copper-painted unshelled walnuts over the top
and spilling onto the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now then, that wasn't rocket science, was it?'' Cowie inquired
with a grin. ``That took 10 minutes, and it's beautiful. Anybody
could do that. It cost probably not over $20. And it'll last for
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The table setting was completed with simple placemats,
chocolate-brown and gold china, silverware and brick-colored cloth
napkins folded atop the plates, each topped with a single
copper-painted walnut as a kind of visual exclamation point. A
small army of votive candleholders, each ringed at the top with a
glued-on strip of copper leaf, marched down the center of the
table, the flickering of the candles reflected in a giant wall
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The effect, in just a few minutes, was warm, welcoming, not too
fussy and perfect for a fall dinner _ maybe Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about presentation,'' Cowie said. ``I think the key
is to make it look effortless. You should never look like you're
trying too hard, because that makes people uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowie has become expert in making people feel at ease. Born in
Zambia and raised in South Africa, with no television and few
outlets for entertainment, ``we learned to entertain ourselves, and
we did that by giving dinner parties,'' he said. ``My parents
entertained a lot, and I learned from them.''
</P>
<P>
   He was style-conscious from an early age, a precociousness his
parents indulged.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the other kids were out playing, I was rearranging the
furniture,'' he said with a laugh. ``That was fun for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Grown up, he worked as general manager of a hotel and spa in
South Africa, and as food consultant for a variety of restaurants
in the United Kingdom and Holland. He created his catering
business, Colin Cowie Lifestyle, and moved its headquarters in 1984
to Los Angeles, his base of operations for planning parties,
weddings and other celebrations thrown for Kenny G, Lisa Kudrow,
Charlie Sheen, Placido Domingo, Bloomingdale's, Champagne Veuve
Clicquot and A&AMP;M Arista Records. He also produced the Council of
Fashion Designers of America awards presentation in 1997 and the
last two Elton John AIDS Foundation Oscar parties.
</P>
<P>
   In between parties, he has served as a style consultant to the
Regent Hotel Group's Australian properties and to the private
island resort of Wakaya in Fiji. In his spare time, he appeared on
``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' ``48 Hours'' and other shows, hawking
his laid-back attitude toward style and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   And in July, the man many term ``the male Martha Stewart'' began
appearing in a half-hour television show _ ``Everyday Elegance With
Colin Cowie'' _ on AMC's Romance Classics (10 p.m. Thursdays),
showing reluctant hosts and hostesses that entertaining at home
isn't that hard to do.
</P>
<P>
   Many people don't entertain because they fear it'll cost too
much, they don't have time and they don't have any special cooking
or decorating ability, Cowie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people want is a formula for entertaining, and that's
what I give them,'' he said. ``I just love entertaining. It's fun
to create and make people feel special in your home.''
</P>
<P>
   For the holidays, that might mean picking a color scheme or
theme and carrying it out in your decorations, which you can make
yourself with scraps of fabric, spray paint, glitter, greenery and
even burnt-out light bulbs; baking special cookies or traditional
family dishes; putting special thought into buying personal, but
less-than-lavish gifts; using a special flair in wrapping packages;
and sharing your skills _ and your holiday spirit _ with friends
and family.
</P>
<P>
   As for worrying that whatever you do won't be perfect, forget
it, Cowie counsels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertaining's not about being perfect,'' declares Cowie.
``Perfect sets too-high expectations and takes away the fun. You
always try to do your best, and that's enough. Remember,
entertaining your friends isn't about impressing anybody. It's
about having a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyday Elegance Holiday Special With Colin Cowie,''
featuring entertaining and decorating tips for the holiday season,
will be shown at 5 and 10 p.m. Dec. 9 on Romance Classics.
</P>
<P>

recipes from the holiday special, at: www.romanceclassics.com. For

 &HT;    CHINESE VILLAGERS STRIKE OUT AT LOCAL COMMUNIST IN 'MODEL'
ELECTION
 &HT;    With photos placed in the International folder on the Cox
Server.
 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of a locator map, the village of Ya Ai is
located 50 miles S-SW of the city of Changsha, China.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   YA AI VILLAGE, China _ Villagers struck out last week at the
local communist who is their village chairman, turning out en masse
to wield secret ballots in a rain-drenched schoolyard polling
place.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of grassroots protest that unnerves China's
ruling Communist Party, especially since it occurred in a ``model''
village election, witnessed by more than 150 Chinese elections
observers and two advisers from the Atlanta-based Carter Center,
founded by former President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The rain not only turned the ground at the outdoor polling
center into inch-thick red clay sludge. It also dripped inside
voting booths and seeped into the cardboard ballot boxes,
apparently smearing scores of ballots. The village election
committee declared more than one-fourth of the votes ``invalid,''
throwing the final outcome into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   One result was clear: the incumbent village boss ran third,
behind a surprisingly strong showing by a maverick village
businessman who campaigned as an unauthorized write-in candidate.
Another village communist also ran ahead of the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest of the elections -- some fair, some cooked --
held at the rock-bottom rung of governance in China's 930,000
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday's election, which drew more than 98 percent of Ya
Ai villagers over 18, was the second time in 12 days that the local
Communist Party branch got a sample of those nasty surprise punches
that democratic processes can land on a ruling elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course to villagers the village committee is more important
than the Communist Party,'' explained Peng Bi Wu, a 36-year-old
mother and farmer in this rice-growing village in southern China.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last week's embarrassment, however, the local communists
could ultimately salvage victory.
</P>
<P>
   For this is democracy ``with Chinese characteristics,'' a
process begun experimentally a decade ago when Deng Xiaoping was
the communist ruler in Beijing. The purpose of village elections
still is to let off just enough steam to insure stability in the
sometimes raucous and unpredictable countryside, where 900 million
of China's 1.2 billion people live.
</P>
<P>
   However it turns out, the election in Ya Ai was supposed to be a
model for three busloads of observers who bounced up dirt roads,
past the dripping flowers of tea-oil camellia bushes, to view this
first balloting held under China's newly revised village election
law.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing this election was part of a training program for
bureaucrats of Hunan Province, a rolling expanse of rivers and rice
fields with 64.6 million people. Carter Center experts were on hand
to teach them how to computerize data for a pilot project that
ultimately aims to give a nationwide picture of how Chinese
villagers vote.
</P>
<P>
   Before observing the election, the provincial officials heard
two days of the Chinese Communist party line on how to carry out
the new law, which is an amalgam of democratic formulas on majority
rule and secret ballots, combined with a bedrock principle that the
party should play ``a core role in leadership'' in village
self-government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party's leadership of village work is the reality of
China. It is indisputable that the party leads all,'' lectured
Zhang Mingliang, director of the basic level government of the
Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   His comments buttressed the views of foreign skeptics such as
Merle Goldman, professor of Chinese history at Boston University,
who has said that a primary purpose of village elections is to make
peasants more accepting of unpopular tax and birth control
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The villagers vote for village committees, but they do not
have any control over the real leaders in the village, the party
committee, whose members and head are appointed by the upper
level,'' she said in an e-mail interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Ya Ai election process may well turn out to prove her point.
</P>
<P>
   The nominating procedure called ``haixuan'' (''sea election'')
allows every villager to make a nomination. Then the village
representative assembly, whose 32 members are selected by groups of
neighboring households, listens to candidate speeches and picks the
finalists listed on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Huang Guo Fang is the upstart non-party member who put his name
before the ``haixuan'' (pronounced ``high-shuwan''), writing in his
self-nominating petition that he is a man ``of the masses'' running
a successful construction materials company. Huang, 49, pledged he
would neither take a salary nor spend a yuan of village money on
the notorious banquets that villagers across China resent.
</P>
<P>
   In the first surprise to the local communist leadership, Huang
pulled 213 ``haixuan'' nominations, the most anyone received. It
was 99 more than the next highest, which went to incumbent Liu Fu
Quan. However, the village assembly somehow ditched Huang and chose
incumbent Liu, a party member, and Wan Bing Kang, a member of the
party executive committee, as the two official candidates on the
ballot for village committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   On election day last Wednesday, the villagers showed they were
not amused. The upstart Huang got 180 write-in votes. Of the
official candidates listed on the ballot, Wan got 192 votes and Liu
174.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it probably was a protest vote because Huang was not
on the ballot,'' said Yawei Liu, associate director of the Carter
Center project on Chinese Village Elections. ``I think it was a
fair process.''
</P>
<P>
   Villagers may have a chance at a run-off election within three
months, although it remains unclear who the candidates will be.

   MOSCOW _ Russia's pressing task is as old as winter: Find a way
to stay fed and unfrozen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the country must do it under severe economic pressure
following the onset of Russia's economic crisis in mid-August. The
crash of the ruble has sent the average Russian income to $40 a
month; most Russians survive by cutting luxuries like meat from
their diet and surviving on vegetables they grow in their own
gardens and pickle for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   At greatest risk are the 12 million Russians living in the
country's northern and far eastern regions; remote areas near and
above the Arctic Circle that have always depended on help to
survive. Mainly mining and fishing outposts, the towns were founded
in Soviet times, but post-Communist Russia is struggling to keep
them supplied.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the economic crisis and unpaid bills, deliveries of
food and fuel were slow to arrive before the ports froze over. Now
the harbors are solid ice and Russia's fleet of ice-breaking cargo
ships, a traditional means of supplying the northern mining towns,
is broken down.
</P>
<P>
   The governors of Yakutia and Murmansk, among other regions, have
declared states of emergency. The region of Kamchatka prepared a
direct appeal to the United Nations. The Far East city of Magadan
said at the end of October that it had only enough food supplies to
last a month and had received only 16 percent of its coal supplies
for winter.
</P>
<P>
   Among the aid to help Russia through its winter:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The United States has pledged $625 million to supply grain,
meat, milk, soybeans and other food assistance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The European Union has offered $472 million worth of food aid.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Red Cross has requested donations of $15 million to supply
emergency aid to the following regions it designated as the hardest
hit:
</P>
<P>
   1. Kaliningrad
</P>
<P>
   2. Murmansk

   PETROPAVLOVSK-KAMCHATSKY, Russia _ At Public School 17, students
and teachers are bundled in winter coats and thick wool sweaters.
Each breath fogs in the frigid air as they recite grammar lessons.
The potted plants on the window sill, intended to add some life to
the drab classroom, are frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a thick blanket of snow already covers the remote
Kamchatka peninsula in Russia's Far East. Temperatures have been
below freezing for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the school on a recent November morning, the mercury
wasn't much higher, because after weeks of numbing cold, the
heating came on for the first time this season only hours ago.
</P>
<P>
   Winter arrives early and hard in this Pacific port city, and
throughout Russia's remote regions in the Arctic, central Siberia
and the Far East. Russia's economic crisis and the annual arrival
of ice and snow are a dangerous combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live like primitive people. No heat. No lights. No money.
Things are awful. The coming 21st century doesn't matter in
Kamchatka. It matters only in other countries. Here it is the 19th
century,'' complained Oxana Ivanova, 17, a student at P.S. 17.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, fuel shortages cut heat and electricity to
homes, businesses and schools and caused several deaths on
Kamchatka, nine times zones and 5,000 miles east of Moscow. Similar
shortages have hit other remote areas and forced evacuations as the
government in Moscow cannot afford to supply food and fuel.
</P>
<P>
   At Public School 17, perched on a ridge in the shadow of a
dramatic range of snow-peaked volcanic mountains that meet the
Pacific Ocean, heat and lights were restored this week, as they
were to most parts of Kamchatka, a peninsula roughly the size of
California and home to 400,000 Russians.
</P>
<P>
   But for weeks, temperatures inside apartments, classrooms and
offices dipped below 45 degrees as winter storms descended. Lacking
fuel to run two main power plants, electricity was rationed to
three hours a day and the central heating network, which supplies
virtually every building on the peninsula with steam heat, was not
turned on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about such conditions from my grandfather and now this
year I found myself in such terrible times,'' said Ludmilla
Nanovskaya, an English teacher at P.S. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Adding financial anxiety to the aching cold, the region's
teachers have not been paid since the school year began on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity and heat began flowing -- at least for now -- after
embarrassed authorities in Moscow acknowledged the emergency and
ordered 10,000 tons of fuel oil from the Pacific navy fleet's
reserves to feed the peninsula's power plants.
</P>
<P>
   They were goaded to the task after the local Kamchatka
legislature drafted and threatened to send a direct appeal for
humanitarian assistance to the United Nations. Other strapped and
suffering regions in Russia have made similar appeals, an ominous
and awkward reminder to the Kremlin of the country's vulnerability
as four months of brutal winter begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until this problem is solved we will continue to work from
crisis to crisis,'' said Yevgeny Klochkov, director of
Kamchatskenergo, the local utility that provides heat and
electricity to the peninsula. ``The problem is not resolved for the
entire winter because we do not have the cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian weather forecasters have predicted the harshest winter
in 30 years. This discouraging news came amid last month's report
that Russia's grain harvest was nearly half the levels of 1997 and
the worst in 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the economic crash of August, which sent the ruble
plummeting, has made more than half of all Russians poor. According
to the Russian Center of the Standard of Living, 79 million
Russians now live in poverty, out of a total population of 147
million.
</P>
<P>
   To help alleviate concerns about food supplies, the United
States and Russia last week reached a deal to ship 3.1 million tons
of American food aid, including grain and meat -- about half of it
in the form of direct aid.
</P>
<P>
   Here by the sea in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky there are no food
shortages. But as in much of Russia, food is out of reach with the
country's economy in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has this problem. There are things to buy but no one
is buying because no one can afford it. So people grow their own,''
said Olga Kosmynina, editor of the local Rybak Kamchatsky
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia's economic crisis erupted in mid-August, her paper
has been running a regular ``how to survive'' feature -- such as
tips on how to pickle cabbage for the winter and how to better seal
your windows from the icy winter winds.
</P>
<P>
   The predicament in Kamchatka was caused by a chain reaction that
reflects the paralysis of Russia's economy today, not quite a free
market and not quite the welfare state of Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, virtually bankrupt, cannot pay the
military, the largest single consumer of energy in Kamchatka, which
is dotted with naval and air force bases. Thus, the military cannot
pay the local utility, which has amassed $146 million in debts and
was unable to buy fuel to run its plants.
</P>
<P>
   Until mid-November, people read by candlelight and there was no
hot water. They slept in their parkas and wool caps. The school day
and business hours were cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   This in a country that is the world's premier producer of
natural gas and on a peninsula seething with active volcanoes --
geothermal energy just waiting to be tapped. Plans call for a new
gas pipeline and geothermal plants, but construction has been
hampered by Russia's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The perplexing irony is that if this region were gauged by its
natural resources, geography and educated populace, it would be
rich. The peninsula and the surrounding waters are bountiful in
seafood and deposits of gold, copper and nickel. Kamchatka is
nearer to Tokyo and Anchorage than to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, such outposts were supported by the communist
government, who settled the remote regions to fortify the empire
and exploit the natural resources. But post-Soviet Russia, rife
with corruption, struggling to reform its economy and nearly out of
cash, finds it increasingly difficult to subsidize the regions.
</P>
<P>
   Russian lawmakers have called for the evacuation of over 1
million residents of the worst-hit areas. Heating fuel rations and
electricity cuts also have reached the Yakutia region in
northeastern Siberia and Sakhalin Island, Chukotka and Koryak on
Russia's northern Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   In Kamchatka and elsewhere, Russians approach the coming winter
with docile forbearance, relying on food they have grown during the
summer to last them through the winter.
</P>

   YA AI VILLAGE, China _ Villagers struck out last week at the
local communist who is their village chairman, turning out en masse
to wield secret ballots in a rain-drenched schoolyard polling
place.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sort of grassroots protest that unnerves China's
ruling Communist Party, especially since it occurred in a ``model''
village election, witnessed by more than 150 Chinese elections
observers and two advisers from the Atlanta-based Carter Center,
founded by former President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The rain not only turned the ground at the outdoor polling
center into inch-thick red clay sludge. It also dripped inside
voting booths and seeped into the cardboard ballot boxes,
apparently smearing scores of ballots. The village election
committee declared more than one-fourth of the votes ``invalid,''
throwing the final outcome into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   One result was clear: the incumbent village boss ran third,
behind a surprisingly strong showing by a maverick village
businessman who campaigned as an unauthorized write-in candidate.
Another village communist also ran ahead of the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest of the elections -- some fair, some cooked --
held at the rock-bottom rung of governance in China's 930,000
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday's election, which drew more than 98 percent of Ya
Ai villagers over 18, was the second time in 12 days that the local
Communist Party branch got a sample of those nasty surprise punches
that democratic processes can land on a ruling elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course to villagers the village committee is more important
than the Communist Party,'' explained Peng Bi Wu, a 36-year-old
mother and farmer in this rice-growing village in southern China.
</P>
<P>
   Despite last week's embarrassment, however, the local communists
could ultimately salvage victory.
</P>
<P>
   For this is democracy ``with Chinese characteristics,'' a
process begun experimentally a decade ago when Deng Xiaoping was
the communist ruler in Beijing. The purpose of village elections
still is to let off just enough steam to insure stability in the
sometimes raucous and unpredictable countryside, where 900 million
of China's 1.2 billion people live.
</P>
<P>
   However it turns out, the election in Ya Ai was supposed to be a
model for three busloads of observers who bounced up dirt roads,
past the dripping flowers of tea-oil camellia bushes, to view this
first balloting held under China's newly revised village election
law.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing this election was part of a training program for
bureaucrats of Hunan Province, a rolling expanse of rivers and rice
fields with 64.6 million people. Carter Center experts were on hand
to teach them how to computerize data for a pilot project that
ultimately aims to give a nationwide picture of how Chinese
villagers vote.
</P>
<P>
   Before observing the election, the provincial officials heard
two days of the Chinese Communist party line on how to carry out
the new law, which is an amalgam of democratic formulas on majority
rule and secret ballots, combined with a bedrock principle that the
party should play ``a core role in leadership'' in village
self-government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party's leadership of village work is the reality of
China. It is indisputable that the party leads all,'' lectured
Zhang Mingliang, director of the basic level government of the
Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   His comments buttressed the views of foreign skeptics such as
Merle Goldman, professor of Chinese history at Boston University,
who has said that a primary purpose of village elections is to make
peasants more accepting of unpopular tax and birth control
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The villagers vote for village committees, but they do not
have any control over the real leaders in the village, the party
committee, whose members and head are appointed by the upper
level,'' she said in an e-mail interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Ya Ai election process may well turn out to prove her point.
</P>
<P>
   The nominating procedure called ``haixuan'' (''sea election'')
allows every villager to make a nomination. Then the village
representative assembly, whose 32 members are selected by groups of
neighboring households, listens to candidate speeches and picks the
finalists listed on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Huang Guo Fang is the upstart non-party member who put his name
before the ``haixuan'' (pronounced ``high-shuwan''), writing in his
self-nominating petition that he is a man ``of the masses'' running
a successful construction materials company. Huang, 49, pledged he
would neither take a salary nor spend a yuan of village money on
the notorious banquets that villagers across China resent.
</P>
<P>
   In the first surprise to the local communist leadership, Huang
pulled 213 ``haixuan'' nominations, the most anyone received. It
was 99 more than the next highest, which went to incumbent Liu Fu
Quan. However, the village assembly somehow ditched Huang and chose
incumbent Liu, a party member, and Wan Bing Kang, a member of the
party executive committee, as the two official candidates on the
ballot for village committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   On election day last Wednesday, the villagers showed they were
not amused. The upstart Huang got 180 write-in votes. Of the
official candidates listed on the ballot, Wan got 192 votes and Liu
174.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it probably was a protest vote because Huang was not
on the ballot,'' said Yawei Liu, associate director of the Carter
Center project on Chinese Village Elections. ``I think it was a
fair process.''
</P>
<P>
   Villagers may have a chance at a run-off election within three
months, although it remains unclear who the candidates will be.

 &HT;    ISRAELI WITHDRAW FROM PARTS OF WEST BANK KEEPS WYE PROCESS ON
TRACK
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 650 words.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ For the first time in nearly two years, Israel
pulled its troops out of pockets of West Bank land Friday, moving
the peace process ahead, causing small Palestinian celebrations and
testing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal was the first land transfer proscribed under the
U.S.-brokered Wye Memorandum, signed a month ago to revive the
floundering Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter process has been marred by Palestinian terrorism and
controversial Israeli expansion of Jewish neighborhoods in the West
Bank. The troop withdrawal came four days later than planned under
Wye, and more than a year later than first envisioned under Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   It was the smallest of three withdrawals scheduled to occur
before February. Israeli leaders have said that each will be
dependent on Palestinian efforts to fight terrorism. It's sure to
stay a rocky process, but the withdrawal Friday could clear the way
for its next big event, an unprecedented visit to Gaza by President
Bill Clinton in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to see immediate effects of the withdrawal, carried
out largely on hills of farms and olive groves. No Israeli army
bases or Jewish neighborhoods had to be uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   But, by Friday evening, with the placement of large, brown and
yellow cement blocks and signs to mark the borders, both the
physical and political geography of the Middle East was slightly
altered.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1997, when Israel pulled out of most of the
Palestinian city of Hebron, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian National
Authority has had full control of 3 percent of the West Bank. In
another 24 percent, Israeli troops still patrolled but Palestinians
controlled civilian affairs, like elections and construction.
</P>
<P>
   With the new Israeli troop withdrawal, the area under full or
partial Palestinian control rises by two percentage points, to 29
percent of the West Bank. More significantly, Israeli troops pulled
completely out of 18 towns and villages that were under only
partial Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves about 10 percent of the West Bank under full
Palestinian control and 19 percent under partial control. The rest
of the West Bank is under full Israeli control and is home to
170,000 Jews who have moved in since Israel captured the land in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also released 250 Palestinian prisoners Friday, though
Palestinians objected that most were common criminals instead of
those jailed for politically-motivated acts.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinian politics, Friday provided progress that Arafat
can show his restless people as they inch toward their goal of
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Palestinian polling firm, support for the peace
process has increased from 66 percent before Wye to 75 percent now.
Support for armed resistance against Israel has dropped from a high
of 51 percent last month to 41 percent now. Most are still
impatient, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (withdrawal) brings hopes and expectations, but does not
fundamentally alter perceptions,'' said Khalil Shikaki, director of
the Center for Palestine Research and Studies.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the withdrawal highlights a deep division within the
country over how to handle the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis, tired of years as an occupying force, want to
relinquish large portions of the land to bring an end to the
conflict. Others, many of whom view the West Bank as land promised
to Jews by God, say Palestinians only want the land as one step
before taking over Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the settler movement, which has spearheaded the
Jewish building in the West Bank, wrote in an Israeli newspaper
that Friday was ``one of the worst days . . . in the inspiring
history of Zionism.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-winger Netanyahu himself used to oppose Oslo, but has
reluctantly continued the process despite constant threats from his
allies to topple his government.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, there is much greater proof that under certain
conditions, he is willing to give away the land of Israel,'' said
Israeli political scientist Efraim Inbar.
</P>
<P>
   Inbar noted that Netanyahu's popularity has increased with
Israelis in general in recent weeks. But support among his
hard-line coalition is slipping. This troop withdrawal almost did
not pass his cabinet's vote and there are new rumors that he will
seek to solidify support by calling for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has also had to beef up his personal security
recently. Thursday, an Israeli rabbi was arrested on accusations
that he was plotting some kind of attack against the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal only came after Netanyahu received assurances
from U.S. and Palestinian officials about the Palestinian
commitment to fight terrorism. While some say he is toying with
war, Netanyahu has driven a tougher bargain on Oslo than his
predecessors, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, giving away less
land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance,'' said Netanyahu spokesman David Bar-Illan,
``is that Netanyahu has kept his promise to adhere to Oslo and kept
his other promises to minimize its damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians counter that Netanyahu's fine line endangers the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep trying to make a balance between making peace with
us and peace with the extremists (in Israel). This is an impossible
balance,'' Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said. ``Now, they are
confronting the moment of truth.''

FILM ABOUT ELIZABETH I IS A ROYAL SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Riveting and occasionally ridiculous, ``Elizabeth'' offers a
fresh, highly entertaining view of the storied Virgin Queen who
presided over England's golden age.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of how she got the crown and consolidated her power is
far from golden _ it's an infernal descent into religious, national
and international politics that's thick with intrigue and death.
</P>
<P>
   The offbeat choice of director _ Indian filmmaker Shekhar Kapur
(``The Bandit Queen'') making his English-language debut _ suggests
that the producers wanted an outsider's perspective on this most
celebrated of British monarchs. They got it.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the kind of stodgy costume drama that often gets
shipped across the pond. It's thoroughly modern in spirit, not shy
of violence, and almost gleefully steeped in realpolitik as an
appealing young princess is transformed with startling quickness
into a remorseless, iron-fisted ruler who knows how to bide her
time, then strike hard.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in 1554 during the reign of Queen Mary I (Kathy
Burke), the Catholic daughter of Henry VIII who became known as
Bloody Mary for her ferocious treatment of Protestants _ the film
opens with a sequence of ``heretics'' being burned at the stake.
</P>
<P>
   This sickly, fearsome woman, who has produced no heir, is
desperate to keep her Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth (Cate
Blanchett), from the throne. She even drafts a death warrant for
the young woman, but can't bring herself to sign it. When Mary
dies, Elizabeth _ after some hardball maneuvering by her backers _
is crowned, and the film nicely conveys her ``now what?''
bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth, at 25, is brave and extremely bright, but has no
experience in court _ and, anyway, how could one possibly be
prepared for leading an impoverished and divided country that has
no army and faces a serious threat of invasion?
</P>
<P>
   Her chief adviser, Sir William Cecil (Richard Attenborough),
tells her she has no chance of surviving unless she marries either
the king of Spain, the most powerful man in the world at the time,
or the Duc d'Anjou, a giddy buffoon and brother of the French
monarch. Either choice would alienate Elizabeth's Protestant
subjects, but more importantly, she just isn't disposed to
sacrifice herself for national politics.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she shows a decided preference for her old friend, the
handsome Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes, Ralph's brother) _ they
dance a vigorous volta together in open court. The relationship
creates problems: The prurient are scandalized, and some royal
advisers are political opponents of Dudley. But Elizabeth is
free-spirited _ and just plain spirited. In anything that doesn't
compromise national security, she'll have her way; for example, she
indulges her fondness for the generally male pursuit of hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Plots and counterplots, assassination attempts, Vatican
machinations, home-grown enemies like the Duke of Norfolk
(Christopher Eccleston) and foreigners like Mary of Guise (Fanny
Ardant, gaily decked in armor), who assembles a French army on the
Scottish border, keep raising the ante.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered young queen turns to her amoral chief spy, Sir
Francis Walsingham (a quietly sinister Geoffrey Rush), to protect
her and, increasingly, to take the offensive. Walsingham is a
fascinating figure, a master manipulator and enforcer skilled at
politics and murder, totally devoted to his queen.
</P>
<P>
   Kapur has assembled a remarkably fine cast, led by Blanchett,
the Australian actress who registered strongly in ``Oscar &AMP;
Lucinda.'' When striking a pose, her Elizabeth cuts an ethereal,
Pre-Raphaelite figure, but when she speaks or moves, a different
character emerges: a vigorous, keenly intelligent and self-assured
young woman who soon grows wise in worldly matters.
</P>
<P>
   It's an exceptional performance, and when Blanchett emerges at
the end in full regalia as the chilly, untouchable and all-powerful
Queen Elizabeth of traditional iconography, it's an extraordinary
moment.
</P>
<P>
   The director also employs his camera in a kinetic way that
creates excitement missing in traditional costume epics. But
occasionally Kapur pushes too hard to break out of the bounds: some
of the gauzier scenes between Elizabeth and Dudley; Mary of Guise's
insouciance; and the comically over-the-top scene in which the Duc
d'Anjou's unusual taste in entertainment is exposed, undermine the
director's effort. In appearance, the film is quite striking, and
the art director seems to have taken a cue from Elizabeth's
remarkable hair and employed dazzling orange/red tones to break up
the frequently dark settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' is history rendered with enough brains and
imagination to more than make up for its few stumbles.

Jewish building in the West Bank, wrote in an Israeli newspaper
that Friday was ``one of the worst days . . . in the inspiring
history of Zionism.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-winger Netanyahu himself used to oppose Oslo, but has
reluctantly continued the process despite constant threats from his
allies to topple his government.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, there is much greater proof that under certain
conditions, he is willing to give away the land of Israel,'' said
Israeli political scientist Efraim Inbar.
</P>
<P>
   Inbar noted that Netanyahu's popularity has increased with
Israelis in general in recent weeks. But support among his
hard-line coalition is slipping. This troop withdrawal almost did
not pass his cabinet's vote and there are new rumors that he will
seek to solidify support by calling for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has also had to beef up his personal security
recently. Thursday, an Israeli rabbi was arrested on accusations
that he was plotting some kind of attack against the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal only came after Netanyahu received assurances
from U.S. and Palestinian officials about the Palestinian
commitment to fight terrorism. While some say he is toying with
war, Netanyahu has driven a tougher bargain on Oslo than his
predecessors, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, giving away less
land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance,'' said Netanyahu spokesman David Bar-Illan,
``is that Netanyahu has kept his promise to adhere to Oslo and kept
his other promises to minimize its damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians counter that Netanyahu's fine line endangers the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep trying to make a balance between making peace with
us and peace with the extremists (in Israel). This is an impossible
balance,'' Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said. ``Now, they are
confronting the moment of truth.''

ARKANSAS LAWMAKER COULD BE IMPEACHMENT BELLWETHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 22)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You may not need a weatherman to tell which way the
wind blows, but you may be able to observe Rep. Asa Hutchinson,
R-Ark., and predict whether the House Judiciary Committee's vote on
impeaching President Clinton will be a strictly party-line
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, a 47-year-old former federal prosecutor who has
represented the Ozark Mountain region of northwestern Arkansas for
the last two years, is one of the few members of that fractious
panel whose vote is not a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   While most of his public statements bear the imprint of a
Republican hard-liner intent on pushing the case against Clinton,
Hutchinson has shown that he is willing to buck party heavyweights
on issues he considers important. For instance, he has supported
greater limits on campaign spending, a no-no in GOP circles.
</P>
<P>
   The public's perception of the impeachment process as either a
credible constitutional exercise or a kangaroo court could well
ride on centrist Judiciary members such as Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   The committee vote is expected within three weeks, and his
position promises to be an important measure of Republicans' unity
on an issue they find increasingly fraught with political peril.
</P>
<P>
   The party lost five seats in the House Nov. 3 in a contest
widely viewed as a referendum on the GOP's pursuit of Clinton.
While Hutchinson easily won re-election with 81 percent of the
vote, he still worries: Should impeachment be a ``just-the-facts''
judicial process or should lawmakers do the political math and
simply make the Monica-and-Bill saga go away?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very, very difficult,'' Hutchinson said in an
interview. Polls showing a lack of public appetite for impeachment
led Judiciary Republicans to streamline the hearings, but
Hutchinson insists that public opinion will have no bearing on
``any ultimate conclusion that we reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hutchinson can't turn a blind eye to the Senate, where his
older brother Tim is the junior senator from Arkansas. A House vote
in favor of impeachment would send the matter to the Senate, where
Republicans are 12 votes short of the two-thirds majority required
for removing a president from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have the votes in the Senate, it is difficult to
put the country through this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's 12-hour impeachment hearing, Hutchinson
sidestepped the political vitriol of both sides in favor of
detailed questions aimed at deriving facts.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr if he could prosecute
Clinton in federal court for perjury and obstruction of justice. If
so, would he have to wait until Clinton leaves office? Is former
Democratic fundraiser John Huang a relevant witness? (Huang, a key
player in questions about financing Clinton's 1996 re-election
campaign, is cooperating with Starr.)
</P>
<P>
   Starr declined to give specific answers to these questions. But
it was one of the evening's more sober exchanges, and the
congressman made no effort to either tear Starr down or prop him
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in the country want to get this behind us ... I
think that's established,'' Hutchinson told Starr. ``(If) the
independent counsel initiates criminal prosecution against the
president, I don't see how that gets (this) behind us. I think
that's a heavy issue that I know you have to weigh, as well as this
committee.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anyone else among the committee's 21 Republicans and
16 Democrats, Hutchinson has a past that is intertwined with
Clinton's. He occupies the seat that Clinton, in his first
political outing, ran for and lost in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. attorney in Arkansas, Hutchinson prosecuted Clinton's
brother Roger in 1985 on cocaine-related charges. The younger
Clinton was sentenced to two years in prison. After Clinton became
president, he told Hutchinson that the prosecution had saved his
brother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson was chairman of the Republican Party in Arkansas from
1990 to 1995, a period in which Clinton went from governor and
adversary-in-chief to president. The congressman said he respects
``Clinton's abilities and what he's accomplished in life,'' but
insists he won't let their past encounters enter into his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment partisans and analysts will watch closely how
Hutchinson reconciles the political and legal dimensions of the
impeachment process. Friends insist he has not made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's extremely mindful of his duties as a Judiciary member,
but Asa is a very astute political observer as well,'' said Richard
Bearden, executive director of the Arkansas Republican Party. ``He
understands there may be a conflict in the mind of the public as to
what Congress is required to do constitutionally and what
sentiments are in terms of how people voted on Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Hutchinson cited statements by Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., the committee's chairman, that impeachment must be
bipartisan in nature. ``If we can't achieve that, that's certainly
a factor to be weighed'' when voting whether or not to approve
articles of impeachment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the committee began its impeachment inquiry last month,
Hutchinson has been a part of a small group of Republican and
Democratic Judiciary members searching for a middle ground on
impeachment or, at a minimum, trying to ensure that the committee's
probe is fair.
</P>
<P>
   Other participants include Reps. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; Howard
Berman, D-Calif.; Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., and James Rogan, R-Calif.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hutchinson first made a national name for himself in 1985 when
he prosecuted members of the white supremacist organization known
as the Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord. Five of the
group's leaders served prison terms for violating federal firearms
statutes.
</P>
<P>
   He lost a bid for a Senate seat in 1986 and a race for state
attorney general in 1990 before heading the Arkansas Republican
Party, which had been a low-budget operation in what was then a
staunchly Democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Republicans in Arkansas credit Hutchinson with elevating
the party's profile, promoting more aggressive campaigning in state
legislative races and raising a record amount of money. Finally, in
1996 he captured the seat in Congress that had been occupied by his
brother Tim, who won his Senate race that year.

YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THE LAST OF RANDY NEWMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; If Randy Newman's subtly outrageous songs were
living things, they'd be sneaky little vipers that creep up on
unsuspecting listeners and bite their ankles.
</P>
<P>
   His canon includes the deeply sardonic cabaret of ``Lonely at
the Top,'' the dark, bawdy rock track ``You Can Leave Your Hat
On,'' the widely misunderstood ``Short People,'' and ``God's Song
(That's Why I Love Mankind),'' in which God is presented not as
vindictive or cruel but intentionally oblivious to mankind's
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, who recently played a rare solo gig to open a five-night
festival of film music presented by New York's Knitting Factory,
has penned soundtracks since the '80s for such movies as
``Ragtime,'' ``Parenthood,'' ``Toy Story,'' ``The Natural'' and,
lately, ``Pleasantville'' and ``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   His uncle, Alfred Newman, was an accomplished composer who wrote
the 20th Century Fox march. Two other uncles, Emil and Lionel
Newman, also composed and conducted film scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible gene pool in his family,'' said session
singer Valerie Carter, who first worked with Newman on ``It's Money
That I Love'' from his 1977 top-10 album, ``Little Criminals,'' and
most recently on the ``A Bug's Life'' soundtrack. ``Some of my
favorite black-and-white films were scored by his uncles. And while
their styles are very different, there's a Newman thread running
through all those incredibly talented relatives of his. But I think
he got the mother lode of the talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman's songs and scores invoke a broad musical sophistication
that includes hints of gospel, Tin Pan Alley, blues and country.
His inspirations range from Fats Domino, Stephen Foster, Chopin and
Hoagy Carmichael to Gershwin, Weill and Copland.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, his playful and often savagely funny 1995
treatment of Goethe's ``Faust'' was greeted with resounding
indifference from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Newman did cut the unofficial theme song of Los Angeles,
``I Love L.A.,'' even though the average pop fan hasn't the
slightest idea who he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I meet a musician, they know his work and rave about
it,'' said Jim Coan, 29, a Tucson, Ariz.-based graduate student who
runs a Web site devoted to Newman. ``Randy is important on so many
levels. His film work is sensational, and his songs and lyrics
result in real timeless art, something that hardly ever happens in
modern pop music.''
</P>
<P>
   A new 105-track, four-CD anthology of Newman's work, ``Guilty:
30 Years of Randy Newman'' (Rhino/WaNewmaner Archives), includes
tunes that blend pop, romanticism and Americana while tugging at
the heartstrings. But his songs can also reflect more twists and
turns than the sun-baked roads that lead through the Hollywood
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's latest project was scoring ``A Bug's Life,'' the new
Disney/Pixar computer-animated film that opens nationwide
Wednesday. He also wrote ``That'll Do,'' a song performed by Peter
Gabriel for the upcoming ``Babe'' sequel, ``Babe: Pig in the
City.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman, 54, is currently finishing a new album, ``Bad Love,''
his first pop album in 10 years and his first for the DreamWorks
label after leaving Warners _ his recording home of 30 years.
Mitchell Froom is producing.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, who has been nominated for 10 Academy Awards without
ever winning, has three adult sons, one of whom, Amos, works for
Glen Ballard's Java label. We met with Newman at the Westwood
offices of Rhino Records.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can we expect from the new album?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are a couple of historical songs, more historical then
I've ever written. It's hard to describe but one's called ``The
Great Nations of Europe,'' one's called ``The World Isn't Fair.''
There are four or five songs about bad love _ ``Better Off Dead''
is one of them. A couple songs are very close to being
autobiographical. There's a country song called ``A Big Hat No
Cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why the title ``Bad Love''?
</P>
<P>
   A: At the moment I have a few songs with that theme. It could
change if I think of something else. But at the moment, that's it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why'd you exit Warners after 30 years?
</P>
<P>
   A: I left because I didn't know anyone there anymore. And I
wasn't happy with what they did with ``Faust.'' It should have done
a little better than it did. I mean, I wouldn't expect it to sell
half a million, but it did like 80,000. They did nothing as far as
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you view the state of the music industry?
</P>
<P>
   A: With (computerized sales calculator) Soundscan, it's brutal.
There's no room for fantasy anymore. They can't tell you, ``Oh, we
shipped 6,500 to Charlotte,'' because you can actually see you sold
two records there and you know the two people who bought it. It's
too real for show business. When I started in this business, I
didn't expect that kind of accurate quantification. Now, you see
albums on the charts that drop off a week later forever. And they
discovered how many albums country music is selling. I like the
fact that it's real, but I don't like being subjected to it. I know
I'm destined for that kind of fate unless I have a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How about a&AMP;r (talent acquisition) departments?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the old days, there was no intrusion from them whatsoever.
Nobody was telling Ry Cooder or Little Feat or me to do this, that
or the other. I think a&AMP;r departments have become more involved,
let's say. They can now tell a group like Aerosmith to go in and do
this again. And I assume they can do it to me, but I'd rather be
left alone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of feeling are you getting about DreamWorks?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, you know (longtime friend and record executive) Lenny
Waronker is there and that's why I'm there. That's the only reason.
My manager tells me they've hired some good people over there. I've
never known anything about how things work after I've made the
record.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did you first see yourself scoring films?
</P>
<P>
   A: I saw myself doing this at an early age, at 5 and 6. At that
time, songwriter-artist didn't exist as a genre. For a while, I was
trying to be Carole King and write songs for people and not doing
as well as her, but it's been a gradual process of acquiring
confidence. It is for everybody. Film composers in general are not
an overconfident lot. Some are, but it's only recently I'm feeling
that I have an increased technical confidence, that if I can do
something like ``A Bug's Life,'' I can do anything. That's about as
hard as they get.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was difficult about the ``A Bug's Life'' score?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's an action-animated picture, a combination that is almost
the most difficult combination to deal with. It's animated people
engaging in chases. There was a little of it in ``Toy Story,'' but
more of it in this. So, it's moving at a mile a minute. Just the
sheer amount of notes, let alone getting the ideas for it, is
difficult. Plus, they wanted themes ahead of time that were sort of
memorable. I had to think of themes that also would have some
utility, that I could go some distance with to cover two minutes
of, say, grasshopper chasing ant. It's an excuse for not having a
life. It's sitting at the piano for 12 to 14 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did you do differently this time?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was a big orchestra. I hadn't used eight horns before and
I had six trumpets at times and some fairly exotic percussion. It's
a more dissonant score than I've written before. Some of it would
stand as 20th-century music, like Bartok on a bad day. I used some
kazoos to cheese it up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who were the kazoo players?
</P>
<P>
   A: Wind players; guys that weren't busy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does the film biz compare to music?
</P>
<P>
   A: You are definitely an employee. The focus isn't on you, which
is as it should be because music's not the most important thing
about the motion picture business. And you have a boss, the
director, who's on top of the score today much more than they were
in my uncles' day. I've been fortunate in ``A Bug's Life'' and
``Toy Story'' that they essentially left me alone. Making a songs
record, no one's ever told me what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are your favorite original tunes?
</P>
<P>
   A: In terms of quality, I always think of ``Davy the Fat Boy''
(1968), an obscure song from the first album I ever made. There's a
song on this new album called ``Miss You'' that's a good one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How about some of the cover versions of your songs?
</P>
<P>
   A: There have been good ones and there have been indifferent
ones. They've provided much of my living for a number of years, so
I'm grateful for them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you were starting out today, do you think you'd be signed
as a singer-songwriter?
</P>
<P>
   A: It would be a close call. I believe I might've gotten noticed
by someone ... but I'm less sure. There's still people looking for
people like me to some degree. But I'm not sure anyone would be
interested.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you keep up on the pop scene?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't and I should. I'm trying to do that now. When I'm
doing a picture, I listen to classical music. Now that I'm making a
record, I'll listen to KROQ or Star 98.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've been nominated for Oscars 10 times. One could assume
you will eventually get one, right?
</P>
<P>
   A: It'll probably be for something that's not necessarily
deserving. I don't know what it'll be for, but it doesn't always
have something to do with quality. Like, I get to vote for
cinematography and what do I know about cinematography? And what do
they know about music?
</P>
<P>
   Q: If you could do just one _ film music or original songs _
which would it be?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would just do songs but I would get more orchestra into
them. I think the last batch of songs I've written are as good as
any series of songs I've ever written for an album. And if I
thought I was getting worse, I'd quit. But you don't know if you're
getting worse, that's the thing. I also wrote a song about
that.!end! &QL;

FOOLS FOR `DANCING AT LUGHNASA'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ten years ago, Noel Pearson, then running Dublin's
celebrated Abbey Theatre, commissioned a new work from acclaimed
Irish playwright Brian Friel. Just as he had in so many of his
previous plays, Friel drew upon his own life and came up with
``Dancing at Lughnasa,'' a moving tribute to his mother's maiden
aunts. Pearson called it Friel's best work and predicted that the
play would premiere in Dublin, successfully move to London's West
End and then win over Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson even had the boldness (some termed it ``audacity'') to
say that ``Lughnasa'' would be made into a movie someday, just like
another production he had commissioned, ``My Left Foot.'' Friel
joked that Pearson's ``left foot'' had gone to his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's just Noel,'' says actress Brid Brennan, who
originated the role of one of the aunts in Dublin and followed the
play to Broadway two years later. ``No one took him seriously at
the time _ or at least they didn't until we were on Broadway. Then
we'd see all these Hollywood actresses out in the audience, and we
knew there might be something to all the talk.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, but it took another six years for ``Dancing at
Lughnasa'' to wind its way from the stage to the screen. And it
took the interest of a pre-eminent Hollywood actress who had never
seen Friel's poetic play, much less read it, to help make it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   When Meryl Streep read screenwriter Frank McGuinness' adaptation
of ``Lughnasa,'' she was struck by just how much he was able to
convey of the hardscrabble lives of the five Mundy sisters just by
showing the landscape and atmosphere of a poor Irish country
village.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the economically bleak 1930s, ``Lughnasa'' follows the
Mundys, who live in a hillside cottage in rural Donegal. The
controlling eldest sister Kate (Streep) is the only one educated
enough to have a job. The others _ dependable Agnes (Brennan),
fun-loving Maggie (Kathie Burke), simple-minded Rose (Sophie
Thompson) and single mother Christina (Catherine McCormack) _ do
what they can to help the family survive, tending the garden and
knitting gloves for a few spare pennies.
</P>
<P>
   It's a humdrum, bare-bones existence, but that all changes when
the Mundys' long-absent brother, a priest named Jack (Michael
Gambon), returns from Africa after spending 25 years there as a
missionary. The sisters proudly welcome Jack home, unaware that his
time in Africa has altered his faith in the Catholic Church. The
shift in Jack's mental outlook leads to the beginning of greater
changes in the Mundys' world, changes that don't always bode well
for the future of the family.
</P>
<P>
   The movie _ filmed on location in Ireland last summer _ succeeds
in capturing the play's melancholy magic while adding the
expansiveness of the Irish countryside. For Streep, that was reason
enough to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never seen the play, and I didn't go back and read it
until I knew what I was doing with my character,'' Streep says.
``What the screenplay does so well is suggest things, using subtext
to convey the greater meaning. The writing itself is quite spare,
relying quite a bit on visual details to tell the story.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason ``Lughnasa'' has always been such a hot movie
property has to do with its strong feminine voice. The work
includes five great parts for women, a rarity in a medium dominated
by movies that feature men playing with guns and electronic toys.
The meaty roles were a dream for the actresses and had side
benefits for other members of the cast as well. Rhys Ifans, who
plays the father of Christina's 8-year-old boy, says he loved
working with a female ensemble, even though the atmosphere on the
set often looked like ``the Spice Girls in tweed.'' (``In his
dreams,'' Brennan says, laughing.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all those great parts for women constitutes a big
reason so many theaters have done `Dancing at Lughnasa' all over
the world,'' Brennan adds. ``I met a director from the Royal
Theatre in Stockholm who told me that his actresses couldn't
believe their luck when they got to do this play.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Pat O'Connor (``Circle of Friends''), has known stage
producer Pearson for several years. (``In the same way everyone in
Ireland knows each other _ passing bottles of alcohol in the
night,'' O'Connor says jokingly.) He, too, jumped at the chance to
put his stamp on one of Ireland's most celebrated plays, although
he had to overcome playwright (and friend) Friel's misgivings about
turning his work into a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian's not gaga about the cinema,'' O'Connor says.
</P>
<P>
   Friel, though, professes to be gaga about the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film neither competes with the play nor attempts to
complement it,'' Friel says. ``What it does faithfully and
generously is, as filmmakers say, `open it up.' This allows us to
share the lives of the Mundy girls at a different level and in new
emotional and intellectual excursions. But the process is not a
license. It demands faithfulness to the original, a base camp from
which the expedition sets out; a necessary fealty if the characters
aren't lost to us, aren't lost to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Friel believes the Mundy sisters make out just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the producer, the director, the screenwriter _ and, of
course, all the wonderful actors were conscious of the need for
fealty,'' he says. ``But when they needed to venture beyond the
confines of a rural kitchen to make different explorations and
fresh discoveries, they did so with courage and sensitivity. For
that, I am most grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Streep, too, was grateful. Her appreciation, though, stemmed
from the chance to work on a movie that was as close to a
theatrical experience as a film can get. The 49-year-old actress
began her career in the theater, spending three years at the Yale
School of Drama before moving on to Joseph Papp's Public Theatre in
New York. She gave up stage work more than 17 years ago, soon after
the first of her four children was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep telling my children that I've made this ultimate
sacrifice,'' Streep says in a tone that gently mocks herself.
``They have no appreciation of that at all, of course, but it is
huge in my life. I am a theater person. I should be on the stage. I
can do that really well, and I love it. But I can't do it because
they want me home after school and on the weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So doing this movie,'' Streep continues, ``was a way of
working in the theater and fitting my life into an ensemble group.
And, let me tell you, it was lovely. It was like coming home.'' &QL;

 &HT;    CLINTON: 'DISTURBING SIGNS' OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS BUILDING IN NORTH
KOREA

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ President Clinton was scheduled to meet
with his South Korean counterpart Kim Dae Jung on Saturday to
discuss what Clinton called ''disturbing signs'' that North Korea
may be trying to thaw out its frozen nuclear weapons program and
advance its missile capability.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has refused to allow U.S. inspectors access to a top
secret underground construction site. U.S. officials believe North
Korea might be planning to build a nuclear reactor there capable of
producing enriched plutonium -- the key raw material in nuclear
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is also suspected of building additional launch
sites for ballistic missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead
to nearby Japan, the Washington Post reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   These worries follow North Korea's provocative launch last
August of a test missile that flew over northern Japan -- and near
to a U.S. Air Force base there -- before landing in the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are quite concerned by some of the news reports we have
seen,'' Clinton said Friday in Tokyo, at the conclusion of a
two-day summit with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. ''There
are some disturbing signs there.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, U.S. intelligence officials have been monitoring
activity at an underground construction site at Kumchangni, 25
miles from a known nuclear site at Youngbyon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dispatched a 12-person team to the North Korean capital
of Pyongyang last Monday and Tuesday to discuss the matter with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The team left on Wednesday, after failing to win permission from
the North Koreans to inspect the suspected site.
</P>
<P>
   One reason: the North Koreans, desperately short of cash, fuel
and food, tried to get the Americans to pay Pyongyang compensation
for conducting the inspections. The U.S. team rejected that
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was some discussion of conditions which were completely
unacceptable for such inspections,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and North Korean officials tentatively agreed to meet in
early December, at a location to be decided, to discuss how to move
forward on the issue of inspections of the suspicious site.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to find a way to solve this,'' said Jack Pritchard,
director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, who
was part of the mission to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's alleged efforts to rekindle its nuclear program
and to expand its ballistic missile capability come on the heels of
other disconcerting activities in the secretive authoritarian
state.
</P>
<P>
   Just last spring, South Koreans discovered a North Korean
submarine trying to ferry special forces into this country, similar
to an incident that occurred in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's economy is crumbling, and it faces grave food and
fuel shortages.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials aren't certain whether Pyongyang is intentionally
rattling its sabers to try to provoke attention -- and aid -- from
the outside world, and the United States in particular, or whether
North Korea's communist government is becoming increasingly
desperate -- and perhaps dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one can be sure whether the North Korean position is simply
a product of economic difficulties . . . or whether they really are
moving toward a more hostile posture,'' Clinton said. ''We will
evaluate that very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has tapped former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry
to lead a reassessment of U.S. policy toward North Korea, in
response to a Congressional mandate.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   There are serious concerns.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea and South Korea remain tense neighbors, divided by
the last Cold War fault line, the demilitarized zone, or DMZ, along
which some one million combat-ready troops face each from opposite
sides of a border proscribed by barbed wire and tank traps.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which sided with South Korea during the
1950-1953 Korean War, still keeps 38,000 American troops in the
South, as defense against an attack from the North.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and North Korea were again on a war footing as
recently as 1994, over North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
   With a diplomatic assist from former President Jimmy Carter, the
Clinton administration brokered in 1994 a so-called Agreed
Framework accord with North Korea that effectively froze
Pyongyang's alleged nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the United States, South Korea and Japan have
promised to build North Korea a pair of light-water nuclear
reactors, which produce only miniscule levels of weapons-grade
reactive material.
</P>
<P>
   Engineering and site preparation work has begun on those
reactors -- expected to cost more than $4 billion, the bulk of
which is to be paid by South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The president will remain here until Monday before making a
quick trip to the U.S. possession of Guam and heading back to
Washington Monday night.

 &HT;    Online shopping this holiday season is projected to double from
1997, and the sky's the limit.
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let your fingers do the walking this holiday season. Why not
join the millions of shoppers doing their holiday shopping online?
Remember, in cyberspace there are no crowds, no lines, you can shop
at 4 in the morning or 11 at night, and you never have to worry
about finding a place to park.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce _ known to most consumers as online shopping
_ is rapidly becoming a booming business. Whether you're looking
for books, blue jeans, CDs or chocolates, there's a retailer online
to take your order, ring up the purchase and drop the goods at your
door.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll never have to pick up the telephone or see the inside
of a mall.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, online shopping has grown to meet the
needs of Web surfers who increasingly see the Internet as a
utility. The same users who turn to the Web for quick doses of
breaking news or financial information have come to see it as a
place to shop quickly. Purchasing a book on a site like Amazon.com
takes about 10 minutes or less for returning shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web sites offer ``one click ordering'' that lets you buy an
item, pay for it and log off in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Latour Kadison, a senior online research analyst with
Forrester Research who tracks online retailing trends, says a
handful of savvy retailers were responsible for moving Web shopping
into the mainstream. ``It took the minds of people like Jeff Bezos
at Amazon (http://
</P>
<P>
   www.amazon.com), Michael Dell at Dell Computer
(http://www.dell.com) and the two guys who started CDnow
(http://www.cdnow.com) (brothers Jason and Matthew Olim) to see the
Web is much more than just an information conduit.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest report from Jupiter Communications,
shoppers are expected to spend $2.3 billion online during the 1998
holiday shopping season, more than double the $1.1 billion spent in
1997. However, Jupiter also points out only 16 percent of online
purchases during this period are gift-related, leaving a largely
untapped revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online retailing got off to a very slow start because it was
these anonymous retailers (online-only stores unfamiliar to
consumers) trying to create a market. But when traditional
marketers like Tower Records (http://www.towerrecords.com), J. Crew
(http://www.jcrew.com) and Barnes &AMP; Noble (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .barnesandnoble.com) saw the value and the volume that could be
generated from online sales, it gave the industry a huge boost
forward,'' says Kadison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon was the leader,'' she says, ``and still is in terms of
online market share. But as access explodes in the next several
years and as all these newbies come online, they are going to look
for brands they know in their offline world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadison predicts Amazon, CDnow/N2K and other Web-only retailers
will have to work twice as hard to establish their brands offline
as traditional names set up shop on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Kadison says Web retailing has introduced a need for increased
speed and convenience. Surfers no longer want to wait for long
downloads or fumble through badly designed Web sites. They expect
slick, easy-to-use sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The utility that consumers are finding is convenience,'' she
says. ``That's the most important factor to online consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Vanderbilt, group director of Jupiter's digital commerce
group, says as the online shopping market matures, retailers will
shift their strategy from acquiring shoppers to building online
loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   She says the gift-giving season is an excellent time to foster
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online retailers have been successful in capturing dollars
consumers spend on themselves,'' she says. ``But they have been
unsuccessful in getting those same customers to spend gift dollars
online.'' She thinks services such as gift registries and other
holiday services such as gift wrapping might do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winners from the losers online will be separated by
excellent technology backing up your brand strategy,'' Kadison
says. ``The top three things shoppers want are convenience, ease of
research and competitive prices. As more and more familiar
retailers such as Land's End and Nordstrom come online, it becomes
more convenient for users, and the security fears go down because
of the reputations of these established brands.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though the Web is a way to do almost anything quickly
and efficiently, it's still a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Web is fun and utilitarian,'' says Kadison. ``You
can do your grocery shopping online and log off right away. But you
can also play games and do other things. It's absolutely both.
That's why the Internet is going to become such a huge part of our
lives in the next century, because it serves such a variety of
needs.

 &HT;    E-shopping's easy, can be fun
 &HT;    By Frances Katz

<TEXT>
<P>
   So you've seen the packed parking lots at the mall, you're sick
of staring at the piles of catalogs cluttering your kitchen table
and you've decided that electronic shopping is the only way to go.
Trouble is, you've never shopped online before. Fear not first-time
shoppers: If e-shopping was hard or scary, nobody would do it and
you wouldn't be able to order Gap sweat shirts online.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need much to hop on the e-shopping bandwagon, besides
a computer, a modem and an Internet browser.
</P>
<P>
   It's always smart to do a little Web comparison shopping to make
sure you're getting the best value for your money. Sites such as
Junglee (http://www.junglee.com) and BottomDollar
(http://www.bottomdollar.com) will be able to tell you which Web
shops are selling the object of your desire at the lowest price.
Many portal sites such as HotBot (http://www.hotbot.com) or Yahoo
(http://www.yahoo.com) and Snap (http://www.snap.com) also offer
bargain finders for various products. Also be on the lookout for
free shipping, gift wrapping and other incentives to give your
business to one site instead of another. For example, music store
CDNow (http://www.cdnow.com) recently had an online trivia contest
with $10 off any purchase as a prize. Also be sure to check
carefully the shipping time the Web site promises. While experience
shows that most ship dates are realistic, many sites may have
cutoff dates for holiday deliveries, so as the saying goes, shop
early and often.
</P>
<P>
   Most shopping Web sites, such as Amazon.com have made the
purchasing process fairly intuitive. There might be something to
click along the lines of ``Add to my shopping cart'' or more
bluntly ``buy this now.'' Don't panic if you change your mind,
you'll have several chances to take items out of your virtual
shopping basket. You can also cancel your order at any time in the
ordering process, but once you click ``submit'' you've placed your
order, so make sure you really want something before sending
anything off into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've ordered your items, remember to keep copies of all
correspondence. Most of it will be via e-mail, so keep copies or
print out the information and store it in a safe place. This will
give you confirmation numbers and will also let you know when to
expect your item.
</P>
<P>
   Most online shopping sites will stay in close contact with you
via e-mail, letting you know they've received your order and
letting you know when it's shipped. They also let you know how to
contact them if you have a problem. However, if you shop wisely,
you'll see online shopping is not only easy, but fun.

NEWMAN'S TALENT RUNS DEEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I'll say it flat out: Randy Newman is the best
songwriter of the past 40 years, perhaps the best American
composer, period.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't as big of a stretch as it may seem. No doubt people
will throw out names from Bob Dylan to Philip Glass, but while not
denying the genius of either one, neither possesses the range of
Newman, who can make you laugh and cry within a two-minute song, or
move you with one of his magnificent, imaginative film scores.
</P>
<P>
   Take one of his early songs like ``Maybe I'm Doing It Wrong''
from his 1971 ``Live'' album. It almost sounds like a throwaway
ditty (and, compared to most of Newman's work, it is). But in the
love-the-one-you're-with, sexual-braggadocio era, it was
refreshingly _ albeit painfully _ honest while at the same time
funny. (``Sometimes I throw off a good one/Least I think I do/Least
I hope I do/Shouldn't be thinking at all''). And yet this humorous
take on sexual angst runs less than 1{ minutes and still speaks
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   The economy of Newman's work is especially noteworthy when you
consider the mindless, self-important drivel that has often been
praised as ``insightful'' lyrics. That economy extends to Newman's
music and his musicianship. Russ Titelman, who has worked on many
of Newman's records, calls him a ``truly great pianist.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember reading a review some 20 years ago by a critic from
another Los Angeles paper (he is still there, by the way) that was
critical of Newman's piano playing. I couldn't tell if this critic
was trying to act like he really knew something about music or was
just simply clueless. Unfortunately, the latter was the case. If
you ever watched Newman play, you know he can effortlessly slide
from style to style, from the highbrow to the lowbrow, and somehow
make it all his. It's too bad an influential critic can't recognize
subtlety and economy.
</P>
<P>
   The public has often had trouble getting Newman, too, which is
why he's never had the sales he deserves. His songs are like short
stories, and the ``I'' in them refers to the characters he creates,
whether it's a bigoted redneck, a money-loving yuppie, a child
molester or a slave trader. Unfortunately, we're so used to
confessional singer-songwriters, people mistake his characters'
prejudices for the real Newman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the funniest, most tongue-in-cheek guy in the world,''
says singer Valerie Carter, who has worked with Newman. ``To me,
Randy could have an amazing stand-up career ... And it's a really
wacky, unusual sense of humor. But Randy is exactly the opposite of
that, and that he's just making fun of the whole thing is the way I
see it.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody sees it that way, and Newman's satirical barbs
are sometimes too sharp for some people. The release of ``Short
People'' in 1977 drew public protests from those who thought he was
ridiculing the vertically challenged.
</P>
<P>
   No, it was clearly ridiculing how we stereotype people, a theme
Newman has returned to a number of times. Ironically, the ``Little
Criminals'' album that ``Short People'' was on was Newman's
best-selling record, and it become a Top 10 hit. (We'll never know
if the public got the joke or a lot of tall people bought the
album.)
</P>
<P>
   But more importantly, Newman goes beyond mere irony in both his
music and lyrics, and his characters include ordinary people trying
to make sense of their lives. In ``Marie,'' from the ``Good Old
Boys'' album, Newman's character (presumably a good old boy from
down South) needs to be drunk in order to confess his own
frailities and to tell his wife how much he loves her and how much
he means to her. It's a song filled with pathos and compassion,
with a lovely melody that recalls bygone days.
</P>
<P>
   And while his songs are often about the American character, the
music itself is very American. Within it you can hear echoes of
Stephen Foster, Irving Berlin, Scott Joplin, Aaron Copland, Fats
Waller, George Gershwin, Hoagy Carmichael and others.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to ``The Natural,'' the simple melody in the prologue
reminds you of the sublime simplicity of Copland's ``Appalachian
Spring,'' while the soaring horns (remember when Robert Redford hit
the big home run?) recall the majesty of Copland's ``Fanfare for
the Common Man.''
</P>
<P>
   This is all from the guy who wrote ``I Love L.A.'' While the
Windy City has the insipid ``My Kind of Town (Chicago Is)'' and the
Big Apple has (yawn) ``New York, New York,'' the City of Angels has
a song that not only rocks but celebrates the craziness that makes
L.A. such a great, fun place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out in the intro with a reference to Cole Porter's
``The Lady Is a Tramp'' (``Hate New York City/It's cold and it's
damp.''), it soons segues into a driving piano and a driving
obsession:
</P>
<P>
   ``Roll down the windows/Put down the top/Crank up the Beach
Boys/Don't let the music stop/We're going to ride it till we just
can't ride it no more/From the South Bay to the Valley/From the
Westside to the East Side/Everybody's very happy 'cause the sun is
shining all the time/Looks like another perfect day/I love L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Newman's having fun with our image and lifestyle, and the
City Council's not going to like the reference to a ``bum ... down
on his knees.'' But this is the home of Tinseltown, and wouldn't
you like to have a city song that was actually entertaining?
</P>
<P>
   Randy Newman _ you gotta love him. &QL;

DRESSING TABLES ARE BACK AS A TOOL OF CONVENIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 22)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Getting dressed for the day or for an event was a
very laborious task a few centuries ago, with makeup, powdered wigs
and hair accessories.
</P>
<P>
   In today's fast-paced world, we look to organized closets and
easy accessibility for our daily toilette, even for special
occasions. Yet we continue to use furnishings that echo an earlier
age.
</P>
<P>
   One very important piece of furniture in the 18th century, which
aided men and women in their daily grooming routine, was the
dressing table.
</P>
<P>
   It became a common fixture at the end of the 17th century, and
late 18th-century dressing tables of English design featured
complex arrangements of adjustable mirrors, candle brackets,
shelves and drawers. Many were designed for men only, becoming even
more complicated in design after early Georgian designs as male
dandyism spread.
</P>
<P>
   The powder table was a small dressing table that usually had a
folding mirror and side leaves that, when open, exposed various
compartments for cosmetics and grooming aids. They were originally
made in the Louis XV style in various rich fruit woods. However,
the best examples of this table that survive today are simple
French and Italian provincial.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the style of dressing tables has changed over the
intervening centuries. Some remain luxurious looking, while others
are very modern and streamlined.
</P>
<P>
   Many 18th- and 19th-century English and French dressing tables
were decorated with carving or other ornate detailing to match
those of the rest of the bedroom set.
</P>
<P>
   The Art Deco period of the 1920s and '30s brought a profusion of
large dressing tables in stained or highly lacquered woods, with a
kneehole opening in the center and a bank of drawers to each side.
There may also have been a shelf on the bottom between the drawers,
which made for a larger expanse of mirror.
</P>
<P>
   If the price for antiques is an obstacle, you can buy a simple
pressed wood version with a kidney-shaped top for under $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that they are fashionable again because as we approach
the millennium, people are looking back on their memories,'' said
interior designer Denise Maurer of Brunswick, N.Y. ``I get a lot of
requests for the addition of a dressing table because of someone's
fond memories of their childhood, where they would see their
grandmother or mother prepping. I have fond childhood memories of
my grandmother combing her hair at her dressing table. That's why I
bought one for myself, and now my 19-month-old granddaughter
watches me.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond nostalgia, dressing tables offer a private place to sit
and take your time when pampering yourself from hair to nails.
</P>
<P>
   Dressing tables had fallen from favor when large bedroom
furnishings and television sets ate up the extra space in the
bedroom. However, walk-in closets with storage drawers can free
that space. Then again, if the walk-in closet is large enough, you
can put a dressing table there. The bathroom is a poorer choice, as
it can be too humid after a bath or shower for fixing hair or
applying makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at rooms differently now,'' said interior
designer Cecil K. Pollen, owner of Tassels in Lenox, Mass. ``The
baby-boomer generation is slowing down and spending more time on
themselves. They are now acquiring a fondness for things they may
have originally thrown out and saying things like, `My mother used
to have a dressing table and I threw it out. If only I had kept
it.' I like to use the dressing table as a standout piece for the
woman's boudoir.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some people also use a dressing table as part of a display in a
bedroom for collectibles such as scent bottles or small silver
picture frames, according to Pollen. Silver vanity sets, with a
handheld mirror, brush, comb and nail file, are still popular and
can be found in many jewelry and department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Antique dressing tables come in all shapes and sizes, but
various tables will do.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the sparkle and function of a dressing table is the
mirror. Those in the first half of the 18th century came with a
fixed mirror (or toilette glass, as it was commonly called), that
either popped up on an easel type or hinged mount. There were also
small mirrors on standards (stand with a drawer) that were used in
conjunction with a table or lowboy for dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can create a trifold mirror by hinging three mirrored
frames together,'' Maurer said. ``You can vary the design of the
shape by using a larger mirror in the center and two smaller ones
on the side. If you find that you need a lot of room on the table
top itself, hang a beautifully framed mirror on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurer suggested that if you do use table lamps on the dressing
table, select boudoir lamps that are 15 inches or less in height.
Cut-glass or other crystal lamps add extra sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   Seating for the dressing table should be comfortable, but in
scale with the table. The dressing stool was also introduced in the
18th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small upholstered bench in the same fabric as the dressing
table is very attractive,'' Maurer said. ``You can also find small
chairs with a low, arched back, that can also be covered with
material. Dressing table chairs are either stationary or swivel.
</P>
<P>
   ``But whatever you choose, make sure it's comfortable, so that
you get a total luxurious feeling. This is one area that is truly
personal. So select what suits you best when it comes to beginning
and ending your day.''

`WINCHELL': PORTRAIT OF A GOSSIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time and station are
for New York area; check local listings.) 
(mk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Tucci delivers a high-energy charge as Walter Winchell
in Friday night's fast-breathing account of the sensational rise
and abrupt decline of America's pioneering gossip columnist. And in
sharp glimpses along the way, Paul Mazursky's movie digs into the
connection between popular-front patriotism of the 1930s and '40s
and the right-wing populism of the brief-lived but powerfully
disruptive McCarthy era.
</P>
<P>
   There's smoky atmosphere in abundance here, from the Stork Club,
where Winchell lorded over press agents and sycophants, to the
barber shop where his cadre of ghostwriters sweated to come up with
Winchell-type cracks (intellectual smart alecks were written off as
``brain pains''), to the Manhattan hotel room where Winchell
disported while his wife raised the family back home in
Westchester. Glenne Headly, as his favorite chanteuse, drops by
frequently for a quickie until her name shows up on some sort of
left-wing petition.
</P>
<P>
   Based on ``Walter Winchell: His Life and Times,'' by Herman
Klurfeld (played earnestly by Paul Giamatti), for 30 years
Winchell's main wordsmith, pardon the expression, the two-hour
biography speeds along from young Walter's hustling beginnings as a
tabloid gossip merchant (``I'm not writing for the major leagues,''
he announces. ``I'm writing for the minor leagues.'') to his
ascendance as the nation's most powerful propagandist.
</P>
<P>
   It's a busy show, and Tucci carries it along at a vigorous pace.
Off with the jacket, on with the hat, and his collection of
titillating tidbits, snappy put-downs, uninhibited opinions and
random claptrap went clicketing out to Mr. and Mrs. America and all
the ships at sea.
</P>
<P>
   In his heyday Winchell was the perfect representative of what
had not yet been elevated to ``the media.'' He was streetwise and
unfastidious, made for the bottom feeders at the Hearst chain;
fast-talking and secret-baring, made for the new growth industry of
radio. Tucci understands that this sentimental tough guy won his
fans' trust not by pretending to be superior to them but by making
sure they recognized him as one of their own, a guy who was on
their side against the big shots whom he mocked and exposed even as
he slavered over them.
</P>
<P>
   With the approach of World War II, Winchell was a premature
anti-Nazi. As a Jew, that came naturally, even though it meant
defying his isolationist Hearst bosses. And he was also susceptible
to the charms of Franklin D. Roosevelt, shrewdly interpreted here
by Christopher Plummer. Winchell, the people's tribune, loved to be
on intimate terms with the movers and shakers of a smoother class.
</P>
<P>
   After Roosevelt's death and Hitler's defeat, Winchell's
patriotism took a paranoid turn. His hour had run out, along with
the sort of tabloids and radio shows that had nurtured him. Yet in
today's cable and Internet rant, one can still detect the influence
of the prototypical ranter.
</P>
<P>
   The farewell glimpse of him Friday night is post-journalism,
when he returned to his early vaudeville days and did a turn as a
Las Vegas hoofer. Tucci goes gamely, even stylishly, through the
routine; it's a big change from his decades of influence but not
out of character.

   WOMEN-TENNIS-STARS (Undated) _ The selling of women's tennis,
featuring a trio of teen-age players whose handlers are
capitalizing on their sex appeal: Anna Kornikova, Martina Hingis,
Serena Williams. By Robin Finn. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VERDURA-JEWELRY (New York) _ It's been a nervous fall for the
initiates of Verdura, one of the last of the bespoke jewelers,
which for most of its 50 years has operated almost as a private
club. In its plush New York showroom, 12 floors above Fifth Avenue
near 57th Street, an appointment was required until recently. By
Jean Nathan. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOLSTER-BAG-FASHION (Undated) _ Helmut Lang's holster bag, which
will go on sale early next year, is one of a number of utilitarian
``body'' bags _ that is, bags that are worn strapped to the body
like vests or belts _ being made by a number of designers right
now. By Penelope Green. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LIMELIGHT-CLUB (New York) _ Peter Gatien wants to make you a
nice cup of hot cocoa. A magnate of New York night life, he was
acquitted on charges that he operated two of his clubs as virtual
drug supermarkets, and he officially reopened the Limelight this
weekend, billing the former Episcopal church in Chelsea as a
community-friendly, arts-oriented complex that will feature puppet
shows, photography exhibitions, a juice and coffee bar, and a
courtyard sandbox for toddlers. By Andrew Jacobs. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RECYCLED-FURS (New York) _ Park Avenue matrons once lined
raincoats with their favorite minks to avoid paint-throwing
protesters. Now that the anti-fur frenzy has died down a bit, furry
pelts are coming out of the closet. Even young eco-sensitive people
are finding ways of rationalizing this indulgence. By Maria
Ricapito. Photo. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   QUAID-SAVIOR-FILM (New York) _ On Thursday, Dennis Quaid was in
New York for what might be the least glamorous movie premiere ever.
His $5.5 million Bosnian film, ``Savior,'' opens here on Wednesday.
By Linda Lee. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ There is something compelling about
the notion of a cutting garden, conjuring visions of a figure
moving gracefully down large pathways of flowers, bending here and
there to snip a bloom for the willow basket on an arm, gathering
flowers to fill the house with thoughtfully arranged bouquets.
Unfortunately, most people these days have neither the space for
such a garden nor the time to maintain it. By Georgeanne Brennan. &QL;

   MIAMI _ When world leaders announced a huge bailout for Brazil,
they hoped it would stave off an emerging-market crisis that has
already crippled Asia and Russia, and now threatens the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, it's worked.
</P>
<P>
   The $41.5 billion package that the world's eighth-largest
economy signed with the International Monetary Fund on Nov. 13 has
sent many stocks up and slowed capital flight to a mere trickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of external support with internal reforms will
permit Brazil to resume growth during 1999,'' Brazilian Finance
Minister Pedro Malan confidently predicted this week.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts worry that Brazil may be celebrating victory before
actually fighting the battle.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso still has to push a slew of
tax increases and spending cuts through Brazil's Congress in order
to implement an austerity plan designed to save $84 billion over
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his proposals -- such as a doubling of the tax rate on
financial transactions -- have met with mounting opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the measures are approved by early next year, the IMF
could back off, dangerously eroding investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial crisis is far from over,'' said Michael
Connolly, professor of international economics at the University of
Miami. ``There's still lots of work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, top economists are far from optimistic over the
country's future, and many predict that the economy will contract
by 2 to 3 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-two billion dollars for Brazil is not enough,'' said
Lawrence Goodman, an economist with Santander Investment Securities
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the world's economic turmoil still poses a real
danger for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has suffered from a gigantic budget deficit, plummeting
foreign reserves, and an over-valuation in currency of up to 20
percent. The country was severely scarred by Russia's devaluation
of the ruble in August, which scared U.S. investors away from
emerging markets such as Brazil's.
</P>
<P>
   Architects of the IMF bailout -- which includes $5 billion from
U.S. taxpayers -- hope the money will prevent Brazil from going the
way of Russia, which also stopped paying its domestic and foreign
debts.
</P>
<P>
   But the bailout mandates Brazil make huge cuts in government
spending while implementing tax increases, a major restructuring
that's sure to fall hardest on the poorest of Brazil's 164 million
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Already, personal bankruptcies are up and companies are laying
off workers in anticipation of the country's austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
   According to conventional wisdom, as goes Brazil -- which
accounts for 45 percent of Latin America's overall GDP -- so goes
the economies of countries as disparate as Argentina and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Already, much of Latin America is on the verge of an economic
meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, for example, President Andres Pastrana
declared a state of emergency in Colombia's economy, which has been
plagued by sky-high interest rates and a massive government debt.
</P>
<P>
   If Brazil falls into a full-fledged recession, as is feared, the
effects will ripple out to the more than 2,000 U.S. companies --
including BellSouth Corp., Dell Computer Corp., Caterpillar Inc. --
doing business in that country.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, President Clinton emphasized this week
that a strong Brazil is in America's interests, and he offered
support for Cardoso's economic proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Cardoso has launched a solid program to tackle its
fiscal problems that he has committed to implement swiftly,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardoso, who was re-elected in October, has a poor track
record. During his first term, he repeatedly failed to push
money-saving reforms to the public sector through a reluctant
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's first real test comes later this year when he tries to
win passage of a budget that seeks to cut $7.3 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Next he must overhaul social security and continue privatizing
state-owned industries that will attract more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president and his economic team know what needs to
be done and they're going to do it,'' Hirschmann said. ``I think
the world realizes it didn't act fast enough in Asia so it's not
going to let Brazil fall.''

THE HARM DONE BY STEREOTYPES, BOTH GOOD AND BAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (mk) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``The Bell Curve'' was published in 1994, black groups
angrily protested the authors' suggestion that because black people
score lower on intelligence tests, they have genetically inferior
mental capacities. But amid the outcry, Sander Gilman spotted what
he thought was an equally insidious assumption about Jews. Although
the book seemed to pay Ashkenazi Jews a compliment by implying they
are smartest because they score highest on intelligence tests,
Gilman, who studies stereotypes, was troubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `This is really scary stuff!''' he said. ``This
pseudoscience had come back with a vengeance. Positive stereotypes
are just as powerful a means of control as negative stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   One had only to go back to the rise of anti-Semitism in Germany
to see how ``positive'' stereotypes can become dangerous, said
Gilman, both of whose parents lost most of their extended families
in the Holocaust. The myth of Jewish superior intelligence was
``one of the arguments used by anti-Semites from the 1890s on, that
Jews are over-represented in certain professions like law and
medicine, when they were trying to revoke the professional
privileges of German Jews,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman's response to ``The Bell Curve'' was ``Smart Jews,''
published in 1996, tracing the notion of Jewish superior
intelligence from the 19th century through contemporary popular
culture.
</P>
<P>
   But the study of stereotypes is only one object of Gilman's
omnivorous intellectual appetite. At age 53, he is one of the most
prolific scholars in the country. He has written, contributed to or
edited 58 books, some overlapping, on subjects from Nietzsche to
the history of plastic surgery. Chairman of the department of
Germanic studies at the University of Chicago, he marches
fearlessly across academic boundaries, writing on body images of
blacks, the depiction of the insane in art, on Brecht's Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the prolific 19th-century English novelist, Gilman
once called himself ``the Trollope of the academy.'' His wife,
Marina von Eckardt, said, ``At one point, I decided if someone was
going to do an autopsy on him, they would find a filing cabinet in
his brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his interests seem diffuse, to Gilman there is one
theme that links all his work: how human beings construct images of
others to define themselves. ``All of us,'' he writes, ``men and
women, poor and rich, black and white, spend a great deal of our
psychic energy constantly defining and redefining who we are.'' One
way people define themselves, Gilman says, is by measuring
themselves against those they perceive as different. And sometimes,
he says, people create difference where there is none to throw
their own self-definition into relief.
</P>
<P>
   As a scholar, Gilman has been unafraid to examine areas that
academics have traditionally shied away from. ``He has been at the
vanguard of a whole contemporary interest in work on the body,''
said Elaine Showalter, a professor of English at Princeton, who has
collaborated with Gilman and other scholars on a book on hysteria.
``His work was often so new and took such unexpected turns that
some people were shocked.'' In a 1985 paper, ``The Hottentot
Venus,'' he wrote about how the image of the black female in the
19th century became a racist icon for deviant sexuality. He said
some scholars ``laced into me because they thought all I was doing
was perpetuating these images.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the `kill the messenger' problem,'' Gilman continued. ``I
violate a lot of taboos. Academics have a very low threshold of
anxiety. I've served as a lightening rod.''
</P>
<P>
   From Gilman's interest in body images have come his studies of
plastic surgery. Well over half his new book, ``Written on the
Body: A Cultural History of Esthetic Surgery,'' to be published in
March by Princeton University Press, is about the nose. Throughout
history, ``good'' and ``bad'' images of the nose, Gilman said, show
how arbitrary stereotypes are. Until the 19th century, nose
degeneration was associated with syphilis; before there was a cure,
some who were stricken had a cavity in the middle of their face
because the nose had disintegrated. During the medieval period,
Jews were associated with illness, and anti-Semitic images
sometimes depicted Jews as having small noses because Jews were
said to suffer from syphilis.
</P>
<P>
   Then ``in the 1880s and the 1890s, the model of the nose comes
from classical art, what culture calls the Greco-Roman nose,'' a
nose that is slightly larger and more sculptured. ``The Germans
imagined themselves as Greeks. Race was now a more powerful way of
making a distinction between me and you than illness,'' Gilman
said. ``Suddenly, the Jew's nose is not Roman enough, and it is
seen to be larger or hooked or curved.''
</P>
<P>
   During the wave of Irish immigration to England and the United
States in the 19th century, the Irish, seen as inferior by some,
were said to have pug noses. Some Irish had plastic surgery to make
their noses conform to the Greco-Roman ideal. But during the 1950s,
when the English actress Kay Kendall had plastic surgery that
resulted in her having a pug nose, suddenly the pug nose became
fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman said his interest in stereotypes grew out of his
childhood in New Orleans. His mother was born in Poland; his
father, a truck driver, was American-born of Russian descent.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman said he grew up as a ``double outsider, between white and
black.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I may have appeared white,'' he said, ``I was
along this fissure line because being a Jew in the South was not
being white.'' The Ku Klux Klan was both anti-Jewish and
anti-black. Not only that, but he was also acutely aware of the
class distinctions between New Orleans' well-established German
Jewish community and its newer Eastern European Jews. Even within
his group, Gilman said, he ``realized that some people were whiter
than other people.''
</P>
<P>
   His sense of the power of stereotypes was heightened by the
civil rights movement when as a teen-ager he was involved in
sit-ins in New Orleans and ``I saw what ugly stereotypes could
do.'' He understood, he said, that laws could be changed, but that
wouldn't change stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s, Gilman came across photographs of insane
people from the 19th century. ``There was a theory in the 19th
century that crazy people always look different.'' As a result, he
wrote ``Seeing the Insane,'' about images of the insane in painting
and photography.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Seeing the Insane,'' ``I started thinking about broader
questions of stereotyping, the psychology of what happens when
stereotypes begin to be internalized.'' He realized, he said, that
he had been avoiding the personal stake he had in his scholarship,
his own Jewishness. He began studying how Jews responded to
stereotypes of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewish Self-Hatred: Anti-Semitism and the Hidden Language of
the Jews,'' published in 1986, was a study of Jewish writers from
the 15th century to the present. ``In every case, the Jew is told
either directly or implicitly that because he is inherently
different, he can never have command of the language of the
culture. One reaction is to become better than, not just as good
as.'' Heinrich Heine, who because he was a Jew could supposedly
never master the language of Goethe, became the most important
lyric poet of the 19th century. Contemporary Jewish writers like
Woody Allen and Philip Roth have solved the problem of their split
identity as writers by mocking their dilemma, Gilman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mid-'80s, I got interested in intelligence and race,''
Gilman said. He points out that intelligence testing in the United
States grew out of panic at the number of Eastern European Jews and
southern Italians entering the United States in the early part of
the century. The tests were used to keep ``mental defectives'' out
of the country, some of them simply immigrants who couldn't speak
English.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence became equated with goodness, Gilman said. ``There
is the assumption that dumb people steal cars, and smart people are
good.''
</P>
<P>
   All too easily, the notion of Jewish ``intelligence'' has been
transformed into ``cunning,'' a construct sometimes internalized by
Jews themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Smart Jews'' Gilman examines the way the notion of Jewish
intelligence sometimes goes along with notions of physical weakness
or sexual inadequacy. The central character in F. Scott
Fitzgerald's 1940 novel ``The Last Tycoon'' is Monroe Stahr,
modeled after Irving Thalberg. He is brilliant and handsome but
also sickly. He is depicted as ``a parvenu,'' and ``his sickliness
and his failure at love and sex compensate for his Jewish superior
intelligence,'' Gilman writes.
</P>
<P>
   Such stereotypes are also in some ways the result of
assimilation, Gilman said. ``Jews will become one more group which
is incredibly diverse. I think it's a great anxiety,'' Gilman said,
``on the part of both the culture at large and of Jews themselves.
The more Jews become like everybody else, the more invisible they
are. If you think of different as dangerous, you want to know where
they are. The great danger to do with Jewish identity has to do
with normalization.''

   WASHINGTON _ The nation's overall crime rate in 1997 fell for
the sixth consecutive year, with the rate of violent crimes such as
murders and robberies showing the sharpest drop, the FBI reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's big cities experienced the steepest decline in
their crime rate, with a 5 percent drop, while suburban counties
saw a decrease of 4 percent, and rural areas were down 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal experts and law enforcement officials attributed the
drop to several factors, including the aging of baby boomers,
increased incarceration of criminals, declining use of crack,
additional police officers and better policing methods.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the rate of violent crimes fell 4 percent from 1996,
helping to push down the overall U.S. crime rate by 3 percent, its
lowest level in over a decade, the FBI reported.
</P>
<P>
   Murders fell by more than 7 percent to 18,209. In the past four
years, the murder rate has plummeted by more than 25 percent.
Robberies fell 8 percent, while aggravated assaults and forcible
rapes decreased 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely continues the trend of good news about
crime,'' said James Alan Fox, dean of Northeastern University's
College of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox cautioned: ``People should remember that these numbers
aren't the full story. In the coming years, these declines could
turn quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox and other crime experts said two dominant trends are
influencing the nation's crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   First, the aging of the baby boom generation, which makes up 25
percent of the population, has pushed down the number of crimes
because adults tend to be less violent than juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the number of crimes committed by teen-agers
has risen sharply since the mid-1980s. The number of murders
committed by teen-agers increased 145 percent between 1985 and
1995. And although the number of violent crimes committed by
juveniles has fallen slightly in the past two years, the number of
teen-agers will grow quickly over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are 40 million children under the age of 10
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said future crime rates will be determined by how society
deals with the rising tide of teen-agers over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, crime rates peak in the couple of hours between the
end of school and when most parents get home for dinner,'' he said.
``That tells you that our children are not getting enough
supervision from their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Thursday, Attorney General Janet Reno
warned Americans not to ``relax their vigilance about crime, about
enforcement, about prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the large number of people growing through their teens
and early 20s over the next decade presents law enforcement
officials with a challenge, but that these kids do not have to
become criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make sure, as we have more young people, that we
have more programs for them, more opportunities to give them a
strong and positive future,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   All regions of the country saw crime rates fall in 1997, with
the Northeast experiencing the largest drop, 5 percent, the FBI
report said. The crime rate in the West and South declined nearly 3
percent, while the Midwest saw a drop of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI report also said the rate of property crimes, burglaries
and larceny fell 3 percent, while the rate of motor vehicle thefts
dropped 4 percent.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that 65 law enforcement officers were killed in
the line of duty during 1997, nine more than in 1996. Of the slain
officers, 34 worked for city police departments, 20 for county
police and sheriff's offices, 9 for state agencies and 2 for
federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the South was by far the most dangerous region for law
enforcement officers. Thirty-two officers were killed in that part
of the country last year, twice as many as next highest region, the
West, where 15 officers were slain. Eleven officers were killed in
the Midwest and seven in the Northeast.

FBI WRAPS UP $20 MILLION RENOVATION TO HEADQUARTERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI on Friday opened a $20 million renovation
of its headquarters designed to handle coordinated police responses
to five major crises happening at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh said the secure, high-tech complex will
prevent a repeat of the summer of 1996, when federal agents, in
quest of space, had to review top-secret documents in a
vending-machine lounge.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's old crisis-management facility was stretched nearly to
its limit then, Freeh said, as the agency simultaneously
investigated three deadly incidents: the TWA Flight 800 crash off
the coast of Long Island, N.Y., which killed all 230 people on
board; the Khobar Towers truck bombing in Saudi Arabia, which
killed 19 airmen; and the pipe-bomb explosion during the Atlanta
Summer Olympics, which killed one person.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 35 rooms and 184 computer terminals at the FBI's new
Strategic Information and Operations Center resemble Mission
Control at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Banks of computer
consoles are spread in front of large video screens at the complex,
which is 10 times larger than the FBI's previous facility.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms, on the fifth floor of the agency's headquarters
building, have sound-proof walls to accommodate top-secret
communications. To ensure security further, the center's telephones
cannot be tapped, and cellular phones do not work from anywhere
inside the complex, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   During a major crisis, up to 16 federal agencies will help the
FBI in handling the investigation, Freeh said, citing the Central
Intelligence Agency's past assistance in capturing terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The facility and its state-of-the-art equipment also will
facilitate the sharing of information between U.S. and foreign
police agencies, cooperation that was critical after the deadly
August bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, Freeh
said. In addition, the facility will improve the coordination among
federal, state and local police that was important after the fatal
1995 Oklahoma City bombing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share our toys and our technologies,'' Freeh said. ``We
rely very heavily on our state, local and federal partners.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI will adopt three degrees of readiness for managing
crises from its new facility, the agency reported. At the most
basic level, up to 25 agents will be at the facility monitoring
day-to-day events, much as a lifeguard watches a beachfront.
</P>
<P>
   The number of staff will increase and their readiness will be
more keen when a planned special event requires increased security,
such as the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The third and highest level of preparation will occur during
evolving crises. The center can accommodate 300 agents working on
five major crises at the same time, said Ron Wilcox, FBI deputy
unit chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it never comes to that,'' Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush handled the ribbon-cutting ceremony
at a private event honoring both the new facility and the FBI's
90th anniversary.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last year, Angela Voulangas found the mink cape she
had inherited from her grandmother years ago. Actually, it was more
of a capelet, and Ms. Voulangas, a 33-year-old graphic designer,
had no idea what to do with it. ``Where am I going to wear a
capelet?'' she asked. The 40-year-old mink seemed ``too incongruous
with my life,'' she added. And yet, it also seemed like ``exciting
raw material.'' She decided to dye it blue and burgundy, and cut it
up into two collars and a bag. That way, she said, ``I don't feel I
went out and clubbed a baby seal.''
</P>
<P>
   Park Avenue matrons once lined raincoats with their favorite
minks to avoid paint-throwing protesters. Now that the anti-fur
frenzy has died down a bit, furry pelts are coming out of the
closet. Even young eco-sensitive people are finding ways of
rationalizing this indulgence. Hand-me-downs are OK; so is anything
found at a flea market or a vintage store, or any fur recycled into
bite-size pieces of trim, collar and other accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Dyeing the fur a color not found in nature helps. Emily
Dougherty, 25, a beauty editor at Harper's Bazaar, had two collars
made _ purple, and black and blue _ because, she said, ``I don't
want to know what kind of animal it was.'' Ms. Dougherty used the
leftover strips to edge the hem of an otherwise boring skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Some skins, however, don't allow for such willful conscience
abating. Liz Darst, 33, a freelance television producer, inherited
her mother's fox stole, the kind with the head still on it that
attaches jaw to paw, which looked as if it last saw the light of
day circa 1959 at the local country club. ``It was like something
from the Flintstones,'' she said. ``It's so grotesque, there are
eyeballs sticking out. You can't salvage that because it's so
shameful.'' But she is making her mother's mink stole into a scarf.
``It's so soft and pretty,'' she said. ``I guess I feel like it's
already dead and gone, so it's better not to waste it.''
</P>
<P>
   The logic can be as fuzzy as a frazzled beaver coat. Jana
Ragsdale, 34, a Columbia University administrator, played dress-up
in her grandmother's furs when she was a child and always thought
someday she would wear them. But after she inherited the furs, she
only dared wear them in the woods near her former home in upstate
New York, and never had the nerve to put them on in public in the
city. ``I don't want to aggravate people unnecessarily, or have to
shout out, `This raccoon was killed 80 years ago,''' Ms. Ragsdale
said. She had the corner dry cleaner stitch together a patchwork
quilt of pieces from stoles and from her grandfather's raccoon
cheerleader coat to make a big throw for an unsightly couch. This
she can live with, she said, because of its sentimental value, and
her cats love it.
</P>
<P>
   Those without inheritances are browsing flea markets and the
Salvation Army. Alison Houtte, the owner of Hooti Couture, a
popular vintage store in Brooklyn, used to stock vintage
full-length fur coats, but few people would even try them on, let
alone buy them. About 16 months ago, she finally donated the furs
to the Salvation Army and began to stock only fur accessories and
fur-trimmed clothes. As of this summer, she said, those items
rarely remain in the store for more than three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women see it in the magazines, and it flies out of the
store,'' said Ms. Houtte, who recently sold a yellow wool coat from
the 1950's with a dyed yellow fur collar for $75. It resembled one
that was $5,530 in the Versace store on Fifth Avenue before it sold
out earlier this fall.
</P>
<P>
   While many fur initiates can condone only wearing colorful
scraps, some are becoming more brazen. Anne Magruder, the managing
editor of US magazine, found a champagne mink stole at the 26th
Street flea market, and wore it to a wedding reception in New
Hampshire. Intact. ``I would never cut it up, it's too beautiful,''
she said. ``Anybody can have a fur collar, but there's just
something so much more luxurious about a stole. It's unexpected.
People treat you like a movie star when you're wearing one.''

 &HT;    RECESSION FEARED IN BRAZIL DESPITE MASSIVE RESCUE PACKAGE
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 550 words.
 &HT;    With BRAZIL-DATA-1121.

categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When world leaders announced a huge bailout for Brazil,
they hoped it would stave off an emerging-market crisis that has
already crippled Asia and Russia, and now threatens the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, it's worked.
</P>
<P>
   The $41.5 billion package that the world's eighth-largest
economy signed with the International Monetary Fund on Nov. 13 has
sent many stocks up and slowed capital flight to a mere trickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of external support with internal reforms will
permit Brazil to resume growth during 1999,'' Brazilian Finance
Minister Pedro Malan confidently predicted this week.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts worry that Brazil may be celebrating victory before
actually fighting the battle.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso still has to push a slew of
tax increases and spending cuts through Brazil's Congress in order
to implement an austerity plan designed to save $84 billion over
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his proposals -- such as a doubling of the tax rate on
financial transactions -- have met with mounting opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the measures are approved by early next year, the IMF
could back off, dangerously eroding investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial crisis is far from over,'' said Michael
Connolly, professor of international economics at the University of
Miami. ``There's still lots of work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, top economists are far from optimistic over the
country's future, and many predict that the economy will contract
by 2 to 3 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-two billion dollars for Brazil is not enough,'' said
Lawrence Goodman, an economist with Santander Investment Securities
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the world's economic turmoil still poses a real
danger for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has suffered from a gigantic budget deficit, plummeting
foreign reserves, and an over-valuation in currency of up to 20
percent. The country was severely scarred by Russia's devaluation
of the ruble in August, which scared U.S. investors away from
emerging markets such as Brazil's.
</P>
<P>
   Architects of the IMF bailout -- which includes $5 billion from
U.S. taxpayers -- hope the money will prevent Brazil from going the
way of Russia, which also stopped paying its domestic and foreign
debts.
</P>
<P>
   But the bailout mandates Brazil make huge cuts in government
spending while implementing tax increases, a major restructuring
that's sure to fall hardest on the poorest of Brazil's 164 million
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Already, personal bankruptcies are up and companies are laying
off workers in anticipation of the country's austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
   According to conventional wisdom, as goes Brazil -- which
accounts for 45 percent of Latin America's overall GDP -- so goes
the economies of countries as disparate as Argentina and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Already, much of Latin America is on the verge of an economic
meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, for example, President Andres Pastrana
declared a state of emergency in Colombia's economy, which has been
plagued by sky-high interest rates and a massive government debt.
</P>
<P>
   If Brazil falls into a full-fledged recession, as is feared, the
effects will ripple out to the more than 2,000 U.S. companies --
including BellSouth Corp., Dell Computer Corp., Caterpillar Inc. --
doing business in that country.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, President Clinton emphasized this week
that a strong Brazil is in America's interests, and he offered
support for Cardoso's economic proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Cardoso has launched a solid program to tackle its
fiscal problems that he has committed to implement swiftly,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardoso, who was re-elected in October, has a poor track
record. During his first term, he repeatedly failed to push
money-saving reforms to the public sector through a reluctant
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's first real test comes later this year when he tries to
win passage of a budget that seeks to cut $7.3 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Next he must overhaul social security and continue privatizing
state-owned industries that will attract more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president and his economic team know what needs to
be done and they're going to do it,'' Hirschmann said. ``I think
the world realizes it didn't act fast enough in Asia so it's not
going to let Brazil fall.''

FBI WRAPS UP $20 MILLION RENOVATION TO HEADQUARTERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI on Friday opened a $20 million renovation
of its headquarters designed to handle coordinated police responses
to five major crises happening at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh said the secure, high-tech complex will
prevent a repeat of the summer of 1996, when federal agents, in
quest of space, had to review top-secret documents in a
vending-machine lounge.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's old crisis-management facility was stretched nearly to
its limit then, Freeh said, as the agency simultaneously
investigated three deadly incidents: the TWA Flight 800 crash off
the coast of Long Island, N.Y., which killed all 230 people on
board; the Khobar Towers truck bombing in Saudi Arabia, which
killed 19 airmen; and the pipe-bomb explosion during the Atlanta
Summer Olympics, which killed one person.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 35 rooms and 184 computer terminals at the FBI's new
Strategic Information and Operations Center resemble Mission
Control at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Banks of computer
consoles are spread in front of large video screens at the complex,
which is 10 times larger than the FBI's previous facility.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms, on the fifth floor of the agency's headquarters
building, have sound-proof walls to accommodate top-secret
communications. To ensure security further, the center's telephones
cannot be tapped, and cellular phones do not work from anywhere
inside the complex, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   During a major crisis, up to 16 federal agencies will help the
FBI in handling the investigation, Freeh said, citing the Central
Intelligence Agency's past assistance in capturing terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The facility and its state-of-the-art equipment also will
facilitate the sharing of information between U.S. and foreign
police agencies, cooperation that was critical after the deadly
August bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, Freeh
said. In addition, the facility will improve the coordination among
federal, state and local police that was important after the fatal
1995 Oklahoma City bombing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share our toys and our technologies,'' Freeh said. ``We
rely very heavily on our state, local and federal partners.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI will adopt three degrees of readiness for managing
crises from its new facility, the agency reported. At the most
basic level, up to 25 agents will be at the facility monitoring
day-to-day events, much as a lifeguard watches a beachfront.
</P>
<P>
   The number of staff will increase and their readiness will be
more keen when a planned special event requires increased security,
such as the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The third and highest level of preparation will occur during
evolving crises. The center can accommodate 300 agents working on
five major crises at the same time, said Ron Wilcox, FBI deputy
unit chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it never comes to that,'' Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush handled the ribbon-cutting ceremony
at a private event honoring both the new facility and the FBI's
90th anniversary.

BIBLE-ARIZONA (Phoenix) - Sure bet there's a Bible Week in Las
Vegas. There's also one in the space-alien loving town of Roswell,
N.M. But Arizona's is in jeopardy, pending a federal court hearing
Friday afternoon. A judge will decide whether to honor the ACLU's
request that Gov. Jane Hull's decree of Bible Week be dropped. By

KEATING (Undated) - Charles H Keating's four-plus years behind bars
didn't dampen his enthusiasm for money, but the circles he moves
these days are less ritzy. Where he once held court with the
nation's rich and powerful, Keating recently found himself in a
tiny motel room giving financial advice to a small, but rapt,
audience. ``I'm right _ I know I'm right,'' Keating said. ``My
instincts are still right.'' By PAT FLANNERY. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL;

   OHIO -- BOEHNER'S-FUTURE. Rep. John Boehner, R-West Chester, is
likely to remain in Congress despite losing his leadership post,
according to Rep. Bob Ney, R-St. Clairsville. Ney went to dinner

Congress, which just ended, and the 106th Congress, which begins in
January, the state of Ohio is losing a lot of clout in Washington.
A 24-year senator (John Glenn) is being replaced by a rookie; a
30-year congressman who served on the powerful Appropriations
Committee (Louis Stokes) will be succeeded by a freshman in the
minority party; and the state's highest-ranking member of GOP
leadership (John Boehner) lost his post. What does this mean and

   TEXAS -- IMMIGRATION. In the devastating aftermath of Hurricane
Mitch, the Clinton administration will allow Central American

SATURDAY'S GAMES

   &UR; SATURDAY'S KEY GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 Florida 9-1
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 at Florida State 10-1
</P>
<P>
   As usual for this game, the winner remains in the
national-championship picture. Florida State has won nine straight
games, Florida seven straight. Doug Johnson of Florida, who has
passed for 1,118 yards and 10 touchdowns in his last three games,
faces the nation's top-ranked defense (215.8 yards a game). But
Florida State's quarterback, Chris Weinke, is lost for the season,
and as Coach Bobby Bowden said of his young quarterback
replacements, ``They've got ability. It's just that you can't coach
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 9 Michigan 8-2
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 at Ohio State 9-1
</P>
<P>
   A classic matchup of Big Ten teams with strong offenses and
solid defenses. Michigan, on an eight-game winning streak, plays
its best in big games, and in the last 10 years it is 8-1-1 over
Ohio State. If the Wolverines win, they will return to the Rose
Bowl. However, Ohio State rates the edge on Joe Germaine's passing,
which helped it roll up 627 yards last Saturday against Iowa. As
Hayden Fry, the Iowa coach, said of Ohio State, ``They have the
greatest conglomeration of talent that I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 Kansas State 10-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 22 at Missouri 7-3
</P>
<P>
   Even after 18 consecutive victories, including an upset of
Nebraska last week, Kansas State needs to win impressively to
preserve a shot at the national title. Missouri lost to Texas A&AMP;M
on a field goal with 90 seconds left, leading Larry Smith, the
Missouri coach, to say, ``Our guys are feeling anger, severe anger,
but we can't let this bury us.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 17 Southern California 7-3
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 at UCLA 9-0
</P>
<P>
   Despite a suspect defense, UCLA, with 19 in a row, has Division
I-A's longest winning streak. It has clinched the Pacific 10
championship, and if it dosn't make the national-championship game
in the Fiesta Bowl it will play in the Rose Bowl. Southern
California, with a freshman quarterback in Carson Palmer, appears
outmanned.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No. 19 Syracuse (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   at Temple (2-8)
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse's offense is explosive and Temple's defense has been
generous.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College (4-6)
</P>
<P>
   at West Virginia (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   A battle of tailbacks Amos Zereoue of West Virginia and Mike
Cloud of Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Penn (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Cornell (4-5)
</P>
<P>
   If Penn wins, as expected, it will gain the Ivy League title
outright.
</P>
<P>
   Yale (5-4)
</P>
<P>
   at Harvard (4-5)
</P>
<P>
   An even battle looms in the 115th edition of The Game.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   at Columbia (4-5)
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's defense, which manhandled Cornell, could provide an
upset.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth (2-7)
</P>
<P>
   at Princeton (4-5)
</P>
<P>
   If Princeton throws six interceptions, as it did against Yale,
it will lose.
</P>
<P>
   Lehigh (10-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Lafayette (3-7)
</P>
<P>
   Lehigh easily in the 134th game of football's longest-running
rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOUTH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No. 25 Kentucky (7-3)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 2 Tennessee (9-0)
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee should win, but beware of Tim Couch of Kentucky, who
has passed for 3,938 yards and 34 touchdowns this season.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   at Georgia (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi has beaten no one with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   No. 15 (tie) Arkansas (8-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Mississippi State (6-3)
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas, which almost upset Tennessee, faces another aggressive
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest (3-7)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 15 (tie) Georgia Tech (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest ends a season of high expectations and poor results.
</P>
<P>
   Houston (3-7)
</P>
<P>
   at Tulane (9-0)
</P>
<P>
   In beating Army, Shawn King of Tulane passed for 332 yards and
ran for 133.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers (5-5)
</P>
<P>
   at Virginia Tech (7-2)
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech, despite a sleepy offense, is a clear favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Army (2-7)
</P>
<P>
   at Louisville (6-4)
</P>
<P>
   Chris Redman of Louisville, who passed for 592 yards and six
touchdowns against East Carolina, may not start because of a
strained left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn (3-7)
</P>
<P>
   vs. Alabama (6-4)

IN A CUTTING GARDEN, SNIP A LITTLE, LEAVE A LOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday Nov. 22) 
 (rl) 
 By GEORGEANNE BRENNAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something compelling about the notion of a cutting
garden, conjuring visions of a figure moving gracefully down large
pathways of flowers, bending here and there to snip a bloom for the
willow basket on an arm, gathering flowers to fill the house with
thoughtfully arranged bouquets. Unfortunately, most people these
days have neither the space for such a garden nor the time to
maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   Like a vegetable garden, a cutting garden is a production
garden. It may look gorgeous as well, but its main purpose is to
produce flowers to be cut, rather than to be admired in the
landscape. Most people think of production gardens as needing large
spaces, but they also can be grown on a near-Lilliputian scale.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best flowers to grow in a small space or a container
for cutting are daffodils, tulips, sweet peas, zinnias and dahlias.
Forget the spacing instructions on the tags or the seed packets.
They should be planted very close together, creating a veritable
thicket of flowers from which to cut without destroying the
harmonious appearance of the space.
</P>
<P>
   Choose a spot that gets sun for at least three-quarters of the
day. In the fall, plant tulips and daffodils for spring bloom, and
in the spring plant sweet peas, zinnias and dahlias for summer
bloom. In areas where bulbs in containers might freeze, the
containers can be stored for the winter in an unheated garage or
closet.
</P>
<P>
   When tulips are planted outdoors at the recommended spacing of
40 or so bulbs in a square yard, or the large daffodils at 25 to 30
a square yard, they will be several inches apart. Consequently,
when they bloom there will be empty spaces among them, which is
fine for the landscape scheme and for eventual naturalizing. But
for the nearly instant gratification of having a mass of blooms
that you can cut from without leaving huge holes in your flower
patch, plant the bulbs so they touch each other.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, plant a double layer. Dig out an area about 18
inches square and 6 to 7 inches deep for full-size tulips and
daffodils (less if the bulbs are small). Place a layer of the bulbs
touching, pointed tip up. Add a second layer, nestling the bulbs on
top of the first layer. Cover with soil to a depth of an inch, and
water to settle the soil.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer to use a container, choose one at least 18 inches
deep and 18 inches across. Fill it to within 8 inches of the rim
with potting mix, and then layer the bulbs as described. A
double-layer planting like this will hold 50 standard-size tulip or
daffodil bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   For maximum effect, it is best to plant all the same variety so
they will bloom at the same time. If you can't bear having just one
variety, choose varieties that bloom together. Mixing early, mid-
and late-season tulips, for example, will produce a scattered
bloom, rather than a massed one. At home, I like to plant
old-fashioned King Alfred long-cupped daffodils in one container
and Cheerfulness, with its fragrant, dangling blossoms, in another.
I combine two single early tulip varieties in a container, the
luscious Apricot Beauty and the fragrant, cherry-pink Christmas
Marvel.
</P>
<P>
   The recommended spacing for sweet peas is 4 to 6 inches apart
for both vine and dwarf varieties. But I find that putting them
only 1 inch apart produces far more plants, and consequently
flowers. One or two square feet of ground or a container 18 inches
deep and 18 inches wide is sufficient. A trellis, stakes, wires or
string are helpful for the vine varieties.
</P>
<P>
   I much prefer the vine types, even in containers, because I cut
single stems and vines 12 to 18 inches long, with flowers in full
bloom and buds to open later. Cutting this way lets more light into
the densely packed plants, while allowing lots of bouquets. Soaking
the seeds overnight in water before planting will speed up
germination.
</P>
<P>
   Zinnias and dahlias are excellent choices for small cutting
gardens because they both branch, producing more branches and
blooms throughout the season after cutting.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of dahlia varieties in 13 different classes,
ranging from single to multipetaled and from dwarf to more than 5
feet high. The flowers range in diameter from 1 to 12 inches. For a
densely planted space, choose varieties that are 2 to 3 feet tall,
with flowers 2 to 4 inches across. Plant them about 9 inches apart
instead of the recommended 18 inches. Thus, in an area 1.5 to 2
feet square, you can plant six to eight tubers. Or put three tubers
in a container 18 inches deep and across.
</P>
<P>
   Zinnias, too, come in a wide range of colors and shapes, though
they are not as varied as dahlias. For cutting, I prefer the
California Giants and the Cactus, both of which branch heavily and
grow to 2.5 to 3 feet tall. For a dense planting, scatter the seeds
about an inch apart over prepared garden ground and rake them in,
covering them with about a quarter-inch of soil. Once they have
germinated, you can thin them to 2 inches apart.
</P>
<P>
   When the flowers are in bloom, put on a straw hat, pick up a
gathering basket and flower shears and head out to the cutting
garden, even if it is just an overflowing container on a balcony,
bursting with tulips.

 &HT;    'PRIVATE RYAN' MOVIE SPURS NEW INTEREST IN NORMANDY

   COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France _ Wandering through a stark white sea
of crosses and Stars of David, Warren Beasley looks hard for the
name of a buddy long lost but not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   For Beasley, 77, a retiree from New Jersey, the memories had
seemed to have all but vanished until early last month when he
popped in to see a movie in London during a visit with his son.
They decided to go see ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which opened in
Europe at the beginning of October. The movie chronicles the Army's
effort to locate one soldier, Private Ryan, and return him to
America after his three brothers have been killed in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't on the beaches for D-Day invasion of France, but quite
a few of his buddies were in the landing crafts that assaulted the
heavily fortified hillside positions 54 years ago. He was riveted
by the movie and decided he couldn't return to the United States
without seeing the beaches and cemetery for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been so long,'' he said in the crisp, clear autumn
morning. ``But the movie made me think about it again, after all
these years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steven Spielberg movie has sparked a new interest in the
stories contained in the beaches, villages and hills of Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the movie's beaches, which were actually in Ireland, and
the French villages, which were in a location set outside London,
the cemetery shown at the movie's beginning and end is authentic:
the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 9,400 American soldiers are buried in the lusciously
landscaped 172-acre cemetery on a rise overlooking Omaha Beach. The
beaches and hillsides bear a few reminders of the war in the forms
of memorials and the remnants of German bunkers, but the cemetery
and its monuments are the largest tangible reminders of the
terrible struggle that occurred there.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Rivers, superintendent of the site since 1982, said the
movie has kindled fresh interest in Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now getting a lot of interest from the generation born
after the war, and even from the grandchildren of those who
fought,'' he said. ``They understand better now and have a greater
respect for that family member.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, the number of visitors to the cemetery was up by a
third _ reaching 36,000 compared with last year's 27,000. Visits by
relatives of those buried in the cemetery were up 50 percent. Tour
groups and guides report bookings well into mid-1999, unheard of
even in these heavily visited regions.
</P>
<P>
   As it is with the world these days, visitors tend to look as
much for connections to the movie as to the history that inspired
it.
</P>
<P>
   The sidewalk the elderly Ryan walks in the opening scene is easy
to discern, with the English Channel stretching in the background.
</P>
<P>
   While the movie's main character, Capt. John Miller _ played by
Tom Hanks _ led the effort to find Private Ryan, Miller never
existed.
</P>
<P>
   However, three of four real-life brothers did die in the war.
Two of the brothers, named Niland, were killed at Normandy and are
buried side-by-side there. A third brother was killed in the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The survivor became a dentist and died at 50.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley eventually gave up the search for his buddy's grave. But
he said the trip was worthwhile, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world like this, people need to see this,'' he said.
``They need to be reminded what an ugly thing war is and to
remember the young men who were so brave in the middle of it.''

SAN FRANCISCO'S TOP COPS TRADE INSULTS, EXPLETIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco's two top law enforcement officers
took time out from fighting crime last week to take a few swings at
each other.
</P>
<P>
   In a bitter, obscenity-laced argument the night of Nov. 13,
police Chief Fred Lau and District Attorney Terence Hallinan argued
over the police handling of a nonviolent protest in front of the
district attorney's home.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was over, Hallinan had accused Lau of never
getting out from behind his desk and not being able to control his
officers. Lau retorted that Hallinan ``knows nothing'' about
prosecuting criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of the argument were reluctantly confirmed by each
man, although _ as expected _ each differs on some details.
</P>
<P>
   The men said they were ``trying to put this behind us'' and
``trying to work together.'' Both said Thursday they regretted the
incident, which involved about five minutes of trading insults.
</P>
<P>
   The two said they hoped the incident did not cause long-term
damage in the relations between the law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of us were at our best. ... It was a tense
conversation. He lost his temper and so did I. I really want to
forget the whole thing,'' Hallinan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Said Lau: ``I used language I should not have used; I said
things I wish I hadn't and I think it's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan, a one-time boxer at the University of California at
Berkeley, is famous for his hot temper. In 1996, he was involved in
a public shoving match with Joe O'Donoghue, president of the
Residential Builders Association.
</P>
<P>
   Lau, on the other hand, is almost as well known for keeping his
cool. His unflappable manner has become his trademark in the
high-pressure job of commanding 2,000 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The verbal confrontation stems from a protest outside Hallinan's
home over the handling by the district attorney's office of a
shooting involving police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan said he was angry that the noisy protesters showed up
at his home and that he received no warning from the police. One of
Hallinan's investigators and two police officers arrived just
minutes ahead of the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan said he tried to speak to the crowd but was heckled. He
said it took the police 45 minutes to arrive in significant
numbers. After the hourlong protest, Hallinan told a longtime
friend in the Police Department how angry he was. That resulted in
Lau contacting Hallinan later that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was critical of the Police Department's security measures of
public officials and the conversation degenerated into him swearing
at me. ... I let the chief know how I felt and at some point he
lost his temper. ... Once it became an argument, it just got out of
hand. I got pretty hot,'' Hallinan said.
</P>
<P>
   Lau said, ``It was a very heated conversation. ... I don't want
to talk about it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Lau said the demonstration was never out of control. No
demonstrators were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a peaceful protest,'' Lau said. ``There were sufficient
officers present. ... I fully respect the privacy of his home, his
family and his private life. I respect his emotions.''

THE GRIDIRON ISN'T ALWAYS GREENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``A Tale of Two Cities,'' Charles Dickens wrote of the best
of times and the worst of times in Paris and London, but he could
have been writing about Oakland and Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Both cities gloried in prosperity early in this century. But the
best of times vanished in a slow economic and psychological
decline. Oakland has long grumbled about being in the shadow of its
sophisticated neighbor, San Francisco. In Hartford, as Governor
John Rowland of Connecticut, said Thursday, ``We want to be more
than a mile marker between Boston and New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Both cities turned to professional football for salvation,
rejecting common sense notions of urban economics. The National
Football League is a suburban enterprise, drawn to the parking-lot
datelines of Irving, Texas, Pontiac, Mich., and East Rutherford,
N.J. But cities depend on density, diversity and daily use, not on
festivals, however popular, occuring eight or ten days a year.
</P>
<P>
   In Oakland in 1995, the entire political leadership of the city
and of Alameda County wooed the Los Angeles Raiders to return to
Oakland, which the team had left in 1982 for Los Angeles. The
unanimity in Oakland was as impressive as the phalanx of consent in
Connecticut last week. (When politicians are unanimous, they seek
to reduce risk and recrimination. In 1964, all but two members of
Congress approved the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. When the war in
Vietnam turned out badly, its adherents murmured that it seemed
like a good idea at the time.)
</P>
<P>
   Nobody asked the question in Oakland that few dare ask in the
Nutmeg State today: ``Can we sell 65,000 seats at $50 apiece in a
city that's not very rich?'' In 1995, Oakland politicians chorused
``No problem!'' to this question.
</P>
<P>
   Three seasons later, the ripple effect is devastating. Since the
team rarely sells out, half its games are not on television, which
in turn depresses attendance. When $40 million in stadium cost
overruns came due, no one was in the skyboxes to accept the bill.
After two empty-seat seasons, the city and county were required by
contract to pay an extra $15 million to keep the stadium operating.
The money came out of the school budget, the park budget, the
police budget, and all the other dry holes that were supposed to
pump manna from the sacred font of pro football.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders owner Al Davis is oft-maligned, but he is a businessman
who did not drive a bargain; he merely stood there to be showered
with taxpayer dollars. Bob Kraft is a businessman saluting the
anthem of the NFL, ``Show me the money!.'' With a succulent deal,
he would prosper as owner of the Pawtucket Patriots or Presque Isle
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rozelle, the publicist who became NFL commissioner,
nationalized the game because he knew that network television was
more important than ticket sales. Fans face a 200-mile round trip
to see their team? Too bad. We care more about couch spuds. But the
blackout rule, which dispirits Oakland fans, will hurt the Patriots
if they fail to sell out. The 75-mile radius would keep the team
off home screens in Providence, as well as Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   NFL propaganda depicts its franchises as talismans of quality
and prosperity. Strangely, however, cities bereft of this source of
metropolitan contentment stagger through the gloom.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, after five years without a team, people hike,
read, bicycle, surf, and even watch pro football on television.
Like everyone else in America, they face a Sunday lineup of so-what
games between has-been or never-were franchises. Salary caps and
free agency have sacked the sport's dynasties. Tonight! On your
teevee! Tampa Bay vs. Jacksonville! As Fred Allen once said in
another context, you might be interested if you happen to be an
orange.
</P>
<P>
   In happy Hartford, some will be excited and others will be wary.
The experience of Los Angeles suggests that life will go on in
Boston and even in Foxborough.

NEW COUGAR IS ADRENALINE ON THE CHEAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, November 22, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A common automotive lament these days is: ``They all look
alike.'' In truth, while autos in general do not look
(itals)exactly(unitals) alike, they do, for the most part, all look
like they have been in the sun a bit long and partially melted.
</P>
<P>
   Why? There are two primary reasons for the apparent me-too-ism
in autoland. The first is the wind tunnel. The second is the focus
group.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel economy regulations, the corporate average fuel economy
requirements or CAFE, govern sedan/coupe/wagon manufacture and put
carmakers in a bit of a styling bind. There are limited avenues to
the goal of reducing fuel consumption _ mainly powertrain
efficiency, weight reduction, and elimination of friction.
</P>
<P>
   Engine efficiency has its limits in the laws of physics and the
demands of the consumer _ nobody wants a car that takes all day to
reach highway speed. Weight reduction, too, has its limits and they
may have been reached, at least for the time being. Lighter
materials are available, but they are much more costly right now,
and how light a sedan will you accept in the third windiest city in
America?
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to friction reduction. The most successful route
to friction reduction has been in designing a car that slips easily
through the air; a very large portion of the power required to run
a car is consumed in forcing the vehicle through resistant air.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to boring, look-alike cars. The best shape to
overcome wind resistance is a pumpkin seed, not a very practical
shape for designing containers for families. Although the wind
tunnel largely dictates design today, imaginative styling and good
engineering can reduce friction very substantially while still
offering pizazz.
</P>
<P>
   Except when you introduce the focus group into the design
process. Since bringing a car to market is a very expensive
undertaking, manufacturers feel it is smart to ascertain customer
acceptance before investing in the manufacturing machinery. Various
designs are tried out on focus groups, selected groups of average
customers who pass judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But judgment often depends on what one is asked to judge. As Bob
Lutz, erstwhile Chrysler second banana, is quick to point out, one
will have more success with a product that really turns on a
minority than with one that merely fails to displease a majority.
Focus groups give us consensus; they are the security blanket of
the industry _ and a rather wet blanket at that.
</P>
<P>
   Still some achieve distinction. Volkswagen's modern Beetle is
selling well, stands out from the crowd. It's not a great car (it's
a good one, a Golf underneath the funky skin) but it has
personality.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying problem in the industry is the lack of passion
for cars in management corridors. The bean-counters and marketeers
who today bring expertise in accounting or retailing have no
burning desire for the car, no inspiration, no clue as to how to
hammer the want button in the consumer. So why should we, the
customers, get all het up?
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some cars that make the pulse quicken _ BMW Z3
or M, Mercedes SLs or CLKs, Mustang Cobra ... Mercury Cougar.
Cougar?
</P>
<P>
   The Cougar is new, different from any previous Cougar rendition.
Originally, it was the Mercury version of Mustang, later it was
Mercury's version of Thunderbird, today it's Mercury's version of a
'90s 2(plus)2. Compared to those German pulse pumpers, it's
adrenaline on the cheap, $16,695 for the V-6 version with the
sporty suspension.
</P>
<P>
   OK, for excitement you'll raise your blood pressure more with a
Ford Contour SVT at $22,665, but the Cougar is a smart looking
little package that stands out in the crowd, moves with some
authority, and offers crisp handling and a taut suspension. It
feels like something more expensive, more European than a Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the California influence _ Mercury is now
headquartered in LaLa Land, perhaps giving the design team a ...
different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   For $700 less, the Cougar is labeled T60 and comes with a
125-horsepower (130 ft/lb torque) I-4 16-valve Zetec engine and
virtually the entire long list of equipment you will find on the
T61 with its 170-hp (165 ft/lb), 24-valve Duratec V-6 _ air bags,
air conditioning power locks and windows, dual power mirrors, tach,
trip computer, 5-speed manual transaxle, variable wipers, and a lot
of other stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The tested model came with the optional $815 4-speed automatic,
$350 compact disc changer, leather, ABS, and traction control. You
don't have to get all that stuff and drive up the price, but the
$235 traction control and $500 ABS make a lot of sense on a sporty
car.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the automatic, acceleration with the Cougar is quite
good _ you can feel the torque as you step on it. Underway, it's
responsive, quick, demonstrating good passing ability. The ABS and
traction control combine to provide sure footing in uncertain
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   This is billed as a 3-door coupe; it's a hatchback of sorts,
albeit a sleek one. The rear seat backs fold to offer added cargo
space but the sill is a mite high when you're trying to unload
heavy stuff from the depths of the rear. The glove box is fair, a
small covered bin sits between the front seats (just behind a
pop-up cupholder); small bins in the doors and seatback pockets
complete the interior storage facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The dash layout is simple enough; the instrument cluster has the
speedometer overlapping the tachometer like an imitation of a
Mastercard logo, with temperature gauge on one side and fuel gauge
on the other. Mirror and window controls sit on the driver's door,
conveniently grouped high up.
</P>
<P>
   Radio controls are fair _ too many buttons but at least they're
large enough to be manipulated conveniently, mostly. The radio
provided the only aggravation; it cut out. Investigation indicated
a ground fault somewhere, since pushing on the front of it would
cause it to operate. After some pushing, thumping, and twiddling,
it resumed normal function and continued to please for the
remainder of the test tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougar V-6 offers sprightly performance and delivers good
fuel economy. It is EPA-rated 24 miles per gallon city, 34 highway
in the 4-cylinder version, 19/26 in the V-6 with manual, 20/29 in
the V-6 with automatic _ what the auto writer drove. The auto
writer averaged 25.98 miles per gallon over 1,347.6 miles measured
in a variety of driving conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Cougar is a comfortable small car on a long haul. I won't vouch
for comfort in the rear seats _ I don't go there much in 2-door
models _ but up front it's a dandy. Thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the guy who developed that funky little VW is now
working for Ford.

SMALL HALO SHINES OVER `SAINT MAYBE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SAINT MAYBE 
Starring: Thomas McCarthy, Mary Louise Parker, Jeffrey Nordling,
Blythe Danner, Edward Herrmann 
Directed by: Michael Pressman 
On: CBS, Ch.4: Sunday 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Midway through ``Saint Maybe,'' Blythe Danner's character, Bee
Bedloe, is told a wrenching bit of news regarding the death of her
oldest son. Danner handles the moment with all the emotional
immediacy and class that have made her into a critics' favorite,
her eyes quickly turning to stone, her legs giving out from the
weight of the knowledge. You can almost feel her motherly heart
palpitating as the haunting words resound in her head.
</P>
<P>
   And there are just about enough small, critical moments like
that to save ``Saint Maybe'' from a quicksand of sentimentality and
sanctimoniousness. As a Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation (the
first of the season), the made-for-TV family drama contains its
share of syrup and fast-food spirituality, with a ``Touched by an
Angel''-like religious conversion at the center of its plot. But as
an adaptation of Anne Tyler's 1991 novel, it has the literary
benefits of quirky characterization, elliptical narration, and a
take on human behavior that mostly steers clear of the
black-and-white. It's graceful, well-acted, smartly filmed
schmaltz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saint Maybe'' is a chronicle of the emotional life of the
Bedloe family of Baltimore. In the mid-1960s, post office worker
Dan Bedloe quickly falls in love with and marries Lucy, a divorcee
with two kids, when she innocently asks to send a bowling ball via
air-mail. Played with appealing vulnerability by Mary-Louise
Parker, Lucy is either a magical woman-child not at home in the
world, or a two-timing floozy. Dan's brother, Ian, is fully
convinced she's the latter and wants to open Dan's eyes. But when
Ian tells Dan, the result is a fatal accident that will haunt Ian
for the rest of his days.
</P>
<P>
   And so the movie takes on some big themes through the character
of Ian _ how grief can keep us from life, how guilt can distract us
from responsibility, how religious fanaticism can become a lonely
place. Ian finds respite from his torment at ``The Church of the
Second Chance,'' where he learns to work out his feelings by taking
action, namely raising Lucy and Dan's children. He grows into a
loving parent, whole-heartedly devoted to his church but a little
removed from the world of love. As Ian, newcomer Thomas McCarthy
gives a steady, but slightly vague, performance. He doesn't quite
nail the subtleties of Ian's inner conflicts, but he's got a
fascinating-looking face, with a hugely clefted chin and an aspect
that seems radically different when shot from different angles.
</P>
<P>
   The pacing of ``Saint Maybe'' is unusual, as the plot develops
in leaps and bounds, with years passing and characters departing
during the commercials. The first half of the movie forms an almost
self-enclosed narrative arc, and so the second half feels a bit
like a distended epilogue. But the movie ultimately hangs together,
and benefits from some sure-handed camerawork that turns many of
the scenes into little set pieces. With its understated tone and
moments of insight, ``Saint Maybe'' manages to stand out on the
current TV movie landscape.

THE STAIN IS PURGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 22, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lowest moment for me in Thursday's dismal 12-hour televising
of the House Judiciary Committee impeachment exercise _ and it is
merely an exercise, like situps or jumping-jacks _ was when Kenneth
Starr described his systematic and surreptious entrapment of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr witness, the only witness, is the legal-eagle who
never witnessed anything in person, who admitted as an afterthought
that he's come up with nothing impeachable about Whitewater,
Filegate or Travelgate. Starr airily dismissed those other
long-running right-wing conspiracies that blackened Clinton's
reputation, but he clings to the semen-stained dress.
</P>
<P>
   Monica-maniacal, I call it. The sexual liason that was never
consummated is now the impeachment effort that cannot be
culminated. I covered the 1974 House Judiciary Committee probe that
propelled the corruption of Nixonism out of office. That was a
lofty, dignified, noble effort _ bipartisan, rigorously conducted,
and honorably concluded. Alas, Thursday's Goon Show was the Peter
Rodino drama replayed as a Henry Hyde farce: Pathetically partisan,
fatally compromised, an exercise of a dysfunctional family.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's undeniable legal legerdemain will prove of little use in
turning public opinion to his side. His whole enterprise, spawned
in partisan rancor, reeks of unfairness. His doughy countenance,
his unappealing voice, his elaborate precision of speech and his
pedantically professorial demeanor will not strike fear in the
heart of Bubba, nor wavering Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr told of how Clinton pollster Dick Morris, another
extra-curricular ladies' man, advised the wary president of Starr's
tightening snare, the prosecutor zeroed in on this, his last, best
shot at the President: ``Political polling led to Hollywood
staging,'' pronounced the president's persecutor with a sniff. Wow.
After dodging all those bullets on Whitewater, Filegate,
Travelgate, You-name-it-gate, Clinton was trying to make the Monica
business go away, but Starr had three ladies named Monica, Linda,
Lucianne.
</P>
<P>
   There are one million lawyers in America, and the smart ones
understand this: people don't like lawyers, until they need one.
Starr's basic problem is simply: Americans have decided we don't
need this particular lawyer, pursuing this particular president, in
such prurient and puritanical fashion, over matters so personal and
private. Period. Starr's fevered account of Clinton's pecadilloes
demands we give Starr the benefit of the doubt he'd deny Clinton.
Sorry, Ken; it's the other guy we voted for.
</P>
<P>
   But: how to shut this runaway congressional reactor down, before
the resulting radiation zaps all of them? The Starr search for
evidence to impeach is hung up on the rocks, neither sunk nor
beached nor docked, a derelict drifting in from the Sargasso Sea of
cynicism, crewed by a self-destructing congressional leadership.
Can't anybody here figure a way out of this?
</P>
<P>
   To the rescue ride I. My prescription for this low-grade,
low-rent fever that paralyzes our bone-headed congresspersons will
not please every faction, but would end what is not our long
national nightmare, but our media's long national wet-dream.
Winding up Ken Starr's four-year romp in the wilderness of
Whitewater requires some adult guidance. My scenario:
</P>
<P>
   The 21 Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee vote to
approve the full set of impeachment recommendations they got from
their Starr search. The 16 Democrats vote nay, natch. As soon as
practicable, the current House members convene. Speaker Gingrich,
soon to be gone, calls for an immediate vote. Congressmen who wish
to impeach vote yes, the rest nay. The nays will have it, with
enough Republicans joining all but a handful of Democrats to defeat
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker-to-be Bob Livingston (R-La.) offers a sustitute motion,
to censure the President for his Monica-mania and subsequent
derelictions. He then asks for the House to recognize for one
half-hour three special guests waiting off the floor. In parade
three of the four living ex-presidents: Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter,
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   These worthies then summon to the chamber a chastened William
Jefferson Clinton for a formal vote of censure in the House. First
Bush, who lost to Clinton, then Carter, who lost to Reagan, and
then Ford, who lost to Carter, each speak for ten minutes. Their
theme: why sitting presidents must tell the truth, not paw the
pulchritudinous patronage people, respect the office, and turn over
the presidency in decent shape to the next in line.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has already suggested some sort of
censure-short-of-impeachment by the Congress. He came in to pick up
the pieces after Nixon. And Carter and Bush have each made plain
their fears for how Clinton devalued the moral authority which is
any president's most potent political tool.
</P>
<P>
   The effect, though only symbolic, is immense. It's as when a
military man, after court martial, has the brass buttons ripped
from his uniform. The president is punished, but the presidency is
exalted. It fits.
</P>
<P>
   Following these solemn denunciations by previous presidents, a
solemn vote is taken. The House formally rebukes Clinton, who
stands contritely in the well of the chamber, chewing his lip and
looking pensive. The whole world watches gape-mouthed at such an
unprecedented spectacle: the formal rebuke of the planet's most
powerful person. The symbolism is overwhelming. The honor of the
office is retreived.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the biggest punishment of all: Clinton does not get to
speak! After Ford's final speech, and the
roll-call-to-end-this-mess, in which the vast majority of members
would probably vote ``aye,'' Gerald Ford leads the assemblage in
the singing of ``America the Beautiful,'' the Rev. Billy Graham
delivers a brief benediction, and everyone goes home.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is suitably admonished. Three prior presidents testify
to the solemnity of the occasion, and the continued dignity of the
office. The stain is purged. Clinton goes back to work. Congress is
off the hook. Everyone is happy but the news media executives, who
have to get a life after Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, this dreadful mess, which demeaned every
participant, including the commenators and chroniclers, is at last
behind us.

RATDOG SPINS OFF FROM DEAD START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When members of the post-Grateful Dead band the Other Ones
toured last summer, they enjoyed a flood of media attention. That's
not the case with the spinoff band, Ratdog, which is slipping in
and out of towns this fall like a pack of guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine with singer Bob Weir _ as long as the music is
good _ and he's definitely found it to his liking this tour. He's
especially pleased with the addition of guitarist Mark Karan, who
was also with the Other Ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the right mix of jazzbos and rock 'n' roll guys
now,'' says Weir. ``It doesn't get top heavy one way or the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratdog, led by Weir and bassist Rob Wasserman, plays a fusion of
jazz, blues, R&AMP;B, and straight-ahead rock. There's every intention
to develop more original material, but the group is still leaning
on the Grateful Dead songbook for ``about one-third to one-half of
our repertoire,'' says Weir. ``We're also doing more jamming this
tour.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dead songs performed on the tour include ``Jack Straw,''
``Sugar Magnolia,'' ``Hell in a Bucket,'' ``Loose Lucy,'' ``China
Cat Sunflower,'' ``Victim or the Crime,'' and ``Playing in the
Band.'' The group also has been covering Bob Dylan's ``All Along
the Watchtower'' and ``Desolation Row.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a bunch of new (Ratdog) songs that we wanted to do this
tour, but we need lyrics for them,'' says Weir. ``My goal is to
replace more of the Grateful Dead stuff with new songs, but that
will have to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratdog also contains saxophonist Dave Ellis (who has a new album
called ``In the Long Run''), drummer Jay Lane, and keyboardist Jeff
Chimenti.
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones, however, have a more uncertain future; Weir is
uncertain about this group touring next summer. ``I'm not sure it
will be an every-year kind of deal. There are a whole lot of chiefs
in that tribe,'' he says, noting for example that he's not the only
Other One to have an outside band. Drummer Mickey Hart and
keyboardist Bruce Hornsby have their own groups, so all of this
will weigh on how often the Other Ones can tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones, boosted by Dead bassist Phil Lesh last summer,
will be represented by a two-CD live set due just before Christmas.
``We've mixed it and I'm trying to come up with a running order of
the songs,'' Weir says.
</P>
<P>
   The album will be released by Grateful Dead Records, and Weir
hinted that a second live double album will come out next year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A beguiling Betwixt: A new band to watch is Betwixt, an unusual,
art-pop/jazz-rock group that features former members of Turkish
Delight and Bulkhead. Singer Leah Callahan writes the lyrics, which
deal with relationships, while the music is a shared endeavor with
other members Tom Devaney (guitars), David Nelson (drums and
clarinet), and Brandeis student Gordon Withers (cello). The group's
engagingly offbeat sound can be heard on a recent debut CD,
``Moustache,'' produced and engineered by Boston legend David
Minehan (of the Neighborhoods).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're poppy, but we have a harder edge now, compared to when
we made the record,'' says Callahan.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be misled by the cello in the group. While it provides
some classical and goth overtones, it's also used in a rock
context, even providing some guitar-like leads. ``Our cellist likes
heavy rock. It's not like we throw a cello in there because it
sounds nice,'' adds Callahan. One of Withers's favorite groups is
Apocalyptica, which does all-cello covers of Metallica songs.
</P>
<P>
   It's also instructive to look at Betwixt's cover songs, which
include Led Zeppelin's ``Whole Lotta Love,'' the Bow Wow Wow
version of ``I Want Candy,'' and Lee Hazelwood's ``Sundown,
Sundown.'' Definitely a band that defies stereotyping.

TONY BENNETT'S RELENTLESSLY UPBEAT `GOOD LIFE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MCCABE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE GOOD LIFE 
By Tony Bennett, with Will Friedwald 
Pocket Books, 312 pp., illustrated, $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony Bennett's a nice guy. Most of the people who know him seem
to think so. He's talented, too; he's an artist. In fact, he may be
the adult pop singer now that Frank Sinatra is gone. And by the
way, did you know Sinatra anointed him his successor before he
left?
</P>
<P>
   Author Tony Bennett doesn't seem to think singer Tony Bennett's
bad, either. Sure, he's made some mistakes. But very few in his
dedication to his music and his fans, of whom there are many, and
more all the time. He's now the keeper of the flame.
</P>
<P>
   These are the unsurprising themes of this deceptively easygoing
and feel-good show-business autobiography. It's an ambiguous, gauzy
solo of a muted instrument, a voice of limited range. If it were a
Tony Bennett number, it would rank somewhere in the middle between
his jazz and adult pop hits _ like his signature ``I Left My Heart
in San Francisco'' _ and ``In the Middle of an Island,'' the
juvenile novelty number that was forced on him by Columbia Rec-ords
in his difficult days there (and a number he now says he's never
been asked to sing in decades of appearing live in concert).
</P>
<P>
   The book starts out interestingly, informatively, energetically.
Here's the best description of all, Bennett's excitement about
Count Basie: ``His music was all about dynamics and nuances, first
soft and then BOOM! There would be unexpected little body blows and
then knockout punches. BOOM, BOOM, BAM!'' There are other
intriguing insights on performing, singing, technique, and artistic
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Then we start slowing down. The deceleration is in direct
proportion to Bennett's accelerating professional success. By page
189 we're cringing as Duke Ellington sends his choir over to the
despondent Bennett's Manhattan hotel to cheer him up with its
rendition of ``On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever).'' We have to
hear about the vaunted MTV video that caused The New York Times to
gush that he had ``not just bridged the generation gap, he has
demolished it. Eventually, the book devolves into show-busy patter
and patois. The eyes glaze over at the parade of greats,
near-greats, names, shows, concerts, albums, and moments that may
well be real but seem synthetic. Oh, and anecdotes, most if not all
showing the singer's best side.
</P>
<P>
   There are some gems among them. Bob Hope, who discovered and
supported Bennett and changed his name to fit on a marquee, tells a
New York audience after the young Bennett finishes his number:
``Well, I was getting tired of Crosby anyhow!''
</P>
<P>
   Narratively, the book is at its best when the younger Bennett is
struggling, particularly as a kid in the Army. That's where he
learned survival skills enabling him not only to get by but to
outmaneuver his adversaries in his biggest professional battle: He
was trying to keep himself from being buried alive by kids and
their music, rock 'n' roll. The ``suits'' couldn't faze Bennett;
after all, back when he was a teenager in the Army, he had been
awakened at 4 a.m. to hear a speech by General George S. Patton,
saying in part: ``Now listen up! Forget your mothers and everything
else you've ever known! You're going up to the line.'' Bennett
comments, ``Can you imagine saying that _ `Forget your mothers!' _
to a bunch of terrified kids?''
</P>
<P>
   Personal difficulties like failed marriages and a drug problem
are given quick once-over treatment. Mob influence in the industry
is given a nod and a wink. What's a guy who's trying to make it in
the business supposed to do?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to calibrate the collaboration that made this
proj-ect. Assuming Bennett was in control, he might have been
better advised to give coauthor Will Friedwald _ who was Sinatra's
Boswell with his ``Sinatra! The Song Is You'' _ more latitude. The
rules apply to a book as well as a show: ``That's the idea, to let
the audience know how you feel,'' Bennett says. To let them ``dream
along with me,'' as Perry Como sang, or to reveal yourself in the
way Bennett says Nat King Cole did, so that Cole ``hypnotized''
him. That's the idea, anyway.

BRUCE LOOKS BACK  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many young artists look at the fickle pop scene and figure
they'll be lucky to put out one album, maybe two, before the
corporate ax falls. That's not an attitude to spark creativity _
and it's not an attitude that was ever shared by Bruce Springsteen,
for whom music has been a fervent calling since he emerged from the
New Jersey Shore in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, I imagined I would have a long work
life,'' he says. ``I didn't know if it would be a successful one,
or what the stages would be, but I always saw myself as a lifetime
musician and songwriter. I was always concerned with writing to my
age at a particular moment. That was the way I would keep faith
with the audience that supported me as I went along.''
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen, 49, has kept that faith with a new boxed set,
``Tracks,'' which skillfully collects 56 previously unissued songs
that not only show how prolific he's been in the last
quarter-century, but how he's matured from fun-loving, bar-band
innocent to worldly poet/philosopher whose recent appointment to
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was well-earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted my music to influence the life you were living
emotionally _ with your family, your lover, your wife, and, at a
certain point, with your children. So I aspired to write across a
wide range of topics. I guess the only map I followed was what I
found myself going through in my own life,'' Springsteen says from
his home in New Jersey. (He moved back from Los Angeles, but he
kept his home there.)
</P>
<P>
   The four-CD box moves from his early folk-rock, Dylan-inspired
days (including his solo audition for Columbia talent scout John
Hammond), through the evolution of his E Street Band into a sleek,
R&AMP;B-influenced machine, to his most recent, post-E Street decade of
exploring introspective domestic issues, often in sparse musical
settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like an alternate career,'' Springsteen says of the
box. ``When I listened to the whole thing, it was like another
slightly abbreviated, but completely alternate, body of work that I
felt had really stood the test of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of it also restores the fun to his career. In recent years
(and to some extent, since he began), he has accented his serious
side, especially on the most recent studio CD, ``The Ghost of Tom
Joad,'' a scarifying, Steinbeckian look at a soured American dream.
That led to a solo tour that was artfully conceived, but almost
morose, in the opinion of some fans.
</P>
<P>
   The new box, though, helped Springsteen ``get back to the fun of
a rock band. It connected me with singing loud and playing loud
again, which is something I've always loved doing. It was a big
change from `Tom Joad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen's party side is back in force on the new box, which
is filled with high-flying rock tunes that were left off previous
discs because they didn't fit the mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, some of the songs that were the most fun, and the
most entertaining and rocking, fell by the wayside because I was
concerned with what I was going to say and how I was going to say
it,'' he admits. ``I write in the liner notes that the reason some
got left off was just contextual. Like, the songs `Give the Girl a
Kiss' and `So Young and in Love' just wouldn't have fit onto (the
album) `Darkness on the Edge of Town' at the time, but they were
fun bar-band rockers.''
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen didn't anguish, however, about filing them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you're working along, everything you've done remains an
ongoing and open project,'' he says. ``I never felt like, even when
I didn't use these songs, they were going to be gone or lost
forever. I felt there would be a moment when I released them. I
just didn't know it would be this far down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The 56 previously unreleased tracks were actually whittled down
from 200-plus songs that Springsteen had in the vaults. He took
what he felt were the best and had them remixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three studios going,'' he recalls of the process. ``I
had a (sound) truck in my yard, I had a studio in the house, and
then I had (mixing engineer) Bob Clearmountain calling me on the
phone from California.''
</P>
<P>
   He also solicited the opinions of his former E Street Band
members, who stopped by his home to hear songs they may not have
heard in 10 to 20 years. ``I'd run things by them that we were
working on at the time, and it was fun hearing their responses,''
says Springsteen.
</P>
<P>
   E Street drummer Max Weinberg would stop by the most, following
his gig on ``The Conan O'Brien Show.'' He and keyboardist Roy
Bittan were later additions to the E Street Band, helping modernize
its sound in the late '70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Max and Roy got into the picture, they formalized the
structure in a certain way, which is what I was looking for,'' says
Springsteen. ``I was looking for something that would streamline
the sound with people who had a wide range of playing styles, as
Max did. He found the place where Keith Moon and Bernard Purdie
intersected. Sometimes we played like the Who and sometimes we
played like an R&AMP;B band. And you needed somebody who felt
completely comfortable covering both places.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into the second CD (on the box), that's when we
really learned how to record the band in the studio dynamically for
the first time. On those sessions for `The River' album _ when
Stevie Van Zandt came in and joined the production team _ we were
committed to capturing some of that excitement. You hear the band
tightening and there was a sort of very contained chaos on songs
like `Roulette,' `Dollhouse,' and `Where the Bands Are.' The band
was playing with tremendous energy, but within a formal arrangement
and the tension that's created. The level of playing is some of my
favorite on the whole (box). It was a great moment _ and a moment
when the band realized itself on another level.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that carries over to the time of (the 1984 album) `Born in
the USA' with a song like `Lion's Den.' I should have put that out!
Why didn't I put that out? It sounds like a hit now. The band is
playing great and the horns come in and it has a great chorus. It
was just too much fun to put out, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   In those years, Springsteen was also trying to distance himself
from his working-class father, who had an enormous impact on his
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early years, I found a voice that was my voice and also
partly my father's voice. But isn't that what you always do? Why do
kids at 5 years old go into the closet and put their daddy's shoes
on? Hey, my kids do it,'' Springsteen says of the three children
he's had with his wife, Patti Scialfa.
</P>
<P>
   ``They run in the car and they come out clunking along with your
boots on. And I think that was part of what I was doing. It was the
fuel and fire for a lot of songs, particularly on `Darkness' and
`The River.' It's always been a central connection. Then you go
beyond it and find your own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``So as I look through the boxed set, it provides you with
records that could have been. But it also fills out all those
records in a certain way and helps articulate a little (more
clearly) the connections that I was trying to make.''
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, Springsteen heaps praise on the E Street
Band, which included saxophonist Clarence Clemons, organist Danny
Federici, and guitarist Nils Lofgren. There have been rumors of a
reunion tour to back the boxed set (Stevie Nicks and Steve Miller
have both done boxed-set tours in recent years), but Springsteen is
reluctant to commit now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll dodge the question as best I can,'' he says with a laugh.
``I don't have any concrete tour plans at the moment, but I've
talked to the guys and, actually, I've talked to all the guys,
going back years. The relationships have all sustained. I had some
of the greatest nights of my life onstage with them. I can't
imagine at some point that we wouldn't do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Springsteen is writing again. He reportedly has
nearly completed a hip-hop album and a country album, but isn't
sure if he'll put either one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a synthesist. I'm always making music. And I make a lot of
different kinds of music all the time. Some of it gets finished and
some of it doesn't,'' he says. ``I found a gray area that actually
works very well for me. I tell myself I'm not making a record and
then I feel free to do anything, no matter how bad or good it might
be. And then I wake up one morning and go, `I have a record!' I've
used that mental state a lot since (the 1982 disc) `Nebraska.'
That's when I really didn't think I was making a record, yet I made
one of my favorite records and it had some of my best writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have another record out by the end of the century,
which isn't that far away,'' he says. ``But I don't know where I'm
going to take it at this particular moment.''

 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 550 words.
 &HT;    With BRAZIL-DATA-1121.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When world leaders announced a huge bailout for Brazil,
they hoped it would stave off an emerging-market crisis that has
already crippled Asia and Russia, and now threatens the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, it's worked.
</P>
<P>
   The $41.5 billion package that the world's eighth-largest
economy signed with the International Monetary Fund on Nov. 13 has
sent many stocks up and slowed capital flight to a mere trickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of external support with internal reforms will
permit Brazil to resume growth during 1999,'' Brazilian Finance
Minister Pedro Malan confidently predicted this week.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts worry that Brazil may be celebrating victory before
actually fighting the battle.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso still has to push a slew of
tax increases and spending cuts through Brazil's Congress in order
to implement an austerity plan designed to save $84 billion over
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his proposals -- such as a doubling of the tax rate on
financial transactions -- have met with mounting opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the measures are approved by early next year, the IMF
could back off, dangerously eroding investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial crisis is far from over,'' said Michael
Connolly, professor of international economics at the University of
Miami. ``There's still lots of work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, top economists are far from optimistic over the
country's future, and many predict that the economy will contract
by 2 to 3 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-two billion dollars for Brazil is not enough,'' said
Lawrence Goodman, an economist with Santander Investment Securities
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the world's economic turmoil still poses a real
danger for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has suffered from a gigantic budget deficit, plummeting
foreign reserves, and an over-valuation in currency of up to 20
percent. The country was severely scarred by Russia's devaluation
of the ruble in August, which scared U.S. investors away from
emerging markets such as Brazil's.
</P>
<P>
   Architects of the IMF bailout -- which includes $5 billion from
U.S. taxpayers -- hope the money will prevent Brazil from going the
way of Russia, which also stopped paying its domestic and foreign
debts.
</P>
<P>
   But the bailout mandates Brazil make huge cuts in government
spending while implementing tax increases, a major restructuring
that's sure to fall hardest on the poorest of Brazil's 164 million
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Already, personal bankruptcies are up and companies are laying
off workers in anticipation of the country's austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
   According to conventional wisdom, as goes Brazil -- which
accounts for 45 percent of Latin America's overall GDP -- so goes
the economies of countries as disparate as Argentina and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Already, much of Latin America is on the verge of an economic
meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, for example, President Andres Pastrana
declared a state of emergency in Colombia's economy, which has been
plagued by sky-high interest rates and a massive government debt.
</P>
<P>
   If Brazil falls into a full-fledged recession, as is feared, the
effects will ripple out to the more than 2,000 U.S. companies --
including BellSouth Corp., Dell Computer Corp., Caterpillar Inc. --
doing business in that country.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, President Clinton emphasized this week
that a strong Brazil is in America's interests, and he offered
support for Cardoso's economic proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Cardoso has launched a solid program to tackle its
fiscal problems that he has committed to implement swiftly,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardoso, who was re-elected in October, has a poor track
record. During his first term, he repeatedly failed to push
money-saving reforms to the public sector through a reluctant
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's first real test comes later this year when he tries to
win passage of a budget that seeks to cut $7.3 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Next he must overhaul social security and continue privatizing
state-owned industries that will attract more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president and his economic team know what needs to
be done and they're going to do it,'' said David Hirschmann,
executive vice president of the Brazil U.S. Business Council in
Washignton, D.C. ``I think the world realizes it didn't act fast
enough in Asia so it's not going to let Brazil fall.''

 &HT;    'PRIVATE RYAN' MOVIE SPURS NEW INTEREST IN NORMANDY
 &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France _ Wandering through a stark white sea
of crosses and Stars of David, Warren Beasley looks hard for the
name of a buddy long lost but not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   For Beasley, 77, a retiree from New Jersey, the memories had
seemed to have all but vanished until early last month when he
popped in to see a movie in London during a visit with his son.
They decided to go see ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which opened in
Europe at the beginning of October. The movie chronicles the Army's
effort to locate one soldier, Private Ryan, and return him to
America after his three brothers have been killed in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't on the beaches for D-Day invasion of France, but quite
a few of his buddies were in the landing crafts that assaulted the
heavily fortified hillside positions 54 years ago. He was riveted
by the movie and decided he couldn't return to the United States
without seeing the beaches and cemetery for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been so long,'' he said in the crisp, clear autumn
morning. ``But the movie made me think about it again, after all
these years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steven Spielberg movie has sparked a new interest in the
stories contained in the beaches, villages and hills of Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the movie's beaches, which were actually in Ireland, and
the French villages, which were in a location set outside London,
the cemetery shown at the movie's beginning and end is authentic:
the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 9,400 American soldiers are buried in the lusciously
landscaped 172-acre cemetery on a rise overlooking Omaha Beach. The
beaches and hillsides bear a few reminders of the war in the forms
of memorials and the remnants of German bunkers, but the cemetery
and its monuments are the largest tangible reminders of the
terrible struggle that occurred there.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Rivers, superintendent of the site since 1982, said the
movie has kindled fresh interest in Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now getting a lot of interest from the generation born
after the war, and even from the grandchildren of those who
fought,'' he said. ``They understand better now and have a greater
respect for that family member.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, the number of visitors to the cemetery was up by a
third _ reaching 36,000 compared with last year's 27,000. Visits by
relatives of those buried in the cemetery were up 50 percent. Tour
groups and guides report bookings well into mid-1999, unheard of
even in these heavily visited regions.
</P>
<P>
   As it is with the world these days, visitors tend to look as
much for connections to the movie as to the history that inspired
it.
</P>
<P>
   The sidewalk the elderly Ryan walks in the opening scene is easy
to discern, with the English Channel stretching in the background.
</P>
<P>
   While the movie's main character, Capt. John Miller _ played by
Tom Hanks _ led the effort to find Private Ryan, Miller never
existed.
</P>
<P>
   However, three of four real-life brothers did die in the war.
Two of the brothers, named Niland, were killed at Normandy and are
buried side-by-side there. A third brother was killed in the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The survivor became a dentist and died at 50.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley eventually gave up the search for his buddy's grave. But
he said the trip was worthwhile, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world like this, people need to see this,'' he said.
``They need to be reminded what an ugly thing war is and to
remember the young men who were so brave in the middle of it.''

BLANCHETTE PORTRAYS AN `ELIZABETH' FOR THE AGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
ELIZABETH 
Directed by: Shekhar Kapur 
Screenplay by: Michael Hirst 
Starring: Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes,
Christopher Eccleston, Richard Attenborough, Kathy Burke, Fanny
Ardant, Vincent Cassel, James Frain, Eric Cantona 
Running time: 124 minutes 
Rated: R (violence and sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   History is written by winners, rewritten by each succeeding age
in its own image. ``Elizabeth'' _ Shekhar Kapur's vibrant,
red-blooded biofilm about the shaky young outsider who steered her
way through a succession of political and amatory minefields to
reinvent herself as the inviolable Virgin Queen, Holy Mother of
England _ is a dazzling entertainment that never attempts to hide
its frankly contemporary slant. Many of our ideas about her have
been put there by movies starring the likes of Florence Eldridge,
Flora Robson, Bette Davis, and Glenda Jackson. Not a shrinking
violet among them, yet none has a thing on the new Elizabeth, Cate
Blanchett.
</P>
<P>
   She's luminous, quick, passionate, sensual, and shrewd. The
Elizabeth of Australian actress Blanchett, known here (insofar as
she's known at all) for ``Oscar and Lucinda,'' is the stuff that
Oscar's dreams are made of. Put simply, she takes one of the
juiciest roles and fills it with and spine, pulse and purpose,
especially when her eyes, agleam with intelligence, dart around
each new shark-infested convergence in which her office casts her.
Contemporary audiences will see a lot of ``Godfather'' in the dark
succession of lethal intrigues she survives, and female
self-empowerment as her confidence grows when she passes test after
test before finally deciding that, being married to the monarchy,
she will marry no man.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the success of the film is director
Kapur's bold conception and high-relief execution. It has been
suggested that Kapur is something of an off-the-wall choice for so
quintessentially English a subject. But although Indian, he has
lived in England for 30 years. His best-known Indian film, ``The
Bandit Queen,'' is in the same psychodynamic ballpark. As the film
opens, the Catholics and Protestants, whacking bloodily away at one
another, are not dissimilar to the warring Hindu and Muslim
factions of ``The Bandit Queen.'' Although they dress and speak
more elegantly, they're just as barbaric.
</P>
<P>
   But it's barbarism in silks and velvets and brocades, we're
reminded time and again. Kapur begins the film in the springtime of
the Protestant Elizabeth's life. Her older Catholic half-sister,
Bloody Mary, is on the throne, burning Protestant heretics with
inquisitorial zeal. When she falls ill, she has Elizabeth
imprisoned in the Tower of London, usually a one-way journey, but
not in Elizabeth's case. She leaves it to be crowned when Mary
dies. The country is in turmoil, with power grabbers jockeying to
seize what seems to them to be the eminently attainable throne.
Slender Elizabeth, impetuous in her movements, who gambols in the
country with her ladies-in-waiting and doesn't care who knows she
loves her courtier Robert Dudley, is about to find her dancing days
at an end.
</P>
<P>
   She survives a few disastrous moves, including an ill-advised
Scottish campaign against a well-prepared French force there.
Knowing full well that France and England are looking at her with
an eye to annexing England, she adroitly evades marriage offers
from each throne. The film caricatures Catholics as bloodthirsty
killers from the top down, with John Gielgud's pope ordering
Elizabeth's assassination. Elizabeth is as lucky as she is shrewd.
Through a fluke, a poisoned dress meant for her kills one of her
attendants, who can't resist trying it on. After a disappointment
in love, she evolves a strategy of trusting her proven counselors,
but none so much that any one will rule her as she steers a course
through castle after castle full of power-hungry men.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Fiennes, Ralph's younger brother, matches Elizabeth's
energy level and subtlety as her lover, Dudley. Before she feels a
need to distance herself, he convinces as the kind of man a woman
would enjoy relaxing with and dancing with. Christopher Eccleston
is another strong presence as the serpentine Norfolk, plotting to
return the throne to Rome. If Blanchett weren't so strong and
transcendent as Elizabeth, the film would be stolen by her
Australian compatriot, Geoffrey Rush, as the loyal, slightly
sinister, and altogether scary Walsingham, the first superspy who
enjoys being cruelly able to mock the exposed Norfolk. When the
latter claims that history will hail him as a martyr, Walsingham
icily replies no, it won't.
</P>
<P>
   The well-chosen authentic castle locations, most in the north of
England, add to the authoritative tread of the production, and not
just as backdrops. The large hewn stones are a visual analogue of
Elizabeth's hard stony era. The walls, rooms, and spaces speak of
people playing for high stakes _ and for keeps. Blanchett has the
last word, theatrically speaking, when she slaps on her orange wig
and white powder and entombs herself alive in her self-made image.
Costume dramas just don't come any more powerful and satisfying
than ``Elizabeth.'' Blanchett's name is surfacing in early
pre-Oscar buzz, and well it should.

NEW COUGAR IS ADRENALINE ON THE CHEAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, November 22, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A common automotive lament these days is: ``They all look
alike.'' In truth, while autos in general do not look
(itals)exactly(unitals) alike, they do, for the most part, all look
like they have been in the sun a bit long and partially melted.
</P>
<P>
   Why? There are two primary reasons for the apparent me-too-ism
in autoland. The first is the wind tunnel. The second is the focus
group.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel economy regulations, the corporate average fuel economy
requirements or CAFE, govern sedan/coupe/wagon manufacture and put
carmakers in a bit of a styling bind. There are limited avenues to
the goal of reducing fuel consumption _ mainly powertrain
efficiency, weight reduction, and elimination of friction.
</P>
<P>
   Engine efficiency has its limits in the laws of physics and the
demands of the consumer _ nobody wants a car that takes all day to
reach highway speed. Weight reduction, too, has its limits and they
may have been reached, at least for the time being. Lighter
materials are available, but they are much more costly right now,
and how light a sedan will you accept in the third windiest city in
America?
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to friction reduction. The most successful route
to friction reduction has been in designing a car that slips easily
through the air; a very large portion of the power required to run
a car is consumed in forcing the vehicle through resistant air.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to boring, look-alike cars. The best shape to
overcome wind resistance is a pumpkin seed, not a very practical
shape for designing containers for families. Although the wind
tunnel largely dictates design today, imaginative styling and good
engineering can reduce friction very substantially while still
offering pizazz.
</P>
<P>
   Except when you introduce the focus group into the design
process. Since bringing a car to market is a very expensive
undertaking, manufacturers feel it is smart to ascertain customer
acceptance before investing in the manufacturing machinery. Various
designs are tried out on focus groups, selected groups of average
customers who pass judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But judgment often depends on what one is asked to judge. As Bob
Lutz, erstwhile Chrysler second banana, is quick to point out, one
will have more success with a product that really turns on a
minority than with one that merely fails to displease a majority.
Focus groups give us consensus; they are the security blanket of
the industry _ and a rather wet blanket at that.
</P>
<P>
   Still some achieve distinction. Volkswagen's modern Beetle is
selling well, stands out from the crowd. It's not a great car (it's
a good one, a Golf underneath the funky skin) but it has
personality.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying problem in the industry is the lack of passion
for cars in management corridors. The bean-counters and marketeers
who today bring expertise in accounting or retailing have no
burning desire for the car, no inspiration, no clue as to how to
hammer the want button in the consumer. So why should we, the
customers, get all het up?
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some cars that make the pulse quicken _ BMW Z3
or M, Mercedes SLs or CLKs, Mustang Cobra ... Mercury Cougar.
Cougar?
</P>
<P>
   The Cougar is new, different from any previous Cougar rendition.
Originally, it was the Mercury version of Mustang, later it was
Mercury's version of Thunderbird, today it's Mercury's version of a
'90s 2(plus)2. Compared to those German pulse pumpers, it's
adrenaline on the cheap, $16,695 for the V-6 version with the
sporty suspension.
</P>
<P>
   OK, for excitement you'll raise your blood pressure more with a
Ford Contour SVT at $22,665, but the Cougar is a smart looking
little package that stands out in the crowd, moves with some
authority, and offers crisp handling and a taut suspension. It
feels like something more expensive, more European than a Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the California influence _ Mercury is now
headquartered in LaLa Land, perhaps giving the design team a ...
different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   For $700 less, the Cougar is labeled T60 and comes with a
125-horsepower (130 ft/lb torque) I-4 16-valve Zetec engine and
virtually the entire long list of equipment you will find on the
T61 with its 170-hp (165 ft/lb), 24-valve Duratec V-6 _ air bags,
air conditioning power locks and windows, dual power mirrors, tach,
trip computer, 5-speed manual transaxle, variable wipers, and a lot
of other stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The tested model came with the optional $815 4-speed automatic,
$350 compact disc changer, leather, ABS, and traction control. You
don't have to get all that stuff and drive up the price, but the
$235 traction control and $500 ABS make a lot of sense on a sporty
car.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the automatic, acceleration with the Cougar is quite
good _ you can feel the torque as you step on it. Underway, it's
responsive, quick, demonstrating good passing ability. The ABS and
traction control combine to provide sure footing in uncertain
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   This is billed as a 3-door coupe; it's a hatchback of sorts,
albeit a sleek one. The rear seat backs fold to offer added cargo
space but the sill is a mite high when you're trying to unload
heavy stuff from the depths of the rear. The glove box is fair, a
small covered bin sits between the front seats (just behind a
pop-up cupholder); small bins in the doors and seatback pockets
complete the interior storage facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The dash layout is simple enough; the instrument cluster has the
speedometer overlapping the tachometer like an imitation of a
Mastercard logo, with temperature gauge on one side and fuel gauge
on the other. Mirror and window controls sit on the driver's door,
conveniently grouped high up.
</P>
<P>
   Radio controls are fair _ too many buttons but at least they're
large enough to be manipulated conveniently, mostly. The radio
provided the only aggravation; it cut out. Investigation indicated
a ground fault somewhere, since pushing on the front of it would
cause it to operate. After some pushing, thumping, and twiddling,
it resumed normal function and continued to please for the
remainder of the test tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougar V-6 offers sprightly performance and delivers good
fuel economy. It is EPA-rated 24 miles per gallon city, 34 highway
in the 4-cylinder version, 19/26 in the V-6 with manual, 20/29 in
the V-6 with automatic _ what the auto writer drove. The auto
writer averaged 25.98 miles per gallon over 1,347.6 miles measured
in a variety of driving conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Cougar is a comfortable small car on a long haul. I won't vouch
for comfort in the rear seats _ I don't go there much in 2-door
models _ but up front it's a dandy. Thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the guy who developed that funky little VW is now
working for Ford.

</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL-EQUIPMENT-REVIEW (Undated) _ With thousands of new tools
and techniques introduced into medicine each year, doctors face
constant pressure to stay abreast of technology. And savvy patients
shop around for those who will perform the latest procedures
advertised in newspapers or discussed at dinner parties. But what
most patients don't know is how skilled their doctors are with the
new equipment. The physicians using it, sometimes for the first
time, may have taken only a three-hour course or watched a video or
chatted with the manufacturer's sales representative. By Susan
Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   LIFE-REDIRECTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans have always had
second acts. They have been immigrants beginning anew. They have
left behind families and scrawled ``Gone to Texas'' on the walls of
their houses. They have moved like gypsies and even in the most
conventional lives, have left their familiar world behind for a new
life at La Boca Vista in the Florida sun. What is new is that so
many Americans are now having third and fourth and fifth acts, they
are having them later in life and numerous trends may be making
them unavoidable. By Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   STARWARS-TRAILER-REVIEW (Undated) _ For ``Star Wars''
enthusiasts, the hottest film shown last week had its sneak preview
announced on the Internet and sent a small army of fans into
theaters around the country to watch it over and over again. It was
the two-minute trailer for ``The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas'
latest installment in what is being billed as a prequel to the
``Star Wars'' trilogy. The actual film is due in theaters on May
21, 1999. By J.D. Biersdorfer.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Despite an overall tightening of
welfare, the federal government is prodding many state and local
governments to encourage poor people to apply for food stamps and
Medicaid. The fear is that governments may be blocking access to
such aid programs, which are considered vital entitlements that
keep working people off welfare and the newly-employed from
slipping back on. By Rachel L. Swarns.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-REACTIONS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The market is made up of two
voices. One which votes with its funds, another which worries over
the economic data. The gulf between these two voices is wider now
than it has been in a long time. By Gretchen Morenson.
</P>
<P>
   BOMBER-THREAT-REVIEW (Undated) _ What to do when a bomber calls:

</P>
<P>
   U.S.-DIPLOMACY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Diplomatic etiquette,
though, has usually discouraged shouting America's enemies list
from the White House rooftop. But last week, driven by frustration,
or anxiety, or perhaps the lure of sounding tough for cameras, the
Clinton administration yelled out loud, twice. In dramatically
different situations, in opposite corners of the world, the U.S.
spoke loudly because it can't find a stick. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-ARABS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ For many decades, the
political contours of the Zionist movement and Israel have been
defined by a division between those who are prepared to share the
Biblical Jewish homeland with the Arabs, and those who claim it
all. Last week, Israel's parliament went through the last formal
act of closing that historical political divide. By Joel Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-REVIEW (Santiago) _ The controversy here over Britain's
arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet represents what may well be the
most serious test of Chile's transition to democracy since Pinochet
left the presidency eight years ago. But the fact that the reaction
was not as explosive as it might have been suggests how much Chile
has calmed in recent years, after decades of inflamed passions. By
Clifford Krauss.

COMEBACK TIME FOR LATIN AMERICA?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Battered by the panic that swept emerging markets in the wake of
Asia's financial crisis and Russia's default, Latin America is a
region that seems more sinned against than sinning.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the cause, the damage there has been real. For
months, stock prices spiraled lower. And the sharp rise in interest
rates on emerging-markets debt has closed the capital markets to
even creditworthy Latin American companies and countries.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are signs of life. Earlier this month, Brazil, the
hardest hit, signed off on a $41.5 billion rescue package led by
the International Monetary Fund. Last week Argentina became the
first Latin American borrower since May to tap financial markets,
when it sold $1 billion worth of bonds. Stock markets have rallied
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Jose M. Barrionuevo, director of global sovereign markets
strategy at Lehman Brothers, took some time last week to talk about
the region's prospects. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Latin America spent the 1980s dealing with a foreign
bank debt crisis. In the process, many countries made structural
changes _ of a kind that countries in Asia are only now
contemplating. So why has the region been hit so hard by this
crisis?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Latin America was brought into the crisis because every time
we have seen a real or potential slowdown in the United States, the
region gets affected. The experience is that it doesn't matter
where Latin America stands at a particular point in time. If the
United States slows down, that has an impact. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)The steep rise in interest rates for
emerging-markets borrowers has hurt. Are credit conditions
improving for potential Latin borrowers?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We have seen a significant compression of interest-rate
spreads over the last month, reflecting significant improvement in
global credit conditions. That is almost entirely due to a very
pre-emptive and forceful Federal Reserve, which understands better
than anyone what is happening to global credit conditions.
</P>
<P>
   You can't really claim that the crunch or credit squeeze is
over, but there is a clear sense of improvement. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Will the Fed's actions be enough to stave off a
recession here and in Latin America?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We don't see a recession, but if you see a slowdown it will
be more pronounced in Latin America. Clearly, Brazil will be
depressed next year, with its economy contracting about 1 or 2
percent. But we don't see recessions in either Mexico or Argentina.
Growth in those countries will be enough to keep the region from
going into recession, assuming the U.S. economy keeps growing. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)You just came back from Brazil. Will this package
cure the country's problems?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The package is good. The key issue is how quickly President
Cardoso implements it.
</P>
<P>
   A critical factor is the budget. If it is approved by the end of
December you will have seen the government's sense of urgency to
deal with Brazil's problems that investors have been looking for
for a long time. But even if that happens, Brazil is still looking
at a recession. The key test for the program's strategy will be
sometime in the first quarter, when political pressure to ease the
economic pain will increase. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)So far this year, mutual funds that invest in Latin
American stocks have fared worse than emerging-markets funds over
all. If the region is starting to come back, is it time to consider
Latin stocks?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. From a fundamental perspective, people will invest in Latin
America because the growth prospects there are high.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, we still have to look at these markets on a daily
basis. And I don't think people should start looking to Latin
equity markets until we get a clear sense of the direction in U.S.
equities. Timing is a key. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Which industries are likely to return to health the
fastest?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Typically, you see utilities doing better in the early phases
of recovery, then telecommunications and then manufacturing. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Does that mean you like a company like Telebras of
Brazil?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Telebras is a company we like, but it is too early to get in,
because Brazil is going into a recession. If the rescue package is
implemented correctly, the recession could bottom in the second
quarter. At that point it might be worth taking a look. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Are you concerned that the experience of the last
couple of years has had an adverse effect on long-term demand for
Latin American securities?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You could argue there has been some structural damage in that
hedge funds have been hurt, that pension funds and mutual funds
will not be back because they feel they may not be getting a return
comparable to the risk they are taking. But one of the reasons
people are still focused on these areas is that they are worried
they will not be there when things turn around.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 22, will move Saturday.

<P>
   (`a' category) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL-EQUIPMENT-REVIEW (Undated) _ With thousands of new tools
and techniques introduced into medicine each year, doctors face
constant pressure to stay abreast of technology. And savvy patients
shop around for those who will perform the latest procedures
advertised in newspapers or discussed at dinner parties. But what
most patients don't know is how skilled their doctors are with the
new equipment. The physicians using it, sometimes for the first
time, may have taken only a three-hour course or watched a video or
chatted with the manufacturer's sales representative. By Susan
Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   LIFE-REDIRECTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Americans have always had
second acts. They have been immigrants beginning anew. They have
left behind families and scrawled ``Gone to Texas'' on the walls of
their houses. They have moved like gypsies and even in the most
conventional lives, have left their familiar world behind for a new
life at La Boca Vista in the Florida sun. What is new is that so
many Americans are now having third and fourth and fifth acts, they
are having them later in life and numerous trends may be making
them unavoidable. By Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   STARWARS-TRAILER-REVIEW (Undated) _ For ``Star Wars''
enthusiasts, the hottest film shown last week had its sneak preview
announced on the Internet and sent a small army of fans into
theaters around the country to watch it over and over again. It was
the two-minute trailer for ``The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas'
latest installment in what is being billed as a prequel to the
``Star Wars'' trilogy. The actual film is due in theaters on May
21, 1999. By J.D. Biersdorfer.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Despite an overall tightening of
welfare, the federal government is prodding many state and local
governments to encourage poor people to apply for food stamps and
Medicaid. The fear is that governments may be blocking access to
such aid programs, which are considered vital entitlements that
keep working people off welfare and the newly-employed from
slipping back on. By Rachel L. Swarns.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-REACTIONS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The market is made up of two
voices. One which votes with its funds, another which worries over
the economic data. The gulf between these two voices is wider now
than it has been in a long time. By Gretchen Morenson.
</P>
<P>
   BOMBER-THREAT-REVIEW (Undated) _ What to do when a bomber calls:
a checklist from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco abnd Firearms.
(This will be sent only as a GRAPHIC and will only be posted to the
data bases, not sent via AP.)
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-DIPLOMACY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Diplomatic etiquette,
though, has usually discouraged shouting America's enemies list
from the White House rooftop. But last week, driven by frustration,
or anxiety, or perhaps the lure of sounding tough for cameras, the
Clinton administration yelled out loud, twice. In dramatically
different situations, in opposite corners of the world, the U.S.
spoke loudly because it can't find a stick. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-ARABS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ For many decades, the
political contours of the Zionist movement and Israel have been
defined by a division between those who are prepared to share the
Biblical Jewish homeland with the Arabs, and those who claim it
all. Last week, Israel's parliament went through the last formal
act of closing that historical political divide. By Joel Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-REVIEW (Santiago) _ The controversy here over Britain's
arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet represents what may well be the
most serious test of Chile's transition to democracy since Pinochet
left the presidency eight years ago. But the fact that the reaction
was not as explosive as it might have been suggests how much Chile
has calmed in recent years, after decades of inflamed passions. By
Clifford Krauss.

   MIAMI _ When world leaders announced a huge bailout for Brazil,
they hoped it would stave off an emerging-market crisis that has
already crippled Asia and Russia, and now threatens the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, it's worked.
</P>
<P>
   The $41.5 billion package that the world's eighth-largest
economy signed with the International Monetary Fund on Nov. 13 has
sent many stocks up and slowed capital flight to a mere trickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of external support with internal reforms will
permit Brazil to resume growth during 1999,'' Brazilian Finance
Minister Pedro Malan confidently predicted this week.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts worry that Brazil may be celebrating victory before
actually fighting the battle.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso still has to push a slew of
tax increases and spending cuts through Brazil's Congress in order
to implement an austerity plan designed to save $84 billion over
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his proposals -- such as a doubling of the tax rate on
financial transactions -- have met with mounting opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the measures are approved by early next year, the IMF
could back off, dangerously eroding investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial crisis is far from over,'' said Michael
Connolly, professor of international economics at the University of
Miami. ``There's still lots of work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, top economists are far from optimistic over the
country's future, and many predict that the economy will contract
by 2 to 3 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-two billion dollars for Brazil is not enough,'' said
Lawrence Goodman, an economist with Santander Investment Securities
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the world's economic turmoil still poses a real
danger for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has suffered from a gigantic budget deficit, plummeting
foreign reserves, and an over-valuation in currency of up to 20
percent. The country was severely scarred by Russia's devaluation
of the ruble in August, which scared U.S. investors away from
emerging markets such as Brazil's.
</P>
<P>
   Architects of the IMF bailout -- which includes $5 billion from
U.S. taxpayers -- hope the money will prevent Brazil from going the
way of Russia, which also stopped paying its domestic and foreign
debts.
</P>
<P>
   But the bailout mandates Brazil make huge cuts in government
spending while implementing tax increases, a major restructuring
that's sure to fall hardest on the poorest of Brazil's 164 million
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Already, personal bankruptcies are up and companies are laying
off workers in anticipation of the country's austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
   According to conventional wisdom, as goes Brazil -- which
accounts for 45 percent of Latin America's overall GDP -- so goes
the economies of countries as disparate as Argentina and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Already, much of Latin America is on the verge of an economic
meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, for example, President Andres Pastrana
declared a state of emergency in Colombia's economy, which has been
plagued by sky-high interest rates and a massive government debt.
</P>
<P>
   If Brazil falls into a full-fledged recession, as is feared, the
effects will ripple out to the more than 2,000 U.S. companies --
including BellSouth Corp., Dell Computer Corp., Caterpillar Inc. --
doing business in that country.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, President Clinton emphasized this week
that a strong Brazil is in America's interests, and he offered
support for Cardoso's economic proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Cardoso has launched a solid program to tackle its
fiscal problems that he has committed to implement swiftly,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardoso, who was re-elected in October, has a poor track
record. During his first term, he repeatedly failed to push
money-saving reforms to the public sector through a reluctant
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's first real test comes later this year when he tries to
win passage of a budget that seeks to cut $7.3 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Next he must overhaul social security and continue privatizing
state-owned industries that will attract more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president and his economic team know what needs to
be done and they're going to do it,'' said David Hirschmann,
executive vice president of the Brazil U.S. Business Council in
Washignton, D.C. ``I think the world realizes it didn't act fast
enough in Asia so it's not going to let Brazil fall.''

PROGRESS REPORTED ON CROSS-BORDER COUNCIL FOR NORTHERN IRELAND  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of the Irish Republic and
David Trimble, the first minister of the new Northern Ireland
Assembly, said Friday that they had made significant progress
toward setting up a council that would give Roman Catholic Ireland
more influence in the predominantly Protestant British province of
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace agreement approved in the spring to end the
sectarian warfare in the North, the cross-border council would have
northern and southern officials cooperating on issues like tourism,
agriculture and development. Under the accord the British
government in London is to yield such powers next year. The council
was a major concession to northern Catholics, and the political
wing of the Irish Republican Army. Sinn Fein, vigorously supported
it.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting for an hour here Ahern and Trimble indicated that
they had made no progress on the issue that is blocking the work of
the new Assembly, the peace accord, disarming the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, the Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist Party,
said, ``It won't work unless it all works,'' referring to the
accord and the disarmament dispute. Ahern said he hoped a
compromise could be achieved in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA. refuses to disarm. Protestant officials, led by
Trimble, want disarmament to start before Sinn Fein is permitted to
take part fully in the work of the Assembly. Trimble is refusing to
allow Sinn Fein to have Cabinet posts in the new Assembly's
provisional government or places on the North-South council until
the IRA. begins to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders said they hoped that there would be progress on
the issue before Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain addresses the
Irish Parliament here next week. He will be the first British prime
minister to do so since southern Ireland became independent in 1922
</P>
<P>
   In Omagh, Northern Ireland, a senior police official of the
Royal Ulster Constabulary appealed for informers' tips to help
catch the terrorists of an Irish Republican Army splinter group
called the Real IRA, who detonated a bomb on Aug. 15 that killed 29
people there. The official said that more than 40 people had been
questioned, but that no breakthrough was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Detective Chief Superintendent Eric Anderson, his
voice cracking with emotion in an interview on Irish national
radio, said: ``It has been a devastating experience. I want you to
listen. I want you to go in your room, perhaps before you say your
prayers, and think of any piece of information whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   To reassure people with Republican paramilitary groups, he
added: ``You will not be followed. You will not be badgered, not be
harassed.'' In the history of Irish rebellion against British rule,
informers have been routinely killed by Catholic terrorists.

 &HT;    ISRAELI WITHDRAW FROM PARTS OF WEST BANK KEEPS WYE PROCESS ON
TRACK
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 650 words.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ For the first time in nearly two years, Israel
pulled its troops out of pockets of West Bank land Friday, moving
the peace process ahead, causing small Palestinian celebrations and
testing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal was the first land transfer prescribed under the
U.S.-brokered Wye Memorandum, signed a month ago to revive the
floundering Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter process has been marred by Palestinian terrorism and
controversial Israeli expansion of Jewish neighborhoods in the West
Bank. The troop withdrawal came four days later than planned under
Wye, and more than a year later than first envisioned under Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   It was the smallest of three withdrawals scheduled to occur
before February. Israeli leaders have said that each will be
dependent on Palestinian efforts to fight terrorism. It's sure to
stay a rocky process, but the withdrawal Friday could clear the way
for its next big event, an unprecedented visit to Gaza by President
Bill Clinton in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to see immediate effects of the withdrawal, carried
out largely on hills of farms and olive groves. No Israeli army
bases or Jewish neighborhoods had to be uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   But, by Friday evening, with the placement of large, brown and
yellow cement blocks and signs to mark the borders, both the
physical and political geography of the Middle East was slightly
altered.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1997, when Israel pulled out of most of the
Palestinian city of Hebron, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian National
Authority has had full control of 3 percent of the West Bank. In
another 24 percent, Israeli troops still patrolled but Palestinians
controlled civilian affairs, like elections and construction.
</P>
<P>
   With the new Israeli troop withdrawal, the area under full or
partial Palestinian control rises by two percentage points, to 29
percent of the West Bank. More significantly, Israeli troops pulled
completely out of 18 towns and villages that were under only
partial Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves about 10 percent of the West Bank under full
Palestinian control and 19 percent under partial control. The rest
of the West Bank is under full Israeli control and is home to
170,000 Jews who have moved in since Israel captured the land in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also released 250 Palestinian prisoners Friday, though
Palestinians objected that most were common criminals instead of
those jailed for politically-motivated acts.
</P>
<P>
   For Palestinian politics, Friday provided progress that Arafat
can show his restless people as they inch toward their goal of
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Palestinian polling firm, support for the peace
process has increased from 66 percent before Wye to 75 percent now.
Support for armed resistance against Israel has dropped from a high
of 51 percent last month to 41 percent now. Most are still
impatient, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (withdrawal) brings hopes and expectations, but does not
fundamentally alter perceptions,'' said Khalil Shikaki, director of
the Center for Palestine Research and Studies.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, the withdrawal highlights a deep division within the
country over how to handle the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis, tired of years as an occupying force, want to
relinquish large portions of the land to bring an end to the
conflict. Others, many of whom view the West Bank as land promised
to Jews by God, say Palestinians only want the land as one step
before taking over Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the settler movement, which has spearheaded the
Jewish building in the West Bank, wrote in an Israeli newspaper
that Friday was ``one of the worst days . . . in the inspiring
history of Zionism.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-winger Netanyahu himself used to oppose Oslo, but has
reluctantly continued the process despite constant threats from his
allies to topple his government.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, there is much greater proof that under certain
conditions, he is willing to give away the land of Israel,'' said
Israeli political scientist Efraim Inbar.
</P>
<P>
   Inbar noted that Netanyahu's popularity has increased with
Israelis in general in recent weeks. But support among his
hard-line coalition is slipping. This troop withdrawal almost did
not pass his cabinet's vote and there are new rumors that he will
seek to solidify support by calling for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has also had to beef up his personal security
recently. Thursday, an Israeli rabbi was arrested on accusations
that he was plotting some kind of attack against the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal only came after Netanyahu received assurances
from U.S. and Palestinian officials about the Palestinian
commitment to fight terrorism. While some say he is toying with
war, Netanyahu has driven a tougher bargain on Oslo than his
predecessors, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, giving away less
land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance,'' said Netanyahu spokesman David Bar-Illan,
``is that Netanyahu has kept his promise to adhere to Oslo and kept
his other promises to minimize its damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians counter that Netanyahu's fine line endangers the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep trying to make a balance between making peace with
us and peace with the extremists (in Israel). This is an impossible
balance,'' Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said. ``Now, they are
confronting the moment of truth.''

A CLUB KING TRIES A WHOLESOME APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 22)  
(mk) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter Gatien wants to make you a nice cup of hot
cocoa.
</P>
<P>
   A magnate of New York night life, he was acquitted on charges
that he operated two of his clubs as virtual drug supermarkets, and
he officially reopened the Limelight this weekend, billing the
former Episcopal church in Chelsea as a community-friendly,
arts-oriented complex that will feature puppet shows, photography
exhibitions, a juice and coffee bar, and a courtyard sandbox for
toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened by his near brush with prison and still dogged by
community opposition, Gatien is trying to rehabilitate the
Limelight's wild, drug-suffused reputation _ and his own tarnished
image _ by offering an unlikely array of wholesome activities that
will keep the landmark church open long after the last inebriated
club kid has stumbled home at dawn. ``We want the neighborhood to
feel like this is the kind of place they can come to for lunch or
for a cup of coffee,'' said Gatien, who still faces tax-evasion
charges and the possible loss of his liquor license. ``We don't
want to be self-serving.''
</P>
<P>
   Has the man whose anything-goes megaclubs embodied the excessive
1980s undergone a religious conversion? Those who live near the
club, which is at Avenue of the Americas and 20th Street, are not
convinced. ``Nice try,'' said Laura Michaels, executive director of
the Flatiron Alliance, a local civic organization. ``We'll believe
it when we see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Until his arrest two years ago on federal charges that he
allowed the sale of Ecstasy and other drugs at both the Limelight
and the Tunnel, Gatien, whose empire included the Palladium and
Club USA, was impervious to outside scrutiny. ``Peter was truly a
mogul, a nightlife czar,'' David Hershkovitz, editor of Paper
magazine, said. ``In many ways he represented the spirit of New
York before it was cleaned up by Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruised and nearly bankrupted by his legal battles, Gatien is
not the club king he once was. Last summer, he was forced to sell
the Limelight to a developer, who is leasing him back the building.
The Palladium and Club USA have been leveled, and the Tunnel, while
commercially successful, draws the kind of youthful, baggy-pants
crowd that scares off models and their followers, a demographic
most Manhattan clubs covet.
</P>
<P>
   The Limelight's return is not only a chance for Gatien to thumb
his nose at those who predicted his demise, but also an opportunity
to recapture some of his lost glory. The born-again Limelight, he
predicts, will usher in a new era of clubbing, one that grafts
high-minded culture onto a traditional big-box dance hall. Rotating
art shows will grace the walls, avant-garde dance troupes will make
appearances in the soaring chapel, and patrons will be able to gab
in a smoke-free, oxygenated cafe. ``We want to help new talent,
incubate new deejays, artists and performers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the club has operated sporadically since last summer,
it is still a work in progress. Gatien says he has spent $1 million
so far renovating the church interior _ a ``reinvention,'' as he
calls it _ but much remains to be done. A half-dozen announced
grand-opening dates have come and gone since his acquittal last
February, and the club's heavily touted Giger Room, created by H.R.
Giger, the German sci-fi designer behind the creatures in the
``Alien'' movies, is still under construction. Another opening,
which Gatien promises will be celebrity-soaked, is scheduled for
Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   While Gatien says the extended soft opening is intentional, the
delays have only deepened suspicions within the nightlife business
that he is floundering financially. ``I'm not hearing any buzz
about the place on the street, and in the club world, that's not a
good thing,'' said Mark Baker, a promoter who worked at the Tunnel
and now helps fill the VIP room at Life, the sprawling dance club
on Bleecker Street.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his unabated legal troubles and the uncertainty over
Limelight's liquor license, Gatien's biggest challenge will be
keeping New York's party crowd interested in a club first
christened 15 years ago (with an opening bash that had Andy Warhol
as its host). Although it drew a parade of glamor-drenched names
and gossip-column mentions in its early years, the velvet rope came
down in the late '80s as AIDS and the recession thinned the ranks
of party hoppers. It was the open-door policy of the '90s that
prosecutors said helped turn the club into a haven for
Ecstasy-gulping adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Gatien's competitors are eagerly predicting that
Limelight will be a failure, much like Studio 54's stillborn
revival a few years ago. Some say Gatien's inability to hire the
promoters-of-the moment, his shaky finances and abundant bad blood
in the club scene all conspire against him. ``That place is like a
haunted house with a lot of ghosts rattling around and no exorcists
in sight,'' said Steve Lewis, a former Limelight promoter who runs
Life, the only dance club in Manhattan that could be considered
competition. ``I give the place three weeks and it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Limelight's huge capacity, 2,000 people, presents an additional
challenge. If the Fabulous crowd can't be persuaded to return week
after week, the door policy will have to be liberalized, which will
bring the club's cachet down a notch. ``It's sad to say, but in
this day and age, the A crowd doesn't want to mix with the
masses,'' said Noel Ashman, the owner of Veruka, a restaurant and
lounge that has done well by excluding hoi polloi. ``Still, Peter
has a good sense of the business, and he will find a way to pack
the club.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Gatien, 47, chain-smoked Newports as he
slowly paced around his office on the third floor of the former
vestry. He seemed both excited and preoccupied, and bitterness over
last year's ``government witch hunt,'' as he calls it, continues to
haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   His trademark eye patch, which covered an eye damaged in a
teen-age hockey accident, has been replaced by green-tinted
glasses. It was insurance money from the mishap, $17,000, that
helped finance his first nightclub venture near his hometown,
Carelton, Ontario. The club, an old tavern he renovated, opened
with an unknown local band called Rush.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those who know him say Gatien is passionate about the nightlife
business, and not just because he sees clubs as ego-boosting
opportunities to hobnob with celebrity. To him, they are valuable
incubators of cutting-edge culture and places where different types
of people can mix. He employs a full-time creative staff, is quick
to hire or promote unheralded talent, and has a keen interest in
new music. ``Peter is a master of seeing the creative gifts of
younger people and the influence they can have on trends,'' Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gatien, for example, is widely credited with importing techno
from the outer boroughs, and unlike many club owners, he is not
phobic of bridge-and-tunnel patrons. ``I think these folks can be
far more sophisticated and on the mark than Manhattanites,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, workmen were tearing apart a series of nearby
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The new design, which Irv Johnson, the club director, describes
as a mix of ``gothic, industrial and high-tech,'' includes a
glass-topped bar over flowing water, a generous helping of
loungelike sofas, and unisex bathrooms. Banks of video monitors, a
nod to the '80s, and giant lightboxes for oversize transparencies,
fill front rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance hall, a macabre statement on Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's quality-of-life crackdown, includes black clarions, a
black steeple that hangs from the ceiling, and two walk-in freezers
with law books, funerary bouquets and angel wings inside blocks of
ice. Julian LaVerdiere, a partner in the design firm Big Room, said
the entrance hall's anti-establishment theme was originally slated
for the entire club, but Gatien, aware of his vulnerability, scaled
back the provocation.
</P>
<P>
   Gatien and his wife, Alessandra, are still facing state charges
that they failed to pay $1.3 million in taxes, and the state Liquor
Authority is considering whether or not to renew the club's
license. (Even though the club was shuttered by police in 1996, it
is still operating under its old license.) In weighing its
decision, the agency will take into account neighborhood sentiment,
the tax-evasion indictments and even the drug charges that were
dismissed by a jury. ``The burden of proof is not as strict as it
is in a criminal hearing,'' Thomas McKeon, the authority's counsel,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Community Board 5 voted to oppose a new license for
the club, although it agreed to revisit the issue in three months.
``The Limelight has caused this neighborhood extreme distress for
13 years,'' Lola Finkelstein, chairwoman of the board, said, citing
noise and drugged and drunken patrons who wreaked havoc. ``We are,
however, willing to give them a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatien seems intent on keeping the community happy. ``Hopefully,
we'll be able to coexist peacefully,'' he said. Ms. Gatien, the
mother of the couple's 4-year-old son, Xander, is overseeing the
outdoor playground, its community-oriented programs, and the juice
and coffee bar, to be called Xander's Window.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether this eclectic mix will fly, but
the club's promoters, among them the singer Donovan Leitch, say
that New York is ready for another dance club. Maya Ben-Avner, a
promoter who is overseeing the club's performance roster, said:
``Everyone is so bored with what's out there. We want to bring back
the old days of club-going, when designers and filmmakers, uptown
and down, gay and straight, all mixed.'' She said the door policy
would be tight but not impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   If Limelight wants a taste-making crowd, it has gotten off to a
good start. On Friday night, Liz Cohen, a publicity agent, and
Lauren Dupont, a fashion editor at Vogue, had their joint birthday
party at Limelight. The affair, which included several hundred of
their friends, was a gift from Gatien, who also provided two hours
of open bar and a champagne waterfall. Last year, the two had their
party at Bowery Bar, which yielded a prodigious amount of media
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ms. Cohen, 28, was hesitant to accept Limelight's
offer ``because of the bad press, the drugs and the club kids,''
she said. ``But when we saw the space,'' she continued, ``we were
blown away.''
</P>
<P>
   Her crowd, she said, is one that Limelight undoubtedly wants to
call its own: young, hip and sprinkled with names like Von
Furstenberg, Lauren, Paltrow and Hawke. ``We're really a great mix
of New York,'' she said. ``A little bit of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, too much diversity is not always a good thing. Ms.
Cohen said she was assured that an iron-clad door policy would be
in effect for the benefit of her 600 invited guests. ``I mean, I
don't exactly want guys with stockings on their head crashing my
party,'' she said.

LESSONS IN FIELDING HARASSMENT ACCUSATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 22)  
 (Budgeted as BIZ-METS-SUSPEND)  
 (bl)  
 By ADAM BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Corporate America often looks to the world of sports
for inspiration on everything from teamwork to persistence to
leadership. But what lesson can be drawn from the way the New York
Mets recently handled its general manager's public acknowledgment
that he had had sexual relations with an employee?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the topics of workplace relationships and sexual
harassment have been on a lot of people's minds this year. With so
much attention paid to President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, companies of all sizes are looking for guidance through
the difficult terrain of such issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets case was a curious series of events that seemed no less
curious even after several slow-motion replays. On Nov. 8, the club
announced that Steve Phillips, its general manager, would take a
leave of absence to deal with an accusation of sexual harassment
and the repercussions of a series of extramarital affairs. The team
brought in a retired former general manager, Frank Cashen, as an
interim replacement and left the status of Phillips' job in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   But on Nov. 16, Phillips was back on the job, with Mets
officials saying that the best thing for the Phillips family and
for the team was ``for Steve to get back to work.'' Announcing his
return, Phillips stood before the media, his mouth in the
tight-lipped frown perfected by Clinton in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who advise corporations on sexual harassment policies
offered color commentary on the team's unexpected off-season
activities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   QUICK REFLEXES: Any company that learns that an employee faces a
charge of sexual harassment should act quickly. On the day Phillips
stepped aside, a week and a half after the accusation was made, the
team said it had already looked into the matter and determined that
there was a consensual sexual relationship between Phillips and an
employee but found no basis for a sexual harassment complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once there is an allegation, you must do a prompt
investigation,'' said Peter Panken, who represents employers as
chairman of the employment and labor law department of Parker,
Chapin, Flattau &AMP; Klimpl in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   TWO BOBBLED PLAYS: Granted, Phillips is something of a celebrity
and appears very comfortable dealing with the media. Still, there
was little to be gained by Phillips' going before the media to
announce that he was returning to his job, according to several
lawyers. After all, it only increased the chance that Phillips
might veer from the script. And, in fact, the news conference did
create unexpected dramatic moments when a lawyer for the woman who
had accused Phillips confronted the general manager in front of
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets also made a mistake in bringing Phillips back so
quickly, said Barbara Kate Repa, author of several books on
employee rights and sexual harassment. When he first announced in a
statement that he would step aside, Phillips acknowledged he had
had affairs with other women and that he had begun ``extensive
personal counseling.'' A lawyer for the Mets also said at the time
that the threat of a lawsuit ``brought to light some personal
problems Steve has, and he's addressing them in counseling.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a speedy return ``makes it sound and seem like more of a
lip-service leave,'' Ms. Repa said. ``It throws a pall of
disingenuousness over the suggestion that they were taking the
investigation seriously in the first place. They may have undone
some good they did by acting quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   FRATERNIZING CAN DRIFT FOUL: People often spend more time
working than doing anything else during an average week, so it is
perhaps inevitable that some relationships start in the workplace,
including an extramarital one like Phillips'. Employers normally
would not ban fraternization outright, but they should advise
managers and other employees about the harsh realities of workplace
romances, said Jay Waks, co-chairman of the employment law
department of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &AMP; Handler, a New York
law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the relationship is discreet, he said, workplace gossip
can harm the careers of either or both parties. Waks also noted
that most romances in the workplace, like anywhere else, ultimately
fail; if one party persists in trying to revive the relationship or
feels very disappointed that it failed, it can lead to public
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broadest lesson is for the manager who is contemplating a
romantic relationship with a subordinate,'' Waks said. ``While some
do result in lasting relationships, most don't. My advice to the
manager is, don't get involved in the workplace.''

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ As if they were Boy Scouts doing a good
deed, soldiers stopped traffic Friday to allow student
demonstrators in bright yellow college jackets to hand out purple
orchids in a gesture of peace.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers stood by quietly outside a downtown university as
1,000 people mourned the shooting deaths of some of the 16 student
demonstrators a week ago. The troops allowed a small group of
demonstrators to cross their lines to demonstrate at the National
Monument, demanding that former President Suharto be put on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the military's insistence that soldiers had been issued
only blanks and rubber bullets before the shooting last Friday
reports have emerged that metal bullet fragments had been found in
some victims' bodies. The military promised an investigation into
whether live rounds had been fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation aims to find out exactly what went wrong,''
I. Wayan Karya, a spokesman for the office of President B.J.
Habibie, said. ``We want to find out why, despite the fact that
live ammunition was expressly prohibited by military commanders,
one post-mortem did locate a bullet embedded in the body of a
victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Munim Idries at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, where
post-mortems were carried out, said Friday that he had found
fragments from ``high-velocity type'' bullets in the bodies of
seven students.
</P>
<P>
   A hospital official said the fragments had been handed over to
the military for investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings have aroused widespread anger at the military at a
time when it is under pressure to withdraw from its pervasive
political and social roles. Graffiti appeared Friday on a overpass
here reading, ``Death to the Army,'' and they were quickly erased.
</P>
<P>
   Next week Parliament is to consider proposals to reduce the
military representation in its own membership. The military has 75
appointed seats in the 500-member legislature. The proposals
include a phased reduction beginning with a cut to 55 or 25 seats
to an immediate and the complete elimination of military
representation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the military leadership favors reducing its role, it
has to contend with resistance in its ranks to eliminating the
privileges that brings. The military is also concerned about
continuing dangers of instability as Indonesia contends
simultaneously with an economic crisis and a political transition.
</P>
<P>
   While the military was put on the defensive by the killings last
week, Habibie took the offensive against his critics, accusing a
group of respected former generals and officials of using the
demonstrations to try to topple his government.
</P>
<P>
   Ten opponents have been charged this week with sedition and
barred from leaving the country. The Jakarta Post, an
English-language newspaper, expressed outrage Friday over the
treatment of Habibie's opponents, calling the charges a trademark
of his predecessor, Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on Thursday, Habibie warned that civil unrest could
threaten the changes that he has put in motion. In the six months
since Suharto was forced to resign, the government has allowed the
formation of new parties, opened the door to free speech and a free
press and moved to arrange general elections for early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are running against time,'' the president said. ``Concrete
measures have to be taken. The stakes are very great. It will not
be an impossibility that social unrest continues to be rampant,
eventually threatening the unity of our nation.''

began trickling into other regional economies of the world, the
global powers have waited anxiously for it to reach South America.

   Here are some of the things you can fit into Helmut Lang's
holster bag, though not all at the same time: a Penguin paperback,
a rolled-up decorating magazine, a reporter's notebook, a cellular
phone, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a box of Uniball pens, a
banana, your hand. (It will not hold a newspaper or a legal pad or
a can of soda or a laptop computer.)
</P>
<P>
   The bag, which is made of thin cotton, straps around your waist
with a wide Velcro band and around your left leg with a slim little
cord. You step into it like a pair of pants, and it hangs loosely
on your hip like a tool belt or a gun holster.
</P>
<P>
   It is an extraordinarily useful piece of equipment, especially
when worn in conjunction with one of Lang's belt bags _ or try two!
_ and his arm pouches, which are the size of cigarette packs and
fit around an arm with wide elastic bands.
</P>
<P>
   When all these bags are deployed around your body, with your
stuff nicely distributed among them and easily accessible, you'll
look a bit odd, like a gun-packing waitress on Rollerblades, but
you'll be functioning in some sort of perfect ergonomic zone.
</P>
<P>
   You might feel like the narrator of Nicholson Baker's book ``The
Mezzanine,'' full of the self-importance that comes from needing
all the things that are contained in all the pouches. ``Of course,
that was the principal reason you needed little bags,'' Baker
writes. ``They kept your purchases private, while signaling to the
world that you led a busy, rich life, full of pressing errands to
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Lang's holster bag, which will go on sale early next year, is
one of a number of utilitarian ``body'' bags _ that is, bags that
are worn strapped to the body like vests or belts _ being made by a
number of designers. Bottega Veneta makes a holster vest bag in
white deerskin that fits under a jacket or shirt. Miu Miu, Prada's
secondary line, has a canvas vest bag, as well as a waist holster
bag; Prada itself has belt bags. Dolce &AMP; Gabbana has both vest and
waist holster bags. Missoni and Ann Demeulemeester make belt bags;
Versace, wrist pouches.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that these designers showed these sorts of bags at
exactly the same time _ during the recent shows of their spring
collections _ feels like one of those fashion conspiracies. It's as
if all the designers had a meeting one day and said: ``OK guys,
forget cargo pants. This year, we're gonna make pockets. Just
pockets this time. Cargos without the pants. Get it?''
</P>
<P>
   (Presumably Ralph Lauren missed this particular meeting, and
that is why he will soon be alone in selling silk Shantung cargo
pants and bikini underwear with cargo pockets.)
</P>
<P>
   Last year's conspiracy, the great cargo pants hoax, roped in
most of the garment industry, from Chanel to Baby Gap. One friend
said wickedly, ``Babies need cargo pants _ they have a lot to
schlep.'' The New Yorker ran a cartoon last summer with the punch
line: ``You don't get an office. You get cargo pants.'' In its
current catalog, J. Crew offers cargo pants with the line, ``More
than an attitude, they're pants with drawers.'' If cargo pants were
last year's metaphor for contemporary culture, which is
increasingly nomadic and equipment-dependent, then body bags are
the inevitable follow-up act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very American, this carrying tradition,'' said Richard
Martin, director of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The companies whose bags look most alike deny collusion. ``It is
the designer's job to feel the needs of society, and this time that
is what we felt people wanted,'' Stefano Gabbana said in a faxed
answer to a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those ideas weren't forced,'' said Laura Moltedo, the
president and creative director of Bottega Veneta. ``They made
sense to us.'' Miuccia Prada declined to be interviewed for this
article. Lang said he has been making the bags for sale in Japan
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice president for fashion direction at
Bloomingdale's, chuckled at the idea of a fashion conspiracy.
``That's the mystery of fashion,'' he said, ``I really do think
these things are in the air.'' Ruttenstein sent a buyer to Asian
factories in the weeks following the Helmut Lang show; he hopes to
have a Bloomingdale's label line of body bags in his stores by
February. ``I hear that somebody in London is making them for
immediate delivery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter who was first? Who knows? What is true is that
because high fashion right now is directly inspired by what young
people are doing, as it was in the 1960s and '70s, the idea of
something's being ``in the air'' is more concrete than it sounds.
Young people (do they know that entire retail empires hinge on
every stylistic twitch?) start little trend fires _ cargo pants,
surf T-shirts, messenger bags _ and fashion smells the smoke and
alters course, searching for street credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Postmodern theorists see the elusiveness of authenticity as
the fundamental crisis of our age,'' Ted Polhemus wrote in his 1994
book ``Streetstyle'' (Thames &AMP; Hudson).
</P>
<P>
   So who's making the real thing these days? Where is ground zero
for the strap-on pocket? It may be in London, at the Soho gallery
and clothing shop run by Vexed Generation, a 4-year-old British
group that makes witty urban ``war'' gear _ fleeces with Ninja
hoods, parkas made with heavy nylon to deflect flying glass shards
and pockets big enough to stow a gas mask and, most important, very
distinctive body bags. Among the globe-trotting fashion pack, the
stuff is all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thing initially was to make clothes in reaction to the
erosion of civil liberties in Britain,'' said Adam Thorpe, 29, who
runs Vexed Generation with his partner, Joe Hunter, 31. ``We wanted
to parody British police riot gear,'' he said. Still, the
protective nylon was real enough, as was the kidney and crotch
padding in the group's pants and parkas, which were manufactured
and worn initially, Thorpe said, by friends who ran a relief
organization in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that well-educated young people with something to
say made paintings or staged performance pieces. Now, it seems,
they make clothes. Vexed Generation's outsider status bloomed in a
gallery space, where the group formed a loose collaborative of
artists and musicians, selling clothes and showing art. They also
made one extremely desirable bag: a well-padded, boxlike backpack
with a strap that runs diagonally across the chest. (You can find
it in Manhattan today at a new store, Nylon Squid _ another British
import.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone ripped it off,'' said Katherine Betts, fashion news
director of Vogue. ``We wrote about it last June, and in the same
issue Miu Miu had an ad with the identical bag.''
</P>
<P>
   The second bag Vexed Generation made was a vest bag called the
Vexed Shopper _ ``a combination bulletproof vest and shopping
bag,'' as Thorpe put it. It's a smart-looking bag, heftier than
those you'll soon be seeing when the designers' spring collections
hit the department stores, but instantly recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Authenticity on this side of the Atlantic is currently making
its home on Elizabeth Street, east of SoHo, where you can buy any
number of body bags. Wander into Orfi, a store whose name stands
for Organization for Returning Fashion Interest, and you'll find
pockets tucked into scarves and four different kinds of belt bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is the outward pimple on the face of everything that
we're up to,'' said Scott Kruger, a member of Orfi. Orfi is _ guess
what? _ a loose collaborative that includes Kruger, an architect;
Don Hearn, also an architect, and Ana Gonzalez, a philosophy
student turned clothing designer.
</P>
<P>
   Orfi makes street-inspired men's and women's clothing, which
means a lot of cargo pants and pea jackets and garments made of
packing cloth. A few weeks ago, Hearn was down in the store's
workroom, fooling with a prototype for a new vest bag, which looked
like a photographer's equipment vest and a little like the military
jacket Hearn had brought in for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it doesn't matter who made the first body bag. Perhaps
what we're seeing is the death throes of the status pocketbook. In
any case, how refreshing to note a trend in bags that are purely
utilitarian and that cost less than $500; Helmut Lang's holster
bag, for instance, will retail for about $155.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are moving away from the bag as fetish object, I think,''
Kruger said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Betts of Vogue is not so sure. ``I think people are just
going to fetishize these little bags,'' she said. ``People will
fetishize anything you put in front of them. Anyway, soon it's not
going to be about bags anymore. I just saw the spring shoe
collections, and you know the way there was this handbag mania last
year? Well, now it's going to be shoes, the weirder the better.
Some of them are so weird they don't even look like shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready for it? My shoes are weirder than your shoes.

JAPANESE BANKS REQUESTING BAILOUT FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ After turning in meager half-year earnings, Japanese
banks have begun to request funds from the government's $500
billion bank bailout to strengthen their weak capital bases.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the banks have said they would ask for sums of
taxpayers' money ranging from $2.5 billion to $5 billion.
Collectively, the requests from nine major banks announced so far
could reach 4.1 trillion yen, or $34 billion, which would easily
exceed the $16.7 billion drawn down by the banks under a failed
bailout scheme carried out earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that the government's new fund might actually help
give the banks a stronger financial footing helped the stock market
to rally on Friday to a 10-week high.
</P>
<P>
   The market also welcomed the news that the governing Liberal
Democratic Party had struck a deal Thursday to form a loose
coalition with the Liberal Party, an opposition group led by Ichiro
Ozawa, who walked out on the Liberal Democrats five years ago. The
coalition, still under negotiation, would smooth prospects in
Parliament for passage of the latest economic package, worth $200
billion, and the national budget.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with a recessionary economy, a nationwide credit
shortage, and a mountain of at least $650 billion in bad debt,
there are enormous pressures on financial institutions. Many are
scaling back overseas operations, cutting the number of branches
and employees at home and overseas and selling real estate and
other assets.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks, which expanded rapidly overseas during the
1980s, have paid a high price this year to borrow in dollars to
finance overseas operations.
</P>
<P>
   Though core business profits at the banks have risen modestly
from the same period a year ago, at least seven major banks said
that they were anticipating losses for the fiscal year ending on
March 31. Many are cutting dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Core business profits for the six months that ended Sept. 30
rose, partly because banks had enjoyed relatively inexpensive
access to funds and partly because some banks benefited from
profitable bond trading. A number of banks are using these profits
to write off bad debts. Collectively, Japan's nine largest banks
said they were disposing of roughly 1.3 trillion yen, or $11
billion, in debts in the first half of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Sanwa Bank announced Thursday that it had applied a new stricter
standard for evaluating bad debts. As a result of using this
standard, which the government's Financial Supervisory Agency will
require by the end of this fiscal year, Sanwa's problem loans rose
to 2.4 trillion yen, or $20 billion, up 70 percent from the amount
calculated in the old way.
</P>
<P>
   To set aside enough of a cushion to offset potential losses from
write-offs of the bad loans, Sanwa said it would apply for about
600 billion yen in taxpayers' money. The bank said it planned to
report a consolidated loss of 250 billion yen, or $2.1 billion, for
this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi and Fuji Bank also reported their bad
loans under the new standards on Friday. Fuji Bank said it would
post a consolidated net loss of 310 billion yen, or $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Fuji said its reserve cushion equaled 68 percent of its problem
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Fuji Bank has been the focus of concern, partly because it
belongs to Fuyo Group, a group of companies that includes Nissan
Motor Co., the troubled automaker with a $33 billion debt burden.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which has indicated that it does not
plan to request public funds, said that it expected to post a
modest net income of 55 billion yen in the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Sumitomo Bank, which reported a modest first-half profit of 53.9
billion yen, or $449 million, projected a net consolidated loss for
the fiscal year of 240 billion yen, or $2 billion. Much of the
losses is expected to reflect the disposal of bad loans totaling
about 800 billion yen, or $6.7 billion. But investors were
impressed with Sumitomo's aggressive revamping plan, and its stock
price rose 3.3 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sakura Bank, which posted a modest midyear profit, also expects
to post a net loss of 260 billion yen, or nearly $2.2 billion, for
the fiscal year. Sakura had previously said it would turn to
business partners to raise about 86 billion yen, or $716 million,
and on Friday it issued a list of those 21 companies, including
Tokyo Electric Power Co. and Mitsui &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota Motor Corp., which had earlier suggested it might buy a
sizable amount of the shares, was not on the list, but bank
officials suggested that they would continue pressing Toyota to
take part, according to a report by Kyodo News Service.
</P>
<P>
   Sakura said it would raise 260 billion yen, or nearly $2.2
billion in the capital markets overseas and would probably request
up to $5 billion in public money.

CONSPIRACY THEORIES, TACKY JFK SOUVENIRS FLOURISH IN DALLAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Art available on NYT database) 
(For release Sunday, Nov. 22) 
 
By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Two guys. About the same age. Both peddling souvenirs.
Both wearing long-sleeve shirts. Both working the place where John
F. Kennedy was shot. Both named Bud. Coincidence or ...?
</P>
<P>
   Bud Pemberton, a sheaf of tabloid pictorials (only $3) tucked
into his waist tote, has an arm extended toward the lawn that
slopes down from Houston Street, across Dealey Plaza, toward Elm
Street and the grassy knoll beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right there, beside that tree,'' he tells a knot of Japanese
tourists. ``That's where one of the shooters stood. Hell, there
were 10 shots fired that day. One bullet hit the street in front of
a guy standing over there, by that underpass.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud P. doesn't buy the lone assassin stuff.
</P>
<P>
   More than likely his audience doesn't either. Hardly anybody
does.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the plaza, on the knoll itself, beside a
folding table laden with magazines, disposable cameras, photographs
and his own memorial publication, Bud McCarron points to the
sixth-floor window of what was once the Texas School Book
Depository and tells two doctors from Denmark, ``That's where
Oswald stood. That's where the shots were fired from.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud M. knows he's losing the argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sells more than I do,'' he says of the other Bud. ``Eight
out of 10 people think there was a conspiracy. Some want to whup me
when I tell them there wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what it has come to, he says: Although 35 years of
probing, testing, analyzing and interviewing turned up not a shred
of credible conspiracy evidence, 80 percent of Americans still
believe that movie director Oliver Stone is a historian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly,'' Bud M. says, ``most of them believe the government is
lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't they? Kevin Costner, who played the district
attorney for New Orleans in Stone's movie ``JFK,'' believes it.
</P>
<P>
   Three and a half decades has done something else. It has enabled
Dallas, at last, to bury its shame. Newspaper stories and magazine
articles rarely, if ever these days, dwell on the ``City of Hate''
or the extremist political climate that ``invited'' political
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy is now the central theme of Nov. 22 and that
controversy has devolved into caricature. Dallas can kick back,
relax and wallow in the absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   In its November issue, D magazine, published a full-page drawing
of Dealey Plaza with stick figures depicting where all the
conspiracy theories have placed all the shooters that fateful day.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 30 in all: four in the plaza, three in the
windows of a county building on Houston Street, another six in the
School Book Depository (three of them, including Oswald sharing a
single window), another 20 behind the rickety fence on the grassy
knoll.
</P>
<P>
   The caption was as droll as the drawing: ``He never had a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The mob, the Russians, the Cubans, Lyndon Johnson and the
right-wing Dallas oil cartel. They all did it.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the Ruby Room in the Red Jacket nightclub on
Greenville Avenue last August proved that the shame is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Amid photographs of a dying Lee Harvey Oswald and a sullen Jack
Ruby, in the glow of a blood-red neon replica of the .38 Colt Cobra
that snuffed the only life that could have answered all the
questions, Dallas partied.
</P>
<P>
   An old stripper from Jack Ruby's Carousel Club showed she could
still shake it. Famed swindler Billie Sol Estes camped on a bar
stool, posing for pictures and signing autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bowden, co-founder of Dallas' Conspiracy Museum, came with
the actual murder weapon, borrowed from a Florida collector,
handcuffed to his wrist. At his museum, which draws about 11,000
visitors a year, bullets fired from Ruby's gun were being offered
for $500 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tacky, tacky, tacky,'' said the Dallas Morning News. ``The
morbid fascination with him (Ruby) is unbecoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Said the Fort Worth Star-Telegram: ``Short on colorful outlaws
of late, Dallas has been forced to retread some old renegades to
create its newest fad ... Crook Chic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fad, maybe, but the the Ruby Room radio commercials boast that
it is the only nightclub in town that is ``shunned by the Dallas
Convention Bureau.'' Business has been very good.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`WE CAN'T REALLY DEBATE IT' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take a position on the &UR;  &LR; question of a conspiracy,''
says Bob Porter, a former journalist and director of public
programs for the Sixth Floor Museum, a highly acclaimed archive of
assassination texts, photographs and memorabilia, in the old book
depository.
</P>
<P>
   For the 450,000 who come each year, the museum merely lays out
historical facts, such as the Warren Commission's finding that
Oswald acted alone, and the House Select Committee's subsequent
determination that there was a 95 percent chance that a shot was
fired from the grassy knoll (a conclusion later discredited). It
also is clear from this exhibit that no evidence of a conspiracy
has ever surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Porter says, ``We can't really debate it. We have to stay
neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Debating with facts is futile anyway. Recently, Porter was
showing a reporter through the museum and another visitor trailed
close behind, listening in on his monologue. At the sixth-floor
window, Oswald's perch, the stalker stepped forward to challenge
Porter's narrative.
</P>
<P>
   If there was no conspiracy, he wanted to know, why did Kennedy's
motorcade, which was progressing down Main Street, turn and go one
block north to Elm Street so that it would pass by the grassy
knoll?
</P>
<P>
   Because where Main and Elm converged at the bottom of the plaza,
there was a curb that would have prevented the motorcade from
turning onto Stemmons Freeway to reach the Trade Mart where Kennedy
was to speak, Porter explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' the guy said, ``it was just a small curb. They could
have jumped it.''
</P>
<P>
   No argument will be won or lost, no cynicism allayed, this year.
As the 35th anniversary of the assassination approached, the
National Archives began making public 400,000 pages of documents
compiled over the past four years by the Assassination Records
Review Board. Most of them will be ignored, except by scholars.
</P>
<P>
   One item has already made headlines: Two different brain
examinations may have been conducted by doctors at the Bethesda
Naval Medical Center, raising questions about the authenticity of
the brain examined.
</P>
<P>
   Available, too, is a new version of the Zapruder film, which
contains the only moving images of the assassination. Digital
remastering has added 20 percent more to the film. A mother lode.
</P>
<P>
   And, the Conspiracy Museum has another new video, this one
detailing how Lyndon Johnson and Big Oil schemed to eliminate
Kennedy. Oswald was a patsy. The marksman was on the knoll.
</P>
<P>
   Bud McCarron, who ran a chain of grocery stores before retiring
to hawk souvenirs in Dealey Plaza, says the government has
collected 2,500 affidavits from everyone who was anywhere near the
plaza that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody saw anybody back there,'' he says, gesturing toward the
picket fence.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing. But then, there's this other guy named Bud ...

ITALIAN RULING ON KURD DEEPENS TENSIONS WITH TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ An Italian court of appeals on Friday rejected Turkey's
request for the extradition of a Kurdish rebel leader, deepening
tensions between Italy and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurd, Abdullah Ocalan, was arrested last week while seeking
to enter Italy. Now he is to be released from detention in a
military hospital and put under house arrest while Italy considers
his request for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema had already said Italy would not
hand Ocalan over to Turkey, citing an Italian law that prohibits
extradition of prisoners to countries that have the death penalty.
But the court ruling _ and the easing of Ocalan's detention _
infuriated Turkish officials, who regard Ocalan, leader of the
Kurdistan Workers Party, as a terrorist and public enemy No. 1. The
14-year-old conflict between Kurdish separatists and Turkish troops
in southeastern Turkey has claimed more than 35,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italy is attempting to make peace with terrorism,'' Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz of Turkey said after hearing the court's
ruling. ``It faces the danger of earning Turkey's eternal
hostility.'' He added: ``The Italian government is making mistake
after mistake. Every mistake will certainly have a very heavy
price.''
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish defense minister, Ismet Sezgin, told Reuters Friday
that Turkey might reconsider military industry projects with Italy.
The Italian company Finmeccanica was a strong favorite to win a
$3.5 billion tender to build attack helicopters for the Turkish
military.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has already begun unofficial boycotts of Italian goods,
and demonstrations in Ankara and Istanbul have included Turkish
protesters burning Italian-made silk ties to illustrate their
point.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Italy and Turkey maintained good relations.
Italy was one of the few European nations strongly favoring
Turkey's inclusion in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is particularly upset because D'Alema has not ruled out
granting Ocalan political asylum, which many leftists in his
coalition favor. The United States, which requested that Italy
extradite Ocalan to Turkey, has also expressed its opposition to
political asylum for Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   If Italy grants him asylum, the move would inflame an already
tense diplomatic standoff. Diplomats in Rome suspect that Italy
will postpone any such decision for as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   While a commission in the Italian Interior Ministry considers
Ocalan's application, the Kurdish leader will have to stay in Rome,
and will have to notify the authorities any time he leaves his
residence.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, who complained this week about the lack of support from
other European nations, may seek it next week, when he is expected
to travel to Brussels, Paris and Bonn for meetings with his
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The court of appeals originally said Ocalan would have to remain
in Italian custody pending an arrest warrant from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany, which issued a warrant for Ocalan on homicide
charges in 1990, said Friday that it would not for the moment press
Italy for his extradition. Germany is home to 2 million Turks, a
quarter of them ethnic Kurds, and seems reluctant to create new
domestic tensions by bringing Ocalan to trial. Essentially, Germany
seems happy for now to let Italy take the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond the legal aspects of extradition,'' a German government
spokesman, Uwe-Karsten Heye, said Friday, ``there is a complex
political problem which can hardly be treated justly as a matter of
formal international extradition procedures.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A surge of chilly air into the Northeast will be accompanied by
snow showers from western New York to central Maine. A band of
squalls may bring a few inches to communities along the eastern end
of Lake Ontario. Clouds will break along the north Atlantic coast
as brisk winds descend the Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Expansive high pressure will control the weather over most of
the eastern half of the nation. It will be mainly sunny and cooler
in the Southeast. After a frosty morning, afternoon readings will
return to seasonal levels in the Ohio and Tennessee valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and scattered showers will mark a stalled front in the
Deep South. The leading edge of cooler air will reach into northern
Florida, but the southern half of the state will remain sultry. A
disturbance at 20,000 feet over southern Texas will produce a plume
of high clouds across the western and central Gulf states. Periods
of light rain will dampen the Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Very mild weather will spread across the Rockies and into the
Plains. Readings will rise toward record levels in eastern
Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas. Farther north, clouds will keep
readings closer to seasonal values. Winds will gust over 40 mph
from Montana to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Gales and heavy rain will drench the Northwest coast from
northernmost California to the Olympic peninsula. Showers will
spread across the interior sections as a vigorous cold front pushes
inland. The Southwest will stay bright and warm with very mild air
reaching into southern California and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Winter Arrives
</P>
<P>
   The mercury fell to 5 below zero at Fargo, N.D., on Friday
morning and to 9 below at Grand Forks, N.D. This marked the first
widespread subzero readings away from the higher elevations of the
West this season. A deep snow cover helped chill the surface air.
In a typical November, the temperature falls below zero twice in
Fargo. Most winters bring 50 days with subzero readings in the
north country, but below-zero values have been measured as late as
April in Fargo. A stiff wind from the southwest will draw much
warmer air into the Dakotas this weekend.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter Gatien wants to make you a nice cup of hot
cocoa.
</P>
<P>
   A magnate of New York night life, he was acquitted on charges
that he operated two of his clubs as virtual drug supermarkets, and
he officially reopened the Limelight this weekend, billing the
former Episcopal church in Chelsea as a community-friendly,
arts-oriented complex that will feature puppet shows, photography
exhibitions, a juice and coffee bar, and a courtyard sandbox for
toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened by his near brush with prison and still dogged by
community opposition, Gatien is trying to rehabilitate the
Limelight's wild, drug-suffused reputation _ and his own tarnished
image _ by offering an unlikely array of wholesome activities that
will keep the landmark church open long after the last inebriated
club kid has stumbled home at dawn. ``We want the neighborhood to
feel like this is the kind of place they can come to for lunch or
for a cup of coffee,'' said Gatien, who still faces tax-evasion
charges and the possible loss of his liquor license. ``We don't
want to be self-serving.''
</P>
<P>
   Has the man whose anything-goes megaclubs embodied the excessive
1980s undergone a religious conversion? Those who live near the
club, which is at Avenue of the Americas and 20th Street, are not
convinced. ``Nice try,'' said Laura Michaels, executive director of
the Flatiron Alliance, a local civic organization. ``We'll believe
it when we see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Until his arrest two years ago on federal charges that he
allowed the sale of Ecstasy and other drugs at both the Limelight
and the Tunnel, Gatien, whose empire included the Palladium and
Club USA, was impervious to outside scrutiny. ``Peter was truly a
mogul, a nightlife czar,'' David Hershkovitz, editor of Paper
magazine, said. ``In many ways he represented the spirit of New
York before it was cleaned up by Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruised and nearly bankrupted by his legal battles, Gatien is
not the club king he once was. Last summer, he was forced to sell
the Limelight to a developer, who is leasing him back the building.
The Palladium and Club USA have been leveled, and the Tunnel, while
commercially successful, draws the kind of youthful, baggy-pants
crowd that scares off models and their followers, a demographic
most Manhattan clubs covet.
</P>
<P>
   The Limelight's return is not only a chance for Gatien to thumb
his nose at those who predicted his demise, but also an opportunity
to recapture some of his lost glory. The born-again Limelight, he
predicts, will usher in a new era of clubbing, one that grafts
high-minded culture onto a traditional big-box dance hall. Rotating
art shows will grace the walls, avant-garde dance troupes will make
appearances in the soaring chapel, and patrons will be able to gab
in a smoke-free, oxygenated cafe. ``We want to help new talent,
incubate new deejays, artists and performers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the club has operated sporadically since last summer,
it is still a work in progress. Gatien says he has spent $1 million
so far renovating the church interior _ a ``reinvention,'' as he
calls it _ but much remains to be done. A half-dozen announced
grand-opening dates have come and gone since his acquittal last
February, and the club's heavily touted Giger Room, created by H.R.
Giger, the German sci-fi designer behind the creatures in the
``Alien'' movies, is still under construction. Another opening,
which Gatien promises will be celebrity-soaked, is scheduled for
Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   While Gatien says the extended soft opening is intentional, the
delays have only deepened suspicions within the nightlife business
that he is floundering financially. ``I'm not hearing any buzz
about the place on the street, and in the club world, that's not a
good thing,'' said Mark Baker, a promoter who worked at the Tunnel
and now helps fill the VIP room at Life, the sprawling dance club
on Bleecker Street.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his unabated legal troubles and the uncertainty over
Limelight's liquor license, Gatien's biggest challenge will be
keeping New York's party crowd interested in a club first
christened 15 years ago (with an opening bash that had Andy Warhol
as its host). Although it drew a parade of glamor-drenched names
and gossip-column mentions in its early years, the velvet rope came
down in the late '80s as AIDS and the recession thinned the ranks
of party hoppers. It was the open-door policy of the '90s that
prosecutors said helped turn the club into a haven for
Ecstasy-gulping adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Gatien's competitors are eagerly predicting that
Limelight will be a failure, much like Studio 54's stillborn
revival a few years ago. Some say Gatien's inability to hire the
promoters-of-the moment, his shaky finances and abundant bad blood
in the club scene all conspire against him. ``That place is like a
haunted house with a lot of ghosts rattling around and no exorcists
in sight,'' said Steve Lewis, a former Limelight promoter who runs
Life, the only dance club in Manhattan that could be considered
competition. ``I give the place three weeks and it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Limelight's huge capacity, 2,000 people, presents an additional
challenge. If the Fabulous crowd can't be persuaded to return week
after week, the door policy will have to be liberalized, which will
bring the club's cachet down a notch. ``It's sad to say, but in
this day and age, the A crowd doesn't want to mix with the
masses,'' said Noel Ashman, the owner of Veruka, a restaurant and
lounge that has done well by excluding hoi polloi. ``Still, Peter
has a good sense of the business, and he will find a way to pack
the club.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Gatien, 47, chain-smoked Newports as he
slowly paced around his office on the third floor of the former
vestry. He seemed both excited and preoccupied, and bitterness over
last year's ``government witch hunt,'' as he calls it, continues to
haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   His trademark eye patch, which covered an eye damaged in a
teen-age hockey accident, has been replaced by green-tinted
glasses. It was insurance money from the mishap, $17,000, that
helped finance his first nightclub venture near his hometown,
Carelton, Ontario. The club, an old tavern he renovated, opened
with an unknown local band called Rush.

U.S. BREAKS UP LABOR SMUGGLING RING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal agents crushed an international operation
that smuggled 12,000 illegal immigrants into the United States over
three years for employers who had placed orders for workers,
Attorney General Janet Reno said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The undocumented workers from Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and
Syria paid as much as $28,000 and were routed through Dallas, which
served as a transshipment point inside the United States, Reno
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest alien smuggling organization every
dismantled in United States history,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one people indicted in the smuggling ring are in custody
and 10 others are being sought, the authorities said. Attention is
now being turned on the employers who hired the illegal workers.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said the ring, made up of three ``flesh
cartels'' based in India, reaped as much as $60 million each year
``trafficking in human cargo.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants were smuggled through Moscow, Cuba and the
Ecuadorean capital of Quito where they received false documents and
forged passports that allowed them to enter the United States
through Houston, Miami and McAllen, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the country, the immigrants were shipped to Dallas,
where they were parceled out to hundreds of employers in Boston,
Chicago, Los Angeles, New Jersey, New York and other points, said
U.S. Attorney Paul Coggins of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials said most of the illegal laborers worked in 38
states, mainly in the East and the central states. INS spokesman
Russ Bergeron declined to identify the 38 states on the basis that
the investigation was still under way.
</P>
<P>
   Coggins released three unsealed indictments Friday charging 31
people with the organized plot to smuggle the foreigners. He said
21 of those charged were in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Two suspected ringleaders _ Nitin Shettie, 30, and Navtej Pall
Singh Sandhu, 40, both of India _ were in custody in the Bahamas
and London, respectively. A third suspect, Niranjan Maan Singh, 58,
is believed to be in hiding in India.
</P>
<P>
   Coggins said INS inspectors and FBI agents were targeting
employers who hired the illegal workers and ``businesses that
placed orders'' for the undocumented laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the immigrants were employed in the service sector,
working in restaurants and other businesses that catered goods and
services to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 work sites have been investigated by federal agents
and Coggins said the Justice Department was working on hundreds of
leads in the next phase of the investigation, called Operation Seek
and Keep.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was aided, federal officials said, by a 1996
immigration law that gave the INS authority to use wiretaps in
smuggling investigations. And federal money-laundering laws gave
investigators the ability to seize homes used as ``stash houses''
where immigrants were held until smuggling fees were paid in full.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS is using the legal tools given to it by the 1996
immigration and reform law and should be applauded for stopping
organized alien smuggling,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the
House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration and author of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joint law enforcement operation marks a turning point in a
battle against alien smugglers,'' said Smith, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said the three cartels often overlapped and worked in
together to smuggle more than 300 workers to U.S. employers each
month.
</P>
<P>
   Coggins said the investigation was launched a year ago when
Dallas INS officers caught a group of undocumented workers, and
began a follow-up probe that revealed the ring's operations
extended into other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The year-long investigation turned up evidence the ring had
operated for at least three years. They recruited immigrants,
shipped them by airplane and boat to other foreign locations.
Clandestine centers produced the false documents that allowed the
immigrants to enter the United States, usually at airports and
airstrips.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictments, Shettie and his associates,
working in the Bahamas and India, would arrange for the smuggling
of immigrants into the United States for a fee ranging from $20,000
to $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   Shettie then moved immigrants through foreign countries and into
U.S. stash houses.
</P>
<P>
   Shettie was arrested Nov. 14 in the Bahamas. Charges of
transporting and smuggling undocumented workers carry a prison
sentence of up to 10 years and as much as $250,000 in fines.

 NEW YORK: called Rush. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who know him say Gatien is passionate about the nightlife
business, and not just because he sees clubs as ego-boosting
opportunities to hobnob with celebrity. To him, they are valuable
incubators of cutting-edge culture and places where different types
of people can mix. He employs a full-time creative staff, is quick
to hire or promote unheralded talent, and has a keen interest in
new music. ``Peter is a master of seeing the creative gifts of
younger people and the influence they can have on trends,'' Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gatien, for example, is widely credited with importing techno
from the outer boroughs, and unlike many club owners, he is not
phobic of bridge-and-tunnel patrons. ``I think these folks can be
far more sophisticated and on the mark than Manhattanites,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, workmen were tearing apart a series of nearby
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The new design, which Irv Johnson, the club director, describes
as a mix of ``gothic, industrial and high-tech,'' includes a
glass-topped bar over flowing water, a generous helping of
loungelike sofas, and unisex bathrooms. Banks of video monitors, a
nod to the '80s, and giant lightboxes for oversize transparencies,
fill front rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance hall, a macabre statement on Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's quality-of-life crackdown, includes black clarions, a
black steeple that hangs from the ceiling, and two walk-in freezers
with law books, funerary bouquets and angel wings inside blocks of
ice. Julian LaVerdiere, a partner in the design firm Big Room, said
the entrance hall's anti-establishment theme was originally slated
for the entire club, but Gatien, aware of his vulnerability, scaled
back the provocation.
</P>
<P>
   Gatien and his wife, Alessandra, are still facing state charges
that they failed to pay $1.3 million in taxes, and the state Liquor
Authority is considering whether or not to renew the club's
license. (Even though the club was shuttered by police in 1996, it
is still operating under its old license.) In weighing its
decision, the agency will take into account neighborhood sentiment,
the tax-evasion indictments and even the drug charges that were
dismissed by a jury. ``The burden of proof is not as strict as it
is in a criminal hearing,'' Thomas McKeon, the authority's counsel,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Community Board 5 voted to oppose a new license for
the club, although it agreed to revisit the issue in three months.
``The Limelight has caused this neighborhood extreme distress for
13 years,'' Lola Finkelstein, chairwoman of the board, said, citing
noise and drugged and drunken patrons who wreaked havoc. ``We are,
however, willing to give them a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatien seems intent on keeping the community happy. ``Hopefully,
we'll be able to coexist peacefully,'' he said. Ms. Gatien, the
mother of the couple's 4-year-old son, Xander, is overseeing the
outdoor playground, its community-oriented programs, and the juice
and coffee bar, to be called Xander's Window.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether this eclectic mix will fly, but
the club's promoters, among them the singer Donovan Leitch, say
that New York is ready for another dance club. Maya Ben-Avner, a
promoter who is overseeing the club's performance roster, said:
``Everyone is so bored with what's out there. We want to bring back
the old days of club-going, when designers and filmmakers, uptown
and down, gay and straight, all mixed.'' She said the door policy
would be tight but not impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   If Limelight wants a taste-making crowd, it has gotten off to a
good start. On Friday night, Liz Cohen, a publicity agent, and
Lauren Dupont, a fashion editor at Vogue, had their joint birthday
party at Limelight. The affair, which included several hundred of
their friends, was a gift from Gatien, who also provided two hours
of open bar and a champagne waterfall. Last year, the two had their
party at Bowery Bar, which yielded a prodigious amount of media
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ms. Cohen, 28, was hesitant to accept Limelight's
offer ``because of the bad press, the drugs and the club kids,''
she said. ``But when we saw the space,'' she continued, ``we were
blown away.''
</P>
<P>
   Her crowd, she said, is one that Limelight undoubtedly wants to
call its own: young, hip and sprinkled with names like Von
Furstenberg, Lauren, Paltrow and Hawke. ``We're really a great mix
of New York,'' she said. ``A little bit of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, too much diversity is not always a good thing. Ms.
Cohen said she was assured that an iron-clad door policy would be
in effect for the benefit of her 600 invited guests. ``I mean, I
don't exactly want guys with stockings on their head crashing my
party,'' she said.

VERDURA: AMERICA'S CROWN JEWELER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (For release Sunday, Nov. 22)  
(lb) 
 By JEAN NATHAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's been a nervous fall for the initiates of
Verdura, one of the last of the bespoke jewelers, which for most of
its 60 years has operated almost as a private club. In its plush
New York showroom, 12 floors above Fifth Avenue, an appointment was
required until recently.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of two great Verdura clients in the last year _
Betsey Cushing Whitney and Lydia Buhl Mann, whose Verdura
collections were auctioned for $1.4 million at Sotheby's last month
_ further gave the impression that an era was passing.
</P>
<P>
   And then last week came the news, disheartening to some, that
Verdura had opened an actual retail store, off Worth Avenue in Palm
Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't street level, is it?'' asked Sloan Lindemann, in
quasi-alarm. Ms. Lindemann, 30, a budding socialite in New York,
the daughter of a cellular-phone magnate, was introduced to the
nearly secret society of Verdura by her mother five years ago. Her
boyfriend, Roger Barnett, was elevated to her fiance last
Valentine's Day when he presented her with a navy-blue Verdura box
containing a diamond bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not street level. Verdura, which has been prized by
some of the most stylish figures of society, filmdom and fashion,
isn't quite ready for a street-level emporium, like the other
high-end jewelers in its Manhattan neighborhood: Tiffany, Harry
Winston, Van Cleef &AMP; Arpels, and Bulgari.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a few efforts to lift the veil of exclusivity and bring
Verdura into the modern commercial era, it is still shrouded in
mystery, all but unknown to the public. ``It's like New York's
best-kept secret,'' said Dominick Dunne, whose novels of the rich
and social feature characters modeled on the real clientele that
Verdura cultivates.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Landrigan, the man who currently presides over the cult,
bought the business in 1984 after the death of its founder, Fulco
di Verdura, an Italian duke who was almost universally known as
Fulco. Landrigan is adored by customers, who clamor for his
attentions, sometimes dropping by his Fifth Avenue salon simply to
hang out. ``To go in and just look makes me happy,'' said Carolyne
Roehm, sounding a bit like a latter-day Holly Golightly. ``There's
so much beauty there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulco was born 100 years ago and developed a passion for design,
friends in high places and a disregard for commercial concerns. Amy
Fine Collins, who writes about fashion for Vanity Fair, said she
considered him the century's best jewelry designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can hold a candle to Verdura,'' she said. ``There is so
much erudition and taste and fantasy involved in each of the
pieces. It's ultrasophisticated, and it takes more intelligence to
appreciate the design. The jewelry is not for insecure people and
does not appeal to the herd instinct. Women who wear Verdura don't
want to look like every other person wearing their Van Cleef
diamond flower pin, their Chanel suit and their Prada bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Verdura is not ``hang a check around your neck'' jewelry, With
its unorthodox combinations of materials _ precious stones mixed
with semiprecious, even shells and sea glass; its novel motifs, and
great wit. It is the ultimate status symbol, recognized only by its
initiates, who might wink at each other across a crowded room.
``Like Volkswagen Beetles flashing each other, but not really,''
one said.
</P>
<P>
   Although most people may not have heard of Verdura, they may
have seen the jewelry in legendary photographs of the great style
icons who wore it. (Think Garbo in a Cecil Beaton shot, wearing a
gold chain-link bracelet and watch; Lauren Bacall with a brooch
clipped to her skirt waistband; Millicent Rogers with a brooch on
her shoulder, or Coco Chanel and Diana Vreeland in Verdura's
Maltese-cross cuffs.)
</P>
<P>
   Verdura designs have been widely imitated. Angela Cummings,
Kenneth Jay Lane, Paloma Picasso, Seaman Schepps, Jean Schlumberger
and David Webb have all incorporated Verdura inventions into their
work.
</P>
<P>
   When Lane bought shell cuff links in the 1960s, Fulco told him:
``I'm really giving them to you. After all, you paid for them with
all the money you've made from my ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when Ms. Roehm was a design assistant at Oscar de
la Renta, she was sent to Kenneth Jay Lane to pick up the copied
Maltese-cross cuffs for a fashion show. ``I fell madly in love with
them,'' she recalled. They were $75 each, wholesale, and I was
taking home $126 a week, so I had to save up for them.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, when she had married Henry Kravis and, with the
backing of his fortune, had started her own fashion house, she was
able to buy a pair of the real thing, plus much more.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Melhado, a money manager, whose mother, Mrs. Mann, was a
great Verdura collector, had his own Verdura moment in 1995, on his
40th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Within the space of no more than 12 hours, he said, he was
presented with three gifts from Verdura: two pairs of cuff links,
one from his mother and one from Louise Grunwald, who was once
married to his father, Frederick Melhado, who gave him a silver
pen.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was just a few days before Christmas and he was still
searching for a gift for his wife, Teresa, he went there himself.
``It's much less intimidating than going to some other jewelry
store,'' he said. ``It's not the `breaking into a cold sweat'
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But marketing through exclusivity and social cachet may have
seen its day. While other blue-chip jewelers have risen to the
challenge of the more competitive 1990s by selling perfumes and
scarves, and by opening stores in malls around the country, Verdura
has risked losing out by not adopting these strategies.
</P>
<P>
   And so the jeweler has begun to demystify itself _ hesitantly.
It put a toe in the water last year with its first
print-advertising campaign ever. ``We felt the need to do it,
because of the advertising-driven society we live in, but we felt
uncomfortable about it,'' said Robert Dwy, Verdura's director of
marketing. Before long, he said, ``we pulled out _ it wasn't
fitting in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Landrigan, 57, began lifting the veil in other ways. First,
he abolished Verdura's ``by appointment only'' policy. Then,
earlier this year, Verdura entered the Academy Awards jewelry
competition for the first time: Jewelers offer loaners to stars
attending the ceremonies, with mutual promotion as the objective.
Susan Sarandon and Linda Hamilton wore borrowed Verdura to the
awards show in April.
</P>
<P>
   Landrigan was persuaded to enter the Oscars game by Joan Rivers,
a Verdura fan and client who mentioned the jewelry on her
Oscar-night telecast on the E! Entertainment channel.
</P>
<P>
   For nine years, Ms. Rivers' line of costume jewelry, which she
sells on QVC, has featured designs inspired by Verdura. Ms. Rivers
readily acknowledges the influence and said she enjoys educating
her audience about Verdura. ``I go through the whole history,'' she
said. ``Chanel is Verdura. Let's all get real here. When things
still work 60 years later, that's when you know they're great.''

   It seems safe to say that rarely have two markets for similar
products _ the society figures who buy Verdura on Fifth Avenue, and
the budget shoppers who tune in to QVC _ had less in common.
</P>
<P>
   Landrigan is not pleased by Ms. Rivers' appropriation _
especially, he said, when he hears customer complaints like this:
``I don't want the woman who's doing my nails to be wearing
earrings like mine.'' But he remains philosophical. ``It's been
going on forever, even in Verdura's day,'' he said. ``If you're
copied in the fashion or jewelry world today, you have to take it
as a compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Landrigan opened the Verdura store in Palm Beach at
38 Via Mizner. Verdura has been available in London each year, in
June during the height of the social season and at Christmas, from
Harry Fane's upstairs showroom at 13 Duke St.
</P>
<P>
   Diana, the princess of Wales, wore several Verdura designs,
including ``pearls in bondage'' earrings, based on a pair Verdura
designed for the duchess of Windsor. Mick Jagger recently gave
Jerry Hall a ruby and diamond ``wrapped heart'' brooch.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Leon Talley, editor at large at Vogue, said he often
borrows Verdura pieces to wear for evenings out. ``Why not?'' he
said. ``Men wore jewels in the 18th century. They carried fur muffs
and wore powder and had beauty marks.''
</P>
<P>
   He favors ``anything that's bombastic or big,'' he added. ``I'm
6 foot 8, so I try to get big-scale brooches.'' He wears them
pinned on a lapel or even on a fedora.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when Talley worked for Diana Vreeland at the
Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he saw Verdura
at close range, in the form of the cuffs that Mrs. Vreeland
``treated as a part of her uniform,'' he said. And he remembered
reading to her from Fulco's childhood memoirs, ``The Happy Summer
Days,'' published in 1976 and reissued last spring by Weidenfeld &AMP;
Nicolson.
</P>
<P>
   He gave Jayne Wrightsman and Annette de la Renta copies at the
haute couture shows in Paris in July, he said. (The book is
required reading in these circles. Before its reissue, Heywood
Hill, the London bookstore, kept a waiting list for secondhand
copies. In 1985, when Landrigan added his name, it was just below
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis'.)
</P>
<P>
   Fulco di Verdura was born into an unconventional and
aristocratic Sicilian family. In 1919, he inherited his father's
title and a small amount of money, which he squandered on one grand
costume ball. In 1926, his professional life took focus when Linda
Porter, the wife of his friend Cole Porter, introduced him to
Chanel, who hired him as a textile designer. Recognizing his eye
for color and sense of style, Chanel asked him to redesign her
personal jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, Verdura opened his own small salon at 712 Fifth Ave.
There, to judge from his carefully preserved handwritten ledgers,
he became a sort of crown jeweler to America's aristocracy, from
the Astors to the Whitneys.
</P>
<P>
   Fulco retired in 1973 and died in 1978. Landrigan, who had been
the head of Sotheby's jewelry department, left the auction house in
1973 to become a private dealer and began an 11-year courtship,
which ended with his buying the firm from Fulco's partner, Joseph
Alfano.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, with an inventory of 35 pieces and Fulco's sketchbooks
containing designs for more than 5,000 pieces, Landrigan set up
shop at 745 Fifth Ave., just north of 57th Street. The production
of new Verdura designs, based on the originals, is overseen by
Landrigan's partner, Maria Kelleher Williams, and executed by its
workshops in New York and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The reactions of Verdura's long-time customers to its attempts
at expanding its market have been mixed. When told of a young
would-be socialite's interest in Verdura, Ms. Collins sighed and
said: ``Well, let her buy the pieces I can't afford. It'll keep
Ward in business. You can't keep the world pure, but you can try.''
</P>
<P>
   But Talley said: ``The more, the merrier. After all, the Babe
Paleys are no longer with us.''

<P>
   QABATIYA, West Bank _ All day long, the Palestinian people of
Qabatiya lined the dusty streets of this quarry town, waiting to be
liberated. They strung streamers, hung flags, dressed their
pint-sized children in khaki uniforms and plastered their bicycles
with pictures of Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   They knew it would be hard to pinpoint the exact moment when the
Israeli military occupation ended and their town, once a hotbed of
anti-Israeli resistance, became fully Palestinian. Unlike the troop
pullout from the big Palestinian cities during the last
redeployment, there would be no visible withdrawal this time
because the Israelis did not maintain a base here.
</P>
<P>
   But the volley of gunshots was their cue. In the late afternoon,
a convoy of powder-blue Palestinian police jeeps roared into town.
Honking and firing their rifles into the air, the Palestinian
policemen took triumphant control of this northern West Bank town,
one corner of the 220 square miles of territory that the Israelis
turned over to the Palestinians Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The occupation is over, and Qabatiya is free,'' said Mahmoud
Zakurneh, 20, a barber who watched from his shop as his neighbors
threw themselves on the jeeps. ``Police are driving through this
town firing their weapons, and we are not ducking from fear. They
are our police, and the weapons are not to be used against us but
to defend us. This is the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   One month after the land-for-security peace plan was signed in
Washington, the Israelis completed the first of a three-phase
withdrawal from the West Bank Friday without incident. They also
released 250 Palestinian prisoners, more than half of them common
criminals. And they signed a document authorizing the long-delayed
opening of the Palestinian airport in Gaza, now set for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A breakthrough after 19 months of stalemate in peace talks, the
new plan seemed fragile even as it was signed. But it cleared a
daunting set of political hurdles in the last few weeks. By the
time the Palestinian security chief and the Israeli army commanders
initialed the land-transfer documents Friday, behind closed doors
at a makeshift military command center, it seemed almost
anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   And it also seemed prosaic, at the start. For hours, the only
sign that anything was taking place were the flatbed trucks fanning
out across the northern West Bank, in the sparsely populated area
between Jenin and Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   On a hilltop outside Jenin, one of the trucks stopped on an
empty road in a stretch of overgrown agricultural fields. The
Israeli driver, Tsemach Takdim, operated a crane lowering new
border markers _ concrete cubes painted yellow and brown _ to
either side of the desolate byway. The soldiers accompanying him
took turns having their picture taken by the cubes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's history,'' one said, with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Takdim, said he would be dispersing West Bank
dividers all day, even though he was ideologically opposed to
territorial compromise. ``I consider myself to be from the whole
land of Israel,'' he said. ``But, bottom line, I'm from Tel Aviv,
and this is my job.''
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning, a crisis seemed to be brewing. A senior Israeli
army official reported at a briefing in Jenin that Arafat had a
beef with changes in the maps. Everything was on hold, he said,
while two Israeli commanders flew by to Hebron to meet with the
Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the delay traveled to the streets of Qabatiya, where the
crowd was quick to turn skeptical. In The Union Sweets Shop and
Restaurant on the main drag, a group of men crowded around a
portable radio sitting on a freezer under a mural of Bambi. The
shop owner, Jamal Abu Rab, held his head in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now what?'' he asked. ``We have no more patience to wait. We
need the Palestinian police.''
</P>
<P>
   Qabatiya is a hard-bitten town, dominated by a handful of clans,
among them the Abu Rabs. It was a hive of unrest during the years
of the intifada, the seven-year Palestinian uprising that began in
1987. In a morbid claim to fame, the town was the site of the first
lynching of a Palestinian believed to be an Israeli collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, Qabatiya, with 16,000 residents, has
lived under Palestinian civil control but Israeli security control.
Israeli officers would sweep through on arrests or raids, and
sometimes close the town's gates, but they did not maintain a
police station there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This town has been lawless, chaotic,'' Abu Rub said. ``The
Israeli police came in and out looking for terrorists. But direct
traffic? That wasn't their job, but it's our biggest need.''

 QABATIYA: biggest need.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Hebron, Arafat was giving his approval to the
altered maps, which contained tiny changes but turned over the same
amount of land: 2 percent of the West Bank to joint
Palestinian-Israeli control, and 7 percent to full Palestinian
control. There are 28 towns and villages, with Qabatiya the
largest, in the mostly rural area; in 10, Palestinian police
stations were opened Friday.
</P>
<P>
   No Israeli army bases were moved in this first redeployment and
no roads leading to and from Jewish settlements fell into
Palestinian hands. Two small settlements, about 50 families each,
will become enclaves surrounded by Palestinian-controlled land.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the second and third withdrawals are complete, the
Palestinians will have control of 40 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, at several military checkpoints between Israel
and the Palestinian territories, the prisoners were set free.
Palestinian officials were upset by the large number of common
criminals, rather than political prisoners, released. At the Nahal
Oz checkpoint in Gaza, an Israeli police officer told reporters,
``You'd better lock your cars because they're all car thieves,''
Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   There were none of the customary hero's welcomes of Palestinian
prisoners released by the Israelis, and many mothers of political
prisoners whose sons were not released were left sobbing at the
border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Abu Rab, a distant relative of the sweets shop owner, was
quietly released from an Israeli jail in Mejiddo very late Thursday
night, and made his way to his home in Qabatiyaslot. A former
leader of a militant group that called itself the Black Panthers,
he was one of five members of the Palestinian security services who
were freed from jail by the Israelis in a last-minute concession to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had confidence that the Palestinians never forget their
political detainees, but when they tapped me on the shoulder last
night I was very surprised,'' he said Friday, surrounded by fellow
Black Panthers, who were shooting their guns in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Rab had been imprisoned after holding an Israeli soldier
hostage in what he considered a political act. Asked if his days of
kidnapping Israelis were over, he said, ``I hope we will not be
obliged to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   A surge of euphoria swept the town during the police parade. The
Mayor, Muhammad Ibrahim Abu Rab, offering orange drinks and
bon-bons to a who's who of Palestinian officials at City Hall,
pronounced his town ``sovereign.'' In the streets, some older women
sang and ululated. But the celebration quieted quickly, and there
were those who voiced doubts that life would change enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot deny that things will be better, '' said Najeeb
Mohammed Abu al-Rab, 70. ``The Palestinian police will not knock on
our door at midnight, looking for someone to arrest. But under the
Israelis we were workers. And under the Palestinians we will still
be workers. When we wake up tomorrow morning, will our life really
be that different?''

MARCHING FOR EISNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Instead of ringing a bell or flashing the lights,
guests were called to dinner by the UCLA Marching Band, which had
elegantly dressed businessmen putting down their drinks to cheer,
``U-C-L-A ... fight, fight, fight!''
</P>
<P>
   The gala at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills
was hosted by the Anderson School at UCLA, so there were plenty of
UCLA grads among the 800 guests, including Disney chairman and CEO
Michael Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner was there to receive UCLA's Exemplary Leadership in
Management Award, and although he didn't entice Mickey and Minnie
to attend, Walt's nephew Roy Disney came in a Mickey Mouse print
tie. Also attending was Peter Ueberroth, who brought the 1984
Olympics to Los Angeles and is expected to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner's presence also brought a flock of hecklers who protested
Disney's ABC locking out one of its unions in a labor dispute by
chanting ``Go USC!''
</P>
<P>
   After dining on spinach-stuffed chicken breasts, comedian Bill
Maher welcomed the crowd with a few witty remarks about the prez
and Monica, saying we ought to have more compassion for our
president since, after all, he's from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   After the laughter died down, John Anderson, the business
school's namesake, described Eisner as a financial wizard and
presented him with the award and a huge crystal vase donated by
Neiman Marcus of Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner modestly accepted the award and praise by saying, ``I'm
just an English major with no M before my B.A.'' Then he shared his
tips for business success: ``Make the product come first, use
common sense, work hard, have good personal hygiene, good timing, a
willingness to always seek the high road ... and a clean desk.'' He
added that a supportive family is an asset above all else.
</P>
<P>
   AT ONE OF THE coolest theme parties of the year, guests got a
chance to step back in time to the film noir era, when guys wore
hats and trench coats, and women wore those furs with the heads and
tails.
</P>
<P>
   They called the highly theatrical event the Neil Bogart
Confidential: The Case of the Missing Cure Gala.
</P>
<P>
   The event honored Tower Records founder and owner Russ Solomon
with the 1998 Children's Choice Award and raised $1.1 million for
children's cancer, leukemia and AIDS research.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers transformed Santa Monica Airport's Barker Hangar into
Rick's _ that swanky nightclub in ``Casablanca'' _ and inside were
scantily clad cigarette girls handing out bubble gum from their
trays, and guys that looked like all your favorite film noir
characters. In one area, guests posed for snapshots on a bed that
looked like a scene right out of ``L.A. Confidential,'' while up on
the stage Marilu Henner performed a saucy number from ``Chicago''
and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy offered hot jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Neil Bogart Memorial Fund members are mostly members
of the music industry (Bogart was the head of Casablanca records
until he died of cancer in 1982), there were plenty of artists
paying tribute to Solomon, and one of the best was young crooner
Brian McKnight, who sang ``When Sunny Gets Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the celeb guests was Dick Clark, who said he'd known
Bogart since they were children and had never missed one of the
fund-raising parties. ``Bogart was known for throwing theme parties
when he was alive, so each year there's always a theme,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about past parties, Les Bider of Encino said they were
all fun, but the 1994 party with a Bogart on Broadway theme was his
favorite. ``That's the year I was honored,'' he said, adding that
he chose to support this fund because of the work it does for
children with cancer and the progress being made in bone-marrow
transplants.
</P>

ENHANCED MOVIE-VIEWING GIVES DVD PLAYERS THE EDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With all the marketing muscle and millions they
can muster, makers of DVD and its rival cousin DiVX are begging us
to buy their stuff. So what should you purchase this holiday
seasons?
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't know, DVD, or digital video disc, looks like
a compact disc but holds 26 times more information, offering plenty
of room not only for music but also incredible games, reference
works and especially movies. Compared to VHS videotapes, DVDs
provide far better pictures, sound and durability.
</P>
<P>
   You also can hop to any point in the movie easily, with
scene-by-scene ``chapter'' markers. And because of DVD's huge
capacity, most titles are packed with such delightful extras as
audio in several languages, running commentary by the director,
interviews and biographies of key personnel and special-effects
explanations.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1998, as many as 1 million players are expected to
be sold, and millions more DVD drives are part of new computers.
That base of players will further drive down prices and encourage
the release of even more titles than the 2,300 now available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already a pretty established base of people love DVD,'' said
Gail Becker, vice president of communications for Warner Home
Video, which has championed the format since 1992. ``You can get a
player for $299 and can rent a disc for the same price as a (video)
tape. And it looks and sounds unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   To further boost the format, electronics companies, retailers,
video rental chains and studios are offering deals through the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, buy a Toshiba player at the Good Guys or Best Buy
and get free DVD rentals at Hollywood Entertainment or West Coast
Entertainment. And Warner and corporate cousin New Line Home Video
will give you ``City of Angels,'' the goodie-laden ``Lost in
Space,'' and three other titles.
</P>
<P>
   In a somewhat similar deal, online DVD seller Netflix.com will
give buyers of Sony, Pioneer and Toshiba players up to five free
rentals, said president Mark Randolph.
</P>
<P>
   CHEAPER ALTERNATIVES: DiVX, or Digital Video Express, players do
everything a DVD player does, and one thing more: equipment and a
modem (which add $50 to $100 to the player's cost) to run specially
encoded DiVX discs.
</P>
<P>
   DiVX discs cost only $4.59, compared to DVDs that usually cost
$20 to $25, making it easy to amass a cheap collection of movies.
</P>
<P>
   But while you can watch a DVD disc as many times as you want,
you can only watch a DiVX disc for 48 hours once you put it in the
player, said Josh Dare, DiVX's director of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Then the controller equipment scrambles the picture until you
call DiVX and pay $3.25 for another 48-hour view. The idea was to
create a system that made rentals easy and cheap while solving
studios' piracy concerns, Dare said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we're complementary to DVD,'' Dare said. ``The
market we're going for is video rentals, with 10 million rentals a
day. But there's a downward trend line, and when you ask customers
why, they say they're tired of hassles, taking back tapes and
paying late fees. DiVX gets rid of those frustrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City and a Los Angeles-area entertainment law firm have
been DiVX's financial backers and have bet big on the product. But
there are perhaps only 200 titles available _ and only a handful of
DiVX-compatible DVD players.
</P>
<P>
   DiVX titles are also stripped down typically, with none of the
extras found on regular DVDs. But Dare said many people don't want
the extras, and many films don't warrant them. DiVX provides a
cheap, simple alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want the other stuff, we would say there's a fine
product already out there,'' Dare said. ``DiVX is the softback to
the hardback of DVD.''
</P>
<P>
   But DiVX has enraged many DVD enthusiasts. Netflix's Randolph
argues, for instance, that the extras are important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed how much those special features add to the
experience, even on the ones that are not the deepest movies,''
Randolph said.
</P>
<P>
   So what you do depends on how you watch movies. DiVX's
convenience may outweigh the format's limits and its more expensive
equipment. However, serious film buffs should dispense with DiVX
and use the savings to buy four or five movies on DVD.

BURNS HOPES WORKOUT WILL SET BRUINS ON WINNING COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was the morning after the night before, and Bruins
coach Pat Burns was still upset. Not angry, mind you, but upset.
</P>
<P>
   He was still coming to terms with the 5-5 overtime tie against
the Florida Panthers, a game in which the Bruins led, 4-0 less than
seven minutes into the second period and 5-2 with less than 13
minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had to pay for blowing what seemed a sure 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   So Burns took it out on those responsible _ the players. He ran
them through a brisk hour-long workout at the FleetCenter. Practice
was no picnic in the park. It was 60 minutes of intensity with
heavy hitting and high-sticking in the corners and a lot of pushing
and shoving.
</P>
<P>
   No one was immune. If Burns didn't like what a unit did, his
whistle blew and the players were ordered to hit the ice for
pushups. And that included the goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   There were times when Burns raised his voice, but later he
assured one and all that that was only to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened (Thursday night) was discussed; there's no
panic,'' said Burns. ``What do you want me to do, throw a big fit
or something? Nothing went on. We discussed where we went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want the puck, you want to get the puck, and once you get
it, you want to make the right decision with it. You just can't
give it back to the other team,'' he added, alluding to the Bruins'
many giveaways Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Burns was asked if he was trying to make sure the players were
sufficiently upset about their collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to make anybody upset with anything,'' he
snapped. ``We screwed up in the final part of the game (Thursday
last) night and we've got to be better. And that's the final word
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not out to scold and go out there and make a Sermon on the
Mount. We talked about what we had to do and we went out there and
practiced it. You address a problem when there'e one there.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Burns did indeed preach that Sermon on the Mount.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are responsible. They're responsible for their
actions on the ice and they have to take full responsibility of
that. That is their job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're out there making mistakes, you have to be
accountable for your mistakes. And the fans let them know that
(Thursday night). They booed them, and they deserved to be booed.
And it's humiliating. You come off the ice, sure, you're
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should go home and think about it because that's your
responsibility. When you hold management to the wall about money,
are you worried then? You're not worried. Are you upset then? Are
you worried about making a mistake? Well, you're out there. You got
it (the money). You go out and do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Ledyard, who celebrated his 37th birthday with his second
goal of the season Thursday, understood the reason behind Burns's
stiff workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desperate times, I guess desperate measures,'' he said. ``We
weren't very happy with the result (Thursday night). We had a lot
of breakdowns that we don't normally have. Until (Thursday night),
we were one of the better teams defensively. It was very
uncharacteristic, but I think we could see it creeping into our
game the last week or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't take any team for granted the way we took the
Panthers. We have to play the start hard, the middle hard, and
certainly play the end of the game hard. The booing hurt. Any time
you're in your own building, you don't want to hear your fans boo,
but I think they had a right to. We should be very ashamed and take
it to heart and try and play the best we can and win them back.''
</P>
<P>
   That chance comes Saturday night when the Bruins host the
Washington Capitals, the team that knocked them out of the playoffs
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``That factor means nothing to me,'' said Burns. ``We just
better put forth a better effort.''

BC'S DEFENSE MAY WANT TO TARGET ZEREOUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. _ Finally, the stage has been set. The battle
lines have been drawn. And the trash talk has been dutifully
recorded, printed, and tacked on Boston College's bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   All year long, senior running back Mike Cloud has ranked as the
best rusher in the Big East, averaging 154.7 yards per game.
Saturday, in BC's season finale at West Virginia, the nation's No.
3 rusher will get the opportunity to prove he's No. 1 in the league
when he goes head to head with Mountaineers junior Amos Zereoue,
the conference's all-time leading rusher with 674 carries for 3,658
yards and 36 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Zereoue popped off about Cloud's status as
the league's leading rusher of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he's leading the Big East in rushing doesn't mean he's
the best back,'' said Zereoue, No. 2 in the conference and No. 5 in
the nation with an average of 147.1 yards per game. ``In truth, I
thought (Edgerrin) James of Miami was better, and you can't forget
about my man (Alvin) Swoope. He's my backup, but he could go to BC
and start there or anywhere else. And one of the best backs is
James's backup _ James Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   Zereoue may have been suffering from short-term memory loss,
considering that Cloud ran for a career-high 211 yards, including
209 in the second half, to rally BC from a 17-3 deficit to a 31-24
victory at Alumni Stadium in last year's meeting with the
Mountaineers. Zereoue, meanwhile, was held to 68 yards on 19
carries.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's 23-15 victory at Pittsburgh, Cloud rushed 37
times for 179 yards to break BC's season rushing record (1,387) set
by Chuckie Dukes in 1992. Cloud improved his totals to 280 carries
for 1,547 yards and 13 touchdowns, breaking the season conference
records for rushes (264) and yards (1,505) set by Zereoue a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to congratulate him on breaking the records, but tht's
as far as it goes,'' Zereoue said. ``Other than that, I don't know
anything about the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he ever watched Cloud run, Zereoue said, ``For what? I
just worry about Amos. I don't look at any other backs in the Big
East. Occasionally, I'll look at the stats, but I compare myself to
the top three backs in the nation. I don't worry about the Big East
backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Zereoue's cutting remarks would seem to be enough to rankle any
opponent. But Cloud, who needs 87 yards to displace Troy Stradford
(3,504 yards, 1982-86) as BC's all-time leading rusher, responded
in a careful and measured tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read that; I saw that on our bulletin board,'' he said.
``I don't pay too much attention to that. Come game day, on
Saturday, it'll be a different story. I have nothing against him. I
don't have anything bad to say about him.''
</P>
<P>
   But BC's defense may want to do some bad things to Zereoue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to say something like that, I think it will help
the team focus a little more in practice and will help the team
focus a little more during the game, because what maybe they
suspect has been verbalized,'' coach Tom O'Brien said. ``But I
don't know why kids say things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   So this is what the season has wrought for BC: One last trip to
West Virginia (6-3, 3-2). After a 3-0 start, the Eagles had
aspirations of making trips to any number of bowl destinations,
ranging from Jacksonville to Tucson to Nashville to Pontiac, Mich.,
to Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   But BC's six-game losing streak, pockmarked by stinging
last-second losses to Navy (32-31) and Notre Dame (31-26), dashed
any postseason travel plans. While the Eagles (4-6, 3-3) cannot
finish with a winning overall record, they can achieve a winning
conference mark with a victory over the Mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our last game,'' Cloud said. ``And we have to come out
and play like it's our bowl game.''
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Brien, ``Obviously, the team did a great job of coming
back (from the Notre Dame loss) and kept playing hard at
Pittsburgh. The key now is to continue that enthusiasm and keep
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got nowhere else to go. We're not worried about
practicing next week or going to a bowl, so there's no sense saving
anything after this game. We've got to go let it all hang out and
see if we can come back with a win from Morgantown.''

EATON RETURNS TO PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Chad Eaton had never missed a football game
because of injury until last week. That's when the medical staff
advised him that if he kept bleeding internally around his ailing
right thigh, he could risk calcification, creating bone growth and
necessitating surgery, a possible career-ending injury.
</P>
<P>
   Only then did Eaton, who expects to return to his nose tackle
spot Monday when the Patriots host the Dolphins, become alarmed
enough to take a seat against Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really humbles you,'' he said. ``It gives you an idea of
how lucky you are to be in the NFL. Injuries can really screw
things up.''
</P>
<P>
   If it were up to him, he would have played last Sunday. The
thought of sitting on the sideline is almost nauseating to him. He
made the NFL on sheer blood and guts, elevating himself from
practice squads with the Cleveland Browns and Patriots. Last year
he shared time in the middle, and in training camp this past
summer, he won the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   So he wasn't going to willingly sit and watch others play, not
after a lifetime of fighting to get his chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell you if they think you can't play,'' said Eaton. ``It
depends on who you are, too. I didn't want to sit out the game
because I care more about the respect I get from my teammates than
I did my own body. Teammates need to know, `Hey, he's playing in
pain.' Everybody knows that Henry (Thomas) is damaged. But he's out
there every game. It was killing me Sunday to see him out there by
himself and me not being out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was killing the Patriots, too. Thomas had to play the nose
rather than his normal tackle spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been playing two weeks before last week not even being
able to look at my leg,'' he said. ``I had excruciating pain. It
came out that it would be better for me to sit and get ready for
the second half of the season, but I think my teammates need to see
me out there. They don't need to see me on the sidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   After a week of sitting and wondering about the next game, Eaton
returned to practice Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' he said. ``I'm excited. I can't wait to
practice. I can't wait to hit somebody. I can't wait for `Monday
Night Football.' That's what we need to do. We can't sit around and
say, `When so-and-so comes back ...' We have enough guys to play
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton, Ted Johnson, Todd Collins, Chris Slade, Thomas, Ferric
Collons, and Chris Sullivan form an effective run-stopping team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I contribute a lot,'' said Eaton. ``I help our
linebackers. They're accustomed to seeing me. The way you stop the
run is everyone needs to fit in the right spot and everyone takes
care of their assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton was in the locker room last week when coach Pete Carroll
put on a display of emotion after the latest loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to see him do that,'' said Eaton. ``He's a cool,
calm, collected guy. Nothing rattles him, so it was good to see him
get upset. I think the team is going to respond this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton senses a marked difference in attitude and approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell in Pete's voice now,'' he said. ``He isn't
screwing around anymore. I think this team has taken a lot of
things for granted. We really need to ... we're working harder. We
used to let some little things pass by, and now we're not letting
anything pass by.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that if the Patriots continue losing, the fault is
with the players, not the coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Pete is very well respected here,'' said Eaton. ``Last
year everything was hunky-dory because he was taking over for
(Bill) Parcells. This year adversity has pointed fingers at
everyone. That's why the question of `off with his head' has come
up. Pete's not out there playing. I feel sorry for him. You have to
be tough and strong to be a coach in the NFL. Pete can handle it,
and that's why he's in the position he's at. He's very competitive,
and that's going to rub off here.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton insists that the Patriots _ 5-5 this season and 6-16 on
Monday nights _ will do an about-face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we can turn it around,'' he said. ``The attitude in the
practices this week ... the last 48 hours have been exciting. That
Jets game (a 24-14 Monday night loss Oct. 19) killed us. We were
high, ready to go, and they killed us. We went to Miami and it was
a free fall (a 12-9 overtime loss the following Sunday). I think
we're going to change it around now.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton said the team's prospective move to Hartford in 2001 is
not a distraction and won't be a legitimate alibi if the Patriots
lose to the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Kraft came in and talked to us about the situation after
Thursday's practice,'' said Eaton. ``He's talking about 2001 and
2002, and everybody is saying, `Well, my contract is up then.'''

<P>
   The megaships are coming. But where will they dock?
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of immense cargo ships, more than 1,100 feet
long and bearing up to 6,675 containers, is poised to capture a
significant share of ocean shipping, but no port in the United
States is now fully equipped to handle the ships when they are
loaded to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Five ports on the Atlantic coast are competing to be the
megaship destination for one of the world's largest shipping lines,
the alliance of Maersk, owned by the A.P. Moller conglomerate of
Denmark, and the Sealand unit of the CSX Corp. Maersk/Sealand is
expected to winnow the list to two finalists this week and make its
final selection by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are billions of dollars of trade, investment and
employment that will flow to and through the main deep-water port
for half a continent.
</P>
<P>
   Maersk/Sealand, whose current lease in the Port of New York and
New Jersey expires in 2000, wants its next home to provide 25
years' exclusive use of a fully modernized terminal with easy road
and rail access and waterways 50 feet deep, matching major world
ports like Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Operations that fit the bill cannot now be found anywhere in
North America, said John M. Pisani, director of ports and domestic
shipping for the maritime administration of the Transportation
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States, the greatest trading nation in the world,
cannot handle the greatest ships in the world,'' Pisani said.
Continued absence of a megaship port on each coast ``would be a
critical blow to the nation's ability to compete in world trade,''
he added. Ninety percent of United States imports arrive by sea,
and the Defense Department relies on commercial ports and
transportation centers to supply military operations overseas.
</P>
<P>
   An expansion project is already under way in the ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach, Calif., that will allow handling of
megaships there in about five years, Pisani said. On the Atlantic
side, the port will be chosen from among New York/New Jersey;
Baltimore; Norfolk, Va.; Halifax, Nova Scotia; and the former naval
base at Quonset Point, R.I. The eventual winner will have to spend
heavily to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Three dozen of the new giant cargo ships _ none built in the
United States or operating under an American flag _ are already in
service and 45 more are on order, some of them bigger than current
models.
</P>
<P>
   Megaships already carry about 25 percent of the world's
ocean-borne containerized freight, including 5 percent to 10
percent of United States imports and exports (by scraping in and
out of existing ports with partial loads). By 2010, they will carry
up to 40 percent of world container cargo and about a third of
United States foreign trade, excluding bulk commodities like oil
and grain, according to M. John Vickerman, a transportation
consultant in Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The engine driving the big ships' role is cost: Ton for ton of
cargo, the bigger the ship, the cheaper it is to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given their economy of scale, in the future the megaships will
increase their market share and make as few port calls as
possible,'' said Kurt J. Nagle, president of the American
Association of Port Authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Maersk/Sealand's search is precipitating a shakeout among North
American ports that will be echoed when each of the three other
global shipping alliances _ groups led by P&AMP;O Nedloyd, Neptune
Orient Lines and Hanjin _ move to establish megaterminals of their
own, Vickerman predicted. Ports that do not win one or more of the
big terminals will be limited to secondary roles in a hub-and-spoke
system like that used in the airline industry _ and will wither
further without modernization.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Upgrading a port to receive megaships can take a decade or more
_ and cost billions of dollars. Wharves must be equipped with a
dozen or more huge container cranes, which can cost $6 million
apiece. Efficient handling of the huge flow of freight to and from
the ships requires complexes of terminals equipped with
computerized tracking systems. Quonset lacks all of these;
Baltimore and Halifax need upgrades in these areas.
</P>
<P>
   Cargo must be able to flow conveniently to and from the port on
high-speed truck routes and modern rail lines with tracks and
bridge clearances that can accommodate containers stacked two-high
on flatcars. Quonset's land transportation links are rudimentary,
and Norfolk and Halifax are each served by only one railroad.
Halifax is also hundreds of miles farther than the other
competitors from the continent's major population centers.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping channels and berths must be dredged to a depth of at
least 50 feet, a job that poses thorny environmental problems in
some ports. New York Harbor would be especially difficult to
dredge: Bedrock would have to be blasted in some places to reach
the necessary depth, and sediments on the harbor floor are heavily
contaminated with industrial toxins dumped over the last century.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore, Norfolk and Quonset would also need dredging, though
the work would be easier; only Halifax is now deep enough for a
fully loaded megaship.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of coordination among shipping lines, land carriers,
environmental groups and port and government officials has long
plagued efforts to keep American ports up to world standards,
especially since the 1980s, when most transportation industries
were deregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Port and surface transportation officials complain that while 75
percent of the operating cost of a cargo ship is spent on land
activity, they did not get to participate in planning the
megaships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The carriers' approach to the port is, `We build bigger ships;
you figure out how to handle them,' '' said Ralph F. Cox, a
transportation consultant in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, port development has lagged far behind ship
development. ``The advances in vessel technology have dramatically
pointed up the shortcomings in the U.S. infrastructure,'' said
Henry S. Marcus, chairman of the Ocean Systems Management Program
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Federal spending on port development and on freight
transportation in general has been limited, Nagle said. The $221.6
million for ports in the current budget falls short of the $330
million needed just to sustain current maintenance projects, he
said. The ports themselves spend about $1.5 billion a year on
capital improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Other than making lease payments, the shipping lines generally
do not help pay for improvements. But they have the upper hand,
because they have more alternatives. Maersk/Sealand, for instance,
feels no need to restrict itself to United States ports to serve
American markets, said Tommy Thompsen, president of Maersk. Feeding
goods into the United States from ports in Canada or Mexico would
do just as well.
</P>
<P>
   As Pisani of the Transportation Department put it, ``The
shippers can move their assets around; the ports can't.''

TRAGEDY STALKS TENNESSEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ He doesn't know how he will react this
afternoon, what will be left in him emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   In any other circumstance, Tim Couch wouldn't have a doubt.
Playing top-ranked Tennessee at Knoxville in what could be his last
regular-season collegiate game would be more than enough incentive
for the University of Kentucky junior quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before last Sunday, when the real world came
crashing down around Couch with a simple telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   His best friend, Scott Brock, whom he'd known since they were
toddlers, had been killed in a traffic accident. So had a teammate,
Arthur Steinmetz. Another Kentucky player, center Jason Watts, had
been injured in the accident, which occurred early Sunday morning
en route to a deer hunting trip.
</P>
<P>
   Added to that was the ominous news that Watts, who was driving
the pickup truck involved in the accident, had a blood alcohol
content of 0.15 percent _ the legal limit is 0.10 _ and faced
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that Saturday's game has been almost an
afterthought for Couch and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   For Couch, who may well be the No. 1 pick in next spring's
National Football League draft and still has an outside chance of
winning the Heisman Trophy, the Tennessee game had been penciled in
as the showcase of a brilliant career and a surprisingly successful
season.
</P>
<P>
   With a 7-3 record, the Wildcats under coach Hal Mumme had become
a bowl-quality team.
</P>
<P>
   Playing Tennessee has always been special for Couch. The
Volunteers recruited him harder than anyone other than Kentucky,
and had Peyton Manning not been in the mix here, Couch might have
considered leaving his home state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always circle the Tennessee game every year on the
calendar,'' said Couch, who called this the biggest game of his
life. ``I love playing them. It means a lot to me and it means a
lot to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   But now it's just a game, nothing more. Couch buried his best
friend Wednesday. He buried a teammate Thursday. The Wildcats
hardly practiced this week, and when they did, their minds were
wandering, although Mumme said the early sessions were better than
he had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Now game day has arrived. Not much is at stake. Just a national
championship for Tennessee (9-0), No. 1 in the Bowl Championship
Series rankings, and a Heisman for Couch.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Couch said it was almost impossible to
concentrate. ``I couldn't quit thinking about all the stuff we had
done,'' said Couch, who also limited his practice time because of a
sore arm.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday afternoon, before a screaming crowd at Neyland
Stadium that will be sympathetic toward Couch and the Wildcats
until the opening kickoff, he must blot out the past week and focus
on playing a game that suddenly has become much less important.

MISSOURI AGREES TO SETTLE TOBACCO LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Missouri agreed to settle its lawsuit
against tobacco companies Thursday for $6.7 billion and new curbs
on the tobacco industry, Attorney General Jay Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said the settlement is the biggest in state history and
will mean dividends for the state starting in April 2000. Missouri
will get annual payments of $200 million to $250 million for 25
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's lawsuit was designed to recover money the state spent
treating Missourians for smoking-related illnesses, primarily
through Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas leaders will announce today whether they will accept a
similar offer.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Budget Director Mark Ward said Missouri can spend the
money as it chooses. Gov. Mel Carnahan, who supported the
agreement, said some funds may be used to finance efforts to combat
smoking by youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   But state Auditor Margaret Kelly's office disputed Ward's
comments. The issue may spark a lawsuit by those who contend at
least some of the money should be returned to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said he weighed the settlement offer against the risks of
pressing his lawsuit and concluded that settling gave the state its
best chance for progress ``against this dreadful addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to take action today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said the agreement provides $4.4 billion in today's
dollars but will come to at least $6.7 billion when adjusted for
inflation. The settlement requires increases of at least 3 percent
per year over 25 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Attorney General Carla Stovall said Wednesday she was
leaning toward accepting the settlement, which would mean $1.5
billion for Kansas plus interest. Stovall plans to announce her
decision at 10 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 46 states, including Missouri and Kansas, would share
in a $206 billion deal designed to end lawsuits against tobacco
companies Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson and
Lorillard.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 states already have endorsed the deal. States have
until noon today to make a decision, and then the tobacco companies
have 24 hours to decide whether to accept the settlement or fight
the lawsuits in court. Nixon said he was confident that enough
states will sign on to bring an end to the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement includes new restrictions on the tobacco
industry aimed at reducing the appeal of cigarettes to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are concessions that can only be secured through a
settlement,'' Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement bans tobacco companies from:
</P>
<P>
   Putting up outdoor advertising, including billboards, in
stadiums and shopping malls. Nixon said there are 1 million tobacco
billboards across the nation, including about 30 percent aimed at
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Using cartoons in advertising and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on youngsters in advertising and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Paying people to promote tobacco products in movies, television
shows and theater productions.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also requires the Tobacco Institute and other
pro-tobacco groups to disband and prohibits tobacco companies from
lobbying against state or local laws to curb tobacco use by
youngsters. It also requires tobacco companies to pay $250 million
to fund a foundation that will work to reduce teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Maryann R. Coletti, vice chairwoman of the Missouri Coalition on
Smoking or Health in St. Louis, said her group endorsed the
settlement as an important first step on tobacco control. Coletti
said her group still plans to work for federal regulatory control
over tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Alan Van Zandt, a member of the coalition and
director of public relations for the American Lung Association of
Western Missouri, said the group would like to see 20 percent of
the revenue from any industry settlement earmarked for tobacco
control, including comprehensive tobacco education programs in
schools and ads that counter those from tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Van Zandt said even though the coalition endorsed the
settlement, members are concerned that the deal protects the
tobacco industry from future litigation by any state, city or
county government.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan praised Nixon's work and said the attorney general held
tobacco companies accountable for the health consequences of their
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement agreement is in the best interest of the
citizens of Missouri,'' the governor said. ``It eliminates the risk
of uncertain and extended litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chuck Pierce, deputy state auditor, said Thursday that
previous court rulings suggest the money will be subject to the
state's revenue and spending lid, known as the Hancock amendment.
That means some or all of the money could be refunded to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce and Kelly, his supervisor, leave office in January.
Pierce said that if they were in office when the money arrived ``we
would be going to court to get that clarified.''
</P>
<P>
   Budget director Ward said that because the money is simply funds
the state had already spent, it is not considered ``new'' state
revenue that could eventually be subject to taxpayer refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's lawsuit was scheduled to be heard in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Strong of Springfield, a private lawyer hired by Nixon to
lead the state's legal team, stood to collect up to $350 million
for himself and others if the state had won. That arrangement
sparked criticism from Republicans, including Sen. Kit Bond, who
defeated Nixon this month in their Senate contest.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said Strong supported the state's decision to settle the
lawsuit. Tobacco companies, not state taxpayers, will pay Strong
and other private attorneys for work they have done, Nixon said. He
said that amount will be determined later.

<P>
   Deflation? Don't be ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Most investors are quick to dismiss the very notion of
deflation, an economic environment defined by widespread declines
in the prices of goods and services. Accustomed to the inflation of
the last half-century or so, they expect ever higher prices for
their cars, their homes and _ perhaps most importantly _ their
stocks. They simply cannot imagine a world where most items they
buy behave the way that computers do now _ getting cheaper year
after year.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that a lot of smart people are thinking about
the possibility _ and not just the Cassandras of the stock market
who insist that a crash is coming. After a period in which the U.S.
economy could seemingly do no wrong, with inflation low and
corporate profits percolating nicely, there is now talk among
economists, money managers and strategists about the odds of
deflation washing up on these shores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from the New Paradigm to deflation, from June to
August,'' said Byron Wien, an investment strategist at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. Even with the recent rally in stocks, he said,
``the word `deflation' is still on everybody's lips.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other people who discuss it, Wien does not think
deflation is likely to take hold. So why all the buzz? Because
there are just enough signs of deflation _ like the flood of cheap
steel into this country or the briefly negative yield on six-month
Treasury bills in Japan _ to make people pause.
</P>
<P>
   Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has mentioned the
subject, and his willingness to cut interest rates again last week
suggests that he is more concerned about the economy contracting
than about inflation.
</P>
<P>
   If the average prognosticator is wrong, and the U.S. economy
does slide into deflation, investors are likely to have a hard time
adjusting. For all the turns of the business cycle, deflation has
been essentially nonexistent in the United States since the 1930s,
and few investors have spent much time considering the impact of
even a mild decline in prices _ an average of just a percentage
point or two a year.
</P>
<P>
   Few money managers are old enough to have had firsthand
experience with deflation. ``The problem is that nobody, with few
exceptions, has ever seen a real deflationary environment,'' said
Timothy Morris, the chief investment officer for Bessemer Trust Co.
in New York. ``We are not sure what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   Like inflation, deflation does not come in a single flavor.
Economists are careful to distinguish, for example, between the
deflation that wreaked havoc during the Great Depression and the
more benign variety seen during the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The former type took a firm hold when demand fell everywhere,
driving down prices and putting millions of people out of work. The
latter coincided with the arrival of the Industrial Revolution in
the United States: Prices fell because both production and
productivity soared, and both workers and business could afford to
keep demand strong. Some analysts see parallels between that period
and today, given the advances occurring in technology.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is sure. ``This could be the deflationary abyss that
everyone is talking about,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment
officer of Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis. Or, he
said, ``this could be the deflationary boom.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Already, portfolio managers are rethinking the kinds of stocks
they own as they confront a changing environment: Many companies
are finding that they cannot easily raise prices and are facing the
deflationary effects of economic turmoil in regions like Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The debate also provides a chance for investors to examine their
own economic assumptions _ and those inherent in the choices made
by their money managers.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to swoon. As noted by Richard Hoey, the chief
economist at Dreyfus Corp., investment mistakes tend to be made
whenever people work with ``giant investment scenarios'' _ often in
response to scattered current events that they extrapolate into
overarching trends. Hoey remembers when people pontificated about
triple-digit inflation in the early 1980s _ just as inflation was
peaking.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if something new is going on here, it makes sense to
think about the implications.
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous Deflation: `Crash' Is the Word
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes the kind of deflation that destroys nearly
everything in its path from the good deflation that marks a
productive economy? Demand. As long as falling prices encourage
people to keep buying in greater volumes, the overall economy can
continue to hum along. When people stop buying, because they start
losing their jobs or want to put off their purchases, deflation can
spiral into depression.
</P>
<P>
   Such potentially demand-destroying events are unfolding in
countries like Indonesia. For now, the country is experiencing high
inflation, because it devalued its currency, the rupiah. But
Indonesia is awash in people who can no longer afford to consume _
unemployment is rising, with roughly a fifth of workers now
unemployed _ and its economy is expected to contract by at least 15
percent this year. High rates of inflation like those in Indonesia,
a result of higher prices for imports, can foreshadow deflation as
countries sink into depression.
</P>
<P>
   Japan also continues to wrestle with deflation. Wholesale prices
have been flat or have fallen there for more than a year as the
government has struggled to re-ignite the economy. Last week, yet
another recovery package was announced _ a plan to inject nearly
$200 billion in tax cuts and government spending into the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The United States last saw devastating deflation during the
Depression, when unemployment soared and many people lucky enough
to have jobs saw their wages fall faster than prices. But only the
most alarmist thinkers paint a picture in which 1930s-style
deflation would be unleashed on America today, when stocks and real
estate are not nearly as overvalued as they were in the 1920s, the
banking system is healthier and the Federal Reserve is likely to
act more decisively.

 Snowbarger reflects on election loss, future role  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLINGER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ It's tough to lose, especially something as public
and prestigious as a seat in the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Vince Snowbarger, who won that spot two years ago,
knows the emotions too well _ anger, bitter disappointment and a
feeling of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   After losing to Democrat Dennis Moore in the Nov. 3 election,
Snowbarger dropped out of sight. He avoided the press and many
friends, leaving for a vacation in Branson with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty significant event in our lives,'' Snowbarger
said Thursday during an interview. ``It's better to take time to
sort this out.''
</P>
<P>
   He realized that he might have said something just after the
election that could haunt him later. A cooling-off period was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be accused of sour grapes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he's back in his congressional office, if only
temporarily, trying to help a staff of 15 find new jobs and close
his offices in Washington and the 3rd District. Moore won't take
the oath of office until Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbarger also is reflecting on what happened, the state of the
GOP and his future.
</P>
<P>
   Will he run again in two years against Moore? That isn't a
decision he's ready to make, but it is something he's considering.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major things is what happens in two or four
years,'' he said. ``Is elective politics in my future or not?''
</P>
<P>
   He will take his time to decide that question and determine
whether he wants to put himself and his family through another
rough-and-tumble campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbarger knows that the political dynamics will change in two
years. Moore will have a voting record to scrutinize, and more
Republicans will be going to the polls in a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   All of these things will be running through his mind, including
the belief that an ideologically fractured GOP can't win the
election for any candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He worries that Republicans, especially in populous Johnson
County, have concentrated so much on fighting each other they have
lost their focus on winning elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Republicans have forgotten is the 90 percent we all
believe in,'' he said. ``Now, the 10 percent we don't agree on is
getting in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting Tuesday of Republican precinct leaders, about 450
Republicans were asked to stand up if they were ready to unite
behind the new party leadership. Most did, but not everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That told me a lot about those people,'' he said of those who
refused to stand.
</P>
<P>
   He said the majority of Republicans who want to put the party
first must get active or deep divisions will only elect Moore for a
second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election was lost by the Republican Party in Johnson
County,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbarger said that when an issue-oriented group such as
Kansans for Life attempts to take over a major political party, the
issue becomes the focus and overall party goals get lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization becomes the prize,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Snowbarger said he didn't understand the power of the ``revenge
factor'' during the campaign. That would include moderate
Republicans getting revenge for his defeat of Overland Park Mayor
Ed Eilert in the campaign two years ago. It also would include
conservatives getting even after Snowbarger had refused to take
sides in David Miller's conservative revolt against Gov. Bill
Graves during the August GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you overcome that?'' Snowbarger asked.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a lot of conservative and moderate Republicans
who deserted him.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a large grass-roots organization went
door-to-door carrying Snowbarger's election message. This year was
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could never get a lit drop (literature distribution) off
the ground,'' said Kevin Yowell, Snowbarger's campaign manager.

   ``Monetary policy can prevent depressions,'' said Charles
Calomiris, an economics and finance professor at Columbia
University, ``and we have a Fed that is extremely attuned to those
kinds of threats.''
</P>
<P>
   One has to hope so. In a vicious deflation, assets like real
estate and stocks go into free fall. Very little is spared, and the
wreckage is magnified by the borrowing that companies and
individuals undertook to buy those assets, as collateral collapses
in value and margin calls on stocks mount.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's ugly deflation, you'll want to get out of stocks,''
said David Tice, who runs his own money management firm in Dallas.
He sees the United States facing sharp deflation _ a result of the
popping of a credit-induced bubble _ that could wipe out about half
the current value of the stock market, sending share prices to
levels last seen in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest losers, he said, would be shares of
credit-card companies and home-equity lenders, because people would
be unable to pay their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seeking an escape from the carnage would have little
recourse other than to squirrel away cash or invest in Treasury
bonds. As the world witnessed earlier this year, when investors
embrace quality, they hug Treasuries the hardest. ``This is an
asset class that would go up in price _ and up substantially,''
said William Gross, a managing director at the Pacific Investment
Management Co. in Newport Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Other types of bonds, like corporates and municipals, would be
riskier during steep deflation, Gross said. Though those, too,
would benefit as interest rates fell, there would be more defaults
as struggling companies or small municipalities could no longer
make their interest payments. Less liquid than Treasuries, and
without the backing of the federal government, these bonds might be
shunned by investors.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly Deflation: Time of Opportunity
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, bad deflation is less common than good, according
to A. Gary Shilling, an economist and investment strategist in
Springfield, N.J., who recently wrote a book on the subject,
``Deflation'' (Lakeview Publishing, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   The United States has not seen benevolent deflation since the
1920s, when the country was roaring as automobiles became
commonplace and many homes and factories received electrical
service for the first time. But there are modern examples like
Switzerland, where the stock market has posted average annual gains
of 19 percent over the last five years despite a bout with falling
prices prompted by the strength of the national currency.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of deflation, like that seen during the Industrial
Revolution, is marked by strong demand. Even when wages fall in
such an environment, prices fall faster. From 1870 to 1894, for
example, the real pay for nonfarm workers increased 29 percent,
Shilling said, though in dollars not adjusted for deflation, pay
fell 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rise of modern manufacturing in the last century, the
technological gains of today show signs of bringing the kind of
rapid increases in productivity that can lead to good deflation.
Advances in computing, telecommunications, biotechnology and other
fields have led to lower costs and improved productivity.
</P>
<P>
   And there are productivity gains in other sectors, too, Shilling
said, pointing to the efficiencies of mass-market retailers like
Wal-Mart and Home Depot. These companies have harnessed technology
to cut prices _ thereby exerting pressure on competitors to lower
their prices as well.
</P>
<P>
   Like Shilling, Paulsen of Norwest describes a world where more
and more products are like computers, steadily falling in price,
and where every business is forced to compete in the way technology
companies already do. Technology _ which Paulsen describes as this
country's leading industry _ ``was birthed under and lives under
massive deflation every year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shilling said companies like Microsoft, Intel and Cisco Systems
have learned to thrive by figuring out how to drive demand, making
rapid improvements to their technology and developing new markets.
</P>
<P>
   And just as companies were forced to innovate during the late
1800s, any innovator of today, like Pfizer in pharmaceuticals,
would be likely to prosper in deflationary times, according to
Gross of Pacific Investment Management. He says companies that
dominate their industries, like Microsoft in computer operating
systems, would also have an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Can Stocks Move Up If Other Prices Fall?
</P>
<P>
   The effects on investors from even mild deflation are the
subject of sharp disagreement. While strategists and economists
agree that a sudden swing from today's low inflation rates to
deflation _ a move of several percentage points _ would rattle
everyone, they are divided over how painful any transition would
be.
</P>
<P>
   Many strategists believe that stocks would suffer as corporate
profits weakened, at least initially, in a recession inspired by
incipient deflation. Even now, Southeast Asia's economic collapse
is hurting American companies that must compete with a flood of
inexpensive imports.
</P>
<P>
   But if the United States skirted a recession, stocks of
corporations that were trimmed to fighting form by the
restructuring of the last two decades might escape essentially
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies in the U.S. have been training for deflation for
almost 20 years,'' Paulsen said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing looks certain in this picture: As interest rates make
their way lower, Treasury bonds will be attractive. They may also
benefit from investor uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Francis, the head of global strategy for Putnam
Investments, said that if deflation became an issue, ``for better
or worse there will be a reflexive move into fixed-income, until
investors work through the calculus.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the severity of the deflation, and how calmly
investors reacted, other types of bonds might also be worth
considering.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone worried about taxes would think about owning high-quality
municipal bonds. High-quality corporates would also benefit from
lower interest rates.

 UNDATED: interest rates.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But for stocks and relatively risky bonds, like high-yield and
most corporate issues, there could be casualties even during
relatively mild deflation. The pain would be most notable among
companies that are used to being able to raise prices to cover
their mistakes, like taking on too much debt or holding too much
inventory. ``Inflation covers a multitude of sins,'' Shilling said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who want to prepare for deflation might want to avoid
companies with high labor or capital costs _ which become more
burdensome if there is pressure to reduce prices _ or companies
that have loaded up on debt.
</P>
<P>
   To protect profits in deflationary times, companies must either
cut costs or generate more sales. The primary goal for the majority
of businesses confronting deflation would be to gain market share,
whether by wresting it away from competitors or by acquiring weaker
companies. ``Top-line growth will be a huge issue,'' Paulsen said.
</P>
<P>
   The high-stress environment of deflation could favor large
companies, he added. Big companies have more leeway than small ones
to reduce their costs, he said, because they can invest in
technology to increase their productivity and can take better
advantage of economies of scale. Small companies have fared better
in times of inflation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some pockets of the economy are likely to remain
somewhat immune to deflation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who think deflation may be coming, whether devastating
or benevolent, should focus on industries ``where demand is very
stable and not terribly price-sensitive,'' said George Jacobsen,
chief investment officer at Trevor Stewart Burton &AMP; Jacobsen, a
money management firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to areas that investors have traditionally considered
safe from economic upheaval, like certain food and entertainment
businesses. Even so, he said, companies that depend on the strength
of their brands to let them charge higher prices than the
competition could be vulnerable. For example, Kellogg Co. is
already seeing its profits hurt because rivals are luring away
customers with lower-cost breakfast foods.
</P>
<P>
   Other areas that might withstand deflation include utilities,
though deregulation is making them face more competition; military
suppliers, which build profits into their contracts with the
government, and small companies that concentrate on narrow niches
where competition is limited, according to Diego Espinosa, a
portfolio manager at Scudder Kemper Investments.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for real estate, which has traditionally been
crushed by deflation, would be mixed if the United States fell into
a mild deflation sometime soon. Prices for commercial real estate
do not look as high now as in past economic upswings, according to
managers and strategists. Shopping malls and hotels could be hurt
if people felt more like saving their money than sprucing up their
wardrobes or going on vacations, but rental apartments could be in
greater demand if falling values made houses no longer look like
good investments, Shilling said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic History Isn't Always a Guide  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mild deflationary breezes, at least, are already wafting across
the U.S. economy, and some portfolio managers have their fingers to
the wind. At Bessemer Trust, for example, managers have shifted
money toward companies whose main market is the United States,
because they believe that consumers here will keep buying no matter
what. They have trimmed holdings in companies that sell many goods
or services in Southeast Asia, where the drought in demand is
likely to drag on.
</P>
<P>
   Money managers have also distinguished between companies that
benefit from cheaper raw materials, like apparel makers, and those,
including oil companies and steel makers, that continue to be hurt
by a fall in commodity prices and could be damaged further by a
potential rush of imports from foreign producers.
</P>
<P>
   And despite another interest-rate cut last week, intended to
loosen credit and keep the economy jumping, some professional
investors are pondering the prospect of an economic slowdown,
whether prompted by deflation or by increases in labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of thinking _ including the thinking about just how
serious a threat deflation is _ remains to be done. The past, of
course, is not necessarily prologue: What was seen in the United
States more than a century ago _ or in Japan or Switzerland today _
may bear very little resemblance to what happens here in the
future. Confronting the unknown, acknowledged Wien of Morgan
Stanley, money managers ``really don't know what to buy.''

 Gender bias remains widespread in Fire Department, report says  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY L. THOMAS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ One year after a federal jury found sexual
discrimination in the Kansas City Fire Department, prejudice
against women remains rampant in the department, according to a
document obtained by The Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found gender bias to be widespread,'' said a draft report
prepared by 9to5, National Association of Working Women, of
Milwaukee. The agency conducted sexual harassment and diversity
training for the Fire Department as part of a court order.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 15 percent (in the training sessions) responded that
no woman can do the job,'' the report said. ``The overwhelming
majority expressed concern about having a female loved one work in
the department, not only because of general safety issues, but
because of the way women are treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Emanuel Cleaver and Fire Chief Rick Brisbin declined to
comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, the document is a draft document, so there's
not going to be any comment until it's final,'' said Laurie
Spoon-Potter, Cleaver's spokeswoman. ``They (officials) could say
something that may affect the final outcome of the document.''
</P>
<P>
   However, minutes from the Oct. 30 firefighters union executive
board meeting indicate the board voted to accept nearly all
recommendations made by 9to5. Union officials did not return
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Among the report's recommendations to the Fire Department:
</P>
<P>
   Strong efforts should be made to root out the worst behavior and
make it clear that complaints found to have merit will result in
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The department should continue sensitivity training.
</P>
<P>
   The department should encourage more support for female
firefighters' issues.
</P>
<P>
   Follow-ups should take place with those who have experienced
harassment as well as those found to have participated in harassing
activity and those responsible for the employees affected.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary report was submitted to Fire Department
officials last month. This week, two of the female firefighters who
sued the department said that while the most blatant acts of sexual
harassment have subsided, the department continues to ignore the
needs of female firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, jurors heard testimony about strippers
performing at fire stations, female employees being fondled and
male firefighters watching X-rated videos while on duty.
</P>
<P>
   In February, U.S. District Judge Ortrie D. Smith ordered the
training after finding ``blatant and inexcusable'' episodes of
harassment in the department. At the time of Smith's order, Cleaver
said the city would comply. Meanwhile, the case is on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The 9to5 agency conducted the training in June and July. Those
in management were required to undergo six hours of training, and
others had four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was thrilled about attending the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the male participants were angry and apprehensive,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Some classes were hostile, and some groups had agreed ahead of
time not to speak, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a class in which no one responded to questions about what
would be examples of sexual conduct at work, the trainer asked one
man if he would mind if someone at work grabbed his wife's
breast,'' the report said. `` `I don't know,' '' he replied. `` `It
depends.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Other comments during the sessions, the report said, ``included
the view that a woman who is `unattractive' would never be
harassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Most female participants expressed concern about prevalent
gender bias, the report said. Few felt comfortable enough to speak
up in class, and some privately expressed anger that the men didn't
understand the seriousness of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women who felt they had experienced sexual harassment _
and husbands of women in this situation _ were outraged that for
all intents and purposes, no one had been charged with either
personal or organizational responsibility for the problems that
occurred,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that battalion chiefs were confused about
their roles. Many of the battalion chiefs, according to the report,
did not see themselves as responsible for guaranteeing a
discrimination-free environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the BCs _ including people who are very influential
with rank-and-file firefighters _ were extremely hostile about the
trainings and appeared to model the `Let's just not talk to women'
approach,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the women who filed the lawsuit that prompted the
training sessions said they were saddened, but not surprised, to
hear of the report's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty damning, and it's bluntly honest,'' said Battalion
Chief Anne Wedow.
</P>
<P>
   Wedow said she was concerned that those in management hadn't
taken steps to address the problems outlined in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has yet been disciplined for the harassment that's been
documented,'' she said. ``And they've shown no interest in
compiling or gathering information from the women in the department
to find out what's going on and what they need and what they can do
to help. All there's been is stone silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Wedow said that female firefighters' needs are still being
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 30, she said, she sent a letter to a top department
official saying that two female firefighters in her district needed
harnesses on their self-contained breathing apparatuses altered so
they would fit properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have yet to get a response,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, Wedow said, a battalion chief sent an e-mail to
the same official on Nov. 6 asking for more golf shirts for the
battalion chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   The battalion chief's e-mail got a response four days later.
</P>
<P>
   Wedow did say blatant sexual harassment in the department had
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say that the things of a sexual nature, like
being called names and pictures of naked women plastered all over
the place, are gone,'' she said. ``But the lack of respect and
consideration are still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Battalion Chief Kathleen Kline, another plaintiff in the
lawsuit, said her experiences have been similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That lawsuit didn't open any eyes,'' Kline said. ``They didn't
get a clue. Management hasn't done its job yet in getting the
message across.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the judge issued his order, at least two steps have been
taken to deal with the concerns, according to Fire Department
memos.
</P>
<P>
   Battalion chiefs are required to inspect their stations for
sexually offensive or inappropriate materials, then report their
findings monthly to their supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   And since April, the department has been receiving monthly
reports from American Cablevision that list all pay-per-view movies
and entertainment purchased in Fire Department buildings.
</P>
<P>
   If the reports reveal viewing of programs of an adult nature,
Brisbin said in a March 4 memo, the cable services for the
offending station would be removed and disciplinary action would be
taken.

 Call it highway robbery  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Those professing shock at revelations of Missouri's
botched highway construction plan must be shocked only in the sense
that the Claude Rains character was shocked to discover gambling at
Bogie's boite in ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   State transportation officials recently acknowledged that
revenue from the gasoline tax increase levied to do the job
wouldn't be enough to complete all the promised projects.
Therefore, the plan will be scaled back to fit updated cost and
revenue estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The miscalculations amount to billions of dollars, and a
Department of Transportation analysis acknowledges that the 15-year
plan ``was $1.4 billion in the red from its very inception.''
Another astounding revelation is that planners assumed inflation
``would be zero.''
</P>
<P>
   This strains credulity beyond the breaking point. The last time
zero inflation occurred in the United States was 1954-55, when the
Consumer Price Index actually declined 0.1 percent. Since then the
index is up nearly 500 percent. Even during the 1990s, a time of
relatively low inflation, the annual inflation rate has averaged
over 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   How do otherwise intelligent people plot a long-term
construction program costing billions of dollars and ignore the
inevitability of inflation? There is growing suspicion that
political flimflammery was at work.
</P>
<P>
   The gas tax increase, it's reasoned, was sold by its supporters
on promises of widespread benefits that couldn't be achieved
without a larger tax increase than was proposed. The magnitude of
the tax increase, however, was kept lower than needed to make it
politically palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone disappointed to discover that the details were too
devilish to overcome hasn't been paying attention. Tax increases
are frequently sold on the basis of unrealistic promises. This is
probably more so at the state and local level, where voters and
politicians work in closer proximity.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever government is involved in raising and spending money,
unpleasant surprises are more apt to happen than in the private
sector. Why? The discipline is never as stringent as when
bottom-line considerations are in play. When a business proposes a
plan, those providing the money make sure all the decimal points
are in the right place and contingencies such as inflation are
factored into the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Pols and bureaucrats don't usually feel as beholden to taxpayers
as business execs feel to their financial backers. Thus, government
types often make things up as they go along. When plans don't work
out, well, no big deal. Life goes on, careers are unaffected,
taxpaying voters forget.
</P>
<P>
   The insouciant nature of the news release explaining it all was
sometimes matter-of-fact to a fault. In some instances, the
official being quoted could just as well have been informing
whoever was interested of a change in the menu at the employee
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   My reaction when Missouri revealed its intention to increase gas
taxes to finance this colossal pork package was a vow to never
again buy gas in the state unless it was a matter of not having
enough petrol to make it to the state line. That promise has pretty
much been kept.
</P>
<P>
   If you think about it, the real shock would have been if the tax
increase had been enough to pay for all the road improvements the
plan's proponents promised. &QL;

<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ If ever an academic department was hot, it was
the English department at Duke University in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, when it was famously reinventing itself. Recruiting
star professors, it bounded up the national rankings and became for
a time the capital of cutting-edge literary studies as well as many
a conservative's favorite example of academic excess.
</P>
<P>
   The department's biggest names included Stanley Fish, its
flamboyant chairman; Frank Lentricchia, whom The Village Voice once
called ``the Dirty Harry of contemporary critical theory;'' Eve
Kosovsky Sedgwick, co-founder of the growing academic field of
``queer theory,'' and, fleetingly, Henry Louis Gates Jr., now the
ubiquitous chairman of Afro-American studies at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past year, the department has appeared to be
self-destructing. Professors have been at war with each other. Many
of the best-known have left. When an external review team paid a
routine two-day visit last spring, it reported having found the
department ``without anything we would be disposed to describe as
an undergraduate or graduate curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the university has placed the department in something
resembling receivership, overseen by an executive committee (headed
by a dean from the botany department who is an authority on plant
respiration). The committee is overseeing the search for a new
department chairman and the first of perhaps a half-dozen new
professors to replace the ones who have left.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the department can come up with three to six excellent
hires, that will signal to the rest of the academic community that
this enterprise is still in business and at the same high level,''
said Fish, now white-haired and 60, who is preparing to leave Duke
next month to become a dean at the University of Illinois in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we blow it _ and I don't know why we would, but if we were
to blow it _ then after about a year or two another word will
settle in. And this will be the word that, `Well, that was nice
while it lasted but it's over.'''
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval at Duke offers a glimpse into the arcane world of
an academic department, one in which the ideological, generational
and personality differences of its 40 members became the dividing
lines in bitter skirmishes over hiring and tenure, graduate-student
admissions and the distribution of departmental tasks and perks.
</P>
<P>
   As some professors see it, the story is a cautionary tale for
universities hoping to emulate Duke's success in building a
national reputation by strategically hiring star scholars; they say
the department's problems stem in part from resentments that took
root after celebrated outsiders never became fully integrated into
departmental life.
</P>
<P>
   But Duke's difficulties also reflect tensions in English
departments nationwide at a time when many have been struggling to
redefine their mission. Where most once agreed that their primary
role was the passing down of an agreed upon heritage of classic
literary texts, that rationale has been challenged in recent
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the postmodern world, some of those working within
literature are using literature as an instrument to try to affect
social change,'' said James Applewhite, a 63-year-old poet and
English professor at Duke. ``I think the problem of our department
was, in the new era, once literature becomes politics, then
politics is a matter of contention rather than consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, five full professors, including Fish and Ms. Sedgwick, are
leaving or have left Duke. In addition, Lentricchia has switched
departments; another English professor has become a vice provost.
Their reasons for defecting vary, but they include the dissension
within the department, unhappiness with its leadership and
opportunities elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the department quite an unpleasant place by the time I
left,'' said Ms. Sedgwick, who said she had moved to New York City
in part to be nearer her husband after learning that she was
experiencing a recurrence of an old cancer. ``I would say
two-thirds of the decision had to do with my loss of respect for
the department I was in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the announcements, the review team arrived for
the department's five-year check-up. Four English professors from
other major research universities spent several days meeting with
members of the department who, said Cathy Davidson, a Duke English
professor, used the occasion ``almost as a confessional and went in
and just sort of evacuated.''
</P>
<P>
   In late May, the team delivered its findings in a confidential
report (leaked posthaste to a student newspaper). The department
was ``in a seriously weakened condition,'' the group wrote. Morale
was ``desperately low.'' Dislike for the chairman, Marianna
Torgovnick, a protege of Fish, was pervasive; some professors
wanted her term cut short ``at whatever emotional and professional
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not to say that the department lacks excellent
faculty,'' the report said. ``But the current department, except by
virtue of its afterglow, cannot reasonably be considered
top-ranked.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early 1980s, the Duke department was a traditional
sort of place. Its members were mostly men, mostly white, mostly
getting on in years: interpreters of literary figures, writers on
esthetic themes, relatively untouched by the intellectual trends
transforming their field. The department seemed in danger of
becoming an old boys' club.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to raise Duke's profile, the university administration
decided to build up the English department. In 1984, it lured
Lentricchia away from Rice University. At his suggestion, it
recruited Fish from Johns Hopkins to head the English department
and Fredric Jameson, the Marxist critic and literary theorist, to
run the program in literature.
</P>
<P>
   They in turn recruited more stars: Barbara Herrnstein Smith, who
was about to become president of the Modern Language Association;
Janice Radway, who had recently studied the romance-novel genre;
then Ms. Davidson, Ms. Sedgwick and Gates, along with Lee Patterson
and his wife, Annabel Patterson, both now at Yale. Ms. Sedgwick is
a pioneer in ``queer theory,'' an approach to literature that goes
into the study of sexuality and refuses to divide the world neatly
into homosexual and heterosexual.

 DURHAM, N.C.: and heterosexual. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly, the department was seen as a hotbed of literary
theory. In the area of gender and literature, U.S. News and World
Report would eventually rank the graduate program first in the
country. Graduate student applications increased four-fold between
1985 and 1991. The department vaulted upward in the National
Research Council rankings, from 27th in the country to 5th. (And
certain attributes of Fish found their way into the work of his
friend, David Lodge, the author of several novels satirizing
academic life.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, an external review team reported with admiration: ``We
were struck by the chorus of testimony we heard from faculty
outside the department that English has become a kind of engine or
life-pump for the humanities at Duke, a supplier of intellectual
energy and stimulation for the university at large. It is not easy
to produce changes of this sort.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit is widely given to Fish. In six years as chairman, Fish
kept the university's resources focused on the department, acquired
for it prime office space in the Gothic building that houses the
president's office, and presided over what one administrator called
``a high-maintenance bunch of people, let me tell you'' with such
apparent impartiality that even potential enemies came to believe
he had the department's best interests at heart.
</P>
<P>
   His style was not, however, notably democratic. He is said to
have abolished the department's bylaws. (As he tells it, there were
no bylaws when he arrived; he simply swept away rules that were
making people unhappy.) His preferred leadership method was working
the halls. Asked when he was going to hold a meeting, he answered,
``When there are no more issues.''
</P>
<P>
   There were always more issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in some ways a classical pitched field of postmodern
versus more traditional types of scholars and critics,'' said
Reynolds Price, the novelist and a member of the department since
1958. ``The general good will that Stanley inspired made those
differences seem a good deal less important than they turned out to
be when Stanley wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   The strain became increasingly apparent in the years after Fish
stepped down as chairman in 1992. Camps and cliques took shape. The
various factions were shifting and difficult to define, but many
believe they were determined, at least in part, by degrees of
enthusiasm, or lack of it, for such areas of study as gender and
sexuality, African-American studies and theory.
</P>
<P>
   To some, like Lentricchia, the department had become dominated
by ideologues who measured the quality of one's scholarship by
whether it was ideologically correct. To others, there appeared to
be, as Ms. Sedgwick put it, ``a whole group of faculty who really
felt that the department was too theoretical, too queer, too
African-American.''
</P>
<P>
   Open warfare broke out over such things as hiring, promotions,
graduate student admissions and issues like which faculty members
had money to bring in outside speakers. There were also longer-term
resentments about teaching-load disparities and a perception that
some stars bore little of the administrative burden.
</P>
<P>
   The antagonisms became especially bitter after Ms. Torgovnick
took over in 1996 and, her critics say, adopted Fish's
authoritarian style without his charm. They accuse her of having
favored her friends, manipulated meetings, even doctored minutes _
all charges she denies. People in every camp ended up feeling like
members of an embattled minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that all the problems are solely the result of
her mismanagement,'' said Michael Valdez Moses, a 41-year-old
associate professor who describes his field of specialization as
Anglophone post-colonial literatures. ``But it's certainly the case
that she made what would be by any stretch of the imagination a
difficult situation into an impossible, particularly ugly one.''
</P>
<P>
   What kind of department will emerge is unclear. The curriculum
may become somewhat more structured than in the past. But many in
the department are skeptical that the curriculum is really a
problem, since the Duke department is more successful than most in
landing graduate students in scarce academic jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Many are equally dubious about the review committee's complaint
that they lack an ``overarching departmental mission,'' a vision of
what the department wants to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   `If there is an English, French or literature department in the
country that has found the new sense of mission and given it a good
formulation, it has a very marketable product because lots of other
departments would want to buy the kit,'' Fish said. ``But I don't
myself know of any. So the lack of clear mission is a feature, I
believe, now of the profession and not just this department.''

JUDGE SAYS BILL GATES IS UNRESPONSIVE WITNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST)  
(lb) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, is
serving as an effective witness for his company at the government's
antitrust trial, it is hard to find anyone other than Microsoft
employees who hold that view.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Thomas Penfield Jackson, the U.S. district judge
who is judge and jury in the case, told lawyers for both sides that
``it's evident to every spectator that for whatever reasons, in
many respects Mr. Gates has not been particularly responsive to his
deposition interrogation.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Microsoft's lawyers at a closed hearing, Jackson
noted that even ``everyone at your table has reflected skepticism
as the testimony is presented.'' A transcript of the discussion was
made public late that night.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers interviewed Gates for 20 hours in August, and
they have been playing parts of this deposition in court over the
last three weeks. In the tapes, Gates appears to recall little if
anything about the subjects in dispute at the trial. He pauses for
30 seconds or longer before answering many questions and argues
with the government about the meaning of even the most common
words, like ``compete,'' ``ask'' and ``market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Experienced trial lawyers who are not involved in this case say
witnesses like Gates can harm a company's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where a case goes to trial, the credibility of a witness can
be strongly and successfully attacked if he couldn't remember
significant events at his deposition that any reasonable person
would have remembered,'' said Gary Naftalis, a partner in the firm
Kramer, Levin, Naftalis &AMP; Frankel in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesmen contend that Gates testified just as
witnesses should in adversarial circumstances. The company even
hired Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney, as a legal
consultant and spokesman. And after the last playing of a Gates
tape segment, diGenova told reporters that the Gates performance
was typical.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had struggled mightily to prevent the playing of the
tape. Thursday's closed conference with Jackson came as a result of
a request by Microsoft's lead lawyer, John Warden, that the
government play the whole tape at once, not just the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson rejected the request, saying: ``If anything, I think the
problem is with your witness, not the way in which his testimony is
being presented.''

 Starr crosses no lines of impropriety  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Mr. Chairman, members, I revere the law.''
</P>
<P>
   So said independent counsel Kenneth Starr on Thursday, as he
closed his two-hour recitation of the history of his investigation
into President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Kenneth Starr, the sober former jurist, the bookish
boy from a small town in Texas who was raised on Bible verses, who
testified before the House Judiciary Committee as it considers the
impeachment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the Ken Starr who sent to Congress a report that,
apart from its legal allegations about Clinton, was the kind of
reading usually associated with literature sold at dingy newsstands
in plain brown wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   No sex, no cigars; not even a hint of salaciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Starr littered his 58-page statement with the word
``truth'' about three dozen times. He referred to the president's
``oath to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth,'' almost half a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for your very passionate defense of the rule of
law,'' said Rep. Robert Inglis, a South Carolina Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were not as receptive. But from the start, the House
inquiry has been a partisan buzzsaw, and Thursday's session, the
first impeachment hearing in more than two decades, was just more
grist for the political mill.
</P>
<P>
   History gets made every day in Washington in ways big and small.
But rarely does it occur with the kind of clamor and warfare that
has surrounded the investigation of President Clinton. It has
cemented government-by-scandal permanently into the capital's
bedrock.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican,
through both light humor and outright pleas, tried to keep the
divisiveness in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hearing is not a trial,'' he said, ``nor is it the White
House versus Ken Starr, nor is it Republicans versus Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Republicans and Democrats so sharply split, Starr's
testimony seemed to do little more than inflame their own
convictions about propriety of his investigation into Clinton's
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   And while it was, indeed, historic _ ``We feel we've been part
of history, whichever way it goes,'' said Norma Shirley, a tourist
from Sedona, Ariz. _ there seemed to be little doubt about the
outcome. Since the November election, when Republicans lost seats
in the House, the general view on Capitol Hill has been that the
president will probably not be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   The swiftly changing atmosphere led Republicans like Rep. Asa
Hutchinson of Arkansas to begin to scale down their goals. ``I've
always believed it was important to have a factual record,'' he
said of Starr's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   No one even considered the notion that Starr would change
anyone's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't think, all of sudden, the ones who want (Clinton's)
head will think for a minute, `Oh my God, Starr did bad things. Let
this guy off,' '' Rep. Howard Berman, a California Democrat, joked
during a recess. Berman has been one of several members from both
parties trying to craft a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was yet another moment of high drama in a story that
has been in equal measures potboiler and constitutional crisis. And
it continues to play out to a public that is weary of the entire
episode and that wants Congress to drop the curtain quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it seemed entirely appropriate that before the lights go out
_ and Hyde again said that he hoped to conclude ``before the new
year turns'' _ that one of the main actors have his turn in the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The president, after all, gave a nationwide speech in August
that was somewhat of an apology, then his grand jury appearance was
broadcast worldwide. And it's been reported that Lewinsky will soon
give a televised interview.
</P>
<P>
   By all reports, Starr prepared meticulously for his moment,
spending hours being grilled by his prosecutors in mock committee
forums.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an easy setting for him,'' said a former Starr
associate. ``It's very partisan and prone to speeches, rather than
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the questions committee members ask often were buried
beneath personal opinion and political spin.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr was at all times patient and courtly. He was the last
to enter the hearing room, a vast chamber of polished wood and blue
velvet, decorated with gold stars and massive American eagle.
</P>
<P>
   For hour after hour, he sat alone at a table in his gray suit,
facing the committee and the president's lawyers to his right. A
battery of aides and prosecutors sat behind him.
</P>
<P>
   For Starr, a prosecutor now nearly as embattled as his quarry,
the hearing was a chance to defend his work and perhaps repair his
public reputation _ once that of a thoughtful solicitor general.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sensitive to the criticisms that he overstepped his
authority and employed roughshod tactics in his pursuit of the
president, he repeatedly invoked the work of his staff, which he
said was composed of experienced prosecutors, former U.S.
attorneys, FBI investigators and academic and legal experts.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also his moment to try to show that he is not the
overzealous, right-wing Cotton Mather that the White House and
other Clinton supporters have portrayed him to be. He entered the
hearing room with a dismal 18 percent approval rating in a recent
public poll.
</P>
<P>
   He took pains early on to emphasize that his September report,
an instant bestseller on the Internet, ``never suggests that the
relationship between the president and Ms. Lewinsky in and of
itself could be a high crime or misdemeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Starr said, it is about ``obstruction of justice, lying
under oath, tampering with witnesses and the misuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that it was Congress' decision, not his, to
release the report to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Starr made his remarks in affable tones that seemed both
instructive and open to disagreement. When he replied to one
congressman's question, ``and you may disagree with me'' _ it was
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, however, Starr showed his anger during White House
attorney David Kendall's sharp questioning late in the day about
his conduct and that of his staff. Confronted with a statement
attributed to William Ginsburg, Lewinsky's first lawyer, Starr
jabbed his finger and criticized the flamboyant Ginsberg as
``rather fast and loose with the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kendall was going to use a news magazine interview with
Ginsberg, Starr said primly, then hearing standards ``are not quite
as lofty as I thought they would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Starr had all the earnestness of a schoolboy who knows
his homework cold, and the soft-spokenness of a Sunday school
teacher explaining the parables. And when he detailed the
president's alleged transgressions, he sounded distressed, almost
sad, as if he felt personally betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when he explained his own motivations, Starr said, ``I
am not a man of politics, of public relations or of polls. My
beliefs have instilled in me a deep respect for the legal process
that is at the foundation of our republic. I am proud of what we
have accomplished.''

LAWMAKER WITHDRAWS PROPOSAL REQUIRING VISION TESTS FOR ELDERLY
DRIVERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Deluged by unfavorable public criticism, a Texas
lawmaker Friday took the unusual step of withdrawing draft
legislation that would have required behind-the-wheel and vision
testing of drivers age 75 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tony Goolsby, R-Dallas, had filed the measure Nov. 9 _ the
first day for lawmakers to submit legislation for the session that
begins Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks since then, the proposal has been reviled
around the state as an affront to elderly Texans. Some
commentators, columnists and radio talk-show callers have claimed
that instead of hassling older drivers, the state should be testing
teen-agers who no longer are required to take a Texas Department of
Public Safety-supervised driving test after they complete driver's
education.
</P>
<P>
   Goolsby's bill would have mandated the expiration of all
drivers' licenses on their 75th birthdays. If renewed, the license
would have expired again every three years until the driver turned
81. At that age, renewal would have been required every two years
until age 87. And after age 87, annual renewal would have been
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``After discussing this issue with constituents in my district
and representatives of the American Association of Retired People
(AARP), I believe the approach taken in my draft legislation would
impose an unfair burden on older drivers,'' Goolsby said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was never my intention,'' he said, adding that he intends
``to continue to work with AARP and other interested groups to
determine whether there are better ways to improve safety on Texas
roads for all drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   The association has opposed similar proposals in other states,
claiming they were unfairly penalizing all elderly people because
of the problems of a minority of older drivers.

WHOSE ``RULES''? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 22, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Tom Wolfe's rollicking novel about modern times in Atlanta,
``A Man in Full,'' the real estate developer hero goes broke after
reading Joel Garreau's book ``Edge Cities'' and believing it.
</P>
<P>
   Aficionados of good journalism will remember Washington Post
reporter Garreau's 1992 book as a particularily fine piece of
reporting. It caught at full flood the surge in the growth of
satellite cities situated along the ring roads of major
metropolitan areas _ a phenomenon of rapidly falling communications
costs and the rent gradient.
</P>
<P>
   But fans will also recognize the problem inherent in all such
journalism based on the discovery of a trend: the form lends itself
to overstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Croker, Wolfe's hero, might not have gone broke if he'd
read ``Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network
Economy,'' by Carl Shapiro and Hal R. Varian.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, hardly a week has passed without some bright
new book fetching up on my desk promising to explain some aspect of
the business dynamics of the new age of information. The most
recent to arrive _ and perhaps the foremost exemplar of the trend _
is Kevin Kelly's ``New Rules for a New Economy: 10 Radical
Strategies for a Connected World.''
</P>
<P>
   This book-length version of a celebrated article by the
executive editor of Wired magazine urges its readers to forget
supply and demand and learn the new economics of the Internet
instead. The atom is passe, says Kelly; the network is the icon of
the new age. ``A good definition of a network is organic behavior
in a technological matrix,'' he writes. Sheer poetry!
</P>
<P>
   In all this stack of books on managing knowledge, intellectual
capital, the ecology of information and the like, the single volume
most worth reading _ and, for many persons having, for it bears
consulting again and again _ is ``Information Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   A word of background. Shapiro and Varian are professors at the
University of California at Berkeley. Shapiro served for a time in
Washington as deputy assistant attorney general for economics.
Varian is dean of Berkeley's School of Information Management and
Systems, an expert on Internet economics and the author of a
leading microeconomics text as well.
</P>
<P>
   As they increasingly were drawn into the policy battles of the
information age, Shapiro and Varian heard the constant refrain from
entrepreneurs, consultants, and journalists: the old rules had been
broken; a new set of principles were required to guide business
strategy and public policy.
</P>
<P>
   They write in their introduction: ``But wait, we said. Have you
read the literature on differential pricing, bundling, signalling,
licensing, lock-in, or network economics? Have you studied the
history of the telephone system or the battles between IBM and the
Justice department?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our claim: You don't need a brand-new economics. You just need
to see the really cool stuff, the material they didn't get to when
you studied economics.'' And so they wrote their book.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over incompatible standards, for example, is as old
as North vs. South in railroad track gauges; between Edison and
Westinghouse in electricity. True, the old story had been given
some new twists, by Sony vs. Matsushita in videotape players, or
3Com vs. Rockwell and Lucent in modems. The jury is still out on
DVD and Divx (both of which play CDs). But same as it ever was,
standards wars still may end in truce, as with modems; in duopoly,
as with video games; or in annihilation of one of the parties, as
with videotape players.
</P>
<P>
   The keys to the analysis of networks are the twin concepts of
positive feedback and network externalities, say Shapiro and
Varian. Neither one is a recent arrival. Network externalities _
when the value of a product to one user depends on how many other
users there are _ have long been recognized as the keys to
transportation and communications industries.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a handful of telephones will have only limited
value. Then positive feedback sets in: as the installed base of
telephones grows, more and more users find it worthwhile to tap
into the network. Eventually growth levels off, but only after a
successful technology has taken over the market. Railroads,
highways, electricity grids, television, e-mail: all obey the same
basic principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information Rules'' has something to say about nearly every
aspect of today's business terrain; it is hard to exaggerate how
pervasive is the logic of positive feedback. Among the most
interesting chapters are those on recognizing and managing
``lock-in,'' the widepread situation in which choices today are
hemmed in by selections made in the past. The cost of abandoning
your Toyota for a Ford may not be great, but just try switching
from a Macintosh to a Windows PC _ without an extensive tutorial.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Savvy marketers, moreover, are trying to raise the switching
costs to their customer base, and not just through tricks of
engineering, training, and design. Frequent flyer miles are an
especially successful devise for increasing lock-in, a subtle form
of volume discount. Consumer loyalty programs are proliferating
everyday as computation power creates ``synthetic frictions,''
little barriers designed to influence your choice. Those
supermarket cards, for example, that gain you sale prices, in
return for the windfall of information about your tastes that store
owners receive are a prime example.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding virtue of ``Information Rules'' is that it is
clearly written but deeply grounded in a sense-making discipline
that has evolved over a couple hundred years. If you want to know
more about the whys and wherefores of ``Goldilocks'' pricing _ you
are referred to a paper by Itamar Simonson and Amos Tversy (and to
the three sizes of peanut butter in your supermarket!). Got a
question about the virtues of standardization through committees
vs. the market? See the recent work by Joe Farrell and Garth
Saloner.
</P>
<P>
   Economics isn't perfect _ far from it. But it has raced ahead in
the last 25 years in topics of the greatest concern in industrial
organization. This book is the best available introduction to the
nuts and bolts of new learning.

   Sex at a molecular level is spawning an elite class of proteins.
Maxygen, a company in Santa Clara, Calif., has used a DNA shuffling
technique to create interferons that are dramatically more
effective against viruses than any produced naturally by the immune
system. It has also made ultra-efficient versions of an industrial
enzyme.
</P>
<P>
   When organisms reproduce sexually, the offspring end up with a
mix-and-match set of genes inherited from both parents. Maxygen's
technique is similar, except the parents are a series of related
genes. These are cut into pieces, shuffled together and then
assembled to form a new genetic generation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these daughter genes can manufacture proteins that are
much better at certain tasks than nature's originals. The best ones
can be screened out and shuffled to produce whole lineages of
superior descendants, in a process mimicking evolution by natural
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Maxygen's technique was described earlier this year in Nature
(vol. 391, p. 288). Now its potential is beginning to be realized.
The parent genes are first broken into fragments by shattering
their DNA with ultrasound, or cutting them up with an enzyme called
DNAse. They are reassembled into daughter genes, comprising
fragments from several parents, using a variant of the DNA-building
polymerase chain reaction. Short template or ``primer'' sequences
ensure that the fragments are stitched together in the correct
order to produce a functioning gene. The daughter genes can then be
inserted into bacteria or fungi, where they begin making protein.
</P>
<P>
   To make superior versions of an industrial enzyme, the identity
of which is still secret, Maxygen's scientists isolated genes from
26 microorganisms which each make their own versions of the enzyme.
Using its system of DNA shuffling, Maxygen made 600 new daughter
genes, 77 of which produced superior enzymes. Screening showed up
variants which functioned better than natural enzymes at high, low
or intermediate pH. Others were more resistant to solvents or heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all highly significant commercially,'' says Pim
Stemmer, Maxygen's vice-president of research.
</P>
<P>
   Maxygen has also shuffled genes that make the 20 known human
interferons. This time they made 2,000 daughter genes _ and once
again, the results were spectacular. The best interferon produced
by the genes was 285,000 times as potent as interferon alpha-2b,
which is marketed as a drug, as measured by its ability to protect
cultured cells against a mouse virus.
</P>
<P>
   It could prove a major moneyspinner for Maxygen. Sales of
interferon alpha-2b, which is used to treat viral diseases and
cancer, pull in $600 million each year for Schering-Plough of
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   At present the most popular method of coaxing genes into making
new versions of proteins is random mutagenesis, in which
ultraviolet light or a DNA-disrupting chemical makes genes mutate.
But most of these mutations are damaging, with typically only 1
percent yielding genes that make improved proteins. By comparison,
13 percent of the enzymes Maxygen produced through DNA shuffling
were superior.
</P>
<P>
   ``DNA shuffling is a very powerful technology,'' says Andy
Ellington of the University of Texas at Austin, who is currently
comparing the technique with random mutagenesis.
</P>
<P>
   It is not even necessary to know the identity of all the genes
which might profitably be ``mated'' with one another, Stemmer says.
Fragments of DNA from a known gene can be used to trawl genomes of
other species for related genes. &QL;

TEXAS CHALLENGES LEGAL SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not an attorney _ although I do play one when I sit in front
of my computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   There are several computer programs that allow users to print
out legal documents with the blanks filled in for buyers and
sellers, landlords and tenants, plaintiffs and defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Bar Association has mounted a legal challenge against
them because Texas law prohibiting the practice of law without a
license also applies to publishing companies as well as
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   But that should be of little concern to home users, particularly
those in other states. Simple legal documents are available in
office supply stores, and courts have held they're protected as a
freedom of speech issue.
</P>
<P>
   The main concern users should have is that legal documents are
sometimes challenged in court. Make sure you have the confidence
that the documents produced by the software are capable of
withstanding such a test. For everyday situations, the end product
will work fine.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken Business Law Partner 4.0 from Parsons Technology is the
newest release in an ever-growing field of legal software. It
contains more than 100 customized documents for small business,
including worksheets, forms and letters covering a variety of
situations: employment, consumer issues, credit, real estate and
other matters.
</P>
<P>
   It also contains a dozen new government forms, an interview
process to determine what forms are needed, password protection for
documents, and a spellchecker.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Forbes' guide for buyers
</P>
<P>
   Looking to purchase a computer? Forbes' Small-Business
Home-Office Technology Buyers' Guide for the fall offers glimpses
and advice on desktops, notebooks, monitors, modems, printers,
copiers, scanners, multifunction scanners, fax machines and
networking.
</P>
<P>
   It discusses operating systems and office suites. The magazine,
a supplement to Forbes' regular publication, is aimed mainly at
small business, but it does contain some advice for the home user
trying to decide between a Windows/Intel based computer and Apple's
Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   The brief article notes that Apple has made a comeback recently
under the re-established leadership of company founder Steve Jobs,
and it says that ``if everyone else at your company or in your line
of work is still using a Mac, it probably still makes sense for you
to own one, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's about as good as the article gets for the case of
buying an Apple. It goes on to point out that for general
customers, ``the picture is more mixed. Some home users may still
find Apple's vaulted ease of use attractive, but this advantage is
more than outweighed by the fact that fewer and fewer software
programs are being written for the Mac. This could change following
the launch of Apple's next-generation Mac operating system late
next year. In the meantime, however, most consumers should opt for
the safer, if more conventional, PC.''

 QABATIYA: biggest need.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Hebron, Arafat was giving his approval to the
altered maps, which contained tiny changes but turned over the same
amount of land: 2 percent of the West Bank to joint
Palestinian-Israeli control, and 7 percent to full Palestinian
control. There are 28 towns and villages, with Qabatiya the
largest, in the mostly rural area; in 10, Palestinian police
stations were opened Friday.
</P>
<P>
   No Israeli army bases were moved in this first redeployment and
no roads leading to and from Jewish settlements fell into
Palestinian hands. Two small settlements, about 50 families each,
will become enclaves surrounded by Palestinian-controlled land.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the second and third withdrawals are complete, the
Palestinians will have control of 40 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, at several military checkpoints between Israel
and the Palestinian territories, the prisoners were set free.
Palestinian officials were upset by the large number of common
criminals, rather than political prisoners, released. At the Nahal
Oz checkpoint in Gaza, an Israeli police officer told reporters,
``You'd better lock your cars because they're all car thieves,''
Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   There were none of the customary hero's welcomes of Palestinian
prisoners released by the Israelis, and many mothers of political
prisoners whose sons were not released were left sobbing at the
border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Abu Rab, a distant relative of the sweets shop owner, was
quietly released from an Israeli jail in Mejiddo very late Thursday
night, and made his way to his home in Qabatiyaslot. A former
leader of a militant group that called itself the Black Panthers,
he was one of five members of the Palestinian security services who
were freed from jail by the Israelis in a last-minute concession to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had confidence that the Palestinians never forget their
political detainees, but when they tapped me on the shoulder last
night I was very surprised,'' he said Friday, surrounded by fellow
Black Panthers, who were shooting their guns in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Rab had been imprisoned after holding an Israeli soldier
hostage in what he considered a political act. Asked if his days of
kidnapping Israelis were over, he said, ``I hope we will not be
obliged to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   A surge of euphoria swept the town during the police parade. The
Mayor, Muhammad Ibrahim Abu Rab, offering orange drinks and
bon-bons to a who's who of Palestinian officials at City Hall,
pronounced his town ``sovereign.'' In the streets, some older women
sang and ululated. But the celebration quieted quickly, and there
were those who voiced doubts that life would change enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot deny that things will be better, '' said Najeeb
Mohammed Abu al-Rab, 70. ``The Palestinian police will not knock on
our door at midnight, looking for someone to arrest. But under the
Israelis we were workers. And under the Palestinians we will still
be workers. When we wake up tomorrow morning, will our life really
be that different?''

<P>
   Cesarean babies may be more susceptible to schizophrenia than
children born naturally, say Canadian researchers who studied the
effects of the operation on rats. The finding raises doubts about
the increasing number of Cesarean sections performed for
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Boksa and Bassem El-Khodor of McGill University in
Montreal gave pregnant rats general anesthetics and delivered their
young by Cesarean section. The operations were uncomplicated, and
the rat pups appeared normal at birth. But they grew into adults
with marked differences compared with controls born naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our surprise, we kept finding dopamine system
differences,'' Boksa says. When the Cesarean rats were given
amphetamines, for instance, drugs that activate the dopamine system
in the brain, they became far more active than the other group, the
researchers told last week's meeting. The Cesarean rats also had a
far worse response to repeated tail pinching, a standard test for
stress reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The results hint that babies born by Cesarean may be more
vulnerable to schizophrenia, which is thought to involve an
overactive dopamine system and has a statistical link with birth
complications.
</P>
<P>
   But no one knows why a Cesarean birth might increase the risk of
developing the illness. Boksa thinks the absence of hormonal surges
when a baby is born naturally may play a role, because these may be
important for brain development. Boksa says we need more evidence
about the operation's effects. ``I would question the Cesarean
section of convenience,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of discussion about complications precipitating
schizophrenia in genetically vulnerable people,'' says Barbara Fish
of the University of California at Los Angeles, who studies the
effects of difficult births. But she cautions that it is difficult
to draw conclusions from the studies when many environmental
factors are involved. &QL;

<P>
   Annoyed by the clutter of mice and keyboards on his desk, a
researcher at the Sony Computer Science Laboratories in Tokyo has
devised a quick and easy way to move files from one computer to
another without touching either a mouse or a keyboard. Instead, he
uses a penlike device to ``lift'' a file icon off one computer
screen and transfer it to another. The file itself is then
automatically transferred between the two computers over a network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first thought of this when I was using three computers on my
desk at the same time,'' says the researcher, Jun Rekimoto. ``There
were three different mice on the desk, and I kept getting confused
as to which mouse went with which screen.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer he's come up with, called pick-and-drop technology,
is designed for a future generation of computers that will use the
interactive screens now common on palmtops, which allow users to
write on them with a pressure-sensitive pen.
</P>
<P>
   The pen-and-screen combination used by Sony is a commercial
product made by Japanese company Wacom. Behind the screen is a
low-power radio transmitter linked to a microprocessor. As the pen
approaches the screen, a coil inside it interferes with the
transmitted signal. By working out where the interference is coming
from, the microprocessor works out the position of the pen on the
screen. But the pen is also identifiable: Buttons on the side of
the pen can be pushed to alter the length of the coil and its
interference pattern, which changes the ID.
</P>
<P>
   In Sony's system, tapping the pen onto a file icon links the
pen's identity code to the file. Then, when the pen is tapped
against the screen of another computer on the same network, the

   Annoyed by the clutter of mice and keyboards on his desk, a
researcher at the Sony Computer Science Laboratories in Tokyo has
devised a quick and easy way to move files from one computer to
another without touching either a mouse or a keyboard. Instead, he
uses a penlike device to ``lift'' a file icon off one computer
screen and transfer it to another. The file itself is then
automatically transferred between the two computers over a network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first thought of this when I was using three computers on my
desk at the same time,'' says the researcher, Jun Rekimoto. ``There
were three different mice on the desk, and I kept getting confused
as to which mouse went with which screen.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer he's come up with, called pick-and-drop technology,
is designed for a future generation of computers that will use the
interactive screens now common on palmtops, which allow users to
write on them with a pressure-sensitive pen.
</P>
<P>
   The pen-and-screen combination used by Sony is a commercial
product made by Japanese company Wacom. Behind the screen is a
low-power radio transmitter linked to a microprocessor. As the pen
approaches the screen, a coil inside it interferes with the
transmitted signal. By working out where the interference is coming
from, the microprocessor works out the position of the pen on the
screen. But the pen is also identifiable: Buttons on the side of
the pen can be pushed to alter the length of the coil and its
interference pattern, which changes the ID.
</P>
<P>
   In Sony's system, tapping the pen onto a file icon links the
pen's identity code to the file. Then, when the pen is tapped
against the screen of another computer on the same network, the
network server notes the pen's identity code, looks to see which
file icon it last touched, and transfers that file to the new
computer. The icon immediately appears on the screen of the second
computer. Files can either be copied or cut and pasted in this way.
</P>

   Next time you're driving home and manage to get there without
going off the road, thank your neck. Neuroscientists have found
that the brain uses information from neck and head movements to
help judge which direction you are moving in. They say the finding
could lead to better robots and virtual-reality software.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, researchers thought that the brain got
all necessary information about the direction of motion from
signals received on the retina of the eyes. The image of a street
sign as you move straight toward it, for example, does not look the
same as when you are passing it on your left.
</P>
<P>
   But when researchers asked people to watch a computer image
which mimicked how a scene would change if they were moving in a
straight line and sometimes glancing to one side, they felt as if
their direction had changed into curved path, suggesting that eye
muscle movements also feed the brain with directional information.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears that neck muscle movements also play an important
role, say James Crowell and his colleagues at the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena. They discovered this in a
series of experiments in which they strapped people into an adapted
dentist's chair and asked them to watch computer images showing a
scene that changed as though they were moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   In one experiment, the chair moved the volunteer's entire body
in front of the screen. In another, it kept the head still while
moving the neck and body. In both situations, people watching the
video felt like they were moving in random directions as if they
were in bumper cars. ``It still amazes me just how incredibly
poorly you do,'' says Crowell, who was one of the subjects himself.
</P>
<P>
   But if they were allowed to freely move their head and neck as
the chair moved, people realized that the image showed them moving
forward on a straight path. They also succeeded in keeping a
head-mounted laser pointer on a stationary target. This suggests
that when the brain sends a signal telling the neck muscles to
move, it also sends a copy of that signal to the part of the brain
that is integrating information about direction (Nature
Neuroscience, vol. 1, p. 732).
</P>
<P>
   The result could lead to a better understanding of how the brain
performs one of its most basic tasks. ``It seems effortless, so
what's the big deal? The big deal is that when they try to design a
robot to do it, it's hard,'' says Richard Andersen, who supervises
the lab where Crowell works. He believes that people designing
robots and virtual reality environments will need to take neck
movements into account when designing software.
</P>
<P>
   Jitendra Malik, who works on robotics at the University of
California at Berkeley, says it had been assumed that robots could
determine direction simply from visual cues. But they quickly found
that it was very difficult to make this work. ``It's interesting
that the human visual system has arrived at the same conclusion,''
Malik notes. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   CALCUTTA, India _ Sister Nirmala padded into the austere room on
bare feet, a small brown sparrow of a woman, and alighted next to a
hauntingly lifelike statue of another tiny nun, an ancient,
wrinkled woman sunk in prayer and dressed in the same simple white
sari edged in blue.
</P>
<P>
   As the liturgical murmuring of 100 nuns' voices mingled with the
racket of trucks on the street outside, Sister Nirmala sat in
stillness on the stone floor through the dawn Mass. At its end, she
left her rosary beads in the statue's lap and touched a lifeless
hand.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since the death of Mother Teresa, the impish,
charismatic founder of the Missionaries of Charity, her successor,
Sister Nirmala, has gladly cast herself in the inimitable stooped
shadow of the woman who began the Catholic order almost half a
century ago to succor the poorest of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   With a humble, quiet way of her own, Sister Nirmala, who was
born in Bihar 64 years ago to an ardent Hindu Brahmin family, said
she cannot replace Mother Teresa, only try to carry on her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never try to fill her shoes,'' she said in an interview at
Mother House, headquarters of the order. ``I have to wear my own
small shoes. I don't have to be Mother Teresa, just Sister Nirmala,
and being Sister Nirmala isn't so difficult. If I had to be Mother
Teresa, I would have collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mother Teresa died in September 1997 at the age of 87,
there were dire predictions that donations to the order's worldwide
network of homes for the dying, the disabled and the orphaned would
wither. But Sister Nirmala said that to the contrary, more money
has come in.
</P>
<P>
   The order does not release figures about how much money is
contributed, but Sister Nirmala said the number of homes run by the
order and its 4,000 nuns has grown by 20 since Mother Teresa died.
There are now 614, and the number is to expand by another 15 before
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Nirmala's time is consumed by the daunting job of
administering the order's work. She is also gathering evidence of
the miracles that will be needed to win sainthood for Mother Teresa
from the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will accept only instantaneous physical cures,'' she
said. ``So far we do not have documented ones. Little gradual ones
are there.''
</P>
<P>
   The keepers of Mother Teresa's memory are scattered across the
teeming, traffic-clogged city of Calcutta _ a place where poverty
is as inescapable as the children begging on the streets. The nuns
live in ascetic quarters as well as elegant flats. And while none
would venture that Sister Nirmala has the star power of the Nobel
Prize-winning Mother Teresa, they say she has provided quiet, firm
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the Rev. Edward Le Joly, a Jesuit, served as
spiritual father to the Missionaries of Charity. He is 89 now and
lives in an unadorned room with a big wooden desk where he has
written books about Mother Teresa. His hands shake, his voice
quavers and his face is covered with liver spots, but he proudly
declares himself ``the authority on Mother Teresa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sister Nirmala will not have Mother Teresa's charisma, and she
will not need it,'' he said. ``Mother Teresa had a special grace of
God, as foundress, to start the society. Now Sister Nirmala takes
over a society that is established.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving in a different sphere of Calcutta is Sunita Kumar, a
cultured, stylish matron. The wife of a successful Hindu
businessman, she has done volunteer work for the Missionaries of
Charity since 1967. In that time she has opened her wood-paneled
living room, lined with the paintings of India's greatest modern
artists, to a weekly gathering of women who fold pieces of paper
that lepers can open easily to reach their pills. ``They have no
fingers,'' Mrs. Kumar explained.
</P>
<P>
   For years she was Mother Teresa's liaison to the international
press corps, and she has continued in that role for Sister Nirmala.
Mrs. Kumar said some mistake the sister's unassuming demeanor for
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   But when three of the order's nuns were killed in Yemen in July
by a man the police described as unstable, Sister Nirmala
immediately got on a plane to go there. ``It was exactly what
Mother would have done,'' Mrs. Kumar said. ``If you had seen her
before and now, you would see she has blossomed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Nirmala was chosen to head the order in March 1997, when
Mother Teresa was gravely ill. A conclave of 120 sisters
deliberated for two months before picking her.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Nirmala, who joined the order in 1958 after converting to
Catholicism, had helped open the order's first home outside India,
in Venezuela. She also helped to open and run a house in New York
for contemplative nuns who tended to the spiritual rather than the
material needs of the poor. For 21 years, she lived a relatively
secluded life in the order's contemplative wing, passing her days
in solitary prayer and ministering to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to be quiet, hidden,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As Mother Teresa's health worsened, Sister Nirmala often came to
Mother House to pray with her and they became closer than ever. But
suddenly, after Mother Teresa's death, she found herself thrust
into the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   Facing sharp-toothed questions at her first news conference, she
gave answers that at times seemed a bit uncharitable. That day, she
said the poor should accept their lot and ``not moan and groan.''
Asked what would happen if the poor became rich, she joked, ``We
would lose our jobs.'' Her comments were not well received in the
local press.
</P>
<P>
   The media comments fed a deeper criticism of the order's
approach to poverty, one that is based on charity, rather than
giving the poor the means to learn to stand on their own feet. The
nuns also condemn the use of contraceptives, in a city grimly
unable to support its growing population of more than 13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Nirmala has become more diplomatic in handling difficult
questions, but still has not altered the order's philosophy. Like
Mother Teresa, she opposes ``artificial'' contraception, like
condoms or the pill. ``To have the pleasure but not the
responsibility only degrades the human being,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The way of life at Mother House remains largely unchanged. And
Sister Nirmala said she believes Mother Teresa is still ``managing
from the top.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mother Teresa's health failed, Sister Nirmala and the other
nuns came to feel lonely for the irrepressible woman who once led
them. So Sister Nirmala decided to have a statue of Mother Teresa
placed in the room where the nuns gather every morning and evening
to pray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother had looked at it and said: `Hide it. Don't let the
sisters see it,''' Sister Nirmala recalled. ``Later, when Mother
passed away, that place was so empty where she used to sit. So we
had it brought up. That is her presence among us.''

CLINTON ACKNOWLEDGES `DISTURBING SIGNS' ABOUT NORTH KOREA'S MISSILE
CAPACITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ President Clinton flew to South Korea on Friday saying
he was ``quite concerned'' about reports that North Korea is
stepping up its missile capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the build-up, reported first by the Washington
Post, was not confirmed, ``but there are some disturbing signs
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said the Pyongyang regime was preparing at least two
new launch sites for Taepo Dong 1 missiles and increasing
production of shorter-range weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The developments come less than three months after North Korea
fired a missile that overflew Japan, dropping its first stage to
the west of the main island Honshu in the Sea of Japan and the
second stage to the east in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The missile report casts Clinton's trip to meet South Korean
President Kim Dae Jung in an even more urgent light, because the
United States was already concerned about a recent lack of
coordination between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo on dealing with
North Korea, the most destabilizing short-term security issue in
northeastern Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also faces North Korea's refusal to
cooperate with inspectors seeking to determine if an underground
site is being used for nuclear weapons development. One report said
that the North Koreans, plagued by a continued threat of famine and
economic chaos, demanded $300 million from the United States in
return for any inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not offer specifics on why the proposed inspections
had faltered, but said some suggested conditions were ``completely
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say that no one can be absolutely sure of
whether the North Korean position is simply a product of economic
difficulties ... or whether they really are moving toward a more
hostile posture,'' Clinton said in a joint news conference with
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi after two days of talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then flew to the South Korean capital Seoul where he was
to meet Saturday with President Kim. He then returns to Washington
Monday after a stop in Guam.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Tokyo, Clinton tried to be moderately encouraging
about the latest move by Obuchi to plow $186 billion into his
nation's economy _ through public works spending, tax cuts and
merchandise vouchers _ in an effort to get Japan's shrinking
economy growing again.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said Japan may need to do more, and Deputy Treasury
Secretary Larry Summer cast doubt on Obuchi's claim that Japan
could return to growth in the fiscal year that begins April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the stimulus package, the seventh for Japan in
six years, ``quite good,'' but added: ``Whether it will be enough
or not I do not know. ... Sometimes when you have to turn a country
around, it takes more than you think in the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   A more hopeful Obuchi said the stimulus package should mean his
government ``will be able to state clearly for the fiscal year 1999
that Japan has turned to positive growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers later was questioned about private economic forecasts
that show Japan in negative territory for longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the recognition that there is a risk of slow or
negative growth is why there's a view that it may be necessary over
time (for Japan) to do more'' to stimulate its economy, Summers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he and Obuchi discussed in detail what the
president called ``our shared concerns about North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi called the North Korean missile launched on Aug. 31 ``a
very shocking experience for us.'' He said Japan was considering $1
billion in financial assistance for North Korea, which he virtually
linked to the nuclear weapons development issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that such an underground nuclear facility ... is not
there in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Were the facility be proven to exist, Obuchi said, ``it will be
very difficult for us to persuade the Japanese people about the
kind of cooperation we would be able to extend to the North
Koreans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has expressed concerned about Japan's
approach to the North Korean dilemma, and a U.S. government
analysts said after the Clinton-Obuchi meeting that Japan was
apparently ready turn negotiations with Pyongyang on the matter
over to Washington more fully.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi was ``not willing to risk U.S.-Japanese relations'' by
pressing a more unilateral engagement of Pyongyang, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's missile program is not covered by the so-called
``agreed framework'' under which Pyongyang has pledged to freeze
its plutonium production in exchange for an energy development
program, financed principally by the United States and Japan. The
plan is intended to help North Korea improve an economy shattered
after 50 years of government mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Pritchard, director of Asian Affairs at the White House's
National Security Council, said the North Koreans have contended
that ``they are a small country (with) some requirements to defend
themselves.'' But, he added, Pyongyang also has appears to have
foreign sales in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are certainly a cash-strapped nation, which accounts for
some of their motivation for the proliferation of those
(missiles),'' Pritchard said.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard also said that with the separate allegations about an
underground nuclear weapons development site, North Korea could be
moving toward violating the ``agreed framework.`` ``We are
aggressively engaged in discussions with the North Koreans to
figure out how we can, in fact, satisfy our concerns,'' Pritchard
said.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded it was not always easy to analyze North Korean
actions or motives.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with a North Korean submarine incursion in South Korea
in 1996, Pritchard said, ``we've seen things that ... you would not
think should be going on at this point in time. With a North Korean
economy that is in dire straits, they ought to be engaged in a more
productive and positive way. They're not.''

   LA-TOBACCO-PAYOUT (Los Angeles) _ On the day the states' and
tobacco industry's $206 billion deal won unanimous support, Mayor
Richard Riordan and City Attorney James Hahn offered strikingly
different spending plans. The city expects to receive $300 million
over the next 25 years. Hahn wants the money used to enforce laws

   KTEL-WHEREABOUTS (Los Angeles) _ In all the questions raised
about K-Tel Communications and its online ventures and unreported
Nasdaq letters, one question rings out the loudest: Is the king of
``As Seen on TV'' really headquartered in Calabasas? Most media
outlets say the company is headquartered in Minneapolis. The

HANGING 10, BUT OFTEN PAYING A PRICE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Momentum advisers are the surfers of the investing arena. They
constantly look for waves that are strong enough to carry them a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are momentum investors of different stripes, the
advisers I'm talking about define momentum in terms of a stock's
recent performance. They seek shares with the best performance over
the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   One might worry that this approach entails buying stocks that
are already awfully expensive. A momentum adviser, however, thinks
that such stocks will keep going _ after all, they have momentum.
Instead of ``Buy low, sell high,'' their motto is ``Buy high, sell
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   As any surfer will tell you, the sport is exhilarating. But what
happens when your wave disappears? The answer is provided by what
happened to momentum investors during this summer's selloff: a
wipeout. From mid-July through August, the typical portfolio of a
momentum newsletter shed between a quarter and a third of its
value.
</P>
<P>
   Investors shouldn't have been surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks with the most momentum during rallies _ like technology
stocks earlier this summer _ are almost always big losers in the
initial stages of declines. They may look irresistible as long as
their wave is rolling, but they also have the farthest to fall.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding whether momentum investing is appropriate, it is
important to examine performance for an entire market cycle.
Momentum investors need to earn huge bull-market gains in order to
weather their bear-market losses.
</P>
<P>
   This is illustrated by one of the best-performing momentum-based
newsletters: MPT Review, edited by Louis Navellier. When the market
rises, MPT's performance is nothing short of spectacular. Consider
its gains during months in which the broad market rose over the
last 13 years: It outperformed the Wilshire 5000, a broad market
benchmark, by more than 30 percentage points, annualized _ 81.8
percent a year to 51.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But for the entire 13 years, including months of both market
gains and declines, MPT Review beat the broad market by ``just''
8.6 percentage points, annualized: 25 percent vs. 16.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, that kind of outperformance is nothing to sneeze at.
But there is another issue here: risk. In achieving that return, I
figure, MPT Review's portfolios were 84 percent riskier than the
overall market, as measured by volatility. That makes MPT Review's
performance less impressive.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, without incurring any more risk than MPT Review, you
could have performed almost as well by buying an index fund on
margin _ borrowing $84 for every $100 of your portfolio's net
worth. What this means is that during rallies, MPT Review needed to
beat the market at an annualized clip of more than 30 percentage
points simply to weather its huge losses during declining months
and still keep pace with the market on a risk-adjusted basis.
</P>
<P>
   MPT Review's example raises this question: Why not combine
momentum stocks with a market-timing system that sidesteps
declines? Fine, but Navellier shuns timing, always staying fully
invested.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum newsletter with the best success at avoiding market
declines is The Chartist, edited by Dan Sullivan. I calculate that
Sullivan's timing has reduced by 31 percent the risk, or
volatility, otherwise associated with his recommended momentum
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But his timing hasn't been perfect: It has also kept him in cash
during some market rallies. I estimate that _ at 17.3 percent,
annualized, over the last 18 years _ his portfolio's performance
was about 20 percent less than it would have if it had remained
fully invested at all times.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of pure statistics, Sullivan's achievement is
creditable: He reduced risk by more than he forfeited return. But
it still is a far cry from the fantasy of capturing all the upside
and none of the downside.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum investing, like surfing, is not for the faint of heart.
The approach can beat the market over a market cycle, but prepare
for a wild ride.

YELTSIN ORDERS INQUIRY INTO ALLEGED PLOT TO KILL TYCOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin ordered an inquiry Friday into
spectacular charges leveled earlier this week _ so far without
evidence _ that Russia's equivalent of the FBI plotted to kill one
of the country's most influential tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   The tycoon is Boris Berezovsky, an oil magnate and director of
Russia's biggest television network who was a leading supporter of
Yeltsin during the last presidential campaign in 1996. Berezovsky,
who is still alive, released a letter last week asserting that the
Federal Security Service, a spinoff of the Soviet Union's KGB,
which is responsible for domestic law enforcement, had plotted last
winter to murder him.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday his source, a Security Service colonel named
Alexander Litvinenko, called a news conference to promote the
accusation and warn that a rogue element is running wild within the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has talked about little else since. On Friday Yeltsin's
spokesman, Dmitri Yakushin, said the president had ordered the
security service and his chief national security aide to
investigate the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin ``is seriously worried by the latest media reports that
FSB officials have allegedly committed illegal actions,'' Yakushin
said. FSB is the Russian acronym for the service, which is
responsible for investigating organized crime, terrorism and
foreign intelligence operations.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Litvinenko and several other agents _
some thinly disguised in dark glasses _ said the agency was
infested by a ``criminal group'' which had been using it ``for
their own private political purposes, including settling accounts
with unwanted people.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the verbal order to murder Berezovsky, which Litvinenko
contended was issued by leaders of the agency, other FSB officers
detailed what they said was a plot to kidnap the brother of another
prominent Moscow businessman, Umar Dzhabrailov.
</P>
<P>
   Why the orders were supposedly issued _ and why the plots were
not carried out _ was not clear. The agents took pains to note that
all of the plots unraveled before the service's current director,
Vladimir Putin, took command in August.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin reacted angrily anyway, saying he had written evidence
that some of the same officers who staged the news conference were
themselves rogues who had pushed illegal crimefighting methods.
Some of them, he said, had actually been Berezovsky's own personal
bodyguards in past lives. ``They will be dismissed in strict
accordance with the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin ridiculed the allegations, arguing that experienced
investigators like Litvinenko would have secured proof of their
charges, perhaps through video surveillance, if they were true.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky's Communist Party critics suggested that the
once-powerful industrialist, his stature lowered by Russia's
economic downfall, was simply seeking to recapture lost limelight.
Berezovsky was one of Yeltsin's principal backers in the last
election, and the president's own drift away from the center of
power may have reduced Berezovsky's influence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Muscovites were not dismissing the allegations out of
hand. A separate criminal investigation of corruption within the
security service already has led to several prosecutions, and Putin
has dismantled the agency's organized-crime unit on the grounds
that it was unprofessional.
</P>
<P>
   And Berezovsky has some reason for concern. Russia's ORT
television network, the nation's largest broadcast company and a
locus of much of Berezovsky's influence, was raided by government
officials this week and some of its equipment confiscated for
nonpayment of taxes.
</P>
<P>
   While the network's arrears are real, so are those of scores of
other major corporations, and some have speculated that the raid
was part of the early jockeying to control the media among
candidates for the 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The last month has also seen an upswing in overt anti-Semitism
among nationalist and communist politicians. Berezovsky is of
Jewish descent and is a strong supporter of Israel. Berezovsky
already has survived one attempt on his life, a 1995 car-bombing
that killed one man and left his bodyguard seriously wounded.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sneakers are off. The stilettos are on. Tennis's
most marketable sweethearts since Chris Evert are seeking the kind
of supermodel clout bestowed on those creatures famous enough to be
known by first names only: Martina and Venus and Anna are in full
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   They still list ``tennis star'' as their primary occupation, but
what they want to be are rock stars, fashion stars, movie stars.
They want to be ubiquitous without needing to spell it. Now, some
of them are playing air guitar with their rackets; some are
pretending to play tennis while selling shampoo; some are grabbing
dinner with Leonardo DiCaprio at Nobu in New York, some dancing
with Kevin Spacey at Iman's Paris disco.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the players who are seeking the status of
crossover stars. They are being facilitated by agents, publicity
agents and executives of the Women's Tennis Association, who want
the sport to raise its hemlines and project a more glamorous image,
in order to take advantage of the blurring of sports and
entertainment. That this comes at a time when women's tennis is
looking for a title sponsor capable of lavishing millions on it the
way Virginia Slims once did isn't much of a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennis has become very smart about marketing its stars,'' said
Michael Wolf, head of media and entertainment at Booz-Allen &AMP;
Hamilton, the consultant and trend-spotter. ``They've come out of
the woodwork, and out of uniform, and they're attending the music
awards, getting photographed at the right parties, and selling
everything from makeup to computers. They're more accessible than
the supermodels, they make better role models, and this is what
transforms athletes into brands. Celebrity is the universal
currency, and they're going after it.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the skeptics on the sidelines suspect that the girls
of summer, along with the executives of the sport that made them
household names, may be on the verge of taking a lethal injection
of glamour. The stars of the makeover of women's tennis are
teen-age players with a Generation X appetite for celebrity:
Martina Hingis, 18, the most vivacious Swiss import since Heidi;
Venus Williams, 18, the beaded Valkyrie from Compton, Calif., whose
outrageous Reebok tennis dresses merge ``Star Trek'' and ``South
Park,'' and Moscow's Anna Kournikova, 17, the blond bombshell who
aspires to be a movie star as soon as she's done playing the femme
fatale of tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The sport even has a second Williams sister stashed in the
wings: Serena Williams, 17, a muscular motormouth who may wind up
rivaling Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura when it comes to crossover
versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for sale!'' chortled the high-spirited Ms. Hingis, who is
the poster girl for the tour's campaign to reinvent itself as a
vehicle that marries sneakers, sweat and sex appeal. Her
congeniality and hubris seem limitless _ as do her endorsements.
``It's business that wants this from us, and we're playing the
game, me and Anna and Venus. We're the Spice Girls of tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hingis was in New York last week to compete in the $2
million Chase Championships, the last tournament of the year, whose
finals are on Sunday. Ms. Kournikova, who has yet to win a title
but already receives royal treatment from the fashion world,
handled the disappointment of a first-round loss with consummate
poise. After all, she had other plans for Thursday night. While
most of her peers put on their sneakers and game faces, she turned
up in head-to-toe Prada to emcee a party for the Next modeling
agency, with music by Mark Ronson, the house deejay to the fashion
set.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival a couple of years ago of this current crop of
talented, photogenic teen-agers coincided with the hiring of Joe
Favorito as the Women's Tennis Association's public relations
director. He had monitored plenty of crossover marketing during a
stint with the National Basketball Association, and was charged by
tennis with the task of getting the top women in tennis off the
sports pages and into the fashion and entertainment media.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days you have to be a utility player: if you only do one
thing, you're not sellable; you have to be able to sing AND
dance,'' said Favorito, who oversaw a remarkable run of appearances
by players this year in publications like Vogue, Rolling Stone, GQ
and Vanity Fair, not to mention on the television shows of David
Letterman, Jay Leno and Rosie O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   Sex appeal, hitherto an unmentionable, is prominent in the
campaign to glamorize the players and the game, which the sport
seems to have decided is required to sell itself in an overcrowded
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Bart McGuire, the chief executive of the Corel WTA Tour, denied
that the effort was exploitative. ``We are not involved in
sexploitation,'' he said. ``I will admit that this is not the
traditional way in which women's tennis has been marketed. The
truth is that we're competing for the public's entertainment
dollar, and to get it, we've got to give them an entertaining
product. I realize that can be done tastefully or distastefully. I
don't see us crossing any lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ms. Hingis, wearing a black turtleneck above narrow
black trousers that segued into black platform brogues, was trying
to explain how she, a Slovakian-born bumpkin, found a compass for
negotiating the glitter and galas now standard territory for
nouveau celebrities like her. ``It's not so hard to figure out what
to do,'' Ms. Hingis said. ``I just think of Julia Roberts in
`Pretty Woman': put on the right clothes, and work your forks and
spoons from the outside in, and you're going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hingis' extracurricular endorsements include everything from
Clairol to Ocean Spray, adding another $8 million a year to the $3
million in prize money she derives from her day job on the tennis
court.
</P>
<P>
   A multimillionaire by the time she was 16 and the youngest No. 1
champion in the history of the game, Ms. Hingis is obviously a
quick study. Asked about the strapless, $750 Michael Kors
concoction that swathed her body contours like a glorified ace
bandage on GQ's June cover, Ms. Hingis tattled on the battalion of
stylists who produced the shoot: ``For two hours the dresses got
shorter and shorter, and of course they picked the sexiest dress!
If I was 13, it would have been a little strange. But I'm not, so
it's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And if her choice of the streetwalker-turned-Cinderella of
``Pretty Woman'' as a role model seems strange, as things
transpired, it was right on the money. In May, the Women's Tennis
Association, hitherto a dowdy bunch when it came to marketing,
signed its worldwide television rights over to the producer of
``Pretty Woman,'' Arnon Milchan, the holder of a 49.5 percent stake
in Regency Enterprises, a production company whose other hits
include ``L.A. Confidential'' and ``City of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Milchan (pronounced MILL-shawn) said the nine-year deal was
worth a potential $120 million to the tour. So, starting in 1999,
women's tennis will have a bona fide executive producer pulling the
television marketing strings and deciding the proper packaging of a
product viewed by an estimated 5.5 billion. And make no mistake:
Milchan plans to redesign the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily about turning them into pinup girls,'' he
said last week from his suite at the Mercer Hotel in Soho. ``In
television terms, I want to change the tournaments from wallpaper
into main events. Make the players into stars.'' And he's hiring
Azzedine Alaia and courting other designers to outfit them.
</P>
<P>
   Milchan's immersion in the tennis business stemmed from a chance
meeting with the German player Anke Huber at Rupert Murdoch's
birthday party two years ago, as well as his not-by-chance purchase
of 25 percent of Puma, a German sportswear company. He celebrated
the television deal by whisking Ms. Huber and Iva Majoli, the 1997
French Open champion, off to the Cannes International Film Festival
and onto a borrowed yacht jammed with celebrities like Don Johnson
and Naomi Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a show business kind of guy,'' Ms. Huber said of Milchan,
``and he wants to turn tennis into show business, make it more
exciting. I think there's room for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all this excitement started, not so innocently, with the
new logo.
</P>
<P>
   Before Ms. Hingis bared her limbs as GQ's first athlete cover
girl in June, before Venus Williams sauntered onto Jay Leno's set
in her zillion-bead headdress and second-skin sheath in July,
before Ms. Kournikova put on a pair of stilettos and morphed into a
rock-and-roll nymphet in a Rolling Stone photo session last spring,
came the revised logo the women's tennis tour used to announce its
makeover from country-club conventional to cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   The silhouette of a curvaceous young woman with her tennis
racket poised in mid-swing and a shock of blond hair tumbling from
her headband, introduced in 1995, provoked a howl from the sport's
original Martina, Martina Navratilova.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Ms. Navratilova was anti-glamour. Long before
Steffi Graf was persuaded to display her body in a Sports
Illustrated swimsuit issue and Mary Pierce poured herself into
those scuba-style Nike tunics, Ms. Navratilova's acceptance of a
Gucci-designed racket commemorating her first Wimbledon title, in
1978, created an establishment backlash.
</P>
<P>
   She was accused of causing women in athletics to appear
frivolous, and the same charge was levied against Monica Seles 13
years later when she received her makeover from Matrix. ``When I
was No. 1 in 1991 and cut my hair, it was a big deal,'' said Ms.
Seles, who couldn't understand the fuss. ``Now it seems like
everything's accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything in Ms. Navratilova's opinion, including a shift in
the Women's Tennis Association's attitude from being protective of
its athletes' sexuality to promoting it. She admonished the
association in 1995, saying its logo was focusing on erogenous
zones. And three years later, she's still scolding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they have the women dolled up in these
skin-tight outfits,'' she said recently. ``I mean, if that's what
they really think it takes to attract an audience, why not just
send them out there naked? You don't see them primping the men
players. Why is it so necessary for women athletes to prove
themselves as women?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it isn't. But only if they don't give a hoot about, as Ms.
Hingis' agent, Jeff Schwartz of the International Management Group,
puts it, ``being seen as multidimensional by Madison Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is selling out,'' he continued. ``I think
it's staying current. If you don't stay with the times, people are
going to flick the channels and find something that does entertain
them.''
</P>
<P>
   While all this preening has been taking place, Ms. Hingis hasn't
won a title since becoming GQ's cover girl, ammunition for purists
who suspect all that moonlighting may be hazardous to the health of
her main job.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 rung on the tennis ladder has been usurped by Lindsay
Davenport, 22, a Californian who happens to be a devout non-glamour
puss. Yes, Ms. Davenport dropped 30 pounds from her 6-foot-2-inch
frame, but no, she's not interested in ``crossing the lines into
Hollywood hype,'' she said, adding: ``For me, being an athlete is
enough. I get paid to win, and I'm just not comfortable with the
idea of posing around town in a fancy hairdo and a ton of makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davenport recoiled when Sports Illustrated suggested that
she wear a gown for its year-end photo spread. ``I realize they
want to grow our sport in a different direction, and maybe this is
all harmless,'' she said. ``There's nothing wrong with wanting to
look your best. Who doesn't? But I hope people remember we're
athletes first, not movie stars or models on the catwalk.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Ms. Seles, 24, whose life story read like a movie script
_ ranked No. 1 when she was stabbed in mid-match in 1993 by a
maniacal fan of her chief rival, Ms. Graf _ long before Milchan
came along, has learned not to question life's little
superficialities. For Ms. Seles, who bought her first Chanel jacket
at 17 but lives in J. Crew, this glam-tennis thing is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Arnon has invested a lot of money in us,'' Ms. Seles
said. ``But the skirts are getting shorter all the time. As long as
women's tennis doesn't become all about who's wearing the shortest
skirt or the wildest color panties, I'm OK with it. But this isn't
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just yet, but the credits are already rolling. ``They've
come a long way,'' said Wolf, the entertainment consultant, ``from
the days when their idea of a commercial crossover was Evonne
Goolagong doing those ads for Geritol.''

U.S. OFFICIALS BREAK UP SMUGGLING RING

(Attn: Texas)

c.1998 Houston Chronicle

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal officials said Friday they have broken a
major international cartel that smuggled illegal workers from India
and other countries into the United States through Texas and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 21 people, including one from Houston, have been
arrested for participating in the three affiliated rings
responsible for smuggling as many as 12,000 illegal immigrants to
this country during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one people have been indicted by a federal grand jury in
Dallas, where immigration officials first began investigating the
case about a year ago. The indictments contain 58
immigration-related and money laundering counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for those who traffic in flesh to pay their pound
of flesh,'' said Paul Coggins, U.S. attorney for the Northern
District of Texas in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The three, loosely connected rings specialized in providing
foreign labor to employers in the United States, charging as much
as $20,000 per person to transport immigrants to this country.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the workers were from India, the organizations
also smuggled immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Coggins appeared Friday with Attorney General Janet Reno and
Doris Meissner, director of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, who lauded government agents for cracking what they
described as the biggest and most sophisticated smuggling scheme
ever dismantled by U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let all those who flout the nation's immigration laws be
warned: We plan to take swift action against you,'' said Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general criticized ``unscrupulous employers ... who
want cheap labor and fearful workers who could easily be
manipulated.''
</P>
<P>
   The rings transported the workers to the United States by a
circuitous route that involved travel across four continents.
</P>
<P>
   The workers would travel by air from India to Moscow and then be
flown to Cuba, where they would be taken to the Bahamas, Ecuador or
other South American countries.
</P>
<P>
   From those transit points the immigrants would be smuggled into
Miami, by boat or plane, or through Central America into Texas,
where many ended up in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said immigrants would be flown by planes to private
airstrips near McAllen, or be smuggled on the ground across the
Texas border.
</P>
<P>
   From Dallas most would be sent to East Coast cities, where they
often ended up in what officials called ``stash houses'' where they
were prohibited from leaving until either the employers or the
immigrants paid the cartels the large fees.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that cartels sometimes demanded fees along the
route at various stops, such as in the Bahamas, where the
immigrants were detained in houses. The trip could often last for
months or years. Most of those being smuggled into the country were
adult males, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the top person involved in the smuggling
operations was a man known as Nick Diaz, who was indicted on Nov.
14 in the Bahamas. Diaz, also known as Nitin Shettie, is in custody
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A second ring leader ,Navtej Pall Singh Sandu, was arrested in
Puerto Rico. A third, Niranjan Maan Singh, is being sought and is
believed to be in India.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested Nov. 19 was a man known as Nizar Lnu of
Houston. According to court papers Nizar traveled to Bedford, a
suburb of Dallas, on Sept. 15 and discussed transporting an
immigrant, Mahmad Maredia Zulfikar, to Houston. Nizar paid $5,000
as a partial payment for smuggling fees, according to court
documents .
</P>
<P>
   Others arrested in Texas were Hiren Jashvant Bhai Pat in Dumas
on Nov. 16 and Dinesh Patel in Fort Worth on the same date.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said that so far they have concentrated on
nabbing the ring leaders in the international smuggling groups and
have not indicted any of the businesses who hired them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to say what kind of businesses were involved
in the scheme, saying that to do so might compromise the ongoing
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have been interviewing many of the
immigrants in hope of using their testimony in court proceedings.
However, they have not yet determined whether the immigrants should
be deported.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark._ The second-richest woman in America is now
apparently the second-richest Texan.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Walton, the only daughter (she has three brothers) of the
late Sam Walton, has acquired a Texas driver's license and 3,200
acres in the hill country near Mineral Wells, west of Dallas. The
compound includes a 4,400-square-foot main house, four other
houses, a pool and outbuildings.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fit spread for Ms. Walton, a lifelong equestrian who
also trains and breeds work horses for ranchers. It is also a
refuge, after a decade of fitful efforts in her native Arkansas to
become a regional leader in money management, economic development
and investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, she resigned as chief executive of Llama Co., her
investment firm, while remaining chairman and majority shareholder.
She opened Llama in Fayetteville in 1988 with $25 million of her
own capital.
</P>
<P>
   Hard feelings linger, according to Arkansas business leaders who
request anonymity for fear of offending the Walton family.
``There's the sense around here that she feels mistreated, so she's
packing up and moving to Texas,'' one senior executive sighed.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview, Ms. Walton did not explain her decision,
but said of her new address: ``I feel so totally at home. I love
it.'' A watercolorist who collects early American art, she
rhapsodized over the paint that was being applied to her new home
that day. ``Yellow-gold, Southwestern, soft, soft, soft,'' she
said. For all her artistic ardor, though, she has no fashion
pretensions. Asked if she had a favorite designer, she laughed.
``I'm a cowgirl,'' she said. ``I like jeans and boots.''
</P>
<P>
   But she left no doubt she would stay in charge at Llama. As she
described her vision for the firm, she peppered her comments with
digs at Wall Street. ``What I want are a group of people who have
financial expertise but don't think like an investment banker, who
have operating knowledge, who understand our clients,'' said Ms.
Walton, 49. ``Most investment banks aren't built that way. They're
built around 28-year-old guys who don't have the sense God gave a
goose.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Ms. Walton has to work for a living. Her stake in
Wal-Mart is worth an estimated $11 billion, placing her second in
wealth to her mother, Helen, among women and probably second, in
Texas, to Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Computer, who is worth
about $13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walton may miss her thousand acres of Ozark lakefront near
the headquarters of the Wal-Mart chain, which was founded by her
father. But she will also leave behind the state's income tax.
(Texas has none.)
</P>
<P>
   Lynn DeVault, her chosen successor as Llama's chief, said that
annual earnings are ``in the millions'' and that Llama has $500
million in investments and loans and $300 million under management.
Llama has had successes, financing a bond issue for a northwest
Arkansas airport near Wal-Mart's home _ President Clinton,
dedicating the airport this month, singled out Ms. Walton for
praise _ and helping to finance an employee buyout that kept
Hathaway Shirt Co. of Maine alive.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Llama acquired Boston Capital Mortgage, since
renamed Llama Capital Mortgage. Llama's real estate and corporate
finance branches, Ms. DeVault said, had record returns in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But in Arkansas, Llama is more often noted for its setbacks. In
February, it sold a sports management division, and three months
later withdrew as underwriter for two state bond issues. ``No one
has ever understood what Llama was trying to do,'' said an
investment banker in Little Rock. ``It's always been whatever was
the idea of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walton's company has also suffered from executive turnover.
Don Clanton, a former Llama executive, calls her a poor manager.
``She becomes impatient,'' he said. But she is knowledgeable, he
added: ``She gets to the bottom line about as fast as anyone I've
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeVault says any turnover resulted from growth. As for Ms.
Walton's management skills, the ranch-horse enterprise, Ms. DeVault
added, is ``very much a business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not a kid with a pony in the back yard,'' Ms. DeVault
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walton traveled to her new backyard along a sometimes rough
course. Her father, in his autobiography, described her as
``volatile.'' She initially worked as a Wal-Mart buyer and later
became a broker at E.F. Hutton's New Orleans office. There, she ran
afoul of the Securities and Exchange Commission over options
trading and in 1979 accepted a six-month suspension without
acknowledging any improprieties. She soon returned to Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   She has also endured two divorces and more than 30 surgeries to
repair a leg crushed when the car she was driving overturned in
Mexico in 1983. Six years later, she was held blameless when an
Arkansas woman stepped into the path of her Porsche and died.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last January, her sport utility vehicle crashed near her
Arkansas home. She was charged with drunken driving and resisting
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who I am, don't you? You know my last name?'' an
officer quoted Ms. Walton as saying. She said she had no memories
of the incident, because of a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite hiring two prominent lawyers and a public relations
firm, she was convicted, fined $925, sentenced to 28 hours of
community service and ordered to undergo counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeVault said Ms. Walton's move to Texas was not an effort to
escape her past. In any case, Ms. Walton will not be leaving the
Walton empire too far behind. There in Mineral Wells is Wal-Mart
Store No. 804.

Atlanta's Piedmont Driving Club, the magnolia blossom tint of the
walls a perfect match for his creamy three-piece suit. The club,
which was founded 111 years ago so that Atlanta's aristocrats could
show off their horse-drawn carriages, had invited the celebrated
writer to lunch with its members. Wolfe made a three-day publicity
tour of the city that he used as the setting for his lastest novel,
about the feeble condition of American morality at the turn of the
milennium. Despite the reviews characterizing Wolfe as a modern-day
Sherman, Atlantans turned his visit into a citywide sensation that

ISRAEL YIELDS MORE WEST BANK TERRITORY, 250 PRISONERS FREED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT   AND ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QABATIYA, West Bank _ Israel began its delayed troop withdrawal
Friday from a carefully carved swath of northern West Bank land,
and in doing so kept the fragile peace process with the
Palestinians alive.
</P>
<P>
   The day should have been a triumphant one for Israelis and
Palestinians who believe in the peace process. Israel also released
250 Palestinian prisoners from its jails, and the Palestinian
Authority announced it would open its new international airport
early next week.
</P>
<P>
   But compared to the heady days of the first Israeli withdrawals
in Gaza four years ago, Friday's steps by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's conservative Likud government were halting at best.
</P>
<P>
   And Palestinian street celebrations were tinged with
disappointment after two years of delays, failed promises on
economic improvement, and the realization that they will ultimately
receive far less of the West Bank than their leaders had led them
to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday morning, Israeli troops began unloading large
yellow-and-brown concrete blocks to mark the new areas of
Palestinian control ringing some 26 West Bank towns and villages.
They also erected red-and-white signs in Hebrew warning Israelis
that they were now entering Palestinian-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
   By the afternoon, convoys of Palestinian Authority policemen
clad in blue fatigues and armed with automatic rifles triumphantly
entered Qabatia, a West Bank town of 17,000. Some of the troops
fired their guns in the air in celebration. A banner hoisted over
the main street read, ``The sun of freedom finally rises.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian residents here celebrated, but their joy seemed
tempered by the knowledge that the situation on the ground, and its
impact on their daily lives, would change very little.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Qabatia, Mohammed Abu Roub, summed up the mood by
saying, ``We will be able to travel more freely. We want anything
that helps get rid of the occupation. But we know this is the first
step of 1,000 steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite disappointment among Palestinians and resentment among
Jewish settlers, the redeployment Friday was by all accounts an
historic moment for the Likud government of Netanyahu. It marked
the first time that the Likud has ceded West Bank land to
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   There was shock and dismay in one of two small Jewish
settlements immediately affected by the handover. And within both,
generally considered among the least militant of the 144 in the
West Bank, there was despair that the redeployment would proceed
and fear over its effect on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want their villages. I don't need their villages. The
issue is how much security is left for me after the land becomes
theirs,'' said Ofer Ashash, the security chief at the Ganim
settlement, which is home to 51 families.
</P>
<P>
   To allay fears, the Israeli military has begun fortifying
security positions around the affected settlements. It has also
issued elaborate plans for building trenches, watchtowers, and
electric and concertina wire fences on the perimeters of the
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem if Palestinians control that area, but we
must be secure, not like I hear from Arafat who says one thing one
day and another thing another day,'' added Ashash, a father of
four.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said on Israel radio Friday, ``Gradually, I believe
everyone will understand this is the only way, given the situation
of the agreements we inherited, to make progress toward a peace
deal with security.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he told reporters, ``Now is the test. We are doing our
part. Now we want to see them do theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as military leaders from the two sides reviewed
redeployment maps together Friday, evidence emerged showing just
how badly the trust between the two camps had frayed in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government immediately angered Palestinian leaders
by altering redeployment maps at the last minute. The Israelis
demolished homes and took farm land to build 12 so-called ``bypass
roads'' which cut through the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   And while Israel lived up to the letter of an agreement to
release 250 Palestinian prisoners, it infuriated Palestinian
negotiators by freeing mostly common criminals and not the
political prisoners whom Palestinians claim were part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever thinks we're happy is insane,'' said Hisham
Abdel-Razek, the lead Palestinian negotiator on the prisoners'
release. ``This is disappointing for Palestinians. Israel is
violating the agreement. The US should intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli withdrawal was the result of an intense and grueling
summit hosted by the Clinton administration, which brought the two
sides together in Wye Mills, Md. last month. The multi-staged,
land-for-security deal was signed at the White House on October 23.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of delays, acrimonious debate and violence by
extremists on both sides intent on destroying the process, Friday's
steps forward proved that the so-called Wye agreement was back on
track.
</P>
<P>
   The accord commits Israels troops to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank _captured from Jordan in the 1967 Six Day War _ in
three phases over 12 weeks. The 13 percent is to fall under joint
Israeli-Palestinian control. An additional 14.2 percent of the West
Bank, now under shared control, is to shift to full Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
   In the phase begun Friday, two percent will come under shared
control and 7 percent will move to full Palestinian control. It is
the first return of land since the 1997 Hebron Agreement, which the
Netanyahu government implemented because its more liberal
predecessors in the Labor Party had agreed to it.
</P>
<P>
   If fully implemented, the new interim agreement would provide
full or share control over 40 percent of the West Bank to Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority. This is dramatically less than the
90 percent of the West Bank that Palestinian leaders believed they
would receive when the process began in Oslo five years ago.

EDUCATION CHIEF ISSUE AT GOP GOVERNOR CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ After losing two members of their ranks to
Democrats advocating state lotteries to fund education, the
Republican Governors Association focused on education at a
post-election conference this week but failed to unite behind a
common approach.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Friday to conclude the meeting, the
group's new chairman, Governor Frank Keating of Oklahoma, said
education would become the top priority for Republican governors.
He acknowledged there were different approaches. Some governors
preferred to reduce class sizes, he said, while others intended to
concentrate on building new schools or stopping automatic promotion
of students.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on education represented a new tack for the
Republican governors, who concentrated on welfare reform earlier in
the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a very interesting and rapid shift'' in the
politics of education, said Ted Sizer, a history professor emeritus
at Brown University who is now running a charter school in
Massachusetts. In a telephone interview, the educator said
politicians who once flogged the educational bureaucracy ``are now
giving new responsibilities to state authorities to give tests to
teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Jeb Bush ran for governor of Florida on a
platform that called for the elimination of the state education
department. He lost. This year, he dropped the theme, presented a
more progressive agenda, and won handily.
</P>
<P>
   Other reassessments have taken place after this month's
election.
</P>
<P>
   Governor James Gilmore of Virginia said he was preparing a plan
to take revenues from his state's lottery and ``send it back to the
localities for education.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore said in an interview that his move was not a reaction to
the defeat of Governors Fob James of Alabama and David Beasley of
South Carolina by Democratic proponents of state lotteries to raise
new funds for education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lottery has been around for a long time,'' Gilmore said.
``The Democrats promised 20 years ago they would use the money for
education and they broke their promise. I'm going to keep my
promise, and keep theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Republicans were well-known for their ``interest in
returning money back to the people. What is not noticed is that our
chief issue is education.''
</P>
<P>
   At the conference's only public session Thursday, education was
the topic and several of the governors spoke about initiatives in
their states.
</P>
<P>
   Governor George W. Bush of Texas talked of his demand to have
every child reading by the third grade and his determination to
test students to ensure they qualified for their class levels. He
said it was important to concentrate on a few goals. ``At one time
we had 30 goals. There were so many goals we didn't have any
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Jane Dee Hull of Arizona, a former teacher, said her
administration had enacted a program that mandates the use of
phonics to increase reading skills.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including outgoing California Governor Pete Wilson and
Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci, just elected to a full term,
stressed the need for testing to ensure teacher competence.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci mentioned the embarrassment in Massachusetts after it
was determined that a high percentage of teachers produced by the
state's education programs either failed literacy tests or tests in
their fields of study.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the different ideas raised by various governors,
Cellucci said he felt ``there is a lot of concensus on education.
We have made it a top issue. We're for reducing class sizes, for
ending social promotion, and there's a big emphasis on teacher
competence. We've got to have capable, competent teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, he said, are in a position to lead the fight for
teacher competence because powerful teachers' unions, which have
been historically allied with the Democratic Party, oppose testing.

INVESTING WITH ROBERT PERKINS: MANAGER OF THE BERGER SMALL CAP
VALUE FUND 
</HEADLINE>

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 22)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his professorial rumpled suits and gray, tousled hair,
Robert H. Perkins, 58, looks every bit the parsimonious value
player. But Perkins, the manager of the Berger Small Cap Value
fund, has had plenty of time to hone his image. He has been
trolling the markets for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1995, however, small-capitalization stocks _ the
category in which he specializes _ have lagged behind their
large-cap siblings by an average of 14.5 percentage points a year,
according to Ibbotson Associates, the research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, like many small-cap managers, he sees better times ahead.
``We're in the early stages of a period when small stocks
outperform larger ones, much like late 1990 through 1993, when the
Russell 2000 stocks more than doubled the S&AMP;P 500,'' Perkins said
from his office, in a turn-of-the-century, landmark brick building
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the rebound will occur when the broad market sorts
itself out and particularly when the large-company market leaders
return to more realistic price levels,'' he said, something he
expects to happen over the next two or three months.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins has amply demonstrated his abilities in the recent
trying times. The fund, with $270.5 million in assets, returned 2.7
percent for the 12 months through Nov. 13, compared with a 9.1
percent loss for its peer group of small-cap value funds, according
to Morningstar, Inc., the financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The fund returned 20.3 percent, annualized, for the three years
through Nov. 13, versus 12.2 percent for its group, Morningstar
said. The data are for the fund's institutional shares; retail
shares became available in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, plies his craft as a partner with Perkins, Wolf,
McDonnell, a money management firm in Chicago. After more than a
decade running funds for Kemper Securities, he struck out on his
own in 1980, eventually starting the Omni Investment fund, seeded
with $3.5 million in cash from friends and institutions. It opened
to the public the week of the 1987 crash.
</P>
<P>
   Sales, however, languished. ``I was stupid enough to think that
a good product would sell itself, and so we never marketed it,'' he
said. It had just $35 million in assets when he sold it in 1996 to
Berger Associates, which was in need of a small-cap value fund. He
continues to manage the renamed fund as subadviser.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins's value tilt flows from an overarching, cautious
philosophy. ``When we look at new ideas, our first step is to
establish downside risk, and then we look for rewards,'' he said.
His starting point is stocks of companies whose market
capitalizations are under $1 billion and whose prices are hitting
new lows.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Perkins has a penchant for what he calls ``fallen
growth stocks,'' those that have tumbled 50 percent to 70 percent
from their 52-week highs because of what he sees as temporary
problems. These are often cyclical in origin, or attributable to
Wall Street overreaction. But not just any fallen stock will do.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, he wants no debt on the company's balance sheet, to
minimize risk. For much the same reason, he also wants companies
that sell for two to four times the cash on their balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cash is particularly important because when you buy near a
stock's low, there's a company-specific or industry-specific
problem,'' he said. ``The cash gives us some confidence that the
company will have time to correct its problem.'' In general, he
expects a company he buys to be back on its feet again within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's own cash position has fluctuated recently. Perkins
let cash levels rise to 20 percent three months ago and, then went
on a stock-buying spree after the market fell. Cash was down to 5
percent by late October but has since rebounded to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small stocks are undervalued long term,'' he said, ``but on a
trading basis, the market may be a little ahead of itself, right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he has been buying shares of semiconductor and
telecommunications equipment makers. Last spring, he bought Brooks
Automation, paying an average of $14 a share, compared with a high
of almost $40 in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price was depressed primarily because of slowing Asian
demand and inventory problems, he said. The downturn is cyclical,
Perkins said, adding that he expects profit growth to be in the low
teens by mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the company, currently unprofitable, could earn $1 a
share over the next 12 months. The stock closed on Friday at
$14.25.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline in selling is important, too. Last summer, Perkins
bought shares in Sawtek, a maker of electronic signal processing
components for the telecommunications industry, at 10 times
projected 1999 earnings. He paid an average of $13.40 for the
shares, which had fallen from $49.50 in September 1997, also
because of problems in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   During the market run-up last month, however, he began paring
back his shares, which had jumped nearly 50 percent in value, to 19
times projected 1999 earnings, above his target of 18 or so. He
closed out his position last week at $22 a share.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month or so, he has moved into consumer stocks,
including Wolverine World Wide, maker of Hush Puppies shoes. He
bought shares at an average of $11, down from $30.50 in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the low-priced shoe business is relatively stable,''
he said. ``When Wall Street liked it, Wolverine sold for more than
25 times earnings, and now it's slipped to less than 10 times 1999
earnings.'' He expects that to climb to 15 over the next six
months. The stock now trades at $13.0625.
</P>
<P>
   The relative obscurity of such picks is no accident. ``Not too
many people on the street follow our stocks,'' Perkins said. ``The
lack of sponsorship creates opportunity.''

REBUILDING A PLATFORM FOR THE AMERICAN WORKER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the driving spirit behind the Labor Party, a fledgling
left-of-center group that hopes someday to be a political
heavyweight, Anthony Mazzocchi presided over its constitutional
convention last weekend in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzocchi, the party's national organizer, helped develop its
political platform, full of proposals certain to irk corporate
America: mandatory four-week vacations, a single-payer universal
health care system like Canada's, rollbacks of free-trade
agreements, and a constitutional amendment guaranteeing every
American a job that pays a living wage.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the union stalwarts in the party, Mazzocchi, an
official with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union, freely
uses class-tinged language that seems a throwback to the 1930s. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How would you describe the Labor Party and its
goals?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I remember a period when the labor movement helped shape the
nation's debate. I would like to see where the labor movement is
once again the driving force for the future direction of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party is a working-class party. I don't think we have
to be afraid of class. Our interests diverge from those of the
corporations. This is a corporate economy and we're not going to
change that overnight. Our vision is that of a social democratic
party similar to the ones in Europe. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)You and other Labor Party members spend a lot of
your time denouncing corporations. Are you anti-corporate?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, that's fair to say. Our attitude is anti-corporate,
although we're not calling for the elimination of corporations.
We're saying corporations have had their way at the expense of the
average person. I think of how far the wealth of the nation has
shifted to a small percentage of the populations.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations can't change. A corporation has to act in its own
self-interest. It has nothing to do with evil intentions or good
intentions. Its own self-interest dictates it has to be
exploitative. It has no loyalty to its workers. It has to maximize
its return.
</P>
<P>
   We're saying corporate behavior has to be regulated with a
political force that says, ``This is what you can do; this is what
you can't do.'' We're saying, if you want to lay off people, those
people have to have a guaranteed income. If you want to move your
plant to Mexico and lay off your workers, you have to pay for those

   A. I grew up in the Depression. On Dec. 7, 1941, my sister was

of the world.

<P>
   A. If there was a Republican president, the Democrats never
would have allowed NAFTA to pass. But a Democratic Party that has
the presidency has delivered GATT, NAFTA, welfare reform _ it's the

we should provide income for those who are helpless. It's total
abdication.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party has not initiated any pro-worker
legislation over the past 25 years. Democratic governors have
dumped public employees, cut budgets, privatized, attacked public
workers. Hundreds of thousands are out of work as a result. I think
the perception is there's very little difference between the two
major parties.

CHARTERHOUSE TO BUY STAKE IN TOWING COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN B. ABBEY  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ United Road Services Inc. said Friday that
Charterhouse Group International Inc. will invest $75 million in
the towing concern, acquiring a 25 percent stake in the rapidly
growing company.
</P>
<P>
   News of the deal prompted a BancBoston Robertson Stephens
analyst in San Francisco to upgrade United Road stock to a ``strong
buy'' rating from a ``buy.'' The investment will be in the form of
an 8 percent bond that is convertible into common stock at $15 a
share. That price represents a 9.1 percent premium over United's
Thursday closing price of $13.75. United stock jumped to $15.75
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The investment will come in two parts. The first, of $43
million, will close in approximately two weeks. The remaining piece
will be subject to shareholder approval and is expected to close
early in 1999. The company projects revenues of $160 million this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Merril M. Halpern, chairman of Charterhouse, and Robert L.
Berner III, a Charterhouse managing director, will join United
Road's board.
</P>
<P>
   When the second part of the investment is completed, Michael S.
Pfeffer, a senior vice president of Charterhouse, also will join
the board. Charterhouse is based in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   United Road Chairman Edward T. Sheehan described Charterhouse's
investment as ``a historic milestone'' for United Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charterhouse has achieved significant success investing in
growth companies over the last 25 years,'' Sheehan said in a
statement. ``They have clearly demonstrated with this investment
their confidence in our strategy of aggressively growing our share
of the towing and automobile transport industries, while
simultaneously achieving strong internal growth of acquired
companies and optimizing their future earning performance.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the additional capital should enable United Road to
speed up its plan of acquisitions next year.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern said in a statement that the deal is consistent with
Charterhouse's strategy of ``backing strong management teams of
growth businesses in consolidating industries.''
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming a public company in May, United Road has acquired
27 companies and has consistently exceeded Wall Street earnings
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Berner said Charterhouse has known of Sheehan since it owned a
company in the waste industry that competed against Sheehan.
</P>
<P>
   The New York investors also knew the investment bankers that
Sheehan used, Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, to take United Road
public.
</P>
<P>
   Charterhouse approached an investment in United Road because
with capital markets more difficult for small growth companies,
they are turning to alternative sources of capital, Berner said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the deal appealed to Charterhouse because the industry
is experiencing intrinsic growth, as well as seeing cost savings
from consolidators like United Road. Berner said the auto transport
side of the business is growing 25 percent, while towing is up 10
percent. Charterhouse is one of the oldest buyout shops in the
country, with a record of 67 percent annual rate of return since
1973.
</P>
<P>
   The private investment entity that took the stake in United Road
_ Charterhouse Equity Partners III _ raised $1 billion in equity
capital from pension funds, states and private institutions for
such deals.
</P>
<P>
   He said Charterhouse has been an owner of companies such as Del
Monte Foods, Fleer trading cards, Charter Communications and
Wham-O. The company owns or has stakes in 20 businesses now.
</P>
<P>
   Berner said Charterhouse board members at United Road will be
watchdogs and advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not there to run the company. We are backing Ed
(Sheehan). Our strategy is to back strong managers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charterhouse will give United Road advice on mergers,
acquisitions, financing and capital structure, as well as provide
contacts to bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Charterhouse currently manages $1.6 billion in private equity
investments through several limited partnerships. United Road now
has 48 service locations in 16 states. Its services include towing,
impounding and storing motor vehicles, conducting lien sales and
auctions of abandoned vehicles and transporting new and used
vehicles and heavy construction equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Andrew Jeffrey said the major factor holding back United
Road's share price has been concern about access to capital and
associated acquisition-driven growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this investment effectively eliminates access to
capital concerns surrounding United Road Services,'' Jeffrey said.
He said the deal offers ``the first tangible evidence'' that the
current earnings per share estimates may be low.
</P>
<P>
   He said United Road shares can reach $21 in three to six months.

ANTIABORTION ACTIVIST MAY BE IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RIC KAHN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The antiabortion activist wanted for questioning in last month's
shooting death of a doctor in a Buffalo suburb may have fled to
Mexico, according to a newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
   James Charles Kopp, 44, of Vermont, was seen in the car of a
female associate crossing the US border days after a sniper killed
Dr. Barnett Slepian in his kitchen, the Buffalo News reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp has been the subject of a manhunt following reports that he
was spotted in a vehicle near the scene of the Oct. 23 slaying of
Slepian, 52, an obstetrician who also performed abortions. The FBI
says Kopp is wanted as a material witness in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, an FBI official said authorities are pursuing more than
400 tips but have not pinned down Kopp's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all candor, the FBI does not know where James Kopp is _
period,'' said Paul Moskal, a spokesman for the bureau's Buffalo
office. ``He's as likely to be in Boston, Massachusetts, as in
Buffalo, New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities want to question the unidentified woman who
allegedly traveled with Kopp, according to an investigator quoted
by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``She may have been with Kopp sometime after the murder,'' the
investigator said. ``Kopp may be in Mexico. He may have even
traveled further into Central America or South America.''
</P>
<P>
   A task force of US and Canadian officials is investigating the
similarities between the attack on Slepian and four others on
abortion providers in Canada and upstate New York in the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
   The US Justice Department is offering a $500,000 reward for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of those
responsible for Slepian's slaying.

 &HT;    EEOC files sexual discrimination suit against Domino's Pizza
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has filed
a sexual discrimination and harassment lawsuit against Domino's
Pizza, saying its employees work in an unfair and hostile
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The federal lawsuit, filed this week in Atlanta on behalf of six
Domino's employees, said Domino's sexually harasses its employees
and discriminates against them on the basis of sex.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed by the EEOC on behalf of Michael Glisson,
Glen Desrosiers, Rita Luter, Angela Taylor, Scott Braswell and
Phillip Nungesser. The lawsuit did not detail alleged wrongdoing,
but said the employees were subjected to a hostile working
environment and unspecified retaliatory tactics by Domino's.
</P>
<P>
   Tim McIntyre, a spokesman for the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based
company, said Domino's management had not yet had time to review
the allegations, and declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages
and a court order requiring Domino's to institute programs that
provide equal opportunities for male and female workers.

 &HT;    Eclipse eclipses sporty rivals
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While other sport and sporty coupes in a variety of
performance and price levels have come and gone (remember the Dodge
Stealth, Ford Probe and the recently axed Acura NSX?), Mitsubishi's
tidy little Eclipse rolls on with a popularity anchored by its
versatility.
</P>
<P>
   Want a looks-good, feels-good sporty car with an entry-level
price? Check out the $15,750 Eclipse RS, which counts a CD player,
full instrumentation and a tilt wheel among its amenities. Want an
aggressive sports car with a convertible top, strong performance
and enough features to make a multidisc CD changer the only
available option? Try the $27,620 Eclipse GS-T, which produces
test-track 0-to-60-mph times of six-plus seconds and has superior
handling.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Japanese/American manufacturer offers six versions
of the Eclipse, which is assembled in Normal, Ill., and shares
Chrysler/Mitsubishi components and styling with the Eagle Talon,
which won't be coming back next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Eclipse, which outsold the Talon version 5-to-1 last year,
is a favorite with both the performance-oriented media and consumer
organizations. Enthusiasts like the $26,550 Eclipse GSX because of
its turbocharged 210-horsepower four-cylinder engine and all-wheel
drive. The more value-minded agree with the cost-conscious
IntelliChoice raters' conclusion that the GSX and GS-T Eclipses are
among the ``best overall value'' cars in their classes.
</P>
<P>
   The deep red test Eclipse GS-T, which totaled $24,818, carried a
mix of the features that make the subcompact so versatile. Its only
options were one must-have item (anti-lock disc brakes for $716)
and one image upgrade (leather seats for $435), while the standard
features included the overblown hooplike rear spoiler, ultra-tight
steering and ride characteristics, a CD player and glass sunroof.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,800-pound GS-T appears chunky, with 16-inch tires, a power
bulge on the hood and a squat stance. The interior is cocoonish,
with scant headroom, better-than-expected visibility and a
driver-oriented layout. Easy-reading white-face gauges, a
five-speed shifter with a throw both short and precise, and nicely
supportive seats make for relaxed or enthusiastic, enjoyable
driving.
</P>
<P>
   Turbo lag, as with most turbocharged engines, is negligible, and
the torque _ 214 pounds-feet at 3,000 rpm _ is nicely dampened by
the steering but has enough range to prevent constant shifting in
speed-up, slow-down traffic. Maneuverability is strong, as are
braking and acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-offs include a rear seat suitable only for cargo and
small children or for torturing adults, a cabin easily penetrated
by road noise, and an independent suspension that assumes the
driver counts seat-of-the-pants sensitivity and input as being
essential to the driving experience. If not, drive the Eclipse
easily on uneven pavement or bring a cushion.
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget, as Automobile magazine suggests, the Eclipse
remains a ``fun to drive'' car distinguished by serious features
that include the availability of all-wheel drive and a
``practical'' price.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS-T front-drive sport
coupe
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $24,818 (base: $23,210)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual air bags, side-impact beams,
height-adjustable front shoulder belts, optional power anti-lock
disc brakes ($716)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with 16
valves (210 horsepower), five-speed manual overdrive transmission
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: leather front seats, $457
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 23 mpg premium unleaded city, 31 mpg highway

NEW YORK RULING ALLOWS JURORS TO TAKE NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Replacing a antiquated tradition with a ``healthy
dose of common sense,'' New York's highest court on Friday said for
the first time that judges can permit jurors to take notes, even
over the objections of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days when most jurors were illiterate and officials
were concerned that the more educated jurors would dominate
deliberations if they were allowed to take notes during a trial,
courts have generally banned, or at least discouraged, note-taking.
However, in recent years, judges have slowly been shifting that
policy, but without the official approval of the state Court of
Appeals. That approval came Friday in the way of a 6-0 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges, lawyers and court clerks typically take notes during
the trial,'' observed Judge Richard C. Wesley. ``In light of the
pervasive use of note-taking by others at trial to manage
information, we are of the view that allowing jurors to take notes
is long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision stemmed from a criminal appeal in which the
convict, a man named Resean Hues, was found guilty of drug charges
by a jury that was allowed _ over the objections of the defense
attorney _ to take notes. Hues' lawyer argued that the judge in
Tompkins County deprived the defendant of his right to a fair
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals disagreed and upheld the conviction.
However, it seized the opportunity presented by the appeal to
address the scope of issues related to juror note-taking, and to
provide a road map to guide judges who are confronted with matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``With appropriate direction from the court, potential abuses
arising form note-taking can be abated,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   That ``appropriate direction'' involves:
</P>
<P>
   _ Explaining to jurors that they should not allow note-taking to
distract them from paying attention to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   _ Admonishing jurors that their notes are only an aid and are
not evidence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reminding jurors that the official transcript is always
available to them, and always prevails over any juror's notes.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 22)

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's alive! The savings and loan debacle, which has
cost taxpayers $165 billion, is about to become more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   That may come as a surprise to those who thought the costliest
bailout in American history was long completed, as much a ghost of
the 80s as Rubik's cubes, break dancing or perestroika.
</P>
<P>
   But two years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that the government
had betrayed investors by changing the rules of the bailout at the
height of the savings and loan crisis. And now, a little-known
federal court here is getting ready to begin assessing the costs _
a sum that could add up to anywhere from $4 billion to $50 billion,
depending on which side is guessing.
</P>
<P>
   In the first big test case, the chief JUdge of the United States
Court of Federal Claims is expected to decide by year-end the size
of the award to a California savings and loan that nearly collapsed
after federal accounting rules were changed in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Loren A. Smith, has already indicated that he will
order a sizable judgment for the savings and loan, Glendale Federal
Bank, which is seeking $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That could set a standard for a parade of cases _ the first of
more than 120 brought by existing and moribund savings associations
and by shareholders _ that are set for trial over the next few
months. The exact size of the awards is likely to be determined by
appeals courts. But this much is certain: Whatever the tab,
taxpayers will pay it, thanks to a two-paragraph provision that
lawmakers buried in last month's appropriations legislation at the
behest of savings and loan lobbyists, who feared either that the
government would not pay or that the industry might end up being
saddled with the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, who supported the move, calculate that
every $1 billion awarded to the industry will cost each American
household $10. And as awards against the government mount,
decade-old questions about Washington's willingness and ability to
tackle the savings industry's problems are certain to be revived.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating their importance and complexity, the savings and
loan cases have engaged legions of lawyers _ the Justice Department
is devoting more resources to them than to any other matter,
including the Microsoft antitrust case. Some unusual battle lines
have been drawn: Two federal agencies are on opposing sides, and
two Nobel Prize-winning economists have been pitted against each
other on the meaning of their own collaborative work. In the end,
huge payouts may go to some of the nation's wealthiest and most
aggressive financiers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, after loosened lending rules and a real estate
collapse left many savings associations buried in bad loans,
regulators decided that the cheapest way to heal the lenders was to
encourage them to merge with healthier institutions or find new
investors.
</P>
<P>
   So regulators struck deals with, among others, Ronald O.
Perelman, who had bought Revlon with junk bonds; the Bass family of
Texas; Jay A. Pritzker, whose family controls Hyatt hotels, among
other properties; Lewis Ranieri, the investment banker credited
with inventing mortgage-backed securities, and William E. Simon,
the former Treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Later, many of the deals were criticized in Congress as being
overly generous. But regulators said that they had no choice,
because Congress had refused to provide money to back the insured
deposits of the rapidly growing list of hemorrhaging institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Now these investors and others who still own shares in the
savings and loans stand to gain from the damage claims. That _ and
the possibility that current and former savings executives may reap
big gains _ would be a remarkable end to a financial calamity that
once stigmatized the industry as a haven for incompetent managers
and financial scoundrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1989, there was no way these people would be paid,'' said
Robert E. Litan of the Brookings Institution. ``The political
environment was terrible for them. Now they're no longer demonized.
This was like the appendix of a lot of the deals of the 1980s. Now
the appendix has burst and someone's got to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   The precedent that made such awards possible is known as the
Winstar case, named after the consolidation of suits brought by the
Winstar Corp., the Statesman Group and Glendale Federal. In July
1996, a splintered Supreme Court ruled that the 1989 legislation
that rescued the savings and loan industry also broke the contracts
that the institutions' salvagers had made with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Those contracts, aimed at attracting investors, had given the
savings and loans permission to use an unusual accounting rule that
had the effect of letting many institutions satisfy their capital
requirements by booking huge liabilities as assets.
</P>
<P>
   The rule allowed the buyers of weakened institutions to take the
difference between their purchase price and the market value of the
institution and count that as an asset, calling it ``supervisory
goodwill.'' Since the price often consisted of the assumption of
the insolvent institution's liabilities, the move converted
liabilities into capital that could satisfy regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to use such accounting led new investors and other
savings associations to infuse new capital into the weaker savings
and loans. The rule, however, was heavily criticized by some
experts as a gimmick destined to lead to greater bailout costs some
day.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals judge ultimately referred to supervisory
goodwill as ``a euphemism for spinning straw into gold.''
</P>
<P>
   As the savings and loan crisis reached a fever pitch in 1989,
the accounting arrangement was phased out by tough legislation
endorsed by President George Bush and approved by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, the law's provision ending supervisory goodwill
turned what had appeared to be healthy balance sheets into ones
that could not meet minimum capital requirements. Many institutions
collapsed. Others tottered on the edge of failure or were bought by
healthier companies, resulting in further consolidation.

FLEET FINANCIAL TO PURCHASE SANWA LENDING UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fleet Financial Group Inc. is expected to announce on
Monday an agreement to buy Sanwa Bank Ltd. of Japan's Chicago-based
commercial leasing and lending unit for up to $750 million, people
close to the deal said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet will blend the Sanwa unit, Sanwa Business Credit, into its
own commercial finance and leasing group, Fleet Capital Corp. The
Sanwa unit is an asset-based lender and lessor specializing in
vendor, equipment, and term-debt finance, cash-flow lending, and
capital-asset finance.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will add $6.5 billion in assets to Fleet's $9 billion
commercial lending unit.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street investment bankers had whispered for weeks that
Boston-based Fleet and other financial companies were eyeing the
Sanwa unit, but bidders were put off by Sanwa's original asking
price of about $1.5 billion, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction signals that acquisitions in the financial
services sector, which proceeded at a hot pace earlier this year
but fell off as markets wobbled, have picked up again. Lower asset
prices and a renewed flurry of deals in recent weeks have helped.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of its home-based counterparts, Sanwa, Japan's fourth
largest bank, is teetering under billions of dollars of soured
loans. The bank, which is participating in Japan's massive bailout
of the financial system, moved to sell its US-based commercial
finance unit to raise cash to cope with its debt.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, the nation's nineth largest bank holding company, had
built up a war chest of cash to finance acquisitions from a recent
share issue. Bank spokesman James Mahoney declined to comment on
the Sanwa deal, first reported Friday by The New York Times and The
Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the acquisition reflects moves by Fleet chief
executive Terrence Murray to recreate on a larger scale a strategy
he launched in the early 1980s, when Fleet was a small, Rhode
Island-based bank. Since then, as growth in traditional commercial
banking has slowed, Fleet has expanded into nonbanking activities,
including credit cards, leasing and lending, stockbroking, and
investment management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there are some credit-issues at Sanwa that worry
me,'' said Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. analyst Nancy A. Bush. But she noted
that Fleet had a huge loan-loss reserve of $1.5 billion and could
absorb any bad loans from the Sanwa unit.

 WASHINGTON: further consolidation.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the industry soon unleashed its barrage of lawsuits,
essentially accusing Washington of having perpetrated an enormous
bait-and-switch.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1996 ruling, a controlling plurality of the Supreme Court
essentially agreed. Justice David H. Souter dismissed the Clinton
administration's arguments that the contracts did not provide
insurance against a legislative change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would, indeed, have been madness,'' Souter wrote, for the
industry to have entered into the contracts without some guarantee
that they were enforceable, ``for the very existence of their
institutions would then have been in jeopardy from the moment their
agreements were signed.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling breathed new life into the savings and loan lawsuits,
which were sent back to the claims court to set damages and resolve
other issues. Since the decision, the Justice Department has
quietly offered settlements of hundreds of millions of dollars to
some institutions. But the companies are waiting to see whether
Smith and his colleagues will be more generous.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's lawyers, along with Smith, have criticized the
Justice Department as moving slowly in settling the claims. They
have accused government lawyers of dragging their feet and
re-arguing issues that they say were resolved years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many respects the Justice Department's positions have been
frivolous and served only to delay progress in these cases and add
enormously to the expense,'' said Charles J. Cooper, a former
senior Justice official whose law firm represents more than a dozen
savings associations and former owners of savings and loans. ``It's
deepened the uncompensated damages that American citizens are
suffering as a direct breach of their contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Justice Department has challenged the damage
claims as pie-in-the-sky figures that have no basis in contract
law. Its sharpest attacks are aimed at perhaps the suits' most
costly assertions _ that companies like Glendale Federal are
entitled to recover all the profits they would have made if the
rules had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is real money,'' said Frank W. Hunger, the assistant
attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's civil
division. ``And it's not money that is being sought for anything
productive, like education, housing or the Peace Corps. We're
simply not going to pay out billions of taxpayer dollars when there
are bona fide legal issues involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is devoting an extraordinary amount of
resources to the cases. Some 40 lawyers and a support staff of
dozens more have been working full time with an annual budget of
$60 million, nearly half the civil division's total.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, too, have been spending freely. For instance,
Glendale Federal, a unit of Golden State Bancorp, has used two law
firms and spent more than $43 million on its case since 1996,
according to company records on file at the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Because more than 40 of the institutions suing the government
are insolvent, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has also entered
the fray, assigning about three dozen of its lawyers to intervene
in the cases. Like a dog chasing its tail, the government now has
one agency, the Justice Department, as a defendant, and another _
the FDIC _ aligned with the plaintiffs in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has asserted that the FDIC, which also
administers a fund from which some of the judgments may be paid,
cannot in effect make claims on itself. ``It is a fundamental axiom
that the United States cannot sue itself,'' the Justice Department
said in a brief.
</P>
<P>
   The FDIC has replied that it must pursue the cases because of
its legal obligations as a receiver, representing the institutions
that collapsed. The agency's lawyers are concerned that if they
fail to intervene, the agency could be liable to shareholders and
creditors. But as a practical matter, much of what it hopes to
recover will result in the simple shift of money from one
government account to another.
</P>
<P>
   The interagency warfare is just one of the strange battles these
cases have spawned. In another notable conflict, two Nobel
Prize-winning collaborators have disagreed on whether their shared
work applies to the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Merton H. Miller of the University of Chicago, who won
the Nobel in 1990, testified for the government that the
Modigliani-Miller Theorem, or M&AMP;M Propositions, which are the
foundation of modern corporate finance, demonstrated that the
industry's claims were wildly overstated. He said that under the
theory, the reduction of supervisory goodwill did not reduce the
value of a savings association and that the profitability of the
company did not depend on its level of goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you phase out goodwill, you're are not taking away any
earning asset,'' Miller testified as a $1,000-an-hour Justice
Department expert. ``You are not taking away anything but
accounting smoke and mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed by Glendale's sister institution, California
Federal Bank, the industry responded with its own $1,000-an-hour
expert: Professor Franco Modigliani of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, the other ``M'' in the propositions, who won the
Nobel in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have decided to testify in this case because my name is
associated with the M&AMP;M Propositions, and, in my view, they are
being misused by the government in a way that I regard as damaging
to the credibility of the theorem,'' Modigliani wrote in his expert
report. ``The truth is that the M&AMP;M Propositions are completely
irrelevant to the present issue and have been dragged in as a red
herring.''
</P>
<P>
   At ground zero in the cases is Loren Allan Smith, 53, the judge
who eight years ago wrote the first opinion in the Winstar case
that gave the industry hope that it could ultimately recover what
it had lost in the 1989 legislation. Not only will he decide the
award for Glendale; he has also been issuing significant rulings on
the common issues in the 120-plus cases and has begun to assign
some of the dozen cases to be tried, beginning next month. Then the
next batch of 30 lawsuits will be tried.

 WASHINGTON: be tried.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smith, an amateur magician and former host of the radio talk
show ``What's Best for America?,'' entered Washington political
circles as a young lawyer working on President Richard Nixon's
legal team during Watergate. Later, he was chief counsel to Ronald
Reagan's 1976 and 1980 presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Reagan appointed him to the Court of Federal Claims, a
specialized branch of the judiciary that hears disputes between the
government and its contractors as well as claims against the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has earned a reputation as a leading proponent of the
legal proposition that property owners should be compensated for
the costs they incur under federal regulations. He has rattled the
Justice Department, lambasting its legal maneuverings and
suggesting that he is leaning toward a substantial award to
Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   In his seventh-floor office at the claims court, across
Lafayette Park from the White House, the judge said in a recent
interview that his job was to dispense justice, not to protect the
public Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see as much a problem to giving away $1 that isn't deserved
as to give away $100 billion that was deserved,'' he said. ``If
it's the law, so be it. You've got to follow the law whatever the
consequences. It's not the duty of the judiciary to guard the fisc.
A judge's duty is to apply the law fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith will not have the last word. Whichever side loses is
certain to appeal. And another judge about to hear a savings and
loan case has already limited the possible damage claims of a major
plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, in a significant claims court victory for the
government, Judge Robert H. Hodges Jr. ruled that when California
federal's case goes to trial on Dec. 12, it cannot pursue the claim
that it is entitled to collect damages equal to the profits it
would have earned had it been able to continue counting supervisory
goodwill. Hodges called such a theory ``particularly speculative.''
</P>
<P>
   For taxpayers, the crucial turn in the cases came late last
month in Congress. With no debate and no news coverage, lawmakers
decided that taxpayers, not the industry, would have to finance the
judgments from all the cases. And rather than confront large and
politically unpopular damage awards as they are handed down,
legislators also decided to simply keep the spigot to the Treasury
open indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Buried in the appropriations legislation that covers all federal
spending for the new fiscal year, lawmakers inserted two paragraphs
giving the administration the authority to spend ``such sums as may
be necessary.'' As part of a tangled compromise, the provision was
supported by the White House and by savings lobbyists, who had
feared that either the industry might be levied higher deposit
insurance premiums to cover the cases or that the plaintiffs would
not be able to collect on judgments because Congress had not set
aside money for such awards.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also prevailed on Congress to leave uncapped
all spending to defend the lawsuits. Some industry lobbyists had
sought to limit spending or require more oversight by Congress,
hoping to prod the administration into quickly resolving more of
the suits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the cases now headed for trial, the beginning of the end is
finally at hand for the savings and loan debacle. But other
industries are looking for ways to make use of the precedent that
the government may be liable for costs incurred when it changes its
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing electric utilities, telecommunications
companies and developers of low-income housing have begun filing
lawsuits, and health care lawyers say they may be next. Initial
successes indicate that taxpayers may end up facing yet more bills.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, a federal claims judge, citing the Winstar
precedent, ruled that the Department of Energy violated a
commitment to remove used radioactive fuel from a nuclear power
plant owned by the Yankee Atomic Electric Co. In all, utilities
have pending claims of an estimated $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of lawyers who are now trying to shake the
money tree,'' said Joshua I. Schwartz, a professor of law and
co-director of the government procurement program at the George
Washington University Law School.''

RECORD EMPLOYMENT HOLDS BAY STATE JOBLESS RATE AT 3.3 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Near-record numbers of Massachusetts residents held
jobs in October, and an extremely low unemployment rate of 3.3
percent helped encourage more people to enter the work force.
</P>
<P>
   Although the jobless rate was unchanged from September, the
state's Department of Employment and Training reported Friday,
businesses said they added 1,900 employees to their payrolls last
month. The increase pushed the total number employed to a
near-record level of 3.212 million.
</P>
<P>
   Economists widely agree that economic growth is slowing,
nationally and in Massachusetts, as financial and economic
turbulence around the world takes a toll. What is unusual is that
with the unemployment rate at historical lows, even modest growth
in the economy can cause a tight job market to stretch even
further, economist say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you parachuted another 10,000 or 20,000 people into
Massachusetts with skills, they'd be employed almost before they
hit the ground,'' said Nicholas Perna, chief economist, Fleet
Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The slowing in Massachusetts' economy _ it's not simply
running out of steam, it's running out of labor. But these numbers
still paint a picture of a very healthy economy,'' Perna said about
the state report.
</P>
<P>
   For a full year, the state's jobless rate has stayed below 4
percent. National unemployment, by comparison, was 4.6 percent in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The state's biggest gains last month were made in the service
industry, ranging from sophisticated business consulting or
software services to dry cleaning. The service sector in October
added 4,600 jobs and has grown at a 3.6 percent annual rate, much
faster than the general economy, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   A 1,200 job loss occurred last month in the manufacturing
sector, suffering from declining exports. The October job losses
continue a year of contraction in such industries as the
manufacture of industrial machinery, equipment, apparel and
textiles, the state report said.
</P>
<P>
   But other state data confirmed that the overall trend is
positive. In a separate survey, households reported they had a
fourth month of rising employment; the household survey said the
number of people employed rose 5,600 to a new record.
</P>
<P>
   The household survey, which is used to calculate the
unemployment rate, is considered a somewhat less reliable measure
of payrolls than is the business survey.
</P>
<P>
   As more people became encouraged about their employment
prospects, the household survey showed that they are entering the
work force, which grew by 6,800.

CLINTON LEAVES JAPAN WITH NO SIGN OF ECONOMIC PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ President Clinton and Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of
Japan ended two days of talk and ceremony here Friday night with an
affirmation of their national partnership but no evidence of
progress on trade and other economic disputes that are festering
between their countries.
</P>
<P>
   While he appealed to the Japanese to have patience with Obuchi's
plan to revive the economy, Clinton gave little sign of such
patience himself or of optimism that the plan would be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you have to turn a country around it takes more
than you think in the beginning,'' Clinton said, standing beside
Obuchi to address reporters Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the United States, Obuchi announced on
Monday a $195 billion package of spending and tax cuts to increase
investment and consumer demand. The markets shrugged, and in a
meeting Friday with private economists here, the most optimistic
forecast for the Japanese economy heard by Clinton advisers was
that it would shrink by only 1 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Standing with Clinton, Obuchi predicted ``positive growth'' next
year. But Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers offered a
dimmer view at a subsequent briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recognition that there is a risk of slow or negative
growth is why there's a view that it may be necessary over time to
do more,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning Clinton suggested that a surge in exports to the
United States of certain types of Japanese steel might stem from
illegal trade practices. He raised the issue in the afternoon in
meetings with Obuchi but received no specific assurances that
Obuchi would address the problem, Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said that Clinton's concerns over steel ``were very
clearly heard'' and that the Japanese showed an ``awareness here of
the importance of making sure that trade is by the rules in steel
and other sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   In his unusually blunt speech, to the American Chamber of
Commerce, Clinton warned of the possibility of ``retaliatory
protectionism,'' saying that protectionist sentiment could rise in
the United States if its trade deficit continued to grow while
Japan resisted opening its markets.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has frustrated the Clinton administration's hopes to
liberalize trade this year in nine specific economic sectors,
including timber and fishing. The president said Friday that he now
hoped to achieve that goal next year.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also devoted 45 minutes to security, including what
Clinton in his public remarks called ``disturbing signs'' in North
Korea. The administration, which has been criticized in the region
as letting its policy on North Korea drift, is worried that North
Korea may be preparing to build a plant for nuclear weapons at a
vast new underground site, in violation of a 1994 agreement. The
United States wants to inspect the site, but the North Koreans
informed an American representative this week that they would grant
such an inspection only in exchange for hundreds of millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to reporters, Clinton called such conditions
``completely unacceptable.'' He said North Korea's intentions
remained mysterious and that it was unclear whether ``they're
attempting to get more money out of various countries for doing
what they ought to be doing anyway or whether they really are
moving toward a more hostile posture.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew Friday night for a two-day visit to South Korea.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ If ever an academic department was hot, it was
the English department at Duke University in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, when it was famously reinventing itself. Recruiting
star professors, it bounded up the national rankings and became for
a time the capital of cutting-edge literary studies as well as many
a conservative's favorite example of academic excess.
</P>
<P>
   The department's biggest names included Stanley Fish, its
flamboyant chairman; Frank Lentricchia, whom The Village Voice once
called ``the Dirty Harry of contemporary critical theory;'' Eve
Kosovsky Sedgwick, co-founder of the growing academic field of
``queer theory,'' and, fleetingly, Henry Louis Gates Jr., now the
ubiquitous chairman of Afro-American studies at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past year, the department has appeared to be
self-destructing. Professors have been at war with each other. Many
of the best-known have left. When an external review team paid a
routine two-day visit last spring, it reported having found the
department ``without anything we would be disposed to describe as
an undergraduate or graduate curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the university has placed the department in something
resembling receivership, overseen by an executive committee (headed
by a dean from the botany department who is an authority on plant
respiration). The committee is overseeing the search for a new
department chairman and the first of perhaps a half-dozen new
professors to replace the ones who have left.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the department can come up with three to six excellent
hires, that will signal to the rest of the academic community that
this enterprise is still in business and at the same high level,''
said Fish, now white-haired and 60, who is preparing to leave Duke
next month to become a dean at the University of Illinois in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we blow it _ and I don't know why we would, but if we were
to blow it _ then after about a year or two another word will
settle in. And this will be the word that, `Well, that was nice
while it lasted but it's over.'''
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval at Duke offers a glimpse into the arcane world of
an academic department, one in which the ideological, generational
and personality differences of its 40 members became the dividing
lines in bitter skirmishes over hiring and tenure, graduate-student
admissions and the distribution of departmental tasks and perks.
</P>
<P>
   As some professors see it, the story is a cautionary tale for
universities hoping to emulate Duke's success in building a
national reputation by strategically hiring star scholars; they say
the department's problems stem in part from resentments that took
root after celebrated outsiders never became fully integrated into
departmental life.
</P>
<P>
   But Duke's difficulties also reflect tensions in English
departments nationwide at a time when many have been struggling to
redefine their mission. Where most once agreed that their primary
role was the passing down of an agreed upon heritage of classic
literary texts, that rationale has been challenged in recent
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the postmodern world, some of those working within
literature are using literature as an instrument to try to affect
social change,'' said James Applewhite, a 63-year-old poet and
English professor at Duke. ``I think the problem of our department
was, in the new era, once literature becomes politics, then
politics is a matter of contention rather than consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, five full professors, including Fish and Ms. Sedgwick, are
leaving or have left Duke. In addition, Lentricchia has switched
departments; another English professor has become a vice provost.
Their reasons for defecting vary, but they include the dissension
within the department, unhappiness with its leadership and
opportunities elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the department quite an unpleasant place by the time I
left,'' said Ms. Sedgwick, who said she had moved to New York City
in part to be nearer her husband after learning that she was
experiencing a recurrence of an old cancer. ``I would say
two-thirds of the decision had to do with my loss of respect for
the department I was in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the announcements, the review team arrived for
the department's five-year check-up. Four English professors from
other major research universities spent several days meeting with
members of the department who, said Cathy Davidson, a Duke English
professor, used the occasion ``almost as a confessional and went in
and just sort of evacuated.''
</P>
<P>
   In late May, the team delivered its findings in a confidential
report (leaked posthaste to a student newspaper). The department
was ``in a seriously weakened condition,'' the group wrote. Morale
was ``desperately low.'' Dislike for the chairman, Marianna
Torgovnick, a protege of Fish, was pervasive; some professors
wanted her term cut short ``at whatever emotional and professional
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not to say that the department lacks excellent
faculty,'' the report said. ``But the current department, except by
virtue of its afterglow, cannot reasonably be considered
top-ranked.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early 1980s, the Duke department was a traditional
sort of place. Its members were mostly men, mostly white, mostly
getting on in years: interpreters of literary figures, writers on
esthetic themes, relatively untouched by the intellectual trends
transforming their field. The department seemed in danger of
becoming an old boys' club.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to raise Duke's profile, the university administration
decided to build up the English department. In 1984, it lured
Lentricchia away from Rice University. At his suggestion, it
recruited Fish from Johns Hopkins to head the English department
and Fredric Jameson, the Marxist critic and literary theorist, to
run the program in literature.
</P>
<P>
   They in turn recruited more stars: Barbara Herrnstein Smith, who
was about to become president of the Modern Language Association;
Janice Radway, who had recently studied the romance-novel genre;
then Ms. Davidson, Ms. Sedgwick and Gates, along with Lee Patterson
and his wife, Annabel Patterson, both now at Yale. Ms. Sedgwick is
a pioneer in ``queer theory,'' an approach to literature that goes
into the study of sexuality and refuses to divide the world neatly
into homosexual and heterosexual.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the department was seen as a hotbed of literary
theory. In the area of gender and literature, U.S. News and World
Report would eventually rank the graduate program first in the
country. Graduate student applications increased four-fold between
1985 and 1991. The department vaulted upward in the National
Research Council rankings, from 27th in the country to 5th. (And
certain attributes of Fish found their way into the work of his
friend, David Lodge, the author of several novels satirizing
academic life.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, an external review team reported with admiration: ``We
were struck by the chorus of testimony we heard from faculty
outside the department that English has become a kind of engine or
life-pump for the humanities at Duke, a supplier of intellectual
energy and stimulation for the university at large. It is not easy
to produce changes of this sort.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit is widely given to Fish. In six years as chairman, Fish
kept the university's resources focused on the department, acquired
for it prime office space in the Gothic building that houses the
president's office, and presided over what one administrator called
``a high-maintenance bunch of people, let me tell you'' with such
apparent impartiality that even potential enemies came to believe
he had the department's best interests at heart.
</P>
<P>
   His style was not, however, notably democratic. He is said to
have abolished the department's bylaws. (As he tells it, there were
no bylaws when he arrived; he simply swept away rules that were
making people unhappy.) His preferred leadership method was working
the halls. Asked when he was going to hold a meeting, he answered,
``When there are no more issues.''
</P>
<P>
   There were always more issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in some ways a classical pitched field of postmodern
versus more traditional types of scholars and critics,'' said
Reynolds Price, the novelist and a member of the department since
1958. ``The general good will that Stanley inspired made those
differences seem a good deal less important than they turned out to
be when Stanley wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   The strain became increasingly apparent in the years after Fish
stepped down as chairman in 1992. Camps and cliques took shape. The
various factions were shifting and difficult to define, but many
believe they were determined, at least in part, by degrees of
enthusiasm, or lack of it, for such areas of study as gender and
sexuality, African-American studies and theory.
</P>
<P>
   To some, like Lentricchia, the department had become dominated
by ideologues who measured the quality of one's scholarship by
whether it was ideologically correct. To others, there appeared to
be, as Ms. Sedgwick put it, ``a whole group of faculty who really
felt that the department was too theoretical, too queer, too
African-American.''
</P>
<P>
   Open warfare broke out over such things as hiring, promotions,
graduate student admissions and issues like which faculty members
had money to bring in outside speakers. There were also longer-term
resentments about teaching-load disparities and a perception that
some stars bore little of the administrative burden.
</P>
<P>
   The antagonisms became especially bitter after Ms. Torgovnick
took over in 1996 and, her critics say, adopted Fish's
authoritarian style without his charm. They accuse her of having
favored her friends, manipulated meetings, even doctored minutes _
all charges she denies. People in every camp ended up feeling like
members of an embattled minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that all the problems are solely the result of
her mismanagement,'' said Michael Valdez Moses, a 41-year-old
associate professor who describes his field of specialization as
Anglophone post-colonial literatures. ``But it's certainly the case
that she made what would be by any stretch of the imagination a
difficult situation into an impossible, particularly ugly one.''
</P>
<P>
   What kind of department will emerge is unclear. The curriculum
may become somewhat more structured than in the past. But many in
the department are skeptical that the curriculum is really a
problem, since the Duke department is more successful than most in
landing graduate students in scarce academic jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Many are equally dubious about the review committee's complaint
that they lack an ``overarching departmental mission,'' a vision of
what the department wants to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   `If there is an English, French or literature department in the
country that has found the new sense of mission and given it a good
formulation, it has a very marketable product because lots of other
departments would want to buy the kit,'' Fish said. ``But I don't
myself know of any. So the lack of clear mission is a feature, I
believe, now of the profession and not just this department.''

TOYOTA EARNINGS FALL 20 PERCENT IN HALF-YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Not even solid sales in the United States and a weak yen
that made those sales more valuable could save Toyota Motor Corp.,
Japan's largest car manufacturer and one of its most financially
sound companies, from a decline in profits.
</P>
<P>
   Expenses largely unrelated to Toyota's core auto business
chipped away at the company's consolidated earnings, which fell 20
percent, to 192.6 billion yen, or $1.6 billion at current exchange
rates, in the six months that ended Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Of Japan's top five car manufacturers, only Honda Motor Co.,
which derives three-quarters of its sales outside Japan, and Mazda
Motor Corp. posted profit increases in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Sales increased 11.4 percent, spurred by gains in North America
and Europe, and income on an operating level crept up 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota's operating profits on a stand-alone basis inched
forward, albeit by a scant 0.1 percent, as cost-cutting measures
and higher exports offset a 14.4 percent decline in its domestic
car sales.
</P>
<P>
   But higher depreciation costs due to plant expansion in the
United States and Canada, and other non-auto-related expenses, such
as a paper loss on the company's securities portfolio and losses on
stakes it holds in 62 companies on a nonconsolidated basis, led to
a drop in bottom-line profits.

WOODWARD LAWYER NAMED IN SUIT BY STATE TROOPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The State Police sergeant who arrested former Louise
Woodward attorney Elaine Whitfield Sharp on drunken driving charges
in May Friday filed a slander and civil rights suit against the
lawyer and her husband for claiming the trooper fabricated evidence
and sexually molested her during the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In a 21-page complaint filed in Suffolk Superior Court, Sergeant
Randy J. Cipoletta and his family contend Whitfield Sharp and
Daniel S. Sharp _ both of whom are lawyers _ damaged Cipoletta's
reputation, harmed his family life, and nearly cost him his job by
filing a false internal affairs complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elaine Whitfield Sharp acted in an aberrant &UR;  &LR; manner and made
untrue and slanderous statements'' about Cipoletta to the press,
and to State Police internal affairs investigators, according to
the lawsuit. Her husband also made ``false, defamatory'' statements
he knew ``were false,'' the suit alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Sharp, who had not read the lawsuit throughly Friday,
dismissed it as ``garbage'' and a ``vindictive'' action by a
trooper interested in punishing lawyers who have sued the State
Police and other law enforcement agencies for misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an opportunity to say something nasty,'' Daniel
Sharp said in a telephone interview from his Marblehead law office,
``Not only nasty, but fictious.''
</P>
<P>
   Cipoletta arrested Whitfield Sharp on drunken driving charges on
May 22 around 9 p.m. in Lynn. Whitfield Sharp's arrest received
widespread attention because of her connection to Woodward, the
former British au pair, but also because Cipoletta quoted her in
his arrest report as saying she drank because she believed Woodward
was guilty of killing 8-month-old Matthew Eappen.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 27 press release, Whitfield Sharp denied she said that.
She said the trooper ``concocted a story'' about Woodward to shore
up a weak arrest. Daniel Sharp told the Globe the trooper ``created
this cockamamie cock-and-bull story.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cipoletta now alleges in his lawsuit that Whitfield Sharp
was drinking at Parker's Bar in the Parker House hotel in downtown
Boston in the hours before she was arrested. A person overheard her
at the bar saying ``she thought Louise Woodward was guilty and that
she was having trouble dealing with it,'' according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, Cipoletta said that Whitfield Sharp was verbally
abusive towards him, other troopers and struck a female EMT who had
been called to examine her after she fell on the floor of the State
Police station and started ``thrashing wildy'' about.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield Sharp sought a State Police internal affairs
investigation, alleging that Cipoletta ``fondled her breasts'' and
offered to release her in return for sexual favors, according to
the lawsuit. State Police cleared Cipoletta earlier this month.
Whitfield Sharp did not talk with internal affairs investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield Sharp admitted in Lynn District Court May 26 that
there was sufficient evidence to convict her of drunken driving and
agreed to undergo alcohol counseling and to serve one year on
probation. Whitfield Sharp, who hosted Woodward's family for
months, was fired by Woodward's defense team June 1 for what they
called ``aberrant behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Cipoletta said he would sue Whitfield Sharp and her
husband unless she apologized. Since no apology was made, Cipoletta
decided to sue, said his attorney, Timothy M. Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ``To simply walk away after he's been through hell for the last
five months _ with the threat of losing his job, when he had
afforded the parties an opportunity to simply apologize _ is
something that I don't think anybody would choose to do,'' Burke
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Sharp said he called Burke's office once in May, but got
never heard back. Burke said he has no record of any telephone call
from Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't return my phone call,'' Daniel Sharp said. ``That
shows you how sincere they are. It just shows you that this is all
vindictive.''

AGENCY BUY BOOSTS ARNOLD IN NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A division of Arnold Communications, New England's
largest advertising agency, said Friday it has acquired Berenson
Isham &AMP; Partners in a union that could result in one of the larger
direct-marketing firms in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to size, the transaction would give the Arnold
division, known as Wickersham Hunt Schwantner, added depth in
on-line marketing and electronic commerce, two areas that Berenson
Isham has specialized in.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed but the price was
believed to be around $3 million. The direct-marketing industry is
in the process of rapid consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   When Berenson is absorbed into Wickersham, the combined
operation is expected to generate annual capitalized billings of
about $160 million. Both firms are based in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition should propel Wickersham into the top 20 of US
direct-marketing firms, according to a company press release.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Wickersham ranks as a distant second behind
direct-marketing giant Bronner Slosberg Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Arnold was bought by Maryland-based Snyder
Communications Inc., which has been acquiring direct-marketing
firms left and right.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder's strategy is to assemble a menu of global marketing
services that Fortune 500 companies can use to make sales pitches
to consumers in a variety of media channels, including TV, print,
direct mail, and the World Wide Web, said GS2 Securities analyst
John P. Larson.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder is hardly alone in making acquisitions to pursue such a
strategy. Many communications companies are under pressure from
their clients to upgrade direct-marketing skills, and buying up
independent direct-marketing firms is one result, said Michael
Bronner, chairman of Bronner Slosberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a feeding frenzy of acquisitions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps best known for the marketing of prescription drugs,
Snyder wants to broaden its scope beyond the pharmaceutical
industry, Larson said.
</P>
<P>
   With such clients as Fidelity Investments, the Financial Times,
and Club Med, Bersenson would not only help Snyder to fulfill that
goal, but also it gives Wickersham more expertise in the
increasingly important fields of electronic commerce and
interactive marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Wickersham, whose clients include Media One, Bose Corp., and
Arbella Mutual Insurance Co., has a ``fledgling'' presence in those
areas, but buying Berenson will make it a ``full-force'' player,
said Amy Hunt, a managing partner at Wickersham.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for Berenson's 20 staffers to move into Wickersham's
offices early next year. While the Berenson nameplate will
disappear, there will be no layoffs, Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition may alter the direct-marketing landscape
locally, but it's just another deal for giant Snyder, which is
expected to report about $740 million in 1998 revenues.

NEW YORK RULING ALLOWS JURORS TO TAKE NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS lede to add dropped word; pickup2ndgraf: Since the.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Replacing an antiquated tradition with a
``healthy dose of common sense,'' New York's highest court on
Friday said for the first time that judges can permit jurors to
take notes, even over the objections of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days when most jurors were illiterate and officials
were concerned that the more educated jurors would dominate
deliberations if they were allowed to take notes during a trial,
courts have generally banned, or at least discouraged, note-taking.
However, in recent years, judges have slowly been shifting that
policy, but without the official approval of the state Court of
Appeals. That approval came Friday in the way of a 6-0 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges, lawyers and court clerks typically take notes during
the trial,'' observed Judge Richard C. Wesley. ``In light of the
pervasive use of note-taking by others at trial to manage
information, we are of the view that allowing jurors to take notes
is long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision stemmed from a criminal appeal in which the
convict, a man named Resean Hues, was found guilty of drug charges
by a jury that was allowed _ over the objections of the defense
attorney _ to take notes. Hues' lawyer argued that the judge in
Tompkins County deprived the defendant of his right to a fair
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals disagreed and upheld the conviction.
However, it seized the opportunity presented by the appeal to
address the scope of issues related to juror note-taking, and to
provide a road map to guide judges who are confronted with matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``With appropriate direction from the court, potential abuses
arising form note-taking can be abated,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   That ``appropriate direction'' involves:
</P>
<P>
   _ Explaining to jurors that they should not allow note-taking to
distract them from paying attention to the trial.
</P>
<P>
   _ Admonishing jurors that their notes are only an aid and are
not evidence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reminding jurors that the official transcript is always
available to them, and always prevails over any juror's notes.

COMMENTARY: GO FOR IT! 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Its love affair with Monica at long last over, TV has turned
nasty. Only 15 minutes into Kenneth Starr's two-hour-plus monologue
_ the ``Meet Joe Black'' of testimony, as one Hollywood observer
described it _ the NBC affiliate in New York pulled the plug and
switched to Sally Jessy Raphael. The same happened on other
channels, in other cities, including Washington itself. In Seattle
the local NBC station had to yank the impeachment hearings to quell
a popular uprising: Viewers were on the phone demanding a return to
regularly scheduled programming.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, when the Starr-Kendall confrontation at last
arrived, the All Monica cable network MSNBC hyped it as ``the big
showdown,'' a prime-time battle so highly anticipated (said one
commentator) that people might even watch it on pay-per-view. But
none of the Big Three networks aired so much as a minute of it
live.
</P>
<P>
   By this point, as The New York Times' Jill Abramson observed,
Starr had failed to match the star power of John Dean, Oliver North
or Clarence Thomas. Among other miscalculations, the independent
counsel didn't realize that the very words ``Morgan Guaranty'' put
the nation (and visibly yawning congressmen) to sleep. Or that his
own report had hit the best-seller list not because of its
constitutional arguments but because of its vivid descriptions of
oral sex that, as he so painstakingly noted, did not reach
``completion.''
</P>
<P>
   If Starr was going to abstain from sex at this late date, then
of course America was going to change the channel to ``The Young
and the Restless.'' New sex, even old sex, was the only hope of
propping up a hearing with no new information, no new rhetoric, no
changes of heart in any camp and no compelling new characters.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's belated exoneration of President Clinton on Filegate and
Travelgate even killed the hope that such larger-than-life rascals
as Craig Livingstone and Harry Thomason might someday be
cross-examined by Mary Bono.
</P>
<P>
   And Henry Hyde quickly proved himself no Sam Ervin. Constantly
lauded by the Washington media as the soul of judiciousness and
wisdom, the chairman returned the favor Thursday morning by
garnishing his own gravely patriotic opening statement not with a
quotation from Jefferson or Madison or even de Tocqueville _ but
from David Broder. After that, he faded into partisanship and
befuddlement, managing his chaotic show with the wheezy ineptitude
of Bottom putting the Mechanicals through the paces of ``Pyramus
and Thisbe'' in ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   But the real author of this drama was Samuel Beckett. Like the
release this week of the Tripp tapes _ whose contents were known
through transcripts weeks ago _ the hearing was merely a rerun,
peopled by characters who cannot escape repeating the same lines
over and over, poignantly hoping that someone will care, that some
higher force will swoop down to give it all meaning. Unlike the
tramps of ``Godot,'' however, the players in our impeachment drama
DO have an exit (or, in D.C. parlance, an ``exit strategy'') from
their existential dilemma _ if only they have the courage to take
it.
</P>
<P>
   That exit is impeachment. The entire country knows _ and has
known since January _ that Bill Clinton lied under oath about his
sleazy affair with Monica Lewinsky. No Democrat on the committee
defended the president's behavior Thursday, because it is, quite
simply, indefensible. The Republicans, meanwhile, keep lecturing us
that a presidential perjurer is not above the law, that the
constitutional process of impeachment should not be derailed by
election results or popular opinion, etc., etc. _ so why not just
put their votes where their mouths are and go for it? The GOP has
the majority _ a bigger majority now than it will have in January _
and can easily cancel the Hyde reruns tomorrow, without fear of
public complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Since there is neither new evidence nor new arguments that will
change the political equation that has been frozen in place for
months, why not cut to the chase and stand up for principle with an
actual vote?
</P>
<P>
   Should impeachment carry the day, there will be dividends for
everyone. Bill Clinton may finally jump from a 70 to a 100 percent
job-approval rating. Clinton-haters will finally get their day in
court. And the country could be rewarded with a Senate trial so
entertaining that Judge Judy may not know what hit her.

ANALYSIS: CLINTON STILL NOT EXONERATED ON NON-LEWINSKY MATTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Both Kenneth Starr and the White House agreed
Friday that the independent counsel had ``exonerated'' Clinton on
several matters that Starr had long been investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Exoneration is not, of course, the same as an ethical gold star,
as one legal expert put it, and the exact facts in each of the
matters are different. The White House complained that Starr was
tardy in disclosing that he had found no wrongdoing on these other
matters and sought to define exoneration broadly, as covering
everything except the Monica Lewinsky saga.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's testimony to the House Judiciary Committee did not go
quite that far.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel said Clinton had done nothing wrong in
two matters, the firing of White House travel office employees and
the improper gathering of FBI files of government officials in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   On Whitewater, where it all started, Starr's testimony fell well
short of clearing the president of wrongdoing. Starr said that he
had prepared a draft impeachment referral on Whitewater late last
year, but decided not to forward it to the Congress because he was
unsure whether the credibility of the witnesses against Clinton was
sufficient to make a strong case.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor's failure to bring charges is not the same thing as
granting a public official a clean bill of ethical health, lawyers
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a distinction between not being charged and being
exonerated,'' said Irvin Nathan, a Washington criminal defense
lawyer who served in the Clinton Justice Department. ``A prosecutor
doesn't give out gold medals for good conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the investigations of the travel office and FBI file
matters, colloquially known as Travelgate and Filegate, closed.
Starr said he is continuing to investigate both matters and could
pursue charges against lower-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, White House officials insisted Starr had cleared the
president on all non-Lewinsky matters. And they complained that he
had been tardy in publicly disclosing his findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conclusions of innocence, no matter how belated, are
important,'' said Paul Begala, one of Clinton's top political
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   On Whitewater, Starr said his prosecutors had difficulty
``establishing the truth with a sufficient degree of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We drafted a report,'' he explained. ``But we concluded that
it would be inconsistent with the statutory standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel cited the cases where he was not still
pursuing the president as evidence of self-restraint. ``We are
proud not only of the cases we won, but also of our decisions not
to indict,'' Starr said, after citing the 14 criminal convictions
he had won on Whitewater, including those of former Justice
Department official Webster Hubbell and former Arkansas Gov. Jim
Guy Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, insisted that Starr's testimony was
tantamount to an admission that he had nothing with which to tar
the president on Whitewater. ``It seems that Ken Starr could not
bring himself to say the words, but a fair reading of yesterday's
statement certainly strongly implies that we're done on
Whitewater,'' said Jim Jordan, a spokesman for the Democratic
minority on the House Judiciary Committee. ``Our members, however,
feel very strongly that Starr was ethically remiss in not
exonerating the president months earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said his attempts to investigate President Clinton and
Hillary Rodham Clinton on Whitewater had been stymied by the
refusal of key witnesses, like Hubbell and Susan McDougal, a former
business partner of the Clintons, to cooperate. Starr indicted
Hubbell for a third time last week and plans to bring Mrs. McDougal
to trial on criminal contempt charges early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while Starr has not uncovered sufficient evidence on
Whitewater to bring criminal charges against the Clintons or
impeach the president, his office is still hoping for a
breakthrough. And while it remains unlikely that pivotal figures
such as Hubbell or Mrs. McDougal will ever supply one to Starr, his
investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   But even Starr pn Friday acknowledged that he had exonerated the
president on several matters, though he was not specific. In a
letter Friday to Samuel Dash, who resigned Friday as Starr's ethics
adviser, Starr wrote, ``And it is important to note that my status
report on the overall investigation included exonerations for the
president on several issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As the recent indictment of Hubbell revealed, Mrs. Clinton is
not completely out of Starr's line of fire. The indictment refers
to her obliquely as the ``billing partner'' on a legal matter that
is at the heart of the new case against Hubbell. Even though it is
thought unlikely that Starr will bring charges against Mrs.
Clinton, he could embarrass her by calling her as a witness in the
Hubbell case.
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on the active aspects of the Whitewater
investigation during his testimony, Nathan said, Starr was making
``a half-hearted effort to show that there was more than Monica.''
He, too, faulted the independent counsel for offering only a
belated exoneration of the president in the travel office and files
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious his investigation concluded long ago that there
was no basis to bring charges on Filegate and Travelgate, '' Nathan
said. ``It was his responsibility to report that at the first
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives, meanwhile, were bitterly disappointed over
how Starr resolved the travel office and FBI files issues. Larry
Klayman, chairman of Judicial Watch, is representing government
officials who charge in a multi-million dollar class action lawsuit
that their files were unlawfully obtained by the White House.
Klayman said that Starr had done an ``unthorough'' investigation of
the travel office and files matters. He said that he has already
deposed about 20 witnesses in his case and that only two of them
had been interviewed by Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes up with virtually nothing,'' Klayman said. ``All he
comes up with is a stained dress. Most conservatives are very
disappointed in Ken Starr.''

MICROSOFT FINDS SILVER LINING IN TOKYO REPRIMAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a yearlong antitrust investigation, Japan's Fair Trade
Commission told Microsoft Corp. Friday to change permanently one of
its marketing practices and pointedly warned the company to watch
its step in the Internet browser market.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the reprimand, the Japanese antitrust agency also
stated that Microsoft's business practices ``cannot be immediately
found to have tended to impede fair competition'' in the market for
browser software in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft focused on that finding Friday as evidence that a
major industrial nation had investigated many of the same practices
as those in dispute in the Microsoft trial in Washington and had
not found an anticompetitive effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finding in Japan is potentially quite interesting from an
American standpoint because the Japanese investigators looked at
the same kinds of things that are at issue in Washington,'' said
Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel for international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also announced Friday that the South Korean Fair Trade
Commission had informed the company two months ago that its
investigation of Microsoft, begun in November 1997, was concluded
and that no further review was expected.
</P>
<P>
   There is no direct link between the several overseas
investigations of Microsoft and the antitrust case being heard in
Washington, where the Justice Department and 20 states have sued
Microsoft. Antitrust experts said that most countries still
investigating Microsoft's practices were taking a wait-and-see
stance toward the company, pending the outcome of the major U.S.
antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Karel van Miert, the European commissioner in charge of
competition policy, said recently that the European Commission was
``closely watching'' the trial in Washington, so for the present,
there was no reason to devote more resources to the European
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting itself is a kind of helpful coordination among
nations,'' said Eleanor M. Fox, a professor at the New York
University Law School. ``And I certainly wouldn't draw the
inference from the Japanese Fair Trade Commission's statement that
Microsoft is off the hook in Japan at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese investigation of Microsoft began in October 1997,
but accelerated sharply on the morning of Jan. 13 when 20 uniformed
police officers swept into Microsoft's offices in the Shinjuku
district of Tokyo. The investigation was stepped up after Joel I.
Klein, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, visited Japan in December. But in
response to a Senate question on the matter, the Justice Department
said that Klein had not encouraged Japan ``to take action of any
kind against Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese antitrust agency did find that Microsoft had been
engaging in an unfair trade practice by bundling its Excel
spreadsheet and Word text program in sales to personal computer
makers. Microsoft began bundling the two products for sales to PC
makers three years ago, after a Japanese rival, Justsystem Corp.,
did the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it began making it easier for PC makers in Japan
to load the two products separately in April, though most PC
companies still preferred the bundled offering. Microsoft says it
has no plans to challenge the Japanese agency's order, which the
fair trade commission terms a ``recommendation.''

   When the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates on
Tuesday, its third cut in seven weeks, it also signaled that it was
done cutting for now, because the markets had largely stabilized
and because widespread hints that the economy was slowing remained
just hints.
</P>
<P>
   Happy to have the cookie but sad that the jar had been closed,
the markets at first reacted tepidly _ which probably suited the
Fed just fine. Minutes of the Sept. 29 meeting of the central
bank's rate-setting committee, released last week, showed members
expressing concern that too big a rate cut would give the markets
the wrong idea about the economy's health by exaggerating the Fed's
worries about a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the markets interpreted the Sept. 29
quarter-point cut as too small, necessitating a between-meetings
cut on Oct. 15 to calm things down.
</P>
<P>
   The economy continued to send mixed signals, with exports to
Asia other than airplanes falling sharply and industrial production
continuing to slip, but housing starts rising smartly. Consumer
prices increased a modest 0.2 percent. &QL;

   Livent, which tried against tradition to be a self-contained
corporate impresario, financing theaters, Broadway musicals and
touring companies with money raised in the securities markets,
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week, three months
after it said it had uncovered substantial accounting problems.
</P>
<P>
   Sunk in the maelstrom were the company's founders, Garth H.
Drabinsky and Myron I. Gottlieb, forced out by Michael Ovitz, the
former Hollywood power who invested in Livent and took over control
of the company six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The leading players immediately set about accusing and suing one
another, with Ovitz saying the founders misled and defrauded him by
spending Livent's money profligately and cooking the books, and the
founders saying that Ovitz and Livent's new chief executive, Roy
Furman, conspired to besmirch them and wreck the company.
</P>
<P>
   Film and television also saw turmoil in executive suites. Frank
Biondi was forced out as chairman of Universal Studios by Edgar
Bronfman Jr., chief executive of Universal's parent, the Seagram
Co. Peter Roth quit the News Corp.'s Fox network last Monday after
a dismal start to its fall season, following by three weeks the
departure of Warren Littlefield from General Electric's NBC. Cable
network veterans appear set to replace Roth and Littlefield. &QL;

   The giant Japanese banks, whose forays into the United States
struck fear into American bankers' hearts not so long ago, have
been brought so low by crushing overhangs of bad loans at home that
they are selling off American operations at a rate approaching
desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the talks said Sanwa Bank was about to sell
its American lending unit to Fleet Financial Group for $700
million, a third of the original asking price. Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi said a big chunk of its majority shareholding in
Unionbancal, a California bank holding company, would go on the
block, though the Japanese bank would retain a controlling stake.

SPACE STATION TAKES GIANT STEP FORWARD AS MODULE ORBITS EARTH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The massive orbital module of the new international
space station circled the Earth in good operating order Friday,
taking the first step in the next phase of space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The 44,000-pound, 41-foot-long spacecraft _ tagged Zarya, or
``sunrise'' in Russian _ will furnish electrical power, maneuvering
propulsion and ground communications during the earliest stages of
the station's six-year construction period.
</P>
<P>
   Its guidance and maneuvering systems are crucial to an automated
orbital rendezvous and docking with the first crew module scheduled
for launching in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A year behind schedule, the launching of Zarya marked a
long-awaited milestone for the United States, which embarked on
developing an international space station in 1984 with Europe,
Japan and Canada. The Russians were added to the project in 1993
following the breakup of the former Soviet Union. The addition gave
the space station new political support, but it also introduced
unprecedented financial uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates from many of the participating nations gathered at
12:40 a.m. CST Friday in Central Asia for launch of the module in
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Momentarily, at least, tensions and uncertainty over what new
wrinkles may be in store for the project abated as a Russian Proton
rocket lifted off flawlessly carrying Zarya from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome.
</P>
<P>
   Within 10 minutes, the module had reached its initial orbit, an
elliptical course that took it to an elevation of 220 miles at its
highest point and 115 miles at its lowest. Communications and
guidance antennas as well as the spacecraft's pair of 35-foot long
electrical power generating solar arrays soon deployed as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The big module, sometimes described as the cornerstone for the
new station, circled the Earth in an orbit that stretches as far
north of the equator as London and nearly as far south as the tip
of South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have 44 launches to go, about a thousand hours of
spacewalks, countless problems and countless issues, but because of
the trust and mutual respect between the United States, Russia,
Europe, Japan and Canada the international space station will
become a reality,'' predicted NASA administrator Dan Goldin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's truly an epoch-making event that has taken place,'' said
Russian Space Agency chief Yuri Koptev, whose organization has
borne the brunt of the financial turmoil. ``The Russian space
effort is alive and well and will continue to be so. We're
perfectly able to meet all our commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   Koptev added a note of thanks to the coalition for its patience
in dealing with his country's financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thank you wholeheartedly for your support and will continue
to be equal to the enormity of the task,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration paid the
Russian's Krunichev State Research and Production Center, an
aerospace company, $240 million to fabricate the module.
</P>
<P>
   Zarya's launch was delayed for a year because of Russia's
chronic funding problems, which delayed development of the
station's third component, the service module, and threatens to
hamper the production of Progress cargo rockets that are needed to
supply the station.
</P>
<P>
   A number of critical activities are scheduled for Zarya in the
coming days, all leading toward the launching of the new station's
second module aboard the U.S. shuttle Endeavour on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The most crucial are tests of Zarya's propulsion system and a
subsequent series of maneuvers that are to raise and round off the
module's altitude to 240 miles by the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvers will set up next month's rendezvous with
Endeavour's U.S. and Russian crew. The shuttle astronauts will
deliver ``Unity, '' a 36-foot long, 26,000-pound cylinder with a
half-dozen docking ports. Together Unity and Zarya will serve as a
structural bridge between future U.S. and Russian segments of the
new space station.
</P>
<P>
   The Endeavour crew plans to use the shuttle's 55-foot-long robot
arm to grapple Zarya and position it so that the module can be
mated to Unity. A pair of shuttle spacewalkers plan three long
excursions to make electrical and data links between the two
modules as well as establish a direct communications channel to
NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Russian mission control center in suburban Moscow
will function as the new station's primary ground link until early
2000. The Russian control team is augmented by a NASA mission
control team from the Johnson Space Center.

IRANIAN FILM CANCELED AFTER THREAT BY J.D. SALINGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under the threat of legal action by representatives
of J.D. Salinger, the Film Society of Lincoln Center announced
Friday that it was canceling a screening of an Iranian film adapted
from Salinger's 1961 book ``Franny and Zooey.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, ``Pari,'' was to have been shown Friday night as part
of three-week festival of Iranian cinema. But Richard Pena, the
programming director for the film society, said his organization
had received a letter Monday warning that screening the film would
constitute a breach of copyright.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said essentially there was no authorization for the
adaptation,'' Pena said. ``We really had no choice but to cancel.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena said the film, made in 1995, had been shown at festivals in
Europe and at a retrospective at Lincoln Center in 1996. ``It was
assumed there was no prohibition on the film,'' he said. ``It's
been around for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   But R. Andrew Boose, a lawyer for Salinger, said the reclusive
writer had only learned of the film's existence last week after
several published articles, including one in The New York Times,
referred to the connection between ``Pari'' and ``Franny and
Zooey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for publicity,'' Boose said. ``They simply
did not seek permission from the copyright owner of the novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal and international copyright law, the copyright
holder has exclusive rights over the original and any derivative
work, including translations, dramatizations and adaptations. The
legal definitions are not exact, however, and knotty disputes are
common, as evidenced recently in the battle over ``Lo's Diary,'' a
takeoff on Vladimir Nabokov's novel ``Lolita,'' told from Lolita's
point of view. Its publication was halted in the United States
after a lawsuit was filed alleging copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pari,'' directed by Dariush Mehrjui, tells the story of three
brothers and a sister confronting the issues of art and religion in
contemporary Iran. In the film, the action of the sister, Pari,
mirrors that of Salinger's character Franny, including her troubled
relationship with her fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   Mehrjui, who is one of his nation's most respected filmmakers,
said he was stunned by the cancellation. ``This reaction is really
quite bewildering,'' he said. ``I don't want to distribute the film
commercially. It's a kind of cultural exchange. I just want to let
the film be seen for the critics and the people that follow my
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The director said the film was indeed ``loosely based'' on
``Franny and Zooey,'' but he added that he had written to Salinger
seeking permission to use the material before making the movie. ``I
wrote him a letter indicating that I was just a small filmmaker
doing an adaptation,'' he said. ``But I did not hear back, so I
just continued and made it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This week's action is not the first Salinger has taken to
protect his work and his privacy. In the 1980s he won a much
publicized case to prevent the publication of a biography by Ian
Hamilton, who had sought to use portions of Salinger's unpublished
correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Salinger's literary and legal representatives
shut down a Web site devoted to the work of the writer, whose most
famous novel, ``The Catcher in the Rye,'' is a staple of high
school and college classrooms nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Salinger's literary agent, Phyllis Westberg, president of Harold
Ober Associates, did not return calls for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For Mehrjui, who said he fell in love with Salinger's writing
while he was an exchange student in California in the early 1960s,
the decision held some ironic value.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our country, we don't have copyrights,'' he said. ``We feel
free to read and do whatever we want.''

CLINTON ARRIVES IN KOREA BESET BY SECURITY PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL _ Hard on the heels of a two-day summit in Japan dominated
by economic woes, President Clinton arrived in South Korea Friday
to confront military and nuclear challenges in a region considered
the most unpredictable security tinderbox in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Tokyo Friday, Clinton said he was quite concerned
by ``disturbing signs'' on the Korean peninsula _ a reference to
North Korea's blocking of weapons inspectors' access this week to
suspected underground nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The stoppage also comes as US intelligence sources say North
Korea is in the process of expanding its missile program, according
to US press reports.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton moves from economic to security issues, he will have
to reassure his South Korean partner, President Kim Dae-jung, of
the US commitment to defending the peninsula. He will also talk to
Kim about the pros and cons of the South Korean leader's softer
``Sunshine Policy'' toward the North, which has included economic
deals and a landmark tourist venture.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not peace, so the
two sides technically remain at war. The United States keeps 37,000
troops stationed in South Korea to defend the Demilitarized Zone
that divides the nations.
</P>
<P>
   The US military commander for Asia and the Pacific, Admiral
Joseph Prueher, recently called North Korea Asia's most
``volatile'' spot, because of ``mercurial decision-making that goes
on in North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By our standards, they don't make rational decisions,'' he
said last month, referring to North Korea's Aug. 31 launch of a
medium-range missile over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   US intelligence officials say the North is building what appears
to be a nuclear facility in Kumchang-ri. A US official said North
Korea demanded that the United States pay $300 million to
compensate for the ``insult'' of inspecting the site _ a condition
Clinton denounced Friday as ``completely unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton acknowledged he didn't know if the request for money
was made because of North Korea's dire economic needs in the face
of widespread famine, or ``whether they really are moving towards a
more hostile posture.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Defense Secretary William Cohen said the United
States would demand access to the site under a 1994 agreement by
North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program in exchange for free
fuel and safer nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean government Friday played down the report. A top
foreign policy official said Friday ``there are suspicions but
there is no firm evidence that it is a nuclear facility. The
official, Lim Dong-won, called media reports ``grossly
exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need calm, patience and magnaminity in dealing with North
Korea, which puts too much emphasis on saving face,'' Lim said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, meanwhile, expressed concern over North Korea's surprise
launching of a missile over Japan three months ago. Japan revoked
its promise to give $1 billion to North Korea for light-water
nuclear power stations, but recently agreed to reinstate the money.
The US gives $35 million a year for oil.
</P>
<P>
   Japan fears North Korea may test-fire another missile capable of
striking Japan. Obuchi Friday called the first launch ``a very
shocking experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo until Friday night, President Clinton patched up
differences with Japan, promising cooperation on both economics and
security. He hailed the US-Japan relationship as ``the cornerstone
of stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.'' That
includes containing any North Korean threat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lauded Japan for aiding financially battered neighbors
and praised Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's $500 billion plan to fix
banks and $196 billion package to stimulate the economy. But mixed
in with kind words was a veiled warning that if Tokyo closes its
markets in response to recession, protectionist backlash in the
U.S. could undermine years of work towards free trade between the
world's two largest economies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the summit brought both sides just what they wanted: it
undid damage done by a year of humiliating US recriminations
against Japan on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, it was a chance to take his case for reviving Japan
through domestic spending and free trade directly to a public wary
of US motives. It was an opportunity to strengthen the US-Japan
security alliance. And it was a chance to act statesmanlike while
avoiding impeachment hearings at home.
</P>
<P>
   For Obuchi, Clinton's stamp of approval was a valuable image
boost for a politician suffering a paltry 18 percent approval rate.
It was a chance to enlist US support on North Korean. And it was a
reminder to rival China _ on the eve of a visit by China's
president next week _ that the US-Japan friendship trumps all
others in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Friday asked Obuchi to shape guidelines that would let
Japan participate more in case of a security theat in Asia. He also
pressed to move a heliport off Okinawa Island to minimize
resentment against US troops there.
</P>
<P>
   On the economy, Clinton continued the upbeat, cooperative tone
he set two days ago, telling a gathering of American and Japanese
business leaders that he wanted to make clear ``something that I'm
surprised there could be any doubt about: The United States wants a
strong Japan, with a strong and growing economy. Japan's prosperity
is vital to our own future.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Japan exchange $200 billion in annual
trade and have more than $600 billion invested in one another's
economies. But the politically sensitive US trade deficit with
Japan is growing _ it stood at $5.1 billion in September _ while
Japanese exports of certain products to the US are ballooning.
That, Clinton warned, is fueling resentment in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   John Neuffer, a political analyst at Mitsui Marine Research
Institute, said, ``Clinton was very effective at winning over the
Japanese people. No big initiative came out of this, but there is
something to be said for Clinton giving a heartfelt peptalk to
Japan; they needed it.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The wondrous innovations of America's technology
companies make them the envy of the world. But for some of the
biggest names in technology, one of the most profitable inventions
is not about computer hardware, software or microchips. It's about
finance, and it is generating hundreds of millions of dollars _
tax-free _ a year.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, Microsoft and, to a lesser degree, Dell Computer sell put
warrants on their own stock to outside investors. The warrants give
buyers the right, for a limited period, to sell shares of stock
back to the company at a set ``strike'' price below the market at
the time they buy. In the quarter ended Sept. 30 alone, Microsoft
took in $225 million from the sale of puts _ a sum equal to 13.4
percent of its net income in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The transactions are ingenious, because tax law makes any
dealings that a company has in its own shares tax-free. And
tax-free income is always nice. But it is a godsend for many
capital-intensive technology concerns, whose operating costs are
often so close to operating income that few generate positive cash
flows. Even companies as mighty as Intel operate close to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   But because the money received in these deals is not detailed on
the income statement, it is unclear whether investors understand
how much the sales can contribute to a company's financial
position. The proceeds show up on statements of cash flows, on
which fewer investors focus.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, when companies are forced to buy back shares, they
often have to use hard-earned money that could otherwise be
reinvested in their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part and parcel of the remarkable degeneration in the
quality of earnings reporting that we have seen in the last two or
three years,'' said Larry Woods, editor of The Technology Review,
an investment newsletter in Stony Creek, Ontario. ``They provide
companies with an inflated bottom line, and they dilute
shareholders' equity.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies that sell puts are betting that their shares won't
fall to the options' so-called strike price during the
transaction's time frame. If they're right, the put expires, and
the company keeps the money paid for it. The buyers of the warrants
are betting that the stock could fall.
</P>
<P>
   But because the company is obligated to buy back its shares from
the outside investors if its stock drops below the strike price,
the warrants are a potential liability.
</P>
<P>
   While Intel reports the potential liability for its warrants _
currently $588 million _ on its balance sheet, Microsoft does not,
so some math is in order.
</P>
<P>
   In notes to its financial statements, Microsoft said it had 75
million put warrants outstanding on Sept. 30. They expire between
March 1999 and September 2001 and have strike prices of $76 to $88
a share.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the average of the two prices, if the company had to buy
back all the stock covered by these warrants, it would spend more
than $6 billion. That's about one-third of Microsoft's net worth
(or shareholders' equity) of $19 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely, of course, that Microsoft's stock will drop from
its current $113.625 to below $76, requiring all the warrants to be
exercised. But it's not out of the question. In January, Microsoft
stock traded at $63.50.
</P>
<P>
   Companies using these programs say they offset some of the costs
associated with aggressive buyback programs that benefit
shareholders. But investors wowed by big jumps in income at
technology concerns would do well to dig beneath the surface to see
if the good news was the result of operations _ or of financial
engineering. &QL;

SCHOOL DIVERSITY ADVOCATES FACE NEW CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With a referendum banning affirmative action in
California, and court rulings effectively doing so in Texas and now
Boston, the question becomes, what can be done to make sure elite
schools and universities reflect the same rainbow as the nation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the solutions being tried haven't quite worked.
</P>
<P>
   Some educators suggest using family income in place of race. But
that doesn't result in racial diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Another policy in Texas automatically accepts the top ten
percent of every high school graduating class to state
universities. But that doesn't necessarily foster racial diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Still others have proposed using a random lottery for all
students above a certain academic threshold. But schools say
achieving diversity this way requires lowering academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, diversity without race-based preferences means
making sure that Hispanic and black students are so well-prepared
beginning in elementary school that they can compete for admissions
to top flight high schools and colleges on grades alone. Yet no
school system in the nation has figured out how to do that.
</P>
<P>
   So as they scheme for the post-affirmative action world,
diversity's supporters say they see only grim scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't any natural equilibrium thats going to give us the
diversity we're after,'' said Scott Miller, head of the College
Board's Task Force on Minority High Achievement &UR; ,  &LR; which includes
Boston school superintendent Thomas Payzant. ``People don't grasp
the scope and scale of the investment required to deal with these
challenges. In the absence of getting a lot more high performing
black kids, and quickly, it's going to be a long time before
admissions decisions are not politically quite divisive.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem arises from a gap in academic achievement between
white and black students at all economic levels, a gap no one has
been able to explain, much less solve.
</P>
<P>
   While affirmative action policies admit the highest-performing
students from a particular race, the alternative most often
proposed is to use class-based preferences: taking the top students
from low income groups, or from families where parents didn't
attend college.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, low-income black students perform worse than
their white low-income peers on the SAT and the National
Educational Assessment Program, the two most widely-used measures
of academic achievement. And middle class black students score
lower than middle class white students, according to the College
Board.
</P>
<P>
   So if schools attempt diversity by taking the best students with
low incomes, they still end up with mostly-white classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Among children of parents with no high school diploma, one
percent of black students scored in the top quartile, or over 1160,
on the 1995 SAT, and only seven percent in the top half. This
compared to 30 percent of whites scoring in the top half. Again,
preferences based on class are likely to favor whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of minority students who are poor yet qualified is
very low,'' said William Bowen, former president of Princeton
University whose recent book, with Derek Bok, ``The Shape of the
River'' argues the benefits of race-based preferences.
</P>
<P>
   After a US District Court in Texas struck down affirmative
action in university admissions in 1996, the university there
settled on another way of getting racial diversity: automatic
admissions to the top ten percent of every high school class.
</P>
<P>
   California lawmakers are considering a similar policy, to admit
the top four percent of each high school to the state university.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking was that because Texas and California high schools
are still largely segregated by race, taking the top percentage
would result in getting the best black and white students. The
policy is likely to pass court muster because it doesn't rely on
race, but on academic merit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the policy has made schools in Texas more diverse, it
didn't make them as diverse as they were under affirmative action.
At the law school at Austin, where the original challenge to
affirmative action began, the freshman class had four black
students at the time of the court ruling, and after the ten percent
policy went into effect for this year's class, eight black
students.
</P>
<P>
   Before the court ruling, there had been 21 black students in the
freshman class.
</P>
<P>
   In California, some researchers say a policy of automatically
admitting the top four percent of every high school will mean the
university accepting white students from poor rural districts, and
black students from low quality high schools, with a high dropout
rate likely for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools differ so much in quality that you may end up offering
admissions to people who ought to be turned away,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Some diversity advocates, including Lani Guinier, once President
Clinton's nominee to be the nation's top civil rights enforcer,
propose a lottery for spots at a school, open to any students above
a certain threshold. But because blacks tend to have lower
standardized scores, Miller says, blacks still end up
underrepresented in the pool, unless the threshold is dropped. Only
46 percent of black students, for example, score above the 50
percent mark on the SAT, which is a low threshold.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no valid surrogate for race'' in designing admissions
policies that provide a racially diverse classroom, said Bill
Trombley, of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher
Education. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Over time, the best way to get racial diversity, with the
courts prohibiting strictly race-based admissions, is to begin
preparing students early so they can compete on grades alone.
</P>
<P>
   But the programs that exist, researchers say, have been focused
more on lifting the lowest performing black and Hispanic students.
There are few programs that focus on holding academically talented
black students at top performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask what do we have for the top ten percent'' of black
students ``so they can be eligible for Boston Latin, or for
Stuyvesant High School, there aren't any,'' Miller said. ``It's not
even a question anyone has asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 15 years of school reform, most of the focus
with regard to minority children has understandably been on helping
extremely disadvantaged chilren who are not doing well to do
somewhat better. Much less attention has been given to getting high
achieving black students. The debates over admissions to Boston
Latin reflect that reality.''

   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's appearance
before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday had no significant
immediate impact on the nation's view of whether President Clinton
should be impeached, two overnight polls released Friday showed.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News interviewed 584 respondents early in the week and again
Thursday night. Early in the week, 25 percent said they believed
that Clinton should be impeached. Thursday night 30 percent said
so, but the poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll interviewed 652 people Thursday night, and found
that 35 percent said they wanted their representative to vote for
impeachment. That was an increase from 31 percent from a different
poll last week. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Both polls registered some improvement in national opinion about
Starr himself. Gallup found that 35 percent had a favorable view of
him now, compared with 31 percent last week. Among the 44 percent
who said they had seen or heard about the hearings, his rating was
40 percent favorable.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News registered a clearer gain, but from a lower base.
Eighteen percent of its sample was favorable to Starr before the
hearing, and 26 percent was afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the national balance is still heavily against him.
Fifty-eight percent of Gallup's respondents said they disapproved
of how Starr was handling his investigation compared with 63
percent last week. In the CBS News poll Thursday, 60 percent said
he was more concerned with damaging Clinton than with finding out
whether anything illegal had been done. Earlier in the week, 62
percent held that view.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kathleen Frankovic, director of surveys for CBS News, said of
her company's poll, ``While there was a modest improvement in
opinions about Starr, there was little change in attitudes about
the investigation or impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   This was true, Ms. Frankovic said, even though the CBS News Poll
showed that 65 percent of the public felt Starr had done a good job
of presenting his case to the committee. Gallup had a similar
finding, with 26 percent saying he had done ``an excellent job''
and another 41 percent saying he had done a ``good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The two polls offered somewhat contradictory findings about the
impeachment process. Gallup asked if the hearing gave respondents
more confidence or less confidence in the impeachment process in
Congress. Thirty-two percent said it gave them more confidence; 42
percent said less.
</P>
<P>
   But in the CBS News Poll, the question was put in a different
way, with respondents asked if they approved or disapproved of how
the committee was handling impeachment. Early in the week, 41
percent approved and 43 percent disapproved; on Thursday night 47
percent approved and 39 percent disapproved.

STARR AIDE RESIGNS TO PROTEST HIS DECISION TO TESTIFY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also see IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-ASSESS) 
(mk) 
 By DON VAN NATTA JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Samuel Dash abruptly resigned Friday as Kenneth
Starr's ethics adviser to protest the independent counsel's
decision to testify before the House Judiciary Committee as ``an
aggressive advocate'' for the impeachment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a bluntly worded, two-page letter, Dash, the 73-year-old
former chief counsel of the Senate Watergate Committee, said he
felt compelled to end his four-year affiliation with Starr because
he had rejected his ``strong advice'' to decline to appear before
the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I resign for a fundamental reason,'' wrote Dash, a professor
at Georgetown University Law Center. ``You have violated your
obligations under the independent counsel statute and have
unlawfully intruded on the power of impeachment, which the
Constitution gives solely to the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr disputed that assertion later in the day, saying he
believed his testimony was not an argument for impeachment but a
``general status report on the state of the overall
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dash had played an active and influential role in Starr's
inquiry into President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky,
helping to broker an immunity deal with her in July and assisting
in the writing and editing of the impeachment referral in
September. And while his letter Friday praised Starr's integrity
and professionalism, Dash had strongly objected to Starr's decision
to continue to represent private clients, including a tobacco
company, while serving as the independent counsel. Earlier this
year, Dash said that Starr's private legal work ``does have an odor
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dash's letter was delivered less than 12 hours after Starr
concluded his marathon day of testimony, in which he noted Dash's
strong views and ``great wisdom.'' His resignation surprised and
saddened Starr's prosecutors and staff members; several were told
about it by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Starr said in his two-page response that Dash's
letter ``reflects an inaccurate view of the law, as well as of the
events that unfolded yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr explained that he was invited to appear by the House
Judiciary Committee, and he said he had taken pains not to urge the
House to impeach the president. But he often sounded like an
impassioned advocate, especially during the cross-examination by
David Kendall, the president's personal lawyer. And in response to
questions from members, Starr said he believed that perjury was an
impeachable offense, an argument that he did not advance in his
Sept. 9 referral.
</P>
<P>
   ``You suggest that by appearing, I harmed public confidence in
the independence of the office,'' Starr wrote. ``With respect, I
disagree with that. Indeed, had I chosen to refuse the invitation
to testify, I believe that would have harmed public confidence in
the office. A refusal to appear would have suggested that we have
something to hide, or that we are unwilling to defend and stand by
the written referral.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said Friday that if Starr had not accepted the
committee's invitation, ``we would have been compelled to subpoena
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After four years of relentless abuse and unanswered
accusations, I think the public was owed an explanation by the
independent counsel,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   In their letters, each man made clear his respect for the other.
In an impromptu news conference Friday morning outside his home in
McLean, Va., Starr said he regretted that he had had a ``gentle
disagreement'' with Dash, but he added that he understood and
respected his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Dash is a man of total principle, and I love Sam Dash,''
Starr said. ``And I think he did feel strongly that while we had
properly submitted the referral to Congress, that it was wrong for
me to go forward and to testify yesterday in the way that, as he
saw it, that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Dash spoke briefly Friday afternoon with reporters outside his
home in Chevy Chase, Md. ``I resigned because he used most of his
opening statement not as a defense of his office but as an
aggressive advocate in reviewing the facts and the law urging
impeachment,'' Dash said.
</P>
<P>
   Without hesitation, White House lawyers and Democratic
strategists began using Dash's sharp words as weapons against
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Begala, senior political adviser to the president, said,
``Starr's ethics guy resigned. Res ipsa loquitur,'' a Latin phrase
that means, ``the thing speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jim Jordan, spokesman for the Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee, said, ``Obviously, Democratic members agree with Dash
that Starr has exceeded his authority from the independent counsel
statute in becoming an aggressive advocate of impeachment, rather
than an objective purveyor of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Dash had warned Starr that he would resign if Starr appeared
before the Judiciary Committee, according to an acquaintance of
Dash, who said he spoke with him on Monday night. ``My hunch is
that he was on the edge for a while,'' the acquaintance said.
</P>
<P>
   When Dash joined the office in October 1994, Starr said Dash
would provide ethical and professional advice to him and his staff.
But Dash quickly became one of Starr's most trusted advisers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In July, Dash reached out to several defense lawyers for Ms.
Lewinsky, inviting them to his home for a breakfast meeting. The
gesture opened negotiations leading to agreements of complete
immunity from prosecution for Ms. Lewinsky and her mother, Marcia
Lewis. One of Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers, Jacob Stein, credited Dash
with bridging the divide between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   And in early September, Dash persuaded Starr to argue that
Clinton had abused the authority of his office by lying to the
public, the Congress and the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Sam Dash not only reviewed the report and helped edit
it, but he argued that we had to make it tougher,'' said Ronald
Rotunda, an adviser of Starr's office and a professor at the
University of Illinois College of Law. ``He fully embraces the
report.'' On the morning that the 445-page report was submitted to
Congress, Rotunda recalled that Dash argued that the abuse-of-power
section ``needed to be beefed up, and it was made tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   But Starr and Dash had disagreed at times, though they succeeded
in keeping those disagreements out of the public eye. Most notably,
Dash objected strenuously to Starr's decision to continue working
in private law practice while serving as independent counsel,
lawyers said Friday. Starr earned $1.2 million last year as a
partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis in Chicago while representing a wide
array of clients, including tobacco companies, and critics objected
because some of his clients were opponents of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Starr acknowledged that he and Dash had disagreed on the matter
during his testimony on Thursday. Starr took a leave of absence
from his law firm last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Dash himself was also recently criticized for earning $400 an
hour. His annual salary was capped at $118,400.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Dash's friends and acquaintances said they were
bewildered by his decision to resign, and they especially bemoaned
the timing.

   ``I believe he has been a moderating influence against the more
aggressive voices who have had Starr's ear,'' said Richard
Ben-Veniste, a Washington lawyer who was a Watergate prosecutor and
Senate minority Whitewater counsel. ``And it is unfortunate that
his departure will leave no one in that role.''

BERTELSMANN MOVES FURTHER INTO BOOK PUBLISHING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG deepened its wide-ranging
investments in books Friday, signing a 1 billion German mark ($597
million) deal to buy a majority stake in a top international
publisher of scientific and medical books. The acquisition will
allow Bertelsmann to make new inroads into the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is for an 82 percent stake in Springer-Verlag GmbH,
Germany's largest publisher of scientific journals and technical
books with headquarters in Berlin and publishing houses all over
the world, including New York.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of the privately owned company, which is subject
to approval by European regulators, is part of an aggressive push
by Bertelsmann to become a dominant player in science and technical
publishing _ a market that is expected to grow faster than consumer
or popular books in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase is the latest in a series of highly visible
acquisitions by the German conglomerate, which earlier this year
took over Random House, the leading American trade publisher, and
in October struck a deal with Barnes &AMP; Noble to participate in a
joint venture in the chain's online bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 25 percent of Springer's annual revenues of 615 million
marks comes from the United States, where it has a flourishing
publishing house based in the Flatiron Building at 23rd Street and
Broadway in Manhattan. More than 60 percent of the company's
publications are in English.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Springer's appeal was its advanced electronic network,
which offers more than 400 technical and medical journals through
an information service called Link, said Bertelsmann chief
executive Thomas Middelhoff, who has been the driving force behind
the acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business it's become more and more crucial to be
digitized and on the Internet,'' Middelhoff said. ``We believe that
with our strength on the Internet we can add something important to
Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Bertelsmann expected Springer to increase its
sales of scientific and technical books through Barnes &AMP; Noble's
electronic bookstore, placing additional pressures on its
e-commerce rival, Amazon.com, which is already doing a brisk
business in the sales of professional books.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Springer-Verlag, he said, will quickly fit into the
conglomerate's expanding infrastructure of Internet investments,
from its electronic bookstores in the United States and Europe to
its interest in the search engine Lycos and the online service
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our information highway, which is built for mass consumer
markets, we can deliver these scientific, technical and medical
contents for incremental costs _ a great advantage,'' Middelhoff
said Friday after the purchase agreement with Springer was signed
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In a month, Bertelsmann could expand its reach even further in
the market for scientific and technical books. It is involved in
discussions with the French media company Havas SA, a unit of
Vivendi SA, to pool their professional publications in a joint
venture. A deal is expected to be finalized by the end of December.
</P>
<P>
   The two media giants are already equal partners in a Spanish
professional publisher, Doyma, and Middelhoff said that if the new
joint venture happened, that would catapult Bertelsmann into the
top tier of professional publishing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Matthew Bechard, associate editor for Simba
Information, which tracks the professional and scientific
publishing market, ``The whole industry is becoming very
consolidated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You really need to have a lot of capital and a lot of
resources to compete in the market today, and being a private
independent company it was getting difficult for them,'' Bechard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Springer was started in 1842 with the opening of a Berlin
bookstore by Julius Springer, who also began publishing German
literature and, later, scientific and academic works.
</P>
<P>
   Through the history of the company, various generations of
Springers remained involved in its management except when they were
forced out because of their Jewish ancestry in 1935 and 1942. The
last Springer to take an active role was Konrad Springer, a partner
in the company, who died in 1997. His children and other relatives
were the major shareholders who signed the agreement Friday to sell
most of the company to Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   Bechard, of Simba, said the company had not achieved the same
kinds of profits as other major participants in the scientific
market, ``but by no means are they struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Middelhoff, who led the negotiations, said that Springer's
profit margin was about 10 percent, but that the new majority
owners expected an improvement: a return on sales of 15 percent to
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their objective hasn't been so much on profit,'' Middelhoff
said. ``They were much more oriented on quality and now we have to
see that we improve the profit level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann has already picked a new chairman to head the
supervisory board of Springer, Juergen Richter, who is the former
chairman of Axel Springer, a Berlin-based newspaper conglomerate
with no connection to Springer-Verlag.

 &HT;    DeKalb County, Savannah get welfare initiative grants
 &HT;    Staff reports
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ DeKalb County will receive $2.2 million from a federal
grant initiative to train unskilled men so they can become employed
and support their children.
</P>
<P>
   The money is part of a $273 million package from the U.S.
Department of Labor that 75 communities in 44 states will share to
implement innovative welfare-to-work programs. Almost 700 community
agencies applied for the money. DeKalb Economic Opportunity Inc. is
the only metro area winner. Savannah received $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb's program is a collaborative effort among educational
institutions, business associations, government and law
enforcement. Known as The Fatherhood Connection, the program will
focus on training unskilled men and helping them get and retain
jobs so they can pay child support, so their children would no
longer need welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to work with 900 men and have at least 500 of them
retain jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In Savannah, officials will use the money to provide child care
for former welfare recipients who work during second and third
shifts, vans to supplement public transit bus routes and additional
funds for a no-interest loan program that sells cars to welfare
recipients.

 &HT;    Georgia catches $4.8 million windfall as part of tobacco deal
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia officials agreed to accept $4.8 billion from
the tobacco industry Friday as part of a 46-state, $206 billion
deal to settle state liability claims for tobacco-related health
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement apparently clears the way for the largest civil
settlement in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The state's share will be paid out over 25 years, including $800
million by 2003, according to Attorney General Thurbert Baker, who
committed the state to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   And the prospect of such a huge windfall already has lobbyists
and lawmakers in Georgia and around the country debating how the
money should be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal goes through as expected, the state will drop its
Fulton County Superior Court suit that seeks $2.78 billion in
damages from the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry said it would sign the agreement Monday.
Eligible states had until midday Friday to act on the industry's
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, there are many things that this agreement
accomplishes, particularly in the public health arena, that we
could not achieve through our lawsuit in Georgia,'' Baker said at a
morning press conference. ``There is no doubt in my mind that it is
in the best interests of this state that Georgia join this
settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said both Gov. Zell Miller and Gov.-elect Roy Barnes were
supportive of the settlement and that he wasn't aware of any
legislative opposition.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of public health organizations, including the
American Cancer Society, gave its conditional support for the
settlement but added that the proceeds must be used to aid tobacco
victims and to discourage teen-agers from getting hooked on
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the money should be spent, Baker said: ``My job is to
get the pie. It's up to the Legislature to divide the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement applies to 46 states and the District of
Columbia. Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas settled their
suits earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the billions of dollars in payouts to the states, the
industry would agree to a bans on advertising that targets youth,
cartoon advertising and outdoor advertising and restricts brand
name sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the industry has also agreed to compensate tobacco
farmers, and will negotiate the details of that aid at meetings
with state officials within 30 days of the signing of the national
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   State agriculture commissioner Tommy Irvin estimated that
tobacco farmers nationwide would receive about $5 billion over 10
years, though he declined to estimate Georgia's share.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco is the state's third biggest cash crop after cotton and
peanuts, generating about $170 million last year. Irvin said only
North Carolina and Virginia sell more. He said Georgia growers face
declining domestic demand for tobacco, but rising international
demand.

 &HT;    Vail fires fuel PR, fail to scare away would-be skiers
 &HT;    By Chris Barker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Dustin Crooks arrived at Vail less than three
weeks ago, hooked up a job tuning skis at the base of the Eagle
Bahn gondola and scored a place to crash in Avon.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, one month to the day after arsonists set seven
fires above 11,000 feet at the nation's largest ski area, the
20-year-old transplant from Raton, N.M., considered the possibility
that the vandalism _ and a threat by a radical environmental group
to do more damage _ could affect the ski area's business.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really didn't have that much impact on me, but I'm sure it
did for some people,'' said Crooks, as he snapped on his K-2 skis
in preparation for a balmy afternoon on the slopes. ``When you come
to ski, man, you want to come where it's peaceful and calm.''
</P>
<P>
   From prototypical ``ski bums'' attracted to Vail by the glamour
and snow to a Denver environmental consultant battling a planned
expansion of the back bowls to Vail Resorts employees trying to get
the message out that the area is safe, a cast of characters are
still feeling the effects of the Oct. 19 fires.
</P>
<P>
   The blazes destroyed a large restaurant, two ski patrol
buildings and damaged several lifts, causing $12 million in damage
and raising the profile of a heated dispute over a proposed
``category 3'' expansion that began days before the fires were set.
</P>
<P>
   A group called Earth Liberation Front claimed responsibility for
the fires Oct. 21, saying the damage was done in the name of the
Canadian lynx. In communiques e-mailed to several media agencies,
ELF said the proposed 885-acre expansion would harm lynx habitat.
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement team made up of the FBI, the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Eagle County Sheriff's
Department have released little information on the investigation
into the fires. Although it has been determined that arson was the
cause of the blaze, no suspects have been named.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that needle in the haystack thing,'' said Kim Andree,
spokeswoman for the county sheriff's department.
</P>
<P>
   The average arson investigation takes 18 months to solve, Andree
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vail Resorts, energized by a fast-approaching ski season that
will feature the long-awaited World Alpine Ski Championships, has
undertaken a whirlwind of repairs and rebuilding over the past
month. Two Elks Lodge, a 33,000-square-foot restaurant that was the
largest building burned in the fires, will be replaced by a fabric
and steel structure seating 400 and offering cafeteria-style food
by Christmas, said Kristin Yantis, communications manager for Vail
Resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Three lifts damaged in the fires have already been repaired and
re-licensed, Yantis said. A double-wide modular building replacing
the burned ski patrol headquarters will be in place by
Thanksgiving, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Chair 5, a popular back bowl lift that was
heavily damaged, will be ready by Christmas as well.
</P>
<P>
   Reservation agents have fielded many calls from would-be skiers
with questions about the fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been our job to help put what happened in perspective to
our guests,'' Yantis said. ``They have more often than not showed
their support for Vail.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the sad truth for legitimate opponents of the proposed
expansion, said Rocky Smith, a consultant working with the Colorado
Environmental Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The fires have drummed up sympathy for a corporation that has
refused to heed the stance of its own community against further
development, he said. Skyrocketing prices and housing shortages had
rallied many against category 3 over the last few years, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a PR coup for Vail, it's probably the best thing
public relations wise that could have happened to them,'' said
Smith, who added that his group has been blamed by some who tend to
broad-brush the environmental movement. ``This has hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Category 3 expansion is continuing, although Vail Resorts has
not yet requested a Forest Service option to continue construction
over the winter, Yantis said.
</P>
<P>
   The final salvo in a drawn-out war over the expansion will
likely be fired in January, Smith said. That's when a circuit court
is slated to hear arguments appealing October's district court
decision against the environmental coalition, which sought to stave
off the start of construction on category 3.
</P>
<P>
   Will the fires drive skiers and snowboarders away from Vail over
the course of the next five months? Several skiers set to tackle
the slopes on Thursday had differing opinions.
</P>
<P>
   For 36-year-old Emmett Feely of Boulder, Vail's reputation as
the biggest and the best ski area in Colorado is well deserved. But
he said those unfamiliar with the area may steer clear because
they're worried the arsonists could return.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, what could hurt Vail most this ski season is what
those opposed to the expansion have based their campaign on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest deterrent is just the crowds and the cost,'' Feely
said. ``The threats for losing any Front Range skier days are just
what they've always been.''

TALIBAN DECLARES BIN LADEN INNOCENT OF BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The militant Islamic fundamentalists who rule most
of Afghanistan declared Osama bin Laden, accused of masterminding
the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, an innocent and free
man on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Taliban movement, which controls about 90
percent of the country, further complicates U.S. efforts to bring
the suspected terrorist to justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban said a religious court had received no evidence from
the United States to support a trial of bin Laden, who has been
living in Afghanistan since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The United States struck Afghanistan with dozens of cruise
missiles on Aug. 20, two weeks after the embassy bombings, seeking
to kill members of bin Laden's network. Bin Laden was not at the
site of the attack, near Khost, in eastern Afghanistan, but more
than two dozen of his associates were reported killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a wealthy exiled Saudi, is regarded by U.S. officials
as the most dangerous and influential sponsor of terrorism in the
world. He is under federal indictment in connection with the
embassy bombings, which killed more than 250 people, including 12
Americans, and injured about 5,000 people in Nairobi, Kenya, and in
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence in the case remains largely secret, and the United
States was in any event unwilling to present it to an Afghan court
of religious judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin,''
Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The
Associated Press in Kabul, the Afghan capital. ``He is a free
man.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice said that the United States should feel
``shame that they have been silent,'' the news agency reported.
``Anything that happens now anywhere in the world, they blame
Osama, but the reality is in the proof _ and they have not given us
any.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, which does not recognize the Taliban
movement as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, never
regarded its offer to place bin Laden on trial as a serious
proposition, U.S. officials said. It issued a stern statement
Friday saying that bin Laden stood accused in the United States of
``cold-blooded murder,'' and it urged the Taliban to expel him.
</P>
<P>
   But for the time being, bin Laden is living outside Kandahar,
the Taliban's stronghold in southern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban's leaders rebuffed a request by senior U.S.
officials to extradite him earlier this year, before the embassy
bombings. They have said that he is their guest in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has offered a $5 million reward for his
capture, the largest bounty ever offered by the U.S. government in
a criminal case. But with the Taliban protecting bin Laden, and
with the United States at present unable to mount what would be a
difficult, dangerous and probably deadly covert operation to seize
him from his remote redoubt, it is unclear who would be willing to
take the risk of collecting that reward.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the 1980s bin Laden fought in Afghanistan alongside rebels
who, backed with $3 billion from the CIA, fought and repulsed the
Soviet troops who occupied their nation.
</P>
<P>
   But since 1991, when U.S. troops set up bases in Saudi Arabia,
his homeland before the onset of the war in the Persian Gulf, he
has been organizing attacks on U.S. forces and installations across
the Middle East and Africa. He sees the United States as an
invading infidel force _ not unlike the Soviet occupiers of
Afghanistan _ and has vowed to attack U.S. troops and civilians
around the world.

 &HT;    TERRORISTS WITH A CROPDUSTER COULD START A DEADLY GLOBAL
OUTBREAK, ARMY SCIENTISTS WARN
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 700 words.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bio-terrorists in a cropduster airplane could
spread a 60-mile-wide cloud of deadly smallpox virus along the U.S.
East Coast and within days millions of Americans would come down
with one of the most feared diseases of all time, Army experts
warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could blanket the entire East Coast, with casualty rates
of 80 percent in the Washington-Baltimore area, extending to New
York City at the 40 percent level,'' said Peter Jahrling, senior
research scientist at the Army's Research Institute of Infectious
Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Since most Americans were never immunized against smallpox and
the vaccinations of just about everyone else have expired, the
disease would spread without resistance and the fatality rate would
likely be 30 percent, Jahrling said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primary cases alone (those who became ill from inhaling the
initial virus-laden cloud) would undoubtedly number in the hundreds
of thousands and perhaps millions and it would undoubtedly start a
global pandemic,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario, complete with a map showing the areas of greatest
likely exposure to the cloud of virus, was used by Jahrling to
dramatize the Army's appeal for preservation of a tiny stockpile of
smallpox virus now being stored at the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-owned virus is needed for researchers to develop drugs
and new vaccines to protect Americans from a terrorist-started
outbreak of the disease, Jahrling told a committee of the National
Academy of Sciences Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although smallpox has been eradicated from human populations,
two small collections of frozen virus, the CDC stocks and another,
smaller quantity at a laboratory in Russia, are officially
acknowledged to exist.
</P>
<P>
   i rate and outbreaks eventually die out, he said.

</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-owned virus is needed for researchers to develop drugs
and new vaccines to protect Americans from a terrorist-started
outbreak of the disease, Jahrling told a committee of the National
Academy of Sciences Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although smallpox has been eradicated from human populations,
two small collections of frozen virus, the CDC stocks and another,
smaller quantity at a laboratory in Russia, are officially
acknowledged to exist.
</P>
<P>
   The academy's Board on International Health has been asked to
develop recommendations for the White House on what the United
States' position should be when the World Health Assembly votes
next year on whether to order destruction of 400
smallpox-containing specimens at the CDC and other specimens
officially acknowledged in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman said the Board said does not have a formal
schedule for issuing its recommendation but would likely make
public a transcript of Friday's day-long meeting sometime in the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The once-simple issue of whether to destroy the few remaining
stocks of smallpox virus has been complicated in the past several
months by a number of expatriate Russian scientists, who say the
former Soviet Union secretly stockpiled tons of material containing
the virus for possible use as a biological warfare weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The whereabouts of this material is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility for clandestine stockpiles for use by a
terrorist organization or a rogue state exists,'' Jahrling said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Jahrling and other scientists -- including a
virologist from the Russian State Research Center of Virology and
Biotechnology (VECTOR) -- argued for preservation of the roughly
500 smallpox-bearing specimens, the committee also was told the
virus is too dangerous and of too little value to be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many years ago, we thought we had smallpox in two
labs,'' said D.A. Henderson, the former CDC epidemiologist who
directed the World Health Organization's successful campaign to
eradicate the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that ``that equation has changed, and it is not a
happy change,'' Henderson argued that since smallpox virus, which
has the scientific name variola, only infects human beings, is too
dangerous and of too little scientific value to be kept.
</P>
<P>
   It is not likely that a drug or a vaccine could be developed and
successfully tested from the remaining stocks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It would it be unthinkable to expose humans to variola in order
to assess the effectiveness of a new kind of vaccine or an
antiviral drug to treat the disease, he said. Further, it is
unlikely that a drug company would spend the estimated $200 million
on an anti-smallpox drug when the disease it would be used to treat
technically does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has called for a crash program to develop sufficient
smallpox vaccine to immunize Americans in case of a
terrorist-initiated outbreak. He acknowledged that the thousands
who might be sickened in the first wave of infection would not
benefit from this vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox vaccine is not made from variola virus, but from a
related virus, ``vaccinia,'' which induces immunity to smallpox.
Therefore, the variola stockpiles would be of little use in such an
effort, Henderson noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us who have worked in the field, there is nothing
quite as focusing as dealing with large numbers of smallpox
cases,'' Henderson said. ``This is a horrible disease.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that concern about a possible bio-terrorist attack on
the United States has centered around smallpox and anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one can imagine a situation of a disease spreading with a
30-percent fatality rate in a totally susceptible population, for
whom there is no therapy once the disease occurs, this could be a
very serious event for our country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jahrling and others argued that while vaccinia was effective in
immunizing much of the world's population in the 1960s and 1970s,
and thereby eradicating the disease, the presence of HIV infection
and large numbers of persons whose immune systems are compromised
by transplants, now make a new vaccine necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Russian virologist Sergei Shchelkunov described the VECTOR
laboratory's research on the genetic makeup of smallpox, cowpox,
monkeypox and other members of the ``orthopox'' family of viruses.
</P>
<P>
   He said cowpox ``appears to be the most ancient'' of the group,
suggesting that the others may have evolved from it or a virus
closely related to it.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Esposito, a CDC virologist, described outbreaks of
monekypox in the Republic of Congo since 1985, and said that while
this disease is similar to smallpox in severity, it does not spread
as rapidly and epidemics end on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Although the other pox viruses can infect several different
species, smallpox is a disease of humans only.
</P>
<P>
   Monkeypox outbreaks occur in August, when the non-human disease
spreads to humans from monkeys and ground squirrels in Africa.
However, it spreads from the first human to ``secondary'' victims
at a much lower rate and outbreaks eventually die out, he said.

HEARING PRODUCES NEW DETAILS IN KILLING OF GAY STUDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Wyo.)  (rl) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before savagely beating Matthew Shepard with a pistol butt, one
of his tormentors taunted him, saying, ``It's Gay Awareness Week,''
a police investigator has testified at a hearing in Laramie, Wyo.,
for one of two men accused of the murder of the gay college
student.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony, by Sgt. Rob Debree, came at a daylong proceeding
Thursday. In the evening, Robert Denhardt, a visiting county judge,
ordered Aaron McKinney, 22, to stand trial on charges of
first-degree murder, robbery and kidnapping. The other suspect,
Russell Henderson, 21, a friend of McKinney, has waived his right
to a preliminary hearing and is to be arraigned on the same charges
on Dec. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the hearing, Dennis and Judy Shepard, parents of the
slain student, sat stoically in Albany County Court as police
witnesses provided new details about a crime that produced a
national wave of anger at anti-gay violence.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of
Wyoming, in Laramie, was fatally attacked a few hours after he had
attended a planning meeting for Gay Awareness Week events on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Debree, the lead investigator for the Albany County Sheriff's
Department, testified that he conducted a tape-recorded interview
with McKinney on Oct. 9, two days after the beating and three days
before Shepard died in a hospital in nearby Fort Collins, Colo. In
that interview, Debree recalled, McKinney said he and Henderson had
identified Shepard as a robbery target and had then lured him out
of a Laramie bar and into their truck by pretending to be gay.
</P>
<P>
   By McKinney's account, the detective said, the attack began
after Shepard had placed his hand on McKinney's leg as they drove
through Laramie. ``Guess what, we're not gay,'' the detective
quoted McKinney as saying he had told Shepard. ``You're going to
get jacked. It's Gay Awareness Week.''
</P>
<P>
   The detective said McKinney had admitted hitting Shepard three
times with fists and six times with a stolen revolver.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy found that Shepard had been hit 18 times in the head.
He was also bruised on the backs of his hands, indicating that he
had tried to protect himself, and around the groin, indicating that
he had been kicked repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 hours after the beating, a bicyclist found him still
alive, tied to a ranch fence. Reggie Fluty, an Albany County
sheriff's deputy, testified on Thursday that Shepard's wrists had
been so tightly bound that it had been difficult to cut the rope
and that his head had been covered in blood except for a clean spot
``where he'd been crying and the tears went down his face.''
</P>
<P>
   A Laramie police officer, Detective Ben Fritzen, testified that
he had interviewed Kristen Price, McKinney's 18-year-old
girlfriend. Fritzen said that in explaining the violence, McKinney
had told Ms. Price, ``Well, you know how I feel about gays,''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Price and Chasity Pasley, Henderson's girlfriend, waived
their right to preliminary hearings and are to be arraigned on Dec.
9 as accessories after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   A public defender for McKinney, Dion Custis, told the judge at
the hearing that the state had failed to prove that the slaying had
been planned, as is required for first-degree murder, or that
Shepard had been kidnapped. Custis also said a watch and other
belongings left at the crime scene showed that robbery was no
factor.
</P>
<P>
   But Cal Rerucha, the Albany County prosecutor, said Shepard's
wallet had been found in a dirty diaper in the kitchen of the
Laramie apartment shared by McKinney, Ms. Price and their
4-month-old son, Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the judge, Rerucha said: ``They beat him for $20,
your honor. That was the contents of the wallet.''

TEXAS MEN POST BONDS, CHALLENGE STATE'S SODOMY LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE BREWER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Two men arrested for having sex in a private home will
contest fines they received Friday, setting the stage for the first
challenge to Texas' 119-year-old sodomy law in a criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   John Geddes Lawrence, 55, and Tyrone Garner, 31, pleaded no
contest and were fined $125 each by Harris County Justice of the
Peace Mike Parrot during a brief hearing. They refused to pay the
fine and instead posted $332 appeal bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The case will now go to a county criminal court-at-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the law is an outrageous intrusion into the private
liberties of lesbian and gay Texans, and it's unconstitutional for
this law to single out gays and criminalize their behavior,'' said
Suzanne B. Goldberg, an attorney with the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg's group, a national gay advocacy group, is working with
local attorney Mitchell Katine on the pair's defense. They will
file a motion in county court to quash the charges on
constitutional grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what happens there, the case could move to local
appeals courts and eventually end up being heard by the Texas Court
of Criminal Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, this case could raise an issue that goes past the
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and to the U.S. Supreme Court, but
that's a long way down the road and it's impossible to predict if
that will happen at this point,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 17, two sheriff's deputies entered a private residence
and allegedly found the men engaged in consensual sex. The two were
then jailed for ``deviant homosexual'' conduct _ a Class C
misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence and Garner were jailed overnight and later released on
bail.
</P>
<P>
   The officers entered the apartment after a third man falsely
reported an intruder on the premises with a gun. That man was later
convicted of making a false report.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence and Garner couldn't reached for comment by the
Chronicle after their court appearance. But Garner told The
Associated Press that he felt his civil rights were violated, and
Lawrence described the police raid as ``sort of Gestapo.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists have tried to have the 19th-century law, which was
a felony until 1974, struck from the books for years. They see this
case as a chance to mount a legal challenge to it.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said that isn't the motive behind mounting such an
aggressive defense in this case, but she would like to see that as
the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``This `homosexual conduct' law treats lesbians and gay men as
second-class citizens,'' Goldberg said. ``It stigmatizes them as
law breakers and is used to discriminate against gays and lesbians
in employment and housing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Supreme Court ruled in 1994 that it did not have the
proper jurisdiction over a civil challenge to the state's sodomy
law because the plaintiffs in that action had never been prosecuted
under it. So there's never been a challenge to it in criminal
court.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr., who supports
enforcement of public lewdness laws, said any complaints about this
statute should be made to lawmakers because they can change it,
while his office is only doing its job.
</P>
<P>
   The law is rarely enforced. Only a handful of such sodomy cases
have been prosecuted in Harris County in the last three decades,
prosecutors have said, and those have mostly been linked to
homosexual conduct in public jails.
</P>
<P>
   Similar cases have traditionally been linked to public
performance of sex acts.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes speculated that advocates for changing the law might have
a hard time making their case to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not so sure that they don't have a point, the critics
of this law, but it's a point that ought to be addressed to the
folks who make the law and not the people who enforce it,'' Holmes
said.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is a serious challenge to the law, Harris County
Republican Party Chairman Gary Polland said gay rights groups might
have a fight on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Polland, whose party's plank is supportive of sodomy laws
already in place, said the law is not unconstitutional and should
not be repealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it would definitely send a wrong message and signal a
continuing deterioration of morals in our society,'' Polland said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Polland said privacy is not a factor in the this case because
the behavior became public when the police entered the residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I wonder if this case was a set-up, if it was set
up as a challenge,'' Polland said. ``The facts themselves sound
suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states have sodomy laws barring consensual anal or oral
sex, but Texas is one of only five states that have laws that
specifically target same-sex partners, according to Lambda. The
other states with similar laws are Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and
Oklahoma.

NEWS LEAKS TOP LIST OF ALLEGATIONS AGAINST STARR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To hear some Democrats tell it, Kenneth W. Starr is
a prosecutor who leaks secret grand jury testimony, intimidates the
people he investigates, and hides his many conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   None of these charges against the independent counsel, re-aired
in Thursday's impeachment hearing, has been proven in court.
Republicans contend the effort by Judiciary Committee Democrats
Thursday to question Starr's ethics was aimed and shooting the
messenger and shifting attention away from President Clinton's
alleged transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an examination of the allegations against Starr show that
some of them are potentially serious and at least one is the
subject of an ongoing federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious matter is the accusation that Starr illegally
leaked grand jury testimony to reporters. Chief U.S. District Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson, citing ``serious and repetitive prima facie
violations'' of the law, has appointed a special investigator to
examine whether laws were broken. Johnson's ruling listed 24
examples of news stories and columns that appeared to be based on
illegal leaks from Starr's office _ one of them a column by John
Ellis published earlier this year in the Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   If the court finds that Starr or his deputies gave reporters
confidential information, the violators in his office could be
found in contempt of court, jailed, and disbarred. There is no law
prohibiting journalists from making use of such leaks.
</P>
<P>
   During his testimony Thursday, Starr admitted he erred in
putting out a press release in January that said he would not
comment on ``any aspect'' of his work ``because of confidentiality
requirements.'' In fact, Starr or his deputies spoke ``on
background'' with reporters shortly after that, and they were
quoted anonymously about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Starr testified the problem was not in speaking to reporters,
which he said was necessary to set the record straight on certain
issues being aired in the media. The problem, Starr said, was with
the January press release he authorized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say, I think that this (press release) is inconsistent
with the duty of a prosecutor to provide appropriate and lawful
public information,'' Starr said. ``I think it is the duty of the
prosecutor to combat the dissemination of misinformation, as long
as the prosecutor can do that without violating his or her
obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's carefully worded explanation reminded some observers of
Clinton insisting he was being ``legally accurate'' when he
testified that he did not have sexual relations with Monica S.
Lewinsky. The court must determine if Starr's background
discussions amounted to illegal leaks or were simply clarifying
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leak investigation is a real one, it is quite serious,''
said Bruce Yannett, a former federal prosecutor. Yannett said
members of Starr's office have signed affidavits stating that they
did not break the law as they understood it. Yannett called it ``a
Clintonesque answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other allegations about Starr raised in the
impeachment hearing were:
</P>
<P>
   _His treatment of Lewinsky. On Jan. 16, 1998, Starr's assistants
picked up Lewinsky after she met Linda Tripp at a Virginia hotel.
During a seven-hour period in which Lewinsky was not represented by
a lawyer, Starr aide Michael Emmick told Lewinsky she could be
indicted for perjury, witness tampering, and obstruction of
justice. He offered her immunity from prosecution in exchange for
her cooperation. Lewinsky refused the offer and tearfully asked to
talk to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats allege Starr's aides discouraged Lewinsky from
seeking legal counsel during this time. Moreover, Democrats said
the effort by Starr's aides to get Lewinsky an immunity deal when
she did not have a lawyer by her side was a possible violation of
Justice Department policy. In addition, questions have been raised
about whether Starr's aides had received authority to ask Lewinsky
to wear a recording device when she talked to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Starr on Thursday repeated his earlier denial that his
investigators wanted Lewinsky to wear a recording device. Starr
accused Lewinsky's former attorney, William Ginsburg, of spreading
the ``wrong'' story, adding that Ginsburg played ``fast and loose
with the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is plenty of evidence that Starr's aides did try to
get Lewinsky to wear a wire, although there is dispute about
whether the investigators had authority to do so. As Kendall
pointed out on Thursday, there is testimony both from Starr's aides
and Lewinsky herself that she was asked to wear a wire and that she
refused.
</P>
<P>
   _Conflict of interest. Starr met about six times in the summer
of 1994 with attorneys for Paula Corbin Jones, who sued Clinton for
sexual harassment. Democrats have questioned whether that would be
violation of the legal code of conduct for Starr to have talked
strategy with Jones's lawyers about the case and later worked as a
prosecutor on a related matter.
</P>
<P>
   Starr talked with the Jones lawyers about ``how to frame an
argument against presidential immunity,'' according to
Representative Martin Meehan, the Lowell Democrat. Meehan suggested
that Starr should have disclosed his discussions with Jones's
lawyers when he sought to get jurisdiction to investigate the
Lewinsky matter last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just did not occur to me, and fault me for my inability to
issue-spot,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Democrats have raised questions about whether Starr
has a conflict of interest because one of his former law firm
partners may have done work that helped the Jones legal team.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan noted that Starr's former ethics adviser, Sam Dash, has
said that Starr's conduct ``does have an odor to it.'' Dash
resigned Friday in disagreement with Starr's decision to testify
before the committee. Such testimony, Dash said, ``unlawfully
intruded on the power of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dash also said that Starr was the subject of ``many
unfounded and misinformed attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a variety of laws covering possible conflicts of
interest, including the law that established the independent
counsel and the law governing the conduct of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   _Delay in clearing Clinton of other wrongdoing. Democrats
complained that Starr erred by waiting until Thursday to announce
he had exonerated Clinton in several other cases investigated by
his office: the Whitewater land deal, the firing of the White House
travel office, and the use of FBI files.
</P>
<P>
   However, Republicans said there is no requirement that Starr
announce an exoneration before he concludes his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   _Fairness of Starr's report. In attacking the report, Democrats
frequently cited Starr's failure to include this exact quote from
Lewinsky: ``No one ever asked me to lie, and I was never promised a
job for my silence.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Starr's report does accurately paraphrase this
statement and, as important, makes clear Lewinsky acknowledged she
and Clinton developed a cover story to hide their affair.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans pointed out, the report does quote Lewinsky
saying this: ``The best way to explain how I feel what happened
was, you know, no one asked or encouraged me to lie, but no one
discouraged me either.''

<P>
   You might have the grandest house in all of Buckhead and the
summer place on Sea Island and the biggest private jet and the
ranch or two in Wyoming, every toy a man could possibly long for _
and yet your failure to make the roster of the Piedmont Driving
Club would always be hanging over you, like a reproach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Tom Wolfe, in ``A Man in Full.''
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As if stepping into his own novel, there was Tom Wolfe
on Thursday dining on herb-crusted salmon and baby carrots in the
perfectly proportioned ballroom of Atlanta's Piedmont Driving Club,
the magnolia blossom tint of the walls a perfect match for his
creamy three-piece suit.
</P>
<P>
   The club, which was founded 111 years ago so that Atlanta's
aristocrats could show off their horse-drawn carriages, had invited
the celebrated writer to lunch with its members, and 470 were now
seated beneath two grand chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   They came despite their understanding that Wolfe's new novel,
``A Man in Full'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux), had pretty well
skewered their club by using it as a metaphor for the social
separation of the races in the capital of the New South. The home
to countless debutante balls and Junior League follies, the Driving
Club remains a place, both in fact and in Wolfe's fiction, where
the only blacks in view usually are wearing waiters' uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe regaled the crowd with stories about how intrigued he had
become with the club's history and architecture. And he recounted
the night, which he molded into one of the book's most vivid
scenes, when formally attired white partygoers stood on a terrace
at the club and watched powerlessly as raucous black college
students attending the Freaknik spring break weekend paralyzed
traffic on Piedmont Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to make some literary capital out of this,''
Wolfe explained impishly, as the society matrons and managing
partners who had been capitalized upon laughed approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was all across Atlanta this week, as Wolfe made a
three-day publicity tour of the city that serves as the primary
setting for his novel about the feeble condition of American
morality at the turn of the millennium. Despite the reviews
characterizing Wolfe as a modern-day Sherman, Atlantans turned his
visit into a citywide sensation that the amused author likened to
the Beatles' first trip to America.
</P>
<P>
   The 742-page book, which will debut atop The New York Times
bestseller list Sunday, has received such broad attention here that
even those who have not cracked its binding offer ready critiques.
Predictably, Wolfe's trip has also prompted one of the periodic
bouts of introspection that afflict this famously image-obsessed
city.
</P>
<P>
   With his depictions of crass white developers and opportunistic
black politicians, Wolfe lampoons both the casing and the core of a
city that he likens to a baseball: a suburban shell of white
economic might surrounding an inner-city nucleus of black political
power.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of explaining ``the Atlanta way,'' the path of
mutual benefit negotiated between black politics and white
commerce, Wolfe also illuminates some dark corners of civic life.
In his Atlanta, white corporate titans measure their worth in
status and possessions, while black political success is determined
by skin tone and walking-around money.
</P>
<P>
   While many Atlanta readers have found Wolfe's descriptions and
characters eerily recognizable, some fault him for simplifying the
city's racial dynamic. Because Wolfe takes such pride in the
journalistic foundations of his fiction, and because his details
are so precise, many have had trouble remembering that the book is
a novel. As a result, some feathers have been ruffled.
</P>
<P>
   Several corporate sponsors and a number of guests backed out of
a benefit Wednesday night honoring Wolfe after reading the early
publicity on the book. ``The sponsors backed out because they were
afraid of being involved in anything that could be racially
controversial,'' said Mary Rose Taylor, a longtime friend of Wolfe
who organized the dinner. ``And some guests felt if they attended
the dinner they would appear to be endorsing the book, and they did
not want to appear to be doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not read the book, former Mayor Sam Massell, who
heads a business group called the Buckhead Coalition, was so
offended by what he had heard that he made a public show of
rescinding a luncheon invitation from the group before Wolfe had
even received it. Massell said he was put off by a passage
describing how Charlie Croker, the book's developer protagonist,
had manufactured a Ku Klux Klan rally to deflate the price of
property he wanted to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand this is fiction and he has the right to do what
he wants,'' said Massell, who served as mayor from 1970 to 1974.
``But that doesn't mean I have to have lunch with him.'' Asked
whether he plans to read the book, Massell paused. ``When I cool
down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A number of prominent Atlantans said they were more offended by
Massell's sense of public relations than by Wolfe's book.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Williams, the president of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of
Commerce, called Massell's disinvitation ``a little crass.'' Rick
Beard, the director of the Atlanta History Center, said he kept
hoping for a city ``that has a little bit more self-confidence and
cares a little bit less about what other people think of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell anticipated Wolfe's arrival
Wednesday by issuing a statement that pleaded for calm: ``Given our
achievements and history of racial harmony, there is no reason to
overreact to a novel that explores several important issues, but
like all literature, from the vantage point of the author.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, the city's third black mayor, said in an interview
that he was particularly pleased that the novel explored race
relations, a topic that he said demanded more discussion. But when
Campbell, who has not read the book, was told that a major theme
involved the political tensions between light-skinned and
dark-skinned blacks, the mayor virtually denied that such an
undercurrent even exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a reality, it's not an issue at all,'' he said, although it
was a widely, if quietly, discussed subtext of Campbell's
re-election in 1997. ``Like the ebola plague, it's very deadly when
it does rear its head, but it's very rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite mixed feelings about the book, much of Atlanta has been
flattered by Wolfe's attention, and views the book's publication as
an opportunity to demonstrate that the city has developed a thicker
skin since it was host to the 1996 Olympic Games. After all, did
not Wolfe use his first novel, ``The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' to
send up New York City, the commercial and cultural capital of the
world?
</P>
<P>
   ``We Atlantans are supposed to be sitting here in mortal terror
that our pretensions are going to be held up to ridicule, when the
truth is, everyone I know is tickled pink about this,'' said
Frederick Allen, a local author and city historian. ``To have
someone of Tom Wolfe's stature hold you up to scorn is really the
Good Housekeeping seal of approval. He wouldn't do this to
Birmingham or Orlando.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe was welcomed at the airport on Wednesday with camera
flashes, and a press contingent has trailed him this week like a
Presidential candidate in the snows of New Hampshire. The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution instituted a daily Wolfe Watch column, and
dutifully reported what Wolfe ate and what his wife wore.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd attending Wolfe's speech and reading at the Atlanta
History Center on Wednesday night spilled out of the 400-seat
auditorium and into a room where his address was shown on
closed-circuit television. Later, some 150 Atlantans paid $600
apiece to attend the black-tie benefit honoring Wolfe who, alone
among the guests, did not adhere to the dress code.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, 200 people joined Wolfe at a breakfast sponsored by
the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau, which hopes that his
book will do for Atlanta tourism what John Berendt's ``Midnight in
the Garden of Good and Evil'' (Random House, 1994) did for
Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, an estimated 1,100 fans jammed Borders Books &AMP;
Music in trendy Buckhead for a reading and signing, some waiting up
to nine hours for Wolfe's arrival. Like eager children queued up to
see a shopping-mall Santa, they snaked in lines throughout the
expansive store, up and down stairwells, as Wolfe scribbled his
autograph from a thronelike stage. By the time he finished at 11:45
p.m., more than two hours later than scheduled, the 68-year-old
Wolfe had signed about 2,000 books.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe, a Virginia native who lives in New York, takes note in
``A Man in Full'' of Atlanta's sensitivity to image, with one
character asserting that Atlantans cannot stand ``the idea that
somebody in New York might be calling them Southern hicks.'' While
here this week, he seemed eager to make amends for any slight,
praising the city's ambition and optimism and telling his audiences
that Atlanta just might become the next great international city.
He also praised the city's manners and unfailing generosity, saying
he was treated graciously in the dozen trips he made here to
research the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved courtesy in the South, even when it takes
the form of hypocrisy,'' he told the crowd at breakfast Thursday.
``I can stand insults, so long as they're couched in courteous
terms.'' Perhaps after Wolfe's visit, Atlanta may discover that it
feels the same way about him.

VOICING CRITICISM, STARR AIDE DASH QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sam Dash, the ethics adviser to Kenneth W. Starr in
his investigation of President Clinton, resigned abruptly Friday
and accused the independent counsel of abusing his office by
advocating impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Dash, who won praise from Starr in his testimony Thursday before
the House Judiciary Committee, said in a two-page letter he opposed
Starr's decision to appear on Capitol Hill and the special
prosecutor ``had no right or authority under the law ... to
advocate for a particular position on the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``By your willingess to serve in this improper role you have
seriously harmed the public confidence in the independence and
objectivity'' of the office of independent counsel,'' Dash said in
his resignation letter, dated Friday. A Democrat, Dash was chief
counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said he disagreed with Dash's interpretation of the law
and called their dispute as a ``gentle disagreement.'' Speaking to
reporters outside his Virginia home, Starr said ``reasonable minds
can differ, as is obviously the case.'' He added that he considered
it his ``duty'' and ``proper'' to testify once the committee had
asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Dash is a man of total principle, and I love Sam Dash, and
I think he did feel strongly,'' Starr said. ``This was so important
to him that he that the right thing to do was to take the action
that he has taken. And I admire that.''
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde of Illinois defended
Starr's appearance before the committee, saying ``he was merely
complying with the law.'' If Starr had not appeared voluntarily,
Hyde said, ``we would have been compelled to subpoena him.''
</P>
<P>
   The resignation surprised the White House, and it sent House
Republicans and Democrats scrambling to put it in the best light.
Democrats used Dash's decision to bolster their argument that the
prosecution of the president has been politically motivated and
unfair, while Republicans noted that Dash did not dispute the facts
of the case Starr has outlined against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly Dash's resignation served as the latest blow to an
impeachment inquiry already hampered by partisan bickering and the
public's sour attitude toward efforts to remove the president from
office and their desire to see the whole process end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wheels are coming off this investigation,'' said Ann
Lewis, White House director of communications.
</P>
<P>
   Dash, a registered Democrat who helped create the office of
special prosecutor, had been considered the independent counsel's
fairness cop, lending his credibility to help deflect attacks
against Starr, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Thursday, Starr repeatedly responded to
criticism about his ethics by citing Dash's support for him and
referring to the ``elaborately documented'' substance of his case
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and a
fixture in Washington legal circles, Dash had a relationship with
Monica S. Lewinsky's lawyers _ Jacob Stein and Plato Cacheris _
that laid the groundwork for granting the former White House intern
immunity from prosecution, after a months-long standoff with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Dash brought the two sides together at his Chevy Chase, Md.,
home one morning in July to work out the arrangement that would
allow Lewinsky to preview for prosecutors the testimony she would
give under oath. Days later, the two sides had a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Dash rebuffed criticism for receiving $400 an hour as an ethics
consultant for Starr. He said he worked many hours for free and put
the actual figure at about $100 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the fallout from Dash's resignation, the Judiciary
Committee was preparing to expand the Lewinsky investigation next
week by privately taking depositions from two individuals familiar
with former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey: her former
lawyer, Daniel Gecker, and a Democratic fund-raiser, Nathan Landow.
</P>
<P>
   Willey has accused Clinton of groping her near the Oval Office
in 1993, although she recanted the allegation and later renewed it.
</P>
<P>
   The following week, the panel will take depositions from its
only other announced witnesses in the inquiry: Bruce R. Lindsey,
Clinton's deputy counsel and long-time confidant, and Robert
Bennett, the president's lawyer in the Paula Corbin Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Starr alleged that when Lindsey advised Clinton about how to
handle the Jones lawsuit, the president was improperly using a
government lawyer for ``his personal legal defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is in Asia for a five-day tour focusing on the
world economic crisis, criticized the committee's decision to call
Bennett, saying it is ``without any precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, there has never been a case where a person's
lawyer was asked to come and testify,'' Clinton said on the airport
tarmac in Tokyo before flying to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said if the committee had a strong enough case against
Clinton involving his relationship with Lewinsky they would not be
calling other witnesses. ``This is sending out yet another search
party hoping they will bump into a crime,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dash, in his resignation letter that began ``Dear Ken,'' told
Starr that his decision to leave had ``nothing whatsoever to do
with the many unfounded and misinformed attacks on your conduct as
independent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was resigning because Starr had ignored his ``strong
advice'' in accepting the invitation to appear before the Judiciary
Committee and ``serve as an aggressive advocate'' for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Dash noted Starr had frequently sought Dash's approval for his
decision-making, and then had publicized it. ``I cannot allow that
inference to continue regarding your present abuse of your office
and have no other choice but to resign,'' Dash said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the final word, from a giant of American
jurisprudence, on the methods, motives, and ethics of Ken Starr,''
said Jim Jordan, a spokesman for Judiciary Committee Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Sam Dash had a fundamental problem with the way Ken
Starr has conducted himself, at least in terms of his outside
income,'' including money he makes as a lawyer for tobacco
companies, said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat
who serves on the Judiciary Committee. ``Now we know that he
rightly had a problem with Ken Starr being an aggressive advocate
for the president's impeachment rather than merely forwarding
evidence to the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde defended Starr's appearance before the committee, saying:
``After four years of relentless abuse and unanswered questions, I
think the public was owed an explanation by the independent counsel
to provide some balance to this highly controversial matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bob Barr, a Republican from Georgia and a member
of the Judiciary Committee, accused Dash of ``political posturing''
and trying to divert attention from Starr's ``outstanding
performance'' before the Judiciary.

NOMURA SECURITIES SHUFFLES TOP MANAGEMENT OF U.S. UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nomura Holding America, the U.S. unit of Japan's biggest
securities company, has named a new executive team to decide the
fate of Capital Company of America, Nomura's once high-flying but
now money-losing mortgage trading operation.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura appointed Michael Hurdelbrink, 55, the chief operating
officer of its London-based Principal Finance Group, to serve as
chief executive of Capital Company of America. He replaces a team
of executives headed by Ethan Penner, the star bond trader who
resigned in September, and Boyd Fellows and Brian Pilcher, whose
resignations were announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Capital Company of America specializes in making real estate
loans and repackaging them as securities to sell to investors. The
business had been a raging success in recent years but faltered
badly in the turmoil that hit bond markets worldwide last summer.
The subsidiary lost $800 million in the six months ended Sept. 30
and contributed to $1.7 billion in losses for Nomura's consolidated
worldwide operations.
</P>
<P>
   The executive changes come as Nomura Securities ponders options
for its U.S. operation, which in recent years used risky
proprietary trading strategies to make big profits. Nomura said in
a news release that the company was weighing several possibilities
for Capital America but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   After the recent losses were reported, Nomura officials said the
firm's international units would de-emphasize private trading
operations and become more like a full-service investment bank,
serving clients.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura officials said recently that Guy Hands, a Nomura managing
director based in London, had been asked to do a top-to-bottom
review of Nomura's U.S. businesses, including Capital Company of
America. Hurdelbrink reported to Hands in London before taking on
his new role in the United States. Company officials said they
expected some results from that review within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some rivals on Wall Street have predicted that the Japanese
company will close or radically shrink Capital America. But Atsushi
Yoshikawa, chief executive of Nomura Holding America, said Friday
in a statement: ``Capital America has the full support and
commitment of NHA.'' In October, Nomura pumped $1.2 billion in new
equity into its U.S. operations, including Capital America, to help
them recover.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership change means that most people on Penner's bond
trading team, once among the best-paid group of traders on Wall
Street, have left Nomura.

PILOTS' UNION CAPITULATES TO FEDERAL EXPRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaders of the pilots union at Federal Express crumbled under
intense pressure from the company Friday and withdrew their threat
to strike during the peak holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising decision by the union's board of directors
amounted to near-complete capitulation to Fedex in what was fast
turning into a bitter conflict. It insures that the delivery of
millions of packages will not be disrupted in December, when Fedex
volumes are 25 percent to 30 percent higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can guarantee all customers that their products for this
holiday peak season will be delivered on time and we stand ready to
meet the peak season demands,'' Byron Cobb, the union's vice
president, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots' virtual surrender is a remarkable victory for Fedex,
which for years has successfully fought union representation for
its 140,000 employees. It is also the second time in the last three
years that the company has beaten back a threat by its pilots to
disrupt holiday deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, United Parcel Service, Fedex's main rival,
suffered a crippling 15-day strike last year when 185,000 drivers
and other workers represented by the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters walked out. Afterward, when UPS pilots also threatened to
strike, the company mollified them with the richest contract in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,500 Fedex pilots were holding out for nearly as good a
deal, dismissing several offers from the company as below industry
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Fedex finally broke off negotiations on Oct. 30 after the pilots
rejected its final offer of a 17 percent pay increase over five
years. The union was also seeking stronger protections against what
it called grueling schedules that have pilots flying at night with
little rest.
</P>
<P>
   Fedex vowed to continue serving customers even if there was a
strike. Many of the pilots thought the company was bluffing, but in
recent days Fedex firmed up its contingency plans by leasing
outside airplanes and trucks, leading them to conclude that their
jobs were in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew force was beginning to shake under Smith's threats,''
said Bob Clement, a union spokesman, referring to Frederick Smith,
the founder of Federal Express, who is now chairman and chief
executive of FDX Corp., its Memphis-based holding company.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter distributed to the pilots Tuesday, Smith scolded
them for ``tarnishing'' Fedex's image and warned that the company
would move forward with or without them.
</P>
<P>
   After an extraordinary meeting Thursday evening during which
many senior pilots urged the union's leadership to settle with the
company, the union agreed to declare a moratorium on all job
actions for 60 days and to delay tallying a strike-authorization
vote, the results of which were scheduled to be announced on Dec.
3. The pilots will immediately begin flying overtime, which they
had been refusing to do since Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Fedex said it will resume contract talks on Monday.
The company also pledged not to lease any more outside trucks and
airplanes, though it said that it would honor the commitments it
had already made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the Fedex Pilots Association decision to eliminate
any job actions during the holiday season,'' said William
Margaritis, a company spokesman. ``We are happy to confirm that
service to customers will continue uninterrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared to welcome the standdown and bid FDX shares
up $1.875 or 3.2 percent to $60.6875, the highest since a $61.375
close on Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots could still conceivably strike early next year if
negotiations with the company once again fell apart. But the
likelihood is small because it seems clear that a majority of them
do not have the stomach for it. In addition, a walkout in February
_ a time when package volumes are low and many outside airplanes
are available for lease _ represents far less of a threat to the
company than one in December.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the union's leadership now appears prepared to accept a
contract that offers less than what their negotiators rejected on
Oct. 30. Margaritis said the company has made it clear to the
pilots that the cost of the contingency plans has now made the
company's previous offer too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The only solace for militant supporters of the union is that it
now appears that Fedex will sign a contract with its pilots, a feat
in itself at the anti-union company. But for Fedex it will end five
years of up-and-down negotiations, in which the divided pilots were
represented by two unions and voted down two tentative contract
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you will see the negotiations resolved in a short
order,'' said Clement of the union. ``You might see a Ford Taurus
rather than a Cadillac. But you will have a contract.''

   When Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.'s stock dipped $1 last Tuesday, to
$82.8125, the move might have left investors scratching their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Lilly had just announced that it would unload its PCS
Health Systems unit to Rite Aid, the drugstore chain, for a cool
$1.5 billion. But the share falloff was just another example of
what might be called the PCS hex.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, convinced that health maintenance organizations were
going to force cuts in prescription drug prices, Lilly paid $4.1
billion for PCS, a pharmacy benefits management concern. Lilly
management thought owning a benefits management business was a sure
way to steer users toward Lilly's drugs.
</P>
<P>
   It never happened. By last year, cash flow was so low at PCS
that Lilly took a $2.4 billion write-down on the unit's assets.
</P>
<P>
   So the sale of the unit should have been cause for celebration
at Lilly's headquarters in Indianapolis _ especially because the
PCS price tag meant that Lilly retained $100 million from PCS on
top of the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Is the hex broken? Ask Rite Aid shareholders. Their shares fell
81.25 cents to end Tuesday at $43.625. &QL;

   A Fidelity Bet on Intel Has Found a Huge Payoff &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who's been making a killing in the Intel Corp.'s stock as it has
run up over 30 percent since the end of third quarter? The mutual
fund giant Fidelity Investments, which spent much of the last four
months building on its already substantial Intel position.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Fidelity Management and Research, the
company's domestic money management arm, nearly doubled its
holdings in Intel, the giant chip maker, adding 26.7 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The purchases meant that at the end of the quarter, Fidelity
Management held 61.5 million Intel shares, or a 3.69 percent stake
in the company, according to data from Technimetrics Inc., a
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   (Fidelity International, the overseas arm, added 462,806 shares
to its position in the same period, increasing its holdings to just
over a million shares.)
</P>
<P>
   It was a timely move. Intel's stock, fueled by bullish sales
forecasts and signs that the semiconductor glut was at an end,
climbed from an annual low of 65.65625 on June 3 to close at
$112.0625 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Fidelity funds that own Intel stock, Trend and OTC
Portfolio named it as their No. 1 holding as of Sept. 30, according
to Fidelity's Web site. The Magellan fund pegged it as its No. 3
holding, while New Millennium and Blue Chip Growth both counted it
as their No. 5 holding.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are all aggressive-growth funds,'' said David W.
Pittelli, senior analyst at Fidelity Investor, a newsletter. ``I
don't see a lot of it in the more value-oriented funds, like
Equity-Income and Equity-Income II.''
</P>
<P>
   A Fidelity spokeswoman, citing company policy not to discuss
individual stocks, declined comment.

   For someone facing the great unknown, A. Barry Rand sounds
awfully upbeat. He and Donna, his wife of eight years, have rarely
taken vacations, almost never with their two children, and he
intends to rectify that. ``We'll go golfing, we'll go skiing, we'll
travel to new places,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rand, 54, announced this month that he was leaving Xerox Corp.,
where he was a front-runner to succeed Paul Allaire as chief
executive until the company hired G. Richard Thoman from IBM last
year and made him the heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   So Rand, Xerox's highest-ranking black executive, quit to look
for a job as chief at another Fortune 500 company. He has no idea
whether his race will help or hinder his search. ``It's like an
election,'' he said. ``Until the votes are in, you don't know
whether your traits are perceived as advantages or disadvantages.''
</P>
<P>
   No one's knocked down his door yet. Gerard Roche, chairman of
Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, an executive search firm, said Rand had the
right stuff but ``the question is what's available.'' Rand says he
has no hard feelings and even plans to ski with Allaire in Aspen
this winter.

   Howard Patterson, who collected money from scores of car dealers
after promising to deliver vehicles that in some cases didn't
exist, was arrested on Nov. 9 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on charges
of writing bad checks to acquire vehicles.

<P>
   Patterson, whose activities were the subject of an article in
The New York Times in September, was in an Acura NSX sports car
with stolen license plates when the police, acting on a tip,
stopped him, Det. Mike Reed said. They confiscated a loaded pistol
and arrested two female companions after a scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Car dealers in six states have been awarded civil fraud
judgments against Patterson, whose real name is Howard Neal Weiner,
for selling them franchises for a Brazilian sport utility vehicle
that he calls the Gazelle.
</P>

   Patterson was released on $4,000 bail, and no court date has

Harvard Business School students that he planned a hostile takeover
of the H.J. Heinz Co., according to The Harbus, the student
newspaper. The actor-entrepreneur also gloated about putting a
rival food venture started by Frank Sinatra out of business.
</P>
<P>
   He was kidding on both counts, of course. Newman, whose company
has contributed more than $90 million to charity since its founding
in 1982, enthralled his audience with his unorthodox musings about
business. He started his venture as ``a joke,'' he said, and
decided to give its profits away after putting his face on bottles
and realizing how tacky it looked.
</P>
<P>
   But James Austin, chairman of the school's Initiative on Social
Enterprise, saw an important business principle at work. Newman's
Own, he said, enjoys a competitive edge because its do-goodism
attracts customers, inspires loyalty among suppliers and employees
and gets favorable press. ``Newman's Own reveals the synergistic
relationship between the social purpose and the commercial
operations,'' he said.

MASSACHUSETTS AG RELUCTANTLY AGREES TO TOBACCO SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Saying it was a ``gut wrenching'' decision to make,
Attorney General Scott Harshbarger Friday announced that
Massachusetts will drop its lawsuit against the tobacco industry
and join the $206 billion national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's decision, which has far-reaching implications for
the state's tobacco control efforts, means Massachusetts will get
$4 billion from the industry over the next 25 years, or $7.6
billion when inflation is factored.
</P>
<P>
   It is the largest civil litigation award in Massachusetts
history.
</P>
<P>
   The first payment, $98 million, will come in March and annual
payments of at least $250 million will follow. The highest amount
will be a payment of $344 million in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general, who three years ago was one of the first
state officials in the country to file suit against cigarette
makers, said he had to weigh two options in deciding whether to
accept the terms of the national settlement or pursue his lawsuit:
the risk of a long legal battle in the courts that might result in
nothing or far less that the deal now on the table; or settle and
immediately gain substantial benefits for Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything in this agreement was the end result of a trial,
I would be more than happy to declare victory,'' Harshbarger said
at a press conference in his office. ``That, in the final analysis,
is the basis for my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger said a victory in court would inevitably become
bogged down in years of appeals and deny the state the sort of
immediate benefits that it will get from agreeing to the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are tangible and hard-fought gains that our state can
begin to enjoy within a few months, instead of speculative benefits
we might have been able to win after a trial and years of
inevitable appeals,'' said the two-term attorney general who is
leaving office in January.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, 45 other states that either have pending suits or
were about to file one have signed onto the agreement. Four other
states _ Florida, Mississippi, Texas, and Minnesota _ have
previously signed separate agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's lawsuit, which had been scheduled for trial in
February in Middlesex Superior Court, was considered one of the
strongest tobacco cases developed by a state. The suit was looking
for reimbursements from the tobacco industry for Medicaid costs the
state incurred from smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But individuals privy to Harshbarger's decision-making this week
say he and his aides were not convinced they would win any sizable
settlement if they won the case in a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a recent ruling by Judge Martha B. Sosman delivered a
serious blow to the amount the state could collect. She declared
the case could not be tried under the state law _ Chapter 93(a) _
that allows for triple damages. The attorney general's own expert
witness estimated the damages in a range that averaged $2.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   At his press conference, Harshbarger said he and other
antismoking leaders would work to make sure the funds from the
settlement were used for public health and antismoking efforts. He
said he wouldalso press to use the money to expand health care
coverage for children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger also said he would file a bill to create a 15-member
commission to make recommendations each year to the governor and
Legislature on how to spend the settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that have signed onto the deal are: Philip Morris
Co.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.; Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp.;
and Lorillard Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is far less than the $368 billion national
settlement that the companies agreed to in June 1997, with the
attorneys general. In that settlement, the industry had agreed to
let the Federal Drug Administration regulate tobacco products and
had agreed to other tough public health provisions. But since then,
cigarette makers have won several important legal and political
victories and were driving a harder bargain this time.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 deal fell apart in Congress this year. This current
agreement does not need congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger three months ago walked out of the talks that
produced the current deal, saying the industry was balking over
public health and marketing issues. He also noted that two of the
major companies _ R.J. Reynolds and Brown &AMP; Williamson _ had pulled
out. He said he wanted to focus on the state's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Harshbarger said he accepted the current settlement
because the two firms had rejoined the talks and the other public
health issues were included in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger had been under pressure from some sectors of the
public health and antismoking community to reject the deal and
press the state's case in court. Antismoking leaders who opposed
the settlement said it did not go far enough in imposing strict
industry marketing restrictions and public health provisions. But
Friday, they said they accepted the reasons for his decision and
praised him for his leadership on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the attorney general was painted into a corner,'' said
Lori Fresina, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts chapter of the
American Cancer Society, referring to the stampede by other states
to join the deal. ``I don't think he had a choice but to settle.''

HARVARD QB ENDS CAREER AGAINST YALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The last player to captain the Harvard football team
for two consecutive years was Daniel J. Hurley _ in 1904-05. That's
one reason Brendan Bibro occupies a special place in Crimson lore
entering Saturday's 115th meeting with Yale at Harvard Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the second time he has served as captain for The
Game, a circumstance he relishes despite the injuries that led to
the distinction. ``They're finally going to kick me out,'' says
Bibro. ``I won't be back.''
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't be in uniform Saturday had it not been for the
series of operations and injuries that kept him on campus.
</P>
<P>
   After a knee injury in his first game in 1994 against Columbia,
he underwent surgery and missed the rest of the year. ``They told
me if I missed that whole year, I'd get an extra year,'' says
Bibro. ``It helped me to know I'd get an extra year.''
</P>
<P>
   The news that Bibro was to serve a second season as captain took
him by surprise. ``It was just a great honor,'' he says. ``I don't
think it's even sunk in now. Maybe it will by the time I'm 40.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson (4-5, 3-3) are underdogs against the Eli (5-4, 4-2),
who can earn a share of the Ivy League championship should they win
and Penn lose at Cornell. The Crimson went undefeated in the league
a year ago, but as Bibro says, ``It's very hard to sustain
perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the program's definitely on the right track, but
sometimes you're faced with adversity and things don't always go
your way. I think we've responded pretty well, but obviously, not
everything's gone our way. The program's still on its way up.
There's just a small group you're recruiting from, without
scholarships. Winning and losing in this league is a fine line.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game transcends league considerations. ``I'm just so
happy I made the choice to come here,'' says Bibro. ``It's just the
best game of the year. It's Harvard-Yale. It's like our bowl game.
Hardly any schools in Division 1-AA can get an atmosphere like
this. This is why you play football. Records are thrown out the
door. It's emotion. It's college football the way it's supposed to
be played.''
</P>
<P>
   No one appreciates Bibro more than coach Tim Murphy. ``You have
to be around him a great deal to really appreciate him,'' says
Murphy. ``He's the single most inspiring kid I've coached in my 20
years of coaching. He's just unbelievable. He is just the most
inspiring leader, the toughest kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be around him to appreciate how fanatical he is
about conditioning, about winning, about helping the kids around
him be successful. He's just so loyal, about being the best he can
be. He's had three surgeries and he's come back stronger than ever.
He's just a special young man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eli are on the upswing, having beaten Princeton, 31-28, last
week on Joe Walland's 76-yard pass to Jake Fuller. ``We were ready
to play,'' says coach Jack Siedlecki. ``The preparation level was
unequaled in my career, and now we've got to come right back and do
it again this week. That's a challenge for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibro's counterpart is a Canadian out of the Toronto suburb of
Peterborough, Corwynne Carruthers, who spent a year at Kent School
in the northwest corridor of Connecticut en route to the Elm City.
He was suitably embarrassed when his team bowed to the Crimson last
year, 17-7, in Yale Bowl and the students out of Cambridge
outnumbered those from his campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to treat it as just another game,'' says
Carruthers. ``I know it's hard to do, but we've just got to focus
on what we have to do. After my sophomore year when I didn't play,
we lost. That's when it really sets in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crimson have won the last three meetings. One of the Eli's
toughest defeats came when Carruthers was a freshman and Eion Hu
scored late in the game for a 22-21 Harvard victory in Yale Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up; he led them down the field and scored a
touchdown,'' says Carruthers. ``I remember all their fans rushing
the field saying, `Yale sucks.' The Yale fans put their heads down
and walked out. There was so much emotion. I wanted to be on the
winning end of it so we can hopefully give out the `Harvard sucks'
chant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could care less if it's the worst game of my career, as long
as we win. If I get knocked off the ball every time, it doesn't
matter. I just want to win.''

   If you could make just one change in the federal tax code, what
would it be? RIA Group, a publisher of tax information for lawyers,
accountants and other professionals, posed that question to
subscribers to its online research service. The answers showed that
people who deal with taxes for a living are concerned about the
same issues as the taxpaying public.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the estate and gift tax, or scaling it back so that
couples with less than $2 million or so would be exempt, was urged
by 40 of the survey's 430 respondents. Many said the tax had so
many loopholes that it snared only those who cannot face planning
for their own deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as many tax professionals want Congress to end the
``marriage penalty,'' under which couples filing jointly can pay up
to $7,000 more in taxes annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply not fair that two wage earners who just happen to
be legally married pay more taxes than two wage earners who are
just living together,'' one respondent wrote.

   Fixed mortgage rates dropped last week as the Federal Reserve
cut short-term interest rates a quarter-point again. A survey of
200 lenders by Bank Rate Monitor found the average rate on a
30-year, fixed-rate mortgage fell 0.08 percent, to 6.81 percent;
the 15-year rate slipped 0.05 percent, to 6.48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed acted for reasons other than to help home refinancers,
but the effect should be lower mortgage rates. Brian O'Connor,
managing editor of the company's Web site, www.bankrate.com, said
the consensus was that 30-year rates would drop to the 6.5 percent
range by mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``don't expect to see results for a while in the
longer-term mortgages, since it is shorter-term bank products that
are more interest-rate sensitive.''

   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's appearance
before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday had no significant
immediate impact on the nation's view of whether President Clinton
should be impeached, two overnight polls released Friday showed.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News interviewed 584 respondents early in the week and again
Thursday night. Early in the week, 25 percent said they believed
that Clinton should be impeached. Thursday night 30 percent said
so, but the poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll interviewed 652 people Thursday night, and found
that 35 percent said they wanted their representative to vote for
impeachment. That was an increase from 31 percent from a different
poll last week. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Both polls registered some improvement in national opinion about
Starr himself. Gallup found that 35 percent had a favorable view of
him now, compared with 31 percent last week. Among the 44 percent
who said they had seen or heard about the hearings, his rating was
40 percent favorable.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News registered a clearer gain, but from a lower base.
Eighteen percent of its sample was favorable to Starr before the
hearing, and 26 percent was afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the national balance is still heavily against him.
Fifty-eight percent of Gallup's respondents said they disapproved
of how Starr was handling his investigation compared with 63
percent last week. In the CBS News poll Thursday, 60 percent said
he was more concerned with damaging Clinton than with finding out
whether anything illegal had been done. Earlier in the week, 62
percent held that view.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kathleen Frankovic, director of surveys for CBS News, said of
her company's poll, ``While there was a modest improvement in
opinions about Starr, there was little change in attitudes about
the investigation or impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   This was true, Ms. Frankovic said, even though the CBS News Poll
showed that 65 percent of the public felt Starr had done a good job
of presenting his case to the committee. Gallup had a similar
finding, with 26 percent saying he had done ``an excellent job''
and another 41 percent saying he had done a ``good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The two polls offered somewhat contradictory findings about the
impeachment process. Gallup asked if the hearing gave respondents
more confidence or less confidence in the impeachment process in
Congress. Thirty-two percent said it gave them more confidence; 42
percent said less.
</P>
<P>
   But in the CBS News Poll, the question was put in a different
way, with respondents asked if they approved or disapproved of how
the committee was handling impeachment. Early in the week, 41
percent approved and 43 percent disapproved; on Thursday night 47
percent approved and 39 percent disapproved.

IRAQ IS STILL BALKING ON ARMS INSPECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq has thrown up significant obstructions to
the work of international arms inspectors less than a week after
backing down on its ban on cooperating with them.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British officials have warned that air strikes remain
an immediate option if the government of Saddam Hussein does not
honor its pledge to renew cooperation with the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis appear to believe that they can balk on major issues
until they win a comprehensive review of their relations with the
United Nations. But that review, the Security Council decided on
Oct. 30, cannot take place until there is full cooperation with
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq appears to be defiant on several fronts, including in its
crucial biological weapons program, which remains potentially the
most immediately dangerous of Iraq's prohibited arms. With the
right components _ and Iraq is suspected of harboring a large
quantity of them _ biological weapons can be produced in a matter
of days.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation with Iraq, sooner than expected, raises
questions about the stability of the Iraqi president and his
understanding of the seriousness of the threat he faces and the
limited help _ if any _ he can expect from former friends.
</P>
<P>
   Experts had assumed that it would take the appearance of a
short-notice, spot inspection team to provoke Iraq. These teams are
only beginning to be assembled, however, as routine monitoring
systems are restored after a week-long break.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the renewed confrontation are Iraqi documents
that Richard Butler, the chief inspector, has said are critical to
a full accounting of what prohibited weapons Iraq possessed before
the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf. Without those records, it is all
but impossible to determine what arms remain _ or have not been
adequately accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Among the disputed documents is at least one that President
Clinton confidently predicted on Sunday would be turned over, to
the surprise of some diplomats here. It is an Iraqi air force
account of what kind of ammunition was loaded and used _ or
destroyed _ in the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. inspectors believe that the missing document _ literally
snatched away from the inspection team that found it in July _
indicates that Iraq may have been left with more chemical and
biological munitions, when the war with Iraq ended, than it has
declared .
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Butler, Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Riyadh
al-Qaisi, said that the request for the air force document had
overstepped the bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The request you made seems to be provocative rather than
professional,'' the Iraqi official said in a letter Thursday night.
This letter is interesting for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, it underscores Iraq's apparently misguided hope that it
can undercut Butler by portraying his requests as out of line.
Considering that Baghdad is making a direct challenge to the
authority of the Security Council, Iraq can never hope to unseat
Butler. The council created his disarmament commission. Moreover,
it ordered the Iraqis to turn over the air force document several
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the prominence of al-Qaisi in recent exchanges
reinforces rumors that he is about to be sent to New York to
represent Iraq at the United Nations, replacing Nizar Hamdoon
sometime in December.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Iraqi move may deplete whatever sympathy or
understanding Saddam may have found in the office of
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has seen his February agreement
with Saddam violated brazenly and repeatedly in recent months, and
his more recent pleas for Iraqi compliance cavalierly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In general, al-Qaisi argued, the documents Butler wanted either
did not exist or were already accounted for in information provided
earlier to UNSCOM, the U.N. Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
   As a possible concession, the Iraqis said that the contested air
force document might be looked at in the presence of the
secretary-general's special envoy, Prakash Shah. Diplomats
dismissed this as another Iraqi ploy to circumvent the special
commission and the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Butler fired back in a nine-page letter to Ambassador
Peter Burleigh, the U.S. representative at the United Nations and
this month's Security Council president, detailing his most recent
exchanges with Iraq. He had written to Iraq this week outlining
what information he needed as inspections resume. A copy of the
letter to Burleigh was sent to Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said Friday that Iraq ``declines to furnish the
commission with any information on its biological-weapons
program,'' preferring to wait for the promised comprehensive
review. But that option was never in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Butler also told Burleigh that Iraq also appears to be denying
access to archives in the Ministry of Defense, the Military
Industrialization Corp. and other government departments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Access by UNSCOM to the archives, to be provided as I hope,
through cooperation by Iraq, would be the most effective and least
controversial way of the commission obtaining the necessary
evidence for the accounting of Iraq's prohibited weapons
programs,'' Butler wrote. ``It would avoid seeking out such
documents through intrusive inspection which, as council members
are aware, has sometimes been the source of tension and blockage.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has furthermore refused to answer questions about the
extent of its production and loading into warheads of the nerve
agent VX, an odorless, colorless gas that can kill within hours.
Questions on missiles and inexplicable quantities of missile fuel
are also being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is also apparently trying to conceal as ``state secrets''
important diaries and memoirs of Iraqi military officers with
knowledge of the extent of Iraqi weapons programs.

 &HT;    Holbrooke recounts near failure of accord's acceptance
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO, STUDENTS-COX
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Today is the third anniversary of the Dayton
Peace Accords, which ended the brutal war in Bosnia, but diplomat
Richard Holbrooke took the occasion to recall how close the
agreement came to not happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exactly three years ago, at exactly this time that we
were shuttling between the Serb, Croat and Bosnian Muslim
delegations, with the conference headed for a crash,'' said
Holbrooke, who returned to Dayton on Friday to receive an honorary
degree from the University of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 10:30 in the evening we gave Bosnian President Alija
Izetbegovic one hour to agree to a concession or we were going to
shut the talks down,'' Holbrooke said. ``He said no and around the
world the talks were reported _ correctly _ as a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in the morning, Izetbegovic relented and the Accord was
reached, ending a civil war that killed 300,000 and introduced the
term ``ethnic cleansing'' to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, three years later, I think Dayton can be judged a
success, not a perfect one, but a success,'' Holbrooke said. ``The
war is over and it ended here.''
</P>
<P>
   UD's Center for International Programs is sponsoring workshops
today to suggest a strategic plan for NATO in the Balkans, where
American troops remain as part of a stabilization force. The
morning roundtable discussion, beginning at 8:30 in UD's Kennedy
Union, is open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke is still working on the Balkans. He spent nine days in
October in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, convincing President Slobodon
Milosevic to pull back Serbian troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation there has seriously eroded,'' Holbrooke said.
``Kosovo was an inexcusable summer of atrocity and Belgrade must be
held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs and rebel ethnic Albanians are observing a fragile
cease-fire, but that could change by spring if a political solution
is not found during the winter, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdic urged that
accused war criminals be brought to justice so that the nearly 2
million refugees can return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be a minimum of justice,'' he said. ``If the
refugees don't go back, then `ethnic cleansing' lives. We must send
a message that you cannot kill your neighbors and get away with
it.''

 &HT;    Rebuilding Bosnia's economy job left after accords, students say
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Rebuilding a shattered economy is one of the main
tasks facing Bosnia, according to students and officials who
gathered Friday to mark the third anniversary of the Dayton Peace
Accords.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 10 years, I see myself working on the stock exchange _ and
we don't even have one,'' said Sabina Hecimovic, one of 10 college
students from Bosnia who participated in a roundtable discussion at
the University of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   UD's Center for International Programs is sponsoring a three-day
workshop on the Dayton Accords, which in 1995 ended the civil war
in the Balkans. With a large international military force in place,
the Serb, Croatian and Muslim factions have not renewed fighting,
but rebuilding the country as a multiethnic state has proven to be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lekson, deputy special representative for the
implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords, told a luncheon crowd
at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base's Hope Hotel that the move to a
free market economy in Bosnia has been slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, McDonald's, which seem to find a way to go
anywhere, is having trouble getting into Bosnia,'' Lekson said.
</P>
<P>
   The students, many of whom were in high school during the
1991-1995 war, seemed ready to move beyond the old animosities that
once divided the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trapped by Communist ideology for 30 years,'' said
Lejla Mrkonja, 26, who is studying law at UD. ``If we continue with
this policy, we'll segregate even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrkonja was conscripted to work in a hospital during the war and
still sees too many signs of nationalism in her country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all flags and shields,'' she said. ``They couldn't even
agree on the design of our flag. That is the level of little
children. We are still locked in our medieval, tribal past.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the key points of the Dayton Accord remain unfulfilled.
Lekson noted there is a lack of political will, lack of a sense of
security, housing shortages and few employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lekson said some common institutions are being created.
</P>
<P>
   ``One flag, passports, one currency, one license plate are more
important that they might appear,'' Lekson said. ``People are
starting to believe that Bosnia has a future.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been three peaceful rounds of elections since the
accord was signed, with a trend toward more moderates being
elected, Lekson said.
</P>
<P>
   However, some Serb factions only cooperate when forced to,
Lekson said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students said it was difficult to see more than
three or four months into their future.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our children will not go through another war,'' Natasa
Gvozdenovic said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a sunny afternoon in Tucson last March when Mary Meeker
sprinted past a cluster of computer executives chatting at PC
Forum, an annual gathering of the digirati. Ms. Meeker, an analyst
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, is best known for her coverage of
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary, would you sell Yahoo when it hits $5 billion?,'' a
reporter shouted from the crowd. Yahoo, the top-rated site that
guides people to destinations on the World Wide Web, had already
become the darling stock of high-technology investors. Despite tiny
sales and microscopic profits, it had surged to a total market
value of $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meeker paused, looking quizzical.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter pressed ahead. ``How about $10 billion?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, throwing out a value that would have seemed unthinkable at
the time, he barked, ``$20 billion?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I believe in the company, I buy the stock,'' she answered,
impatient with the question. Then she zoomed off.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, would Yahoo's stock market value. It shot past $5
billion in April, hopped over $10 billion in September and is now
at $18.8 billion. And Ms. Meeker, like most of the other analysts
who follow the stock, continues to rate Yahoo a strong buy.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every type of investor thinks about valuation in one way
or another. The trick of the game, after all, is to buy low and
sell high _ and that requires a way to measure if a stock price is
more or less than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and investors who are bullish on companies like
Yahoo _ or on other new stars like Amazon.com, the bookseller, and
Ebay, the on-line auctioneer _ are just not interested in the
question of whether these stocks are climbing too high.
</P>
<P>
   If you have to ask, as they say on the Internet, you just don't
get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had been overly focused on value, I don't think we would
have been able to take the leap of faith to own these things,''
said Pamela Cutrell, a vice president of Essex Investment
Management, one of the few institutional investors that have been
active in Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cutrell argues that Internet companies are growing so fast
that they are bound to become more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many investors who focus on the value question washed
their hands of Internet companies long ago _ if they ever sullied
them in the sector to begin with. Indeed, that has been the style
of professional investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not pension fund-type stocks,'' said Shaun G.
Andrikopoulos, an analyst with BT Alex Brown. Most trading in such
issues is in lots of a few hundred shares, indicating that
individual investors, not mutual funds or other institutional
investors, are the usual players.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, brokerage firms and their analysts cannot simply wash
their hands of these stocks, no matter how unreasonable the
valuations may seem. There is too much money to be made in
underwriting the stock offerings of the endless stream of Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts justify their recomendations with the
multiple-multiplication method. In this approach, the analyst
forecasts continued, rapid growth for sales, and just maybe
earnings, for the company for several years. Then the analyst
calculates what the stock would be worth if the company achieved
those sales forecasts and its stock traded at a certain, enormous
multiple.
</P>
<P>
   A good example of this is the justification used two weeks ago
by Rakesh Sood, the Goldman, Sachs analyst, for a report predicting
a $150 stock price within 18 months for Ebay, a company that
Goldman had brought public in September at $18 a share; it now
trades at $147.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst estimated that the revenue of Ebay, which lets
consumers auction their attic collectibles, would triple from $43
million to $126 million in 2000. If the company exceeded his
published estimate by 50 percent (``Optimistic,'' he wrote, but
hardly unthinkable) and it warranted a price-to-sales multiple of
35, then its stock would be worth $150.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, don't bother with the mathematical contortions
to back up their picks. ``Never let valuation get in the way of a
good Internet story,'' Andrikopoulos said. ``The only way to look
at Internet stocks is based purely with what is happening with the
underlying fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrikopoulos used to cover computer stocks, to which he applied
the old-fashioned idea that analysts should recommend selling
stocks as they became over-valued. He learned his lesson with
Yahoo's stock when he downgraded it in June 1997. After the stock
tripled, he upgraded it last April, and it has more than tripled
since. Now, Andrikopoulos has a buy recommendation on every
Internet stock he covers.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst who argues that some small measure of gravity may
apply even on the Internet is Paul W. Noglows of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist,
the San Francisco brokerage firm that specializes in small
companies. After championing Yahoo for years, Noglows dropped his
rating to a hold in July, after its market value hit $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Yahoo on a fundamental basis,'' he said, ``but I don't
think its value should be the same as Viacom or CBS.'' Viacom, he
said, is expected to post revenue of $15 billion next year, versus
$315 million for Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Noglows has become a virtual Jeremiah among Internet analysts
because he dares to speak of value. His initial rating for
Broadcast.com, the on-line music and news provider, was a hold, a
shocking move since his firm was among the underwriters. ``I am a
huge believer that the Internet will dwarf anything we have seen
before,'' he said. ``But I don't think that people are buying these
stocks to hold for the next 10 years. I think this is a game of the
greater fool.''

 Comdex Is Collision of 2 Lifestyles  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Las Vegas
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Coty Alexander spoke in a voice barely above a whisper, and she was
hawking some pretty obscure technology, but she didn't have any
trouble drawing visitors to the T.S. MicroTech booth at the Comdex
computer trade show that ended here  &LR; Friday &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Her secret was in the platinum hair, the distinctive beauty mark
and the low-cut white dress. What computer nerd could resist a
pitch from Marilyn Monroe?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've handed these flyers out before just being myself, and
they say no, but they'll take them from me because I'm Marilyn,''
Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   Comdex is the ultimate collision of Silicon Valley geek chic and
cheesy Las Vegas glitz. Taxicabs and billboards that once promoted
exotic dancers are this week advertising Tektronix printers and all
the ``hot'' goings on at the Conexant booth.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that sex is hidden from view. Shameless
hucksters hand out raunchy flyers advertising the city's seemingly
endless array of strippers and hookers. That's smart marketing:
It's not too risky to guess that three-quarters of those attending
Comdex are men.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue for Ziff-Davis, the unit of Softbank that runs
Comdex, is whether the show is losing some of its luster. The buzz
at Comdex was that fewer people attended, while industry leaders
like Intel, Dell Computer, Compaq Computer and IBM did not have
booths on the show floor.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas Review Journal reported that hotel rooms were much
easier to come by this year, and the Comdex price-gouging that had
gone on in the past _ with rates even tripling during Comdex week _
was not in evidence. Part of that may be because people come only
for one or two days of the show, rather than the duration. In
addition, Las Vegas keeps building thousands of new hotel rooms at
splashy casinos like Bellagio and New York New York.
</P>
<P>
   William Sell, the general manager of Ziff-Davis' Comdex Group,
staunchly defended the show as on target in both corporate and
individual attendance. He expects 220,000 people to have passed
through the show, he said, and he noted that Intel and others were
still present with signs, keynote speeches, meeting rooms and
hospitality suites.
</P>
<P>
   CULTURE CLASH: The computer industry does not represent the
typical visitor to Las Vegas. Cabbies grumbled that techies are
lousy tippers. Show attendees would rather do business, or debate
the merits of Windows NT versus Unix, than blow their hard-earned
stock options at the craps table.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the week a lot of casinos do renovations,'' said Mary
Ellen Collins, Ziff-Davis public relations manager.
</P>
<P>
   A croupier at the Treasure Island craps table said, ``The joke
about these computer guys is, they come to Comdex with one shirt
and one $20 bill, and they don't change either one of them.'' (A
computer reseller gambling at his table exclaimed, ``That's so
true! Have you smelled some of these guys?'')
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Las Vegas Convention Center one night, attendees
filed past Fred Wufka, pastor of Holy Ghost Church in Las Vegas,
who held a small basket collecting money for the city's homeless.
</P>
<P>
   As the programmers and resellers at Comdex walked past him on
their way to lavish parties and expense-account dinners, were they
generous to his cause?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're people and they're doing OK,'' Wufka said, glancing at
the meager collection in his basket. ``They do their best, I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   THE URGE TO CONVERGE: Almost as notable as the absence of Intel
and IBM booths were the massive setups from companies like
Panasonic, Sony, Hitachi and Toshiba. Many of their offerings show
how consumer electronics and computers are inching toward each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Even a veteran PC watcher like Michael Slater, editor of
Sebastopol's Microprocessor Report, noted, ``The things that were
the most interesting were not the PCs. It's the consumer
electronics show.''
</P>
<P>
   Little machines that hook up to the Internet, or communicate
with each other, or bring television to the PC _ or vice versa _
were all the rage this year. Fueled by the PalmPilot's popularity,
tiny, lightweight portable devices that ``allow you to do e-mail in
the back of a taxicab'' have proliferated, Ziff-Davis' Sell said.
</P>
<P>
   GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES: Coty Alexander, the Marilyn
impersonator, said she had much better luck getting an acting
career going when she left her native Los Angeles and moved to Las
Vegas a few years ago. ``I made more money as an actress in my
first year here than I ever did in L.A.,'' she said. `I got a
starring role in a show, and I'm on billboards and taxicabs.''
</P>
<P>
   She stars as Madonna in a show at the Stratosphere casino.
Playing Madonna lets her show off her bad side, she said, while as
Marilyn she ``conjures up some specialness'' that people respond
to.
</P>
<P>
   Playing Marilyn, Alexander earns $500 to $800 a day at booths
like T.S. Microtech's, and she can fetch $5,000 for singing a few
songs at a party.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part of the job is the blisters she gets after
standing for eight hours in her white high heels.
</P>
<P>
   At the T.S. Microtech booth, she handed out flyers touting TSM's
fan cards and Point of Sale PCs. What could she tell visitors about
those items? ``Nothing at all,'' she said. ``And that's the way I
like it.''
</P>
<P>
   SPOOK DISPLAYS: Sceptre Technologies lured people to its booth
with a contest to win the most popular freebie at this year's show:
bright stuffed Komodo dragons that roar when squeezed. Sceptre
makes computer monitors, and the dragons are monitor lizards _ get
it?
</P>
<P>
   One type of Sceptre monitor, for use on a laptop, is an
``exclusive view'' screen. You can't see a thing on the screen
until you put on a special pair of glasses. Computer execs could
use it to keep nosy airplane seatmates from stealing trade secrets
_ and some other organizations find it useful, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually selling them to the CIA,'' said Simon Chen,
marketing manager for the City of Industry (Los Angeles County)
company.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE BOX: Proving that old maxim that no one ever went broke
underestimating the taste of the American people, the folks at Agfa
earned ``top-of- mind'' awareness for their products by handing out
cardboard boxes that could be worn as hats.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Scoggin of Las Cruces, N.M., was one of many show
attendees roaming the halls with a box atop his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here to collect free stuff,'' Scoggin said, showing
off dozens of product-promoting buttons. ``People give people like
me free things to wear.''
</P>
<P>
   COMDEX BY THE NUMBERS: The trade show featured 2,400 exhibitors
representing 131 countries, with two-thirds from North America,
Ziff-Davis' Collins said. They occupied 2.5 million square feet of
floor space _ the equivalent of 510 football fields.
</P>
<P>
   That floor space cost about $50 a square foot, which brings the
indoor real estate alone to $125 million. That doesn't include what
it cost companies to set up the booths or to send employees to
staff them.
</P>
<P>
   Although that figure was not available, Collins said the show,
Las Vegas' biggest convention, brings $405 million into the city.
And Sell said annualized audits show that $1.6 billion in business
is transacted either at the show or as a result of contacts
established or renewed at the show.
</P>
<P>
   THE RULES OF COMDEX: As with any show the size of Comdex, there
have to be rules. But the attendees don't have to like those rules.
</P>
<P>
   One unbreakable rule was that no one but exhibitors could go on
the show floor until 10 a.m. The guards did not rely on their own
watches, but waited for the all-clear to be broadcast. One morning,
the clock approached 10:10 a.m., and the mob waiting for floor
access grew angry, but the opening bell was not forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's running this show?'' one wag asked. ``Amtrak?''
</P>
<P>
   A rule closing the press room at 6 p.m. was just as rigidly
enforced, never mind the deadlines. As reporters were ousted from
phones and laptops, one muttered, ``This must be the only place in
Las Vegas that closes at 6 p.m.''

LUBBOCK OFFICIALS FLY TO VIRGINIA TO APOLOGIZE TO COACHES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Top Lubbock city officials Friday offered in-person apologies to
two Hampton, Va., college basketball coaches who were erroneously
arrested for attempted theft in the Texas city.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at Hampton University said lawyers, including
former O.J. Simpson defense attorney Johnnie Cochran, will continue
their investigation into this week's ill-fated police action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything remains the same,'' said Faye Hardy-Lucas, the
university's general counsel. ``Cochran and the other attorneys are
still looking into the matter for us.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit against the city of Lubbock or the police department
is a possibility, she said. ``But we don't know as of yet,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Meanwhile, the witness who identified one of the coaches as
the woman who tried to con her in a Wal-Mart parking lot told The
Associated Press on Friday that she was too far away to be certain
the coach was the culprit. The victim, Elenita Hester, said police
only allowed her to see the coach from a car 60 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release issued late Friday, Hester and her husband
said that even though they told officers they were arresting the
wrong people, police ``expressed confidence they were on the right
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Ken Walker said he was certain Hester had a good
chance to look at the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. According to her response, we felt that she was
comfortable with the identification,'' Walker said Friday after
hearing about the news release. ``Without any doubt whatsoever, she
identified the coach as having been involved. She gave us a sworn
statement under the possible perjury penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton women's basketball coach Patricia Bibbs, 48, her
husband, Ezell Bibbs, 46, and assistant coach Vanetta Kelso, 36,
were arrested Monday afternoon in an alleged attempted ``pigeon
drop'' scam. Such schemes generally involve the victim being conned
into providing the thieves with cash in exchange for a share in a
fictitious found treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Kelso, who is five months pregnant, became ill during the arrest
and was briefly taken to a Lubbock hospital before joining her
companions at the local jail. Tuesday night's scheduled basketball
game against 12th-ranked Texas Tech University was canceled after
the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday afternoon, Lubbock officials said no charges would
be filed in the case. They said they regretted the mistake, but
stressed that the arrests for attempted felony theft were made on
the basis of sworn statements by the purported victim who later
recanted.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Lubbock Mayor Wendy Sitton, City Attorney Anita
Burgess, City Councilman T.J. Patterson and City Manager Bob Cass
flew to Virginia. In a Friday afternoon news conference in Hampton,
Sitton said she wanted to dispel any doubt that might linger, and
to ``do anything that I possibly could to help preserve the dignity
of Hampton University.''
</P>
<P>
   University President William Harvey responded that ``the apology
indicates that there is recognition that there was wrongdoing,''
The Associated Press reported. ``It takes a big person to do what
Mayor Sitton has done, and I believe her apology is genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   Lubbock police Friday continued to search for a pair of women
who attempted two pigeon drops at separate Wal-Mart stores Monday.

FIRST PIECE OF INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ORBITING EARTH  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN E. LEARY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first piece of the international space station
was orbiting Earth Friday, sprouting antennae and unfolding solar
power panels as it awaited other segments, which will eventually
grow into the largest orbital laboratory in history.
</P>
<P>
   The module, called Zarya from the Russian term meaning sunrise
or dawn, took a flawless ride into space atop a three-stage Russian
Proton booster rocket that lifted off at 1:40 a.m. Eastern time
from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   The launching was witnessed by the heads of the space agencies
of the 16 nations that are sponsoring the station, which will cost
at least $40 billion to build over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Zarya, built in Russia with $240 million from the United States,
is to be joined in two weeks by the first American module, a
docking hub called Unity.
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle Endeavour is to take off on Dec. 3 to
rendezvous with Zarya and attach the two units. This is to be
followed by 43 more flights by American and Russian rockets
carrying more than 100 parts to be assembled in space to form a
900,000-pound research station housing up to seven astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Goldin, the administrator of NASA, said at a news
conference following the launching, ``Now we only have 44 launches
to go, about 1,000 hours of space walks and countless problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But because of all the partner nations trusting each other and
working together, he said, ``the international space station is
going to be a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the new space station is coming together, questions
continue about the fate of Russia's existing space laboratory, the
12-year-old Mir. Because of the collapse of the Russian economy,
doubts that Russia can produce enough rockets and other equipment
to support both projects led Russia to promise that it would
abandon Mir and destroy the station by next summer. However, in
recent weeks Russian officials have been lobbying to find ways to
extend Mir's life.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by the news agency Reuters, President
Boris Yeltsin's space adviser, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, said Friday he
was preparing a number of proposals on extending Mir's life past
the year 2000. Support for such options has been growing in recent
weeks among Russian space officials, astronauts and nationalists,
who see Mir as a symbol of Russian achievements in space.
</P>
<P>
   James Van Laak, NASA's deputy manager of operations for the
space station, said Friday that the agency had not received any
formal proposals about extending Mir's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA would find such a proposal unacceptable if it has any
measurable impact on the international space station,'' Van Laak
said in a telephone interview from the Johnson Space Center in
Houston, ``No one has any objection to Mir or keeping it
operational if the Russians find a way to support both projects,
but they have to demonstrate they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian Space Agency, said the
launching of Zarya, a 42,000-pound space tugboat that will supply
power and propulsion in the early stages of station construction,
was a needed vindication for the troubled Russian space program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian space industry is alive and well and is perfectly
able to fulfill all of its commitments on the international space
station,'' Koptev said.

46 STATES ACCEPT $206-BILLION SETTLEMENT WITH CIGARETTE MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: More to be filed by 9:30 ET.) 
(mk) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest legal and financial threat to the tobacco industry
ended Friday when 46 states accepted a $206 billion plan to settle
state lawsuits filed against cigarette makers to recover Medicaid
money spent treating diseases related to smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which the tobacco industry said it would sign on
Monday, brings to an apparent close one of the most dramatic
chapters in the history of the nation's war on smoking, one that
began in 1994 when the first states filed damage suits against
cigarette makers and accelerated when four of those states reached
multi-billion-dollar settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Those states _ Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas _
settled their suits for a total of $40 billion paid over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases the tobacco corporations found themselves in the
crosshairs of public attention as thousands of secret industry
documents spilled into view, revealing how the companies had
suppressed research on the health hazards of smoking and had sought
to attract teen-agers as ``replacement'' smokers for those who had
died.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, in an effort to protect itself from potentially
bankrupting state and class-action lawsuits, the tobacco industry
reached a $368.5 billion accord with attorneys general from 40
states. When Congress took up legislation required for ratifying
that agreement this spring, the bill was raised to $516 billion and
cigarette makers were denied the legal immunity they had sought in
return.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in the legislation's defeat and eventually this
week's settlement without the participation by the federal
government, ending anti-smoking groups' hopes for a broader
agreement that would combat teen-age smoking and bring the industry
under federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Many anti-smoking advocates, like Dr. C. Everett Koop, the
former surgeon general, declared the new pact weak and called on
state officials to reject it. But over the past five days, the
period when officials had to decide whether to join the plan or to
pursue their lawsuits, state after state signed up, including those
that had initially expressed strong reservations with the accord,
like Wisconsin, Massachusetts and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, Christine Gregoire, the Washington state
attorney general, announced that 46 states and five U.S.
territories that had not already made individual settlements with
the industry or filed a smoking-related lawsuit had signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gregoire, chief state negotiator in the talks, said she
believed the accord was the best deal that could be reached and
said that further delays would do little to prevent more young
people from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who say it is not enough, I say we simply couldn't
afford to come away with nothing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette producers participating in the plan are Philip
Morris Cos.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco
Holdings Corp.; Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of Loews Corp., and
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, a subsidiary of BAT Industries PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to sign the settlement on Monday, Nov. 23, as
planned,'' the companies said Friday in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's fifth-largest cigarette maker, Liggett &AMP; Myers, a
subsidiary of the Brooke Group, also agreed Friday to join the
plan, Ms. Gregoire said. She added that all states except
Massachusetts had also agreed to resolve their claims against the
nation's largest producer of smokeless tobacco, U.S. Tobacco, a
subsidiary of UST Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Mike Easley, the North Carolina attorney general,
said the four major cigarette makers were close to reaching an
agreement under which they would pay $5 billion to help affected
farmers in tobacco-growing states.
</P>
<P>
   Companies will likely pass the settlement's cost on to smokers
who may see prices rise from 35 cents to 40 cents a package. Gary
Black, a tobacco industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in New
York, said major price boosts might come as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement plan, cigarette makers will, among other
things, make marketing changes like taking down billboards, finance
educational campaigns intended to stop young people from starting
to smoke, and pay for research intended to help smokers quit.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement does not prevent cigarette makers from
continuing a number of practices that would have been restricted
under last year's plan, like advertising in stores and in
magazines. They will also be permitted to continue to sponsor
sports events, though on a limited basis.

AMID U.S. SUIT, NORTHWEST BUYS STAKE IN RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (js)

<P>
   Northwest Airlines acquired a controlling stake in rival
Continental Airlines for $430 million in cash and stock Friday,
despite a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department last month that
charged that the deal violates federal antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The two airlines also said that they would form the country's
fourth- largest airline network next month when they begin
combining their frequent-flier programs and selling seats on 850 of
each other's domestic and international flights.
</P>
<P>
   Both actions were widely expected, but the start of the
country's most comprehensive domestic airline alliance in the face
of government opposition raises the stakes in a simmering national
debate over airline competition. Ever since Northwest and
Continental first announced their so-called virtual merger in
January, consumer advocates, politicians, large corporations and
small airlines have charged that it would inhibit competition,
making it easier for major airlines to charge higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest and Continental have countered that their alliance
would enhance competition by creating a stronger fourth rival to
the three largest U.S. carriers: United Airlines, American Airlines
and Delta Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that if Northwest and Continental are allowed to
align, it will only encourage the other airlines to cooperate
rather than compete. United and Delta have already combined their
frequent-flier programs and airport lounges, as have American and
US Airways. Executives at the airlines say they are waiting to see
what happens with Northwest and Continental before they strengthen
their alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domestic alliances represent a consolidation of the airline
industry that will undoubtedly leave consumers with fewer choices
and higher fares,'' Rep. William Lipinski of Illinois, the ranking
Democrat on the House Aviation Subcommittee, said in a statement
Friday. ``Northwest and Continental are setting an unhealthy
precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock transaction was allowed to close Friday despite the
government's lawsuit because the Justice Department, in an usual
move, did not ask the courts to block the deal while its case was
wending its way through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers said that unlike a merger, in which companies
fire employees and close down plants, a stock deal can be easily
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   In order to insure Continental's independence, Northwest has
agreed to put the shares in a trust for six years, voting on them
only when Continental's future was at stake, such as during a
takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
   After negotiating with the Justice Department, Northwest agreed
to extend the restrictions for four more years and to give up its
right to a seat on Continental's board, features it agreed to
retain in the deal closed Friday even though negotiations with the
government collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing we have heard changes our view that this transaction
is anticompetitive,'' said Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the
Justice Department's antitrust division. ``We are moving ahead with
our lawsuit. If we prevail, the parties will have to sell their
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that will take time, during which Northwest and
Continental will continue to do business. Northwest has still not
responded to the government lawsuit and no trial date is set. Asked
if it was in the airline's interest to delay a resolution of the
case for as long as possible, Douglas Steenland, Northwest's
general counsel, replied: ``One could speculate that it might be.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the alliance could face further government scrutiny. Both
the Justice Department and the Department of Transportation are
investigating the arrangement. According to a new law recently
passed by Congress, the Transportation Department can force
airlines to delay the implementation of their joint ventures while
it reviews them.
</P>
<P>
   A Transportation Department spokesman said Friday that the
frequent flier portion of the Northwest-Continental alliance is
subject to a 30-day waiting period that expires on Dec. 4. The
department also has the power to extend the review by another 60
days.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its far-reaching powers the Transportation
Department has done virtually nothing to police airline competition
since the industry was deregulated in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DOT is closing its eyes and hoping this is all going to go
away,'' said Samuel Buttrick, an analyst at Paine Webber in New
York. ``Sooner or later they are going to have to adopt a coherent
domestic alliance policy.''
</P>
<P>
   One hitch in closing Friday's deal had nothing to do with the
government. Certain investors in Air Partners, the investment group
led by financier David Bonderman that was selling the Continental
shares to Northwest, were not happy about receiving Northwest
shares because their price had fallen much farther than Continental
stock has since January.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the investors were allowed to hold on to 854,000
shares of Continental stock but gave Northwest their proxy to vote
the shares. ``They were able to salvage some value by taking fewer
Northwest shares,'' Buttrick said of the investors.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Friday, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association
won the right to represent Northwest aircraft mechanics, displacing
the International Association of Machinists. The vote clears the
way for Northwest to negotiate a new contract with both the
mechanics and other workers who are still represented by the
Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Northwest must also negotiate a contract with its
flight attendants, who are represented by the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters.

which of George Balanchine's ballets were on the first program when
the New York City Ballet officially came into existence on Oct. 11,
1948. As virtually every City Ballet subscriber knows by heart, the
triple bill consisted of ``Concerto Barocco,'' ``Orpheus'' and
``Symphony in C.'' The same program will inaugurate the City

   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews ``Little Me'';
``Chicago'' and ``The Ride Down Mount Morgan. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   KIDMAN-THEATER (London) _ It will come as no surprise to Nicole
Kidman's screen admirers to learn that she also looks sexy and
beautiful on stage, not least when scantily dressed. Yet this
unremarkable discovery threw British newspapers into a veritable
swoon this fall when she made her first stage appearance in 11
years. True, sex (italics)is(end italics) the theme of the play,
``The Blue Room,'' David Hare's loose adaptation of Arthur
Schnitzler's turn-of-the-century play ``Reigen,'' or round-dance,
now better known as ``La Ronde.'' Ten characters (Ms. Kidman and
the British actor Iain Glen each play five) engage in a daisy-chain
of sexual encounters. By Alan Riding. (Moved).

<P>
   LA-CAJUN-MUSIC (L'anse De'prien Noir, La.) _ The vital French
music of the region _ 22 parishes called Acadiana _ hasn't been
shunted to the museum, to be occasionally dusted off and propped on
a sterile stage. French music thrived here because of South
Louisiana's isolation, both physical and cultural. But what
happened here is not an isolated event. Often damned for its
take-no-prisoners mass culture, the United States has always found
room for local, often country, musics: the strong fiddling
tradition that grew up around Galax, Va.; the African-American
fife-and-drum bands of Northern Mississippi; the Mexican-American
conjunto born along the Texas-Mexico border. And the omnivorous
popular culture has never been shy about borrowing (stealing?) from
the locals, as Cajuns know. By Dana Jennings. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-FAME (Undated) _ Is it desperation among music marketers
or just the nature of celebrity that has turned career building
into such spasms of sudden success and sudden obscurity? Selling
and buying the star is a musical process as old as Franz Liszt, but
the ascent to belovedness has become more vertical. A certain
hysteria is in the air, with audiences needy for something to love
and promoters eager to supply it. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).

   IRIS-OPERA (Undated) _ One hundred years ago Sunday, Pietro
Mascagni's opera ``Iris'' had its premiere at the Teatro Costanzi
in Rome, the same theater in which, eight years before, his first
and most famous opera, ``Cavalleria Rusticana,'' received 60
curtain calls at its premiere. But whereas ``Cavalleria'' ushered
in the era of verismo, which sought to dramatize the lives of
ordinary people, ``Iris'' came at the height of the ``japonisme''
that swept the arts in Europe in the second half of the 19th
century. The centennial of the work, which was last heard at the
Metropolitan Opera in 1931, will be celebrated on Monday evening
with a concert performance by Teatro Grattacielo at Alice Tully
Hall in New York City. By Paula Deitz. (Moved).

master calligrapher-painters. By Kay Larson. (Moved). &QL;

<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-TV (London) _ The words book and television tug against
each other in a fairly obvious way, but I still can't help smiling
at the sassy paradox implicit in the designation Book TV. That's
what C-Span 2 calls the round-the-clock weekend programming it
introduced in September, displacing reruns of the United States
Senate, the estimable show this cable network carries live on most
weekdays. By Will Joyner. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CANDID-CAMERA (Monterey, Calif.) _ ``Candid Camera'' _ at least
a collateral precursor of such varied fin de siecle phenomena as
``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ATM surveillance cameras,
nannycams, FBI sting operations, ``The Truman Show'' and Linda
Tripp _ remains an absolutely noncontroversial, even beloved
institution. And undoubtedly this is why CBS, struggling with the
other broadcast networks to attract a larger share of a shrinking
audience, has chosen to return to its roots and revive this
51-year-old franchise. By Andy Meisler. (Moved).

   ANTIQUES

<P>
   EXPLORATION-ART-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ For the legions who drive
sport utility vehicles to work on Wall Street, wear high-tech
mountain gear to suburban barbecues and keep Jon Krakauer's Everest
adventure story, ``Into Thin Air,'' on the best-seller list,
another spectator sport is catching on: collecting exploration art.
That rubric covers the paraphernalia used by the great explorers _
their oxygen cylinders, packing crates, rations cups, Holy Bibles
and climbing shoes _ as well as photographs, paintings, maps and
charts, many of which were drawn on the spot of previously
uncharted terrain. The genre spans nearly 500 years of exploration
from the early sea voyages of the 1400s to the Everest climbs of
the 1950s. By Christa Worthington. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   SAVINGS&AMP;LOANS-LAWSUITS (Undated) _ The most important civil
litigation being pursued right now by the Justice Department? Don't
be too quick to answer the Microsoft case. An argument can be made
for the cases pending at the US Court of Claims over the detritus
of the savings and loan bailout. The government could be forced to
pay as much as $50 billion if it loses cases brought by financiers
who purchased failed S&AMP;Ls and claimed that Washington altered the
terms of the deals after the fact. Fully 7 percent of the lawyers
in the Justice Department's civil division labor on these cases. By

   INVEST-DEFLATION (Undated) _ Most investors are quick to dismiss
the very notion of deflation, an economic environment defined by
widespread declines in the prices of goods and services. Accustomed
to the inflation of the last half-century or so, they expect ever
higher prices for their cars, their homes and _ perhaps most
importantly _ their stocks. They simply cannot imagine a world
where most items they buy behave the way computers do now, getting
cheaper year after year. But the truth is that a lot of smart
people are thinking about the possibility _ and not just the
Cassandras of the stock market who insist that a crash is coming.

   BIZ-MEGASHIPS (Undated) _ Megaships are taking over the world's
ocean freight traffic, but they don't yet have a port in the United
States that can handle them. One port on each coast will get the
billions of dollars in investment needed to accommodate these
thousand-foot-long behemoths and the huge flow of freight traffic
and jobs they will bring. On the west coast, Los Angeles-Long Beach
is already building the necessary facilities, but which port will
be chosen in the East? Five ports are competing _ New York,
Baltimore, Norfolk, Quonset, R.I. and Halifax, Nova Scotia _ but
three of the five will be cut from the list in the next week or two
by Maersk-Sealand, the huge shipping consortium that is the first

BMW has made top-to-bottom changes, including a new body and a
couple of updated engines, but it has left the car's character _
serious but fun, solid but spritely _ essentially intact. The

NEXT UP: SPACE SHUTTLE ENDEAVOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the successful launch of a Russian rocket carrying the
first element of the international space station, attention shifted
Friday to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida where the shuttle
Endeavour is on Launch Pad 39B, awaiting a Dec. 3 blastoff that
will mark the start of the five-year station assembly effort.
</P>
<P>
   In Endeavour's huge cargo bay is the second element of the $60
billion space station, a Boeing-built module called Unity, which
will serve as a connecting passageway for astronauts to various
parts of the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking forward to Endeavour's launch. There's a real
sense of excitement now that everything is under way,'' said Royce
Mitchell, Boeing's deputy space station project manager in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Chairman Phil Condit and other company executives are
expected to be at Kennedy Space Center for the pre-dawn launch,
which is scheduled for 12:59 a.m. (Seattle time) on Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is NASA's prime contractor for the space station and the
Seattle-based aerospace giant built all the key U.S. station
elements.
</P>
<P>
   Unity was transferred from the station processing facility at
the space center to Endeavour last week, Mitchell said. It will now
go through what's known as a flight readiness review before the
upcoming launch so engineers can make make sure all systems are
working properly.
</P>
<P>
   Unity was built by Boeing in Huntsville, Ala. Along with another
station hardware, Unity has been at the processing facility at the
space center for more than a year while engineers completed work on
the module and performed extensive testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The testing has gone extremely well,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   After Endeavour reaches orbit, astronauts over 11 days will make
three space walks, each lasting more than six hours, to connect
Unity with Zarya, the Russian-built module that was launched
Thursday night (Seattle time) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on the
steppes of the Asian country of Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
   It was from the Baikonur launch complex that Yuri Gagarin became
the first person to rocket into space. Russian now rents the site
from Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-foot Zarya, which was built by Russia under contract for
Boeing, was reported to be working flawlessly Friday. It is
designed to serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the
project, providing propulsion, power and communications.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the module into its
initial orbit 125 miles above Earth. Zarya, or Sunrise in Russian,
will fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with Endeavour.
Before then, it will have been boosted into an orbit about 250
miles up.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and U.S. officials will jointly control the Zarya from
Moscow and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The third element of the station, a Russian-built service
module, is now scheduled for launch in Russia next July. It has
been delayed several times because of funding problems in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The service module is designed as the first habitation for three
astronauts and cosmonauts who will live on the station, starting in
early 2000, until construction is finished in 2005. A crew of up to
seven scientists can live on the completed station.

SCHOOL CHIEF URGED TO IMPROVE TRACKING OF SPECIAL EDUCATION
PLACEMENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rl) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The federal Education Department's Office of Civil
Rights has challenged Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew to show evidence
that thousands of black and Hispanic students are being properly
placed in special education programs, saying that a federal
analysis shows evidence of discrimination that Crew has failed to
report or investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The department's order comes 18 months after Crew agreed to
federal monitoring of his efforts to reduce the number of children
consigned to special education classes in New York City public
schools. Federal officials had raised questions about
disproportionate referrals of black and Hispanic students into the
classes, which are supposed to accommodate children with learning
or behavioral problems, but usually end up as pathways to academic
failure. Once placed in special education classes, children seldom
return to regular classes or receive a diploma, even though the
vast majority have only minor impairments, not severe handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Crew this month, Steven Pereira, chief attorney
for the New York Office for Civil Rights, said that federal
analysts had found ``anomalies and omissions'' in data on special
education placements.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the analysis found that a third of the city's
school districts sent unusually high numbers of children who spoke
limited English into special education. In 11 of the 32 districts,
more than 20 percent of the students whose native language is not
English were in special education classes in the 1996-97 school
year. Citywide, the study said, the rate was 8.2 percent of
students with limited English and 4 percent for native English
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   In nine districts, the study found that black students were more
than twice as likely as white students to be referred to special
education. What is more, black students were three times as likely
as white students to be recommended for the most restrictive
special education classes, from which they were least likely to be
transferred back to the mainstream. Federal officials said that
even among districts with the same rates of poverty, there were
wide discrepancies in special education placements that appeared to
be based on race or ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Pereira's letter suggested that Crew and the Board of Education
had not been aggressive enough in tracking how individual schools
and school districts place children in special education. ``None of
these statistical anomalies were identified by the board as
problematic, triggering further inquiry,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. LaRock, a spokesman for Crew, said that the federal data
were not up to date and that Crew was sending more recent data to
the Office of Civil Rights that would show more progress in
reducing special education placements.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with the federal government, the Board of
Education must reduce the numbers of black and Hispanic students in
special education or lose federal aid _ about 10 percent of its $8
billion budget. The so-called memorandum of agreement, signed in
May 1997, came after a two-year investigation of special education
placements in New York City found that such programs had become
warehouses for minority children.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Pereira complained that Crew had provided little
evidence that he had carried out plans to improve training for
teachers, who often initiate placements for special education, and
to inform parents of alternatives. Although the board submitted a
description of training sessions to the Office of Civil Rights in
May, ``many of the topics of the training seem extraneous to the
goals'' of the federal agreement, Pereira said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, his letter said, the board had reported that all
32 school districts had been given training in the prevention of
teen-age suicide. But only one district was given training in
``inclusion,'' which means putting special education students in
regular classrooms, but giving them extra help.
</P>
<P>
   The federal report found that eight schools with extremely low
reading and math scores had transferred large numbers of students
into special education in 1996-97. The percentage of students moved
ranged from 29 percent at Hostos Academy in East Harlem to a low of
13 percent at Public School 111 in Brooklyn. Five of the eight
schools were on a state list of ``schools under registration
review,'' which are threatened with closing if they do not improve.
The scores of special education students on standardized tests are
not used to determine school rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Lucila Rodriguez, director of Hostos Academy, where 21 percent
of students were reading at grade level in 1996, declined comment
Friday on the federal report.
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of black students moved to special education in
1996-97 ranged from a low of 2 percent in District 5, which is in
Harlem, to 10 percent in District 21, in the Sheepshead Bay section
of Brooklyn. Citywide, 3.8 percent of white students and 5 percent
of black students were moved to special education that year.
</P>
<P>
   The share of students with limited English who were placed in
special education in 1996-97 ranged from a low of 2.6 percent in
Harlem to 22 percent in District 31, which comprises Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Coltoff, executive director of the Children's Aid Society,
which has been tracking special education for years, said that
although the numbers of black and Hispanic students in special
education were high, often these children did need extra support.
The problem, he said, was that they were not necessarily getting it
in special education.
</P>
<P>
   Coltoff said that Crew had begun to put supports in some
schools, including an extended school day and school year. ``If
these schools had more extensive mental health staff, guidance
staff and clinics,'' Coltoff said, ``a lot of those students would
not have to go to special education.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   William J. McCarthy, a New England labor leader who served a
term as national president of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters when the union was fighting federal racketeering charges,
died Nov. 19 at Symmes Hospital in Arlington, Va. He was 79 and
lived in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy was president of Local 25, New England's largest
Teamsters union, for 35 years before he lost a re-election bid to a
reform candidate in 1991. That year, the end of his four-year term
as national president, he had chosen not to run for the office in
the first election by the rank and file in the union's 90-year
history. Until then, the national presidents were chosen by a small
circle of insiders.
</P>
<P>
   The following year he also stepped down as head of Joint Council
10, which he had run for 20 years. The council is an umbrella group
of 40 unions with nearly 40,000 members throughout New England.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, who was named national president of the Teamsters in
1988, was the last Teamsters chief picked without a vote by the
membership. In 1989, under McCarthy's leadership, the Teamsters
agreed to federal oversight of their activities. In return, the
government agreed not to prosecute the Teamsters on federal
racketeering charges. McCarthy agreed to the settlement
reluctantly, he said at the time, contending that the union
deserved ``vindication and exoneration'' from the government's
corruption claims.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 the 1.6 million teamsters were enfranchised for a
federally supervised vote that brought many reformers to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate for president preferred by McCarthy lost to a
reform candidate, Ron Carey, who was expelled from the union this
year because of an illegal scheme to finance his re-election
campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy's 1984 bid for the second spot in the union's national
hierarchy failed amid accusations that he had sought the support of
mob allies in order to manipulate the appointment. The accusations
were made by Jackie Presser, McCarthy's predecessor as national
president and an informer for federal law officials.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy denied the accusations, and the case was closed.
</P>
<P>
   William McCarthy was born in Boston and became a teamster at age
17, driving a rig on the Boston-to-New York run. In 1946, after 10
years at the wheel, he became business agent for Local 25, based in
Boston, and its 7,000 members. He quickly rose through the ranks,
becoming president of the local in 1955 and a vice president of the
national union in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy is survived by his wife, Audrey; two daughters,
Rosemary Treacy and Anne Prendergast, both of Sudbury, Mass.; two
sons, Lawrence Pope of Sudbury and Thomas C. Pope of Marlborough,
Mass.; a brother, John, of Chelsea, Mass.; and 11 grandchildren.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal agents have cracked an international ring
that made hundreds of millions of dollars smuggling thousands of
Indians and other Asians into the United States over the last three
years, the government announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The smugglers filled orders from small businesses looking for
workers, the government said. The businesses or the immigrants'
families typically paid $20,000 or more for each of those smuggled,
who made ``long, grueling trips fraught with danger'' that often
took months, said Paul Coggins, U.S. attorney in Dallas, who is the
lead prosecutor in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the United States, some immigrants were kept as virtual
captives by employers or the smugglers until the debt was paid, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest alien smuggling organization ever
dismantled in United States history,'' Attorney General Janet Reno
said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   In three indictments unsealed in Dallas Friday, 31 people were
charged with bringing illegal aliens into the United States,
transporting them within the United States, conspiracy and money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one of those indicted, including two of the three men
identified as leaders of the ring, were seized in arrests that
began last Saturday and lasted through Thursday, in the Bahamas,
Puerto Rico and several cities across the United States. The rest
are at large.
</P>
<P>
   The ring brought about 300 people a month, and as many as 12,000
over three years, into the United States, said Doris Meissner,
commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Some of
those undocumented workers, almost all adult men, have been found
and are being held as witnesses, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the smuggling operation worked, the officials said:
</P>
<P>
   The ring leaders solicited orders from families in the United
States and employers who were prepared to pay for illegal aliens.
The people they helped bring to the United States were mostly
Indians, but some were from Pakistan, Syria or Afghanistan. In many
cases, they were provided false passports and other documents.
</P>
<P>
   From India, the people were taken to Moscow and then to Cuba.
From Cuba, the officials said, some workers were taken to the
Bahamas and then to Miami. Others were taken from Cuba to Ecuador
and then to Miami or across the Mexican border into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived by air, land and sea.
</P>
<P>
   The money raised from the smuggling enterprise was shipped from
the United States to India through Canada, Dubai and the United
Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   One of the secret houses where the immigrants were held was in
Miami. Another was in northern New Jersey. Most of the immigrants
ended up on the East Coast, but some have been identified in 38
states.
</P>
<P>
   One of the stash houses was located in New Jersey, and for a
period beginning last May, four members of the ring held 22 illegal
aliens there until a smuggling fee of $14,000 was paid for each,
according to a separate federal indictment that was unsealed in
Newark Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said the four set up the house and collected
smuggling fees of over $300,000. The indictment, announced by the
U.S. attorney for New Jersey, Faith Hochberg, charged them with
conspiracy and harboring illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment did not disclose the location of the stash house.
But it said some of the four suspects' illegal planning and acts
took place in Hudson County.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the four has been arrested. He was identified as
Pankaj Brahmbhatt, of Union City, N.J. The three at large were
identified as Manish Patel, Nilesh Mistry, and Amrish Patel, of
Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   The officials in Washington refused to say what kind of
businesses sought the immigrants. They said the investigation was
still under way and that they expected to arrest the owners of some
of these businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The businesses employing the smuggled immigrants were primarily
in the service industries, especially fast food, according to one
Immigration and Naturalization official who did not want to be
identified for fear of impeding the investigation. He said the
smuggling appears to have been arranged by fast food restaurant
owners and franchisees, rather than larger corporations. ``There is
no indication that any parent companies were aware of or involved
in that type of activity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Coggins described it, the investigation began about a year
ago when some of the smuggled immigrants were arrested in Dallas.
With ample highways and one of the nation's largest airports,
Dallas became a major transshipment point. ``All the same factors
that make Dallas a great city of legitimate trade make Dallas a
great city for illegitimate trade,'' he said. ``It's a lot like a
drug cartel, except they substituted people for drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the indictments would spin off hundreds of other
investigations into the businesses that employed the workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meissner estimated that the ring collected about $220
million over three years. The investigation, called Operation Seek
and Keep, lasted a year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operation Seek and Keep is an important landmark in the
administration's goal of protecting authorized workers in the
United States and putting unscrupulous employers out of business,''
she said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 300 illegal immigrants a month brought in by the
smuggling ring is a tiny fraction of the number that illegally
crosses the Mexican border into the United States every week.
</P>
<P>
   The ring involved three overlapping but competing cartels, the
officials said. They said that the head of one of these
organizations, Nick Diaz, who is also known as Nitin Shettie, was
arrested in the Bahamas last Saturday and was in custody in Miami.
He was said to be 30 years old and a resident of the Bahamas and
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Another man said to be a top leader, Navtej Pall Singh Sandhu,
was arrested in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Wednesday. He was said to
be 40 years old and a resident of London.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged leader of the third organization, Niranjan Maan
Singh, was said to be 58 years old and at large in India.
</P>
<P>
   Other arrests were made at LaGuardia Airport and on Staten
Island; in North Bergen, Somerset and Perth Amboy, N.J., and in
Florida, California, Texas and Pennsylvania.

ETHICS PANEL IS GUARDED ABOUT HYBRID OF COW CELLS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Struggling to respond to President Clinton's request for
immediate advice on the hybrid cow-human cell announced earlier
this month, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission has
delivered a guarded and somewhat tentative reply, based on the few
facts available to it.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the commission, Dr. Harold Shapiro, the
president of Princeton University, said in a letter to Clinton that
the news raised ``concerns about crossing species boundaries and
exercising excessive control over nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed use of the hybrid cells to grow human tissues for
transplant into a patient would or would not raise new ethical
issues, depending on the nature of the cells, Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   The cells are obtained by fusing a human skin or blood cell with
a cow egg whose own nucleus has been removed. The cow egg is
thought to make the nucleus of the human cell revert to the
embryonic state. The human nucleus then takes over control of the
cell, displacing most of the cow proteins with human proteins, and
the cell divides into a cluster of embryonic stem-like cells,
according to Dr. Michael West, president of Advanced Cell
Technology, who announced the technique earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   As embryonic stem cells have the potential to develop into any
tissue of the body, West's company hopes to grow whatever
replacement tissues a patient might need from his or her own cells.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro's letter pointed to the ambiguous nature of the cells
apparently created in the technique. If the embryonic cells that
result from the human cell-cow egg fusion are capable of developing
into a fetus when transferred to a uterus, then they raise the same
``important ethical concerns'' as any other research on human
embryos.
</P>
<P>
   But if the embryonic cells are not capable of developing into an
embryo, then ``we do not believe that totally new ethical issues
arise,'' Shapiro said. His letter implies that the only issue
raised in this case would be that of mingling human and animal
cells, noting that this is done routinely for certain medical
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of the embryonic cells to grow into an infant cannot
at present be determined. The original experiments were taken only
to a very preliminary stage, and no scientific tests were performed
on the cells that resulted.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said they would need more evidence to know if
human embryonic, stem-like cells had indeed been produced, as the
company asserted, although one expert, Dr. John Gearhart of Johns
Hopkins University, said when shown a photograph of the cells that
they could be embryonic stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   West said previously that his company had no intention of
transferring the embryonic cells created in this way to a person's
womb and that it would be wrong to do so. Shapiro said the
commission also held this view. Thus, it seems unlikely that the
potential of the cells to become a person will be tested directly.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the commission a week ago, Clinton said he was
``deeply troubled'' by news of the cow-human hybrid cells. In
interviews, several commission members expressed a somewhat lesser
level of alarm while saying they understood the reasons for the
president's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carol Greider, a biologist at Johns Hopkins, said that the
thought that someone might transfer to a uterus the embryonic cells
created by the hybrid technique was deeply troubling, but that she
had fewer problems with the company's stated purpose of making
transplantable tissues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some ethical issues there but they are much
less worrisome,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission plans in a later report to address a second issue
that Clinton raised, the ethical problems and medical benefits of
research on human embryonic stem cells derived from human tissue.
Earlier this month two groups of university scientists isolated
embryonic stem cells from embryos and from aborted fetuses, the
first time that these primordial cells had cultured in the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The company that sponsored the research, the Geron Corp. of
Menlo Park, Calif., also plans to use the cells to grow
transplantable tissues.

DAVIES LEADS TOUR CHAMPIONSHIP BY FOUR SHOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)  (rl) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ If Laura Davies continues to dominate the par-5
holes at the Pagenet LPGA Tour Championship, she will be difficult
to catch.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a five-under par 67, after an opening-round 66, Davies
surged to a four-stroke lead Friday after the second round at the
Desert Inn Golf Club. Davies was 11 under par for the tournament
(133), four strokes ahead of Tina Barrett and six ahead of Karrie
Webb.
</P>
<P>
   Davies, the longest hitter in women's golf, has overpowered the
Desert Inn's four par-5 holes. Through two days, she was a combined
11 under par on the par-5 holes, with three eagles and five
birdies, using those holes to gain an edge on the elite field
limited to the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour's top 30
money-winners this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The par-5's play right into my hands,'' said Davies, who
eagled the par-5, 471-yard No. 10 Friday, reaching the green with a
driver and a 6-iron, then making a 35-foot putt. ``Today, a 4-iron
was the longest I hit into any of the par-5's. I'm getting the ball
into good position, and I'm taking advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day with a two-stroke lead over Juli Inkster,
Davies was pushed by Barrett, who shot the best round Friday, a 66.
Playing four groups ahead of Davies, Barrett birdied four of the
first five holes, and when she birdied No. 12 by making a 12-foot
putt, she pulled into a tie with Davies at seven under par.
</P>
<P>
   But the eagle at No. 10 gave Davies a two-stroke lead, and she
was never caught again. Davies added an impressive birdie on the
par-5, 453-yard No. 15, a difficult green to reach in two shots
because it is protected by water in the front. But for Davies, it
was no problem. After a huge drive that traveled more than 280
yards, she hit a 9-iron shot 12 feet from the cup, then two-putted
for birdie. Davies ended the day on a high note by making a 30-foot
putt for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   For Davies, the par-5 holes have played more like par-4's,
leaving many of her competitors admiring her power.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she harnesses her talent, she is on a different planet,''
said Barrett, who will be paired with Davies in Saturday's final
twosome. ``I can't worry about what she's doing. A win here would
be huge, but there are still two more days to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it appears that Annika Sorenstam, who has already won
the money title, will also win the points race for player of the
year. Se Ri Pak, the only other golfer who can win player of the
year, shot herself out of the tournament Friday with a
five-over-par 77, leaving her five over par for the tournament
(149), 16 strokes behind Davies.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam, who shot a 71 Friday, is one over par for the
tournament. Sorenstam would have to finish fourth or worse and Pak
would have to win the tournament for Sorenstam to lose the player
of the year title.
</P>
<P>
   Davies has no chance to win player of the year, but for two days
she has been the best player in the Tour Championship's
season-ending field. Entering the tournament 24th on this year's
money list, Davies had hoped to use this weekend to make a
statement that she will be a force in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get back to playing well,'' she said, ``and maybe
this can be a start.''
</P>
<P>
   But will Davies, who has not won on the LPGA tour since March
1997, hold on to her lead?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to be ahead, but you can never relax,'' she said. ``I
was still nervous out there today. If you're not confident, you
could lose it. But I'm having fun. This is a lot better than trying
to make the cut.''

 &HT;    4 new witnesses called for exapanded impeachment inquiry
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With some congressional Republicans publicly
opposed to impeaching President Clinton, the House Judiciary
Committee is widening its investigation beyond the president's
sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Split along party lines, the committee issued subpoenas Friday
to four new witnesses in the impeachment inquiry while it prepared
to examine allegations that Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance
on a White House volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the panel is exploring allegations that Clinton
friends bought the silence of Clinton friend and former Justice
Department official Webster Hubbell. The panel may also look at
Clinton's involvement in campaign fund-raising abuses in the 1996
election.
</P>
<P>
   But some moderate Republicans said the drive to impeach Clinton,
which would likely command majority support in the bitterly divided
Judiciary panel, lacks sufficient Republican backing to prevail in
a vote of the entire House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we should spare the country all of that
turmoil, partisanship and rancor,'' Rep. John Porter (R-Ill.) said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), who has condemned the
president for lying about his affair with Lewinsky, said Clinton's
misdeeds do not rise to the level of removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Shays said he was one of ``conceivably 20''
Republicans who would vote against impeachment if it came to a vote
on the House floor. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said there are 15 to
40 Republicans who might not support impeachment, while Porter put
the number at 50.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hold 228 of the 435 seats in the current House,
meaning they can lose 10 votes and still produce a majority. Their
edge will shrink to six votes when the new Congress takes office in
January. Following independent counsel Kenneth Starr's testimony
Thursday, the committee issued subpoenas to presidential adviser
Bruce Lindsey; Robert Bennett, Clinton's lawyer in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case; Daniel Gecker, lawyer to former White House
volunteer Kathleen Willey; and Nathan Landow, a wealthy Maryland
Democratic donor and acquaintance of Willey, who says Clinton made
an unwanted sexual advance.
</P>
<P>
   Gecker is expected to deposed Monday, Landow on Tuesday. Bennett
and Lindsey are expected to appear after Thanksgiving.

NYC MUNICIPAL UNION OFFICIAL GUILTY OF EMBEZZLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The head of a municipal union local pleaded guilty to
embezzlement Friday in the first criminal charges in a corruption
investigation of District Council 37, the umbrella group of New
York City municipal workers.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Joseph DeCanio, president of a local representing
1,000 highway laborers, pleaded guilty to stealing more than
$50,000 as part of a broad kickback scheme in providing thousands
of Thanksgiving turkeys to union members. The charges were part of
a widening investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau into allegations of kickbacks, embezzlement, vote fraud
and falsification of records at District Council 37.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney, lawyers with knowledge of the
investigation say, is looking into kickbacks from caterers, law
firms and travel agencies, and officials' flying girlfriends and
other nonunion members to labor conventions at union expense. In
addition, they are looking into allegations that some union
officials embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars from the union
treasury through false invoices and false overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Several union officials said DeCanio's guilty plea to grand
larceny, principally involving kickbacks for providing 1,000
turkeys a year to a single union local, was the tip of the iceberg.
These union officials said that in recent years DeCanio, acting as
middleman, often provided more than 10,000 turkeys a year to union
locals at the district council, which represents 120,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   DeCanio also pleaded guilty to criminal solicitation,
acknowledging that earlier this month he gave blank ballots to the
candidate he favored in his union local's upcoming election so that
the candidate could fill in the ballots fraudulently to insure his
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers knowledgeable about the district attorney's
investigation said DeCanio had also told prosecutors that
widespread vote fraud was committed in 1996 to insure the
ratification of the District Council's current five-year contract.
The allegations were reported Friday in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   In his guilty plea before state Supreme Court Acting Justice
Micki Scherer, DeCanio admitted to stealing more than $50,000 over
four years by improperly inflating the invoice price for 1,000
turkeys he provided each year to Local 1251, which represents 1,784
clerical workers with the Board of Education. In a mumbling, nearly
inaudible voice, DeCanio told the judge that he split the embezzled
money with Bessie Jamison, the local's president.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Bills for the turkeys were inflated, and the local overpaid
for the turkeys,'' DeCanio said in a dark, quiet courtroom. ``I,
along with the other official, kept the overpayment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jamison did not return telephone calls made to her office,
and a receptionist who answered the phone referred inquiries to the
district council's public relations office. Officials there said
she was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference following DeCanio's guilty plea, Morgenthau
said he was continuing the investigation into the distribution of
turkeys, which have been a Thanksgiving tradition in District
Council 37 for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Several union officials said DeCanio provided thousands of
turkeys each year to at least five other locals, including one
representing school cafeteria aides and crossing guards, one
representing computer programmers and one representing truck
drivers. These officials said DeCanio sometimes charged $40 for
turkeys that retail for half that.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers knowledgeable about the investigation said Morgenthau
was investigating allegations that kickbacks occurred in the turkey
purchases by other locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stealing, under any circumstances, is a serious offense,''
Morgenthau said. ``But stealing from a union which represents city
workers is particularly offensive. Our municipal employees, who
work every day to make our city function, deserve better.''
</P>
<P>
   DeCanio, a 68-year-old Westbury resident, was released on his
own recognizance, with sentencing scheduled for May 5. According to
the terms of the plea bargain, DeCanio faces a minimum of two years
in prison and a maximum of 12. The plea also called on him to make
restitution in excess of $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau declined to say whether DeCanio was cooperating with
prosecutors, but other lawyers knowledgeable about the
investigation said he had already talked to Morgenthau's office.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guilty plea, DeCanio was required to resign the
presidency of the local he has headed since 1991. In addition, he
was forced to step down from his position on the council's
executive board, which paid him $24,000 a year in addition to his
city salary of close to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on DeCanio's guilty plea, Stanley Hill, the district
council's executive director, said, ``It is always deplorable when
a union official takes advantage of his position of trust and by
doing so casts aspersions on the whole union structure. But I would
assure members that this Council remains strong and effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Jane Tully said DeCanio inflated the
price of turkeys by about 20 cents a pound, often raising the price
to $1.10 a pound from the wholesale price of 90 cents. This meant
that he might embezzle $4,000 in providing 1,000 20-pound turkeys.
But other unions officials said that when he charged $40 for a
20-pound turkey, DeCanio walked off with far more than 20 cents a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau has already subpoenaed records from all 56 locals in
District Council 37. Lawyers knowledgeable about the investigation
say Morgenthau was examining allegations that a large clerical
workers local had paid rent for several years so its president,
Albert Diop, could use the penthouse apartment in the district
council building, just north of the World Trade Center. In
interviews, district council officials said that they often
telephoned Diop there or forward phone calls to him there.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill said in an interview that no one lived in the
penthouse, although he said people occasionally sleep there.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's guilty plea, DeCanio admitted his participation in a
scheme to rig the next election for the executive board of his
local, Local 376. According to Morgenthau, DeCanio, knowing that he
was under investigation and planning to retire from the presidency,
wanted to make sure that his successor would be an ally.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, Morgenthau said, DeCanio gained unauthorized access
to blank ballots for the next executive board election and gave the
ballots to one of the candidates so he could fill in the phony
ballots and substitute them for real ballots.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation continued, a police union official said the
allegations of vote fraud in the ratification of the District
Council 37 contract called into question the validity of an
arbitrator's ruling concerning the police contract.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release Friday, James Savage, first vice president of
the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said the union was
considering going to court to vacate the arbitrator's decision on
the ground that it was based on the District Council 37 contract,
which may have been ratified through fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The police union had refused to accept the two-year pay freeze
that was part of the district council's council, but the
arbitration panel ruled that the police had to follow the pattern
set by the council's contract.

RELIGION JOURNAL LEADERS OFFER ADVICE ON LIFE AT LARGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ohio)  (af) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When leaders of major religious organizations believe their
flocks to be facing a matter of overarching importance, they may
decide guidance is best given through a formal pastoral statement,
a nuanced and reflective document sent to all congregations under
their care.
</P>
<P>
   Such statements are not a simple matter, often involving months
of deliberation before they are released.
</P>
<P>
   At least two such messages were published this week, one by the
nation's Roman Catholic bishops, the other by the president of a
Protestant denomination. Each, in its own quite separate way,
addressed the question of how Christians should act in the larger
society.
</P>
<P>
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a document at
its semiannual meeting in Washington. News from the four-day
gathering was dominated by the bishops' statement that they should
try to persuade politicians to oppose abortion, and by the election
of Bishop Wilton Gregory of Bellevue, Ill., as the conference's
vice president, making him the first African-American prelate to
hold one of the organization's top two offices.
</P>
<P>
   But the bishops also voted unanimously to send out a
plain-spoken, ``pastoral reflection'' on the values Catholics ought
to bring to the workaday world. ``How do we connect worship on
Sunday to work on Monday?'' asks the document, ``Everyday
Christianity: To Hunger and Thirst for Justice,'' which says the
church's social mission is ultimately up to the people in the pews.
It will be sent to all 19,000 parishes in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With references to statements by Pope John Paul II and to some
of the bishops' pastoral letters of earlier years, the document
addresses Catholics as members of families, workers, managers and
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Of business owners and investors, it asks: ``Decisions about the
use of capital have moral implications: Are they creating and
preserving quality jobs at living wages? Are they building up
community through the goods and services they provide?''
</P>
<P>
   And to the faithful as consumers, it states: ``When we purchase
goods and services, we can choose to support companies that defend
human life, treat workers fairly, protect creation and respect
other basic moral values at home and abroad. We can also make
conscious efforts to consume less.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society urgently needs the everyday witness of Christians
who take the social demands of our faith seriously,'' the document
states in its conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, as the bishops approved their message, the United
Church of Christ finished mailing copies of a pastoral letter from
its president, the Rev. Paul Sherry, to the more than 6,000
congregations in the 1.4 million-member denomination, which has its
headquarters in Cleveland. Sherry's letter, ``Now, No
Condemnation,'' defends the rights of gay men and lesbians in the
church and in society.
</P>
<P>
   He began it, Sherry wrote, months ago as a response to
well-publicized statements by prominent politicians and religious
bodies condemning homosexual activity. The letter, he said, is ``to
remind all of us that the church is to be a place where all are
welcomed, where the gifts of all are recognized and received, and
where the rights of all are defended and promoted.''
</P>
<P>
   While many Protestant bodies have moved to prohibit or at least
discourage the ordination of openly gay men and lesbians as members
of the clergy, the United Church of Christ is unusual in leaving
the matter to its conferences, as its regional associations are
called. Some have ordained openly gay men and lesbians as
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   In a cover statement addressed to clergy members, Sherry wrote
that the murder of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student, in
Wyoming last month ``underscores the critical importance of this
reflection and the need for our voice to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry asked that the letter be read from the denomination's
pulpits.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that happens is up to each congregation, which are
autonomous under the church's system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an edict,'' said Barb Powell, a church spokeswoman.
``It's a letter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants people to talk about it,'' Ms. Powell said.

EDITORIAL: THE HIGH PRICE OF HAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 21:
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. John Rowland ran for re-election, he promised to make
the rejuvenation of Connecticut's cities a top priority for his
second administration. Now the state has learned that Rowland was
secretly negotiating to bring the New England Patriots to Hartford
as the centerpiece of his urban development. This week the governor
and the Patriots' owner, Robert Kraft, stunned both Massachusetts
and Connecticut by announcing a deal to move the football team into
a new $350 million, publicly financed stadium. This is a story in
which almost every position deserves to be regarded with both
sympathy and a degree of skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft agreed to move his team to Hartford after long and
drawn-out negotiations to keep the Patriots in the Boston area fell
through. It is impossible to feel much concern for Kraft, who was
prospering in Massachusetts. But as team owners go, he did not seem
to have been asking for very much to keep the team in its present
location in Foxboro. Massachusetts House Speaker Thomas Finneran,
who calls Kraft a ``whiney millionaire,'' vetoed a deal that would
have required the state to make about $70 million in infrastructure
improvements in order to keep a team that generates $10 million a
year in tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston area, which is booming, and which has three other
sports teams closer to residents' hearts, does not really need the
Patriots as a symbol of local solidarity and prestige. But Hartford
has been mired in severe problems for years, including a disastrous
school system, a half-deserted downtown and an image as a dangerous
place that suburban residents prefer to shun.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to accept the idea that a football team ought to be a
top priority for a city with so many needs. But the psychological
jolt of grabbing big-league status might help to ignite a rebirth
of the commercial district. The big question is whether Rowland is
right in believing that a football team that plays only 10 regular
and preseason games a year at home could be the catalyst that turns
Hartford's fortunes around.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium is supposed to be the center of a larger urban
development project along the Connecticut River, and Kraft has
agreed to build a hotel there, as well as make other gestures
toward encouraging downtown development. But in return, the state
is going to be responsible for the debt payment on $350 million in
bonds. Rowland says the money will come from a tax on stadium
revenues, but the estimate of how much money that tax will bring in
seems optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut state Legislature must meet before the end of
the year to approve the deal. Right now, most lawmakers seem caught
up in the euphoria of the moment. But that should not keep them
from making hard-headed decisions about whether a state that
already has a very high debt burden should be taking on this
additional responsibility. It was good to see Hartford's
politicians and business leaders looking optimistic for a change
this week. But a $350 million investment has to buy something more
than good feeling.

EDITORIAL: DANGEROUS DELAYS IN INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 21: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After 32 years of dictatorship under President Suharto,
Indonesians are understandably eager for free elections. President
B.J. Habibie must move faster in providing them and avoid the
Suharto-style repression he has flirted with in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie, who was Suharto's protege, took over when his mentor
was forced from power last May. He has made some limited steps
toward democracy. But instead of seeking legitimacy through early
elections, Habibie has stretched out what should have been a brief
transition.
</P>
<P>
   This month, students returned to the streets of Jakarta for the
largest demonstrations since the fall of Suharto. They were
protesting the slow pace of Habibie's transition timetable, his
anemic efforts to recover money stolen by the Suharto family and
the military's continued role in government. Unlike last May, the
protests were not joined by the middle class. But they did draw
support from the far more numerous, and desperate, urban poor.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces overreacted, killing several students. Habibie
seized on the violent crackdown as a pretext for interrogating
several opposition political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie is pushing ahead with plans that would defer selection
of the next president until the end of 1999. Even then, the choice
would not be made by Indonesia's voters but by a partially elected
assembly likely to include large numbers of military officers and
government appointees. It will lack the legitimacy to carry out
painful economic reforms or cope with popular protests.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Indonesia's Parliament will consider the army's
future role in politics. Habibie and his political allies want the
army to retain its hand in selecting presidents for 5 to 10 more
years. That kind of military influence has no place in a democratic
Indonesia. A quicker, cleaner transition to full civilian democracy
is needed, and Washington should not be shy about saying so.

 UNDATED: limited basis.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The agreement, which does not require the approval of Congress,
does not end all litigation against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   While the industry had settled several state cases earlier, no
court had ruled on the soundness of the claims. However, the
industry had feared the state lawsuits more than the private claims
because they had the power of government behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, a major class-action lawsuit filed against producers
on behalf of all smokers in Florida is unfolding in a Miami
courtroom. And Black, the industry analyst, said he expected that
other class-action lawyers who would have gotten their lawsuits
settled if Congress had passed last year's Senate bill would find
new ways to attack the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to come up with an ingenious way to wring money
out of these companies,'' Black said. ``They just bet on the wrong
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Although cigarette producers plan to sign the agreement on
Monday, the plan could face challenges. One anti-smoking group,
Action on Smoking and Health, said in a release Friday that it
would file briefs in 10 states asking courts to permit a 30-day
period for public review and comment on the accord. Ms. Gregoire
said she expected attorneys general in those states to question the
group's legal standing in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement was almost derailed at the last moment by
disputes over the involvement of Liggett &AMP; Myers in the plan, said
one lawyer briefed on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   That company, which was the first cigarette maker to acknowledge
a link between smoking and cancer, previously signed settlement
agreements with several states under which it divulged internal
documents and agreed to cooperate in lawsuits against its
competitors, but until late Thursday it had not signed the new
plan.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some state officials were concerned that if Liggett
&AMP; Myers was purchased by a major producer like R.J. Reynolds, then
that company might point to the fact that the smaller producer had
not signed the new deal to reduce its own obligations, said the
lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent result was a deal favorable to Liggett &AMP; Myers,
which, in agreeing to take part in the latest plan, was released
from the earlier agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gregoire, the Washington state official, said the company
would not have to contribute financially to the settlement unless
its sales rise 25 percent above current levels.
</P>
<P>
   That is unlikely to happen because the company on Friday sold
three of its cigarette brands, representing 14 percent of its
sales, to Philip Morris.

SIDES IN NBA LOCKOUT TALKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Please note reference in 6th graf to duration of talks)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took 23 days and countless episodes of the blame game, but
the NBA and its locked-out players finally got behind closed doors
Friday and talked to each other instead of about each other.
</P>
<P>
   The early signs were encouraging in that the sides continued to
talk well into the night and no furniture was seen to have been
broken. The last time the sides had similar talks of substance was
three days before Halloween. Since then, there have been
accusations and counteraccusations about who's doing what while the
NBA season hangs in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday, the league-imposed lockout is in its 143d day.
There have been 130 scheduled games canceled, and players have
already lost one paycheck and almost $300 million. With the season
in doubt _ teams already have lost 25 percent of the schedule _ the
full negotiating lineups for both sides met at the Sheraton in New
York to see if either side would budge or blink.
</P>
<P>
   The major difference was still how to divide the ample
basketball pie, which produces $2 billion a season. The league has
insisted on a 50-50 split as a way to slow salary growth. The
players want no less than they made last year _ 57 percent _ and
also want no limit on salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The league was represented by its legal team and seven of the
nine members of its ownership negotiating team. The only two
missing were Lakers owner Jerry Buss and Jazz owner Larry Miller.
The players had their leadership team on board, plus one new face:
Wizards guard Tim Legler, who had been quoted in the Washington
Post as being critical of the union's apparent tilt toward the
big-money guys at the expense of little guys (three years, $4
million) like himself.
</P>
<P>
   Legler backtracked from those remarks and showed his union
solidarity by joining comrades Patrick Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo,
Alonzo Mourning, Jim McIlvaine, and the rest of the union
leadership at the session. The talks got under way at around 10:30
a.m., with breaks on and off during the day. As of 9 p.m., there
still had been no break.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the fact that they were still talking, it was hard to
determine if progress was being made. No one came out during any of
the breaks to brief reporters, and the league decided not to hold a
conference call because of the late hour. However, the last time
there was a major negotiating session, it lasted 8 1/2 hours and
virtually no progress was made. Both sides were not optimistic at
the start of the day because each figured the other was disinclined
to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have any reason to think we'll make any
progress,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik told reporters
before the talks. ``We certainly want to, but I don't have my hopes
up right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Union head Billy Hunter arrived 15 minutes later and said, ``I
guess the issue is discussing the proposals that were on the table
and seeing whether or not there's any possible movement. As I've
said before, if they are inclined to move off their position, then
we are prepared to discuss whether we're ready to move.''
</P>
<P>
   The union says it has made all the concessions and wants the NBA
to reciprocate. The NBA says it will talk when the numbers are
realistic. Commissioner David Stern has made it clear that several
teams would do better not operating this season unless there are
drastic changes.
</P>
<P>
   Stern also has opened several publicity fronts, including
fingering agents of high-priced players as being out to sabotage
the deal and allowing teams to hold ``informational only'' chats
with players to explain the NBA position. Hunter responded by
sending both the NBA and the union proposal to all 28 teams so they
could examine both positions and calling players to keep them up to
date.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key start-up dates supposedly was Christmas. The
league's benefactor, NBC-TV, has a doubleheader scheduled for that
day featuring _ it hopes _ Michael Jordan. However, those games are
on the existing schedule, which might well have to be reconfigured
or abandoned. You can be sure, however, that if there are games on
Christmas, NBC will have its way and the Bulls will be playing.

TETSUYA FUJITA, 78, INVENTOR OF TORNADO SCALE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich.)  (rl) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tetsuya Fujita, a meteorologist who devised the standard scale
for rating the severity of tornadoes and discovered the role of
sudden violent down-bursts of air that sometimes cause airplanes to
crash, died on Thursday at his home in Chicago. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Ted the Tornado Man'' or ``Mr. Tornado,'' Fujita once
told an interviewer, ``anything that moves I am interested in.''
According to a colleague, he followed that interest to the last,
though he had been ill for two years and bedridden recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did research from his bed until the very end,'' said James
Partacz, a research meteorologist at the University of Chicago Wind
Research Laboratory, of which Fujita was the director.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Sumiko, Fujita devised the Fujita scale of
tornado wind speed and damage in 1951. It classifies tornadoes on a
hierarchy beginning with the designation F0, or ``light'' (with
winds of 40 to 72 mph), to F6, or ``inconceivable'' (with winds of
319 to 379 mph).
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, he collaborated in the development of a sensing
array, a rugged cylinder of instruments carried by tornado chasers
on the ground who would anchor the cylinder in the path of an
approaching tornado, then flee. The instrument package would record
pressure, temperature, electrical phenomena and wind.
</P>
<P>
   Less well known than his work with tornadoes was Fujita's
discovery of a type of wind called ``micro bursts,'' a small,
localized downdraft that spreads out on or near the ground to
produce 150-mph gusts that can knock airplanes out of the sky. The
discovery stemmed from his investigation of an Eastern Airlines
crash in 1975 at Kennedy International Airport in New York.

<P>
   The patterns of trees uprooted by tornadoes helped Fujita to
refine the theory of micro bursts, as did similar patterns he had
seen when he visited Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945, just
weeks after the atomic bombs were dropped there, to observe the
effects of shock waves on trees and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Fujita was born in Kitakyushu City, Japan, on Oct. 23, 1920. He
graduated from the Meiji College of Technology in 1943 with a
bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, became an assistant
professor there and earned a doctorate from Tokyo University in
1953.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, after observing a severe thunderstorm from a mountain
observatory in Japan, he wrote a report speculating on downdrafts
of air within the storm. He sent the report to Horace Byers,
chairman of the University of Chicago's meteorology department, who
ultimately invited Fujita to Chicago and became his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Fujita was fascinated by statistics _ any statistics. For years,
he charted the Dow Jones average and the Consumer Price Index from
the year of his birth, as well as his own blood pressure.
Colleagues said he also had a gift for insight into the workings of
the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``He often had ideas way before the rest of us could even
imagine them,'' said James Wilson, a senior scientist at the
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Although he built a machine that could create miniature
tornadoes in the laboratory, Fujita shunned computers. ``He used to
say that the computer doesn't understand these things,'' said Duane
Stiegler, a Chicago meteorologist who worked with Fujita until his
death.
</P>
<P>
   Fujita is survived by his wife and a son, Kazuya, a geology
professor at Michigan State University in East Lansing.

NO EASY OUT FOR ANYONE IN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>

(lb) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Kenneth Starr forcefully restated his case
against President Clinton on Thursday, he did nothing to resolve
the political dilemma facing the Republican-controlled House:
whether to defy public opinion and impeach Clinton for his efforts
to cover up his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   For those lawmakers who had clung to the hope that Starr might
yet provide them with a wider-ranging case against Clinton, his
testimony was a disappointment. Starr said there were no
impeachable offenses in the Whitewater land deal, the travel-office
firings, and the use of FBI files.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of Congress said Starr had simply reinforced
already existing opinions. ``I think no one's opinion was
influenced by the events of yesterday,'' said Rep. Richard Boucher,
a Virginia Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And so on Friday Rep. Lindsey Graham, a Republican member of the
committee walked before a bank of television cameras and delivered
a plea to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he knew that the country did not want Clinton
removed from office. He said he had decided Paula Jones' sexual
harassment case was irrelevant to impeachment. Yet, he said, ``I
believe with the bottom of my heart, unless the facts change, that
our president lied to a federal grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's something that can be said to change that fact
pattern even slightly, say it,'' the South Carolinian implored,
seeking a way not to vote for impeachment. ``Put up or shut up.
Please, God, do it soon. Because when this train leaves the
station, it will affect the course of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's dilemma was emblematic of the problem facing the whole
House. Most Democrats and some Republicans resist the idea that the
case deserves impeachment. The public has made its views known and
overnight polls showed no change. An impeachment vote could be an
agony for moderate Republicans in particular, torn between the
swing voters that can decide elections in their districts and the
party's hard-right core.
</P>
<P>
   But as Rep. Henry Hyde's end-of-year deadline looms, and his
Judiciary Committee prepares to depose four more witnesses, there
is still no one brokering a way out for those in Congress who hope
for some escape from the issue.
</P>
<P>
   With Speaker Newt Gingrich gone, it is now Rep. Robert
Livingston's role as the incoming speaker to decide how his party
wants to handle the issue. He met on Monday with Rep. Dick Gephardt
of Missouri, the House minority leader, and the two men agreed that
they would like to put the issue behind them before the next
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the question still is how.
</P>
<P>
   Many members believe it now seems almost inevitable that the
Judiciary Committee will send to the full House on a party-line
vote at least one article of impeachment on perjury, perhaps as
early as the week of Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   At that point House Republican leaders face hard decisions on
whether they want to impeach Clinton on a near party-line vote,
knowing the Senate will not convict him; whether they can even
muster the votes for impeachment, or whether to look for some
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   A number of House members favor some kind of censure short of
actual impeachment. ``I would not be comfortable voting for
articles of impeachment,'' said Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana, one
of the 31 Democrats who broke with his party in October to support
the Republicans' broad impeachment inquiry. ``But on the other hand
I would not be comfortable dropping the entire event as if nothing
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically such an option would have to have some Republican
backing to be viable. ``This is not going to end unless Livingston
steps in here and takes some kind of leadership role,'' said Laura
Nichols, Gephardt's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican close to
Livingston, says that with the Republican scramble for new leaders
now complete, ``the leadership will have some time to discuss
this.'' He describes Livingston as ``very anxious to start his
tenure as speaker with an agenda rather than a scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   What kind of resolution is worked out may well depend on vote
counting to see if impeachment could even prevail in the House.
Democratic strategists say they expect only a handful of the 31
Democrats who broke ranks to support the Republican impeachment
inquiry to vote for Clinton's actual impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   That means if 15 or so Republicans oppose impeachment, it could
be defeated. A question for Livingston is this: If a vote to
impeach the president would be defeated, would he want the vote to
go ahead?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The White House, which has been quietly sounding out a handful
of moderate Republicans about their mood, faces a decision as well.
Does Clinton agree to censure if he thinks it is possible that
articles of impeachment could be defeated?
</P>
<P>
   If the votes are there to impeach Clinton narrowly on a
party-line vote, other figures could intervene. Does Sen. Trent
Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, want the issue sent to
the Senate to dominate its opening weeks or months? Does the Senate
become the venue for a censure deal? And does anyone want to
consume the year with a Senate trial when it is known that the
Republicans lack the 67 votes to convict the president?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the House were to vote impeachment,'' said Rep. Jerrold
Nadler, D-N.Y., ``then you get six or seven months of torturing the
country with impeachment in the Senate.''

YEFIM GELLER, GRANDMASTER OF DARING ATTACKS, DIES AT 73 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yefim Geller, a Ukrainian-born grandmaster, whose penetrating
technical analysis, inspired innovations, and brilliant play helped
the former Soviet Union almost totally dominate international chess
for decades, died on Tuesday at a hospital near his home in Moscow.
He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of a long series of illnesses that
included prostate cancer and heart disease, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   For those with only a cursory knowledge of the ancient game of
chess, it may seem surprising that a man who never won a world
championship and whose most memorable public role was serving as
Boris Spassky's beleaguered second in his 1972 world championship
loss to Bobby Fischer, should be such a revered figure in chess
circles.
</P>
<P>
   That is at least partly because to its true believers chess is
more than a sport _ both an art and a science, if not an actual
religion _ and if Geller failed to achieve ultimate headline
success, he was a feared attacker and discovered many innovations
in venerable openings. His book, ``The Application of Chess
Theory,'' was reissued in paperback by Scribner's in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   During a career in which he won the Soviet championship twice
(1955 and 1979) and was a candidate to challenge the world champion
six times, Geller also established an enviable personal record: a
lifetime tournament edge over four world champions, Mikhail
Botvinnick, Tigran Petrosian and Vasily Smyslov.
</P>
<P>
   And in a satisfying personal triumph, Geller also has a winning
edge (five victories, three losses, two draws) over Bobby Fischer
himself.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Odessa who served in the army in World War II and
obtained a degree in economics from the University of Odessa,
Geller was a late bloomer as a chess player. Like many in a country
where chess is as popular as, say, basketball is in the United
States, he learned chess as a child but did not take it seriously
until college.
</P>
<P>
   His other passion was basketball; though he was a short, stocky
fellow built more along the lines of a wrestler he was a
sure-handed star on a powerful Odessa team. Nevertheless, in a
reflection of the Soviet Union's reverence for chess, his
basketball coach, a chess enthusiast, urged him to concentrate on
chess.
</P>
<P>
   The results of his new single-minded pursuit were immediate.
Making his major tournament debut in the 1949 Soviet championships
while still a candidate master, he led until a final round loss
dropped him to a tie for third, but his showing catapulted him into
the pampered top rank of Soviet players.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years Geller, who became an international
grandmaster in 1952, had a spacious house outside Moscow in
Peredelkino, the artists' and writers' colony, and was a familiar
figure at the elegant Central Chess Club in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Geller was known for his often brilliant,
sometimes reckless combinations and all-or-nothing slashing
attacks, a style that sometimes cost him victories in games that
came down to plodding positional battles that tried his patience.
</P>
<P>
   In time Geller learned to moderate his fervor for attack and
obtain more consistent results, but it is a continuing tribute to
his youthful daring that in winning his first Soviet championship
in 1955 he became the only Soviet champion who has ever won the
title while losing five games.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more bizarre episodes of his career, during the
1972 world championship in Iceland, it fell to Geller to issue a
statement suggesting that Fischer's supporters might be using
``electronic devices and a chemical substance'' to weaken Spassky's
playing ability. It is assumed that the statement was dictated by
the Moscow authorities to prepare the Soviet people for Spassky's
eventual loss.
</P>
<P>
   In a crucial game Spassky, playing a familiar Queen's Gambit
defense, failed to make an innovative move Geller had discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Spassky lost the game, but a year later, playing the same line
(against a weaker player, of course), Geller finally got a chance
to make the new move and won the game decisively. The innovation
was later hailed as one of the year's most brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Oxana, and a son, Alexander.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee sent
subpoenas Friday to four witnesses in the expanding impeachment
inquiry, setting up possible new conflicts with lawyers over
privilege claims even as panel members planned a firmer timetable
that could result in a full House vote on impeachment by
mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides also said the panel was tentatively scheduled
to vote on any articles of impeachment during the week of Dec. 7.
If the articles are approved, the panel could bring them to the
full House during the week of Dec. 14, although aides cautioned
that the schedule was subject to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real intense desire to get it done over the next few
weeks,'' said Rep. Christopher Cannon, R-Utah, a panel member, who
added that few, if any, additional witnesses would be called.
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers seek to wrap up the inquiry, Gregory Craig, the
White House's impeachment coordinator, has discussed how to resolve
the inquiry with a handful of House Republicans in recent days,
senior White House officials said. The White House is assessing the
likelihood of quashing an impeachment vote on the House floor, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee, after a party-line dispute in closed
session, said it would subpoena four witnesses, three of whom are
lawyers. The Republicans said they hoped those witnesses would shed
light on whether President Clinton or his associates tried to
influence the testimony of Kathleen Willey, a former White House
volunteer who claims the president groped her outside the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   The contentious issue of whether lawyers would be required to
waive lawyer-client privilege in testimony before a House committee
surfaced on Thursday as the Judiciary panel ended a draining
daylong hearing with Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   All 16 panel Democrats opposed summoning Ms. Willey's lawyer,
Daniel Gecker of Richmond, and Robert Bennett, Clinton's lawyer in
the Paula Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats objected when Republicans refused to honor the
lawyer-client privilege when the witnesses give sworn statements in
depositions beginning as early as next week.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows real contempt for lawyer-client privilege as a
matter of principle,'' Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a committee
member, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One subpoena was sent without objection to Bruce Lindsey, a
senior White House lawyer and longtime confidant of the president.
By a vote of 23-14, with two Democrats joining all 21 Republicans,
another subpoena was sent to Nathan Landow, a wealthy Maryland
developer and Democratic fund-raiser who has denied trying to
influence Ms. Willey's testimony in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican committee spokeswoman, Nicole Nason, said committee
investigators were scheduled to take sworn statements from Gecker
on Nov. 23, Landow on Nov. 24, Bennett on Dec. 3, and Lindsey on
Dec. 4. Ms. Nason said the committee might also hold hearings to
hear testimony from an expert on perjury, and from the Democratic
and Republican investigative counsels.
</P>
<P>
   Broadening the inquiry would allow the panel's Republican
majority to look beyond the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky
for a larger pattern of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats dismissed the latest batch of depositions as political
gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``These depositions are going nowhere,'' said Nadler. ``It's a
bone they're throwing to their right wing.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. John Conyers
Jr. of Michigan, objected to Republican efforts to delve into
Clinton's 1996 campaign finance practices.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, Conyers opposed a
request from Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the panel's chairman, for a
prosecutor's report to Reno recommending she name an independent
counsel to investigate Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and other
fund-raisers for their re-election campaign. Conyers called the
request ``an unjustified and unwelcome fishing expedition.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, traveling in Asia, said he had seen only snippets of
Starr's presentation Thursday, and was not concerned about the
subpoenas to Lindsey or Bennett. But he suggested he was surprised
by the subpoena to Bennett. ``As far as I know, there has never
been a case where a person's lawyer was asked to come and
testify,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans say they do not intend to ask questions of
Bennett that would violate his confidences with the president, or
ask Gecker about what he discussed with Ms. Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Republican committee aides say the lawyer-client privilege, a
fundamental right in American law, does not extend to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the historical position of the House that common-law
privilege, including attorney-client, does not apply to the
legislative branch,'' Ms. Nason said. She noted that the panel
called six lawyers during the Watergate inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   An expert in legal evidence and ethics, Stephen Gillers of New
York University's School of Law, agreed with the interpretation,
saying: ``The Republicans are right. Privilege is a creation of
statute, the Federal Rules of Evidence. It applies in judicial
proceedings only and does not apply by statute in hearings or
depositions.''
</P>
<P>
   If one of the lawyer-witnesses invoked privilege, Hyde would
decide whether to allow it or pursue contempt-of-Congress
sanctions. Sanctions would require a majority of the committee and
full House, Ms. Nason said. If the House was out of session, the
decision would rest with Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and Gecker did not return phone calls Friday. Landow
declined to testify before the grand jury in the Jones case, citing
his Fifth Amendment privilege. Congressional aides said they
expected him to do the same in this case.

IRAQ IS STILL BALKING ON ARMS INSPECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Story rewritten throughout, with additional details.)  (Eds: Double parentheses should be set as brackets.) 
(lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iraq threw up a new roadblock to the work of U.N. arms
inspectors Friday, less than a week after agreeing to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest twist in the dispute between the United Nations
and Iraq over the prohibited arms, Iraq balked at handing over
documents on chemical and biological weapons and missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British officials have warned that air strikes remain
an immediate option if the government of Saddam Hussein does not
honor its pledge last Saturday to renew cooperation with
inspectors. In Washington, P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the
National Security Council, said of Iraq, ``This response is not
sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   But the initial Western reaction was muted.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British forces are standing by within striking distance
of Iraq and could be sent into combat in hours, U.S. officials have
said. The forces include warships, dozens of F-14 and F-18 fighters
and more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, aviators and marines.
</P>
<P>
   Statements by Iraq indicate that it believes it can balk on
major issues pending a comprehensive review of its relations with
the United Nations. But that review, the Security Council decided
on Oct. 30, cannot take place until there is full cooperation with
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq appears to be defiant on several fronts, including in its
crucial biological-weapons program, potentially the most
immediately dangerous. With the right components _ and Iraq is
suspected of hiding a large quantity of them _ biological weapons
can be produced in days.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation, which has come sooner than expected, raises
questions about Saddam's understanding of the seriousness of the
threat he faces and the limited diplomatic help he can expect _ if
any _ from former supporters like Russia, China and France.
</P>
<P>
   Experts had assumed it would take the appearance of a
spot-inspection team to provoke Iraq. These teams are only
beginning to be assembled, however, as routine monitoring systems
are restored after a week-long break.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the renewed confrontation are Iraqi documents
that Richard Butler, the chief inspector, has said are critical to
a full accounting of what prohibited weapons Iraq possessed before
the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf. Without those records, it is all
but impossible to determine what arms remain or have not been
accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Among the disputed documents is at least one that President
Clinton confidently predicted on Sunday would be turned over, to
the surprise of some diplomats: an Iraqi air force account of what
kind of ammunition was loaded and used _ or destroyed _ in the
1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. inspectors say they believe that the missing document _
literally snatched away from inspectors who discovered it in July _
indicates that Iraq may have been left with more chemical and
biological munitions than it has declared when the war with Iran
ended.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Friday night to Butler, Iraq's deputy foreign
minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, said the request for the document had
overstepped the bounds. ``The request you made seems to be
provocative rather than professional,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter is interesting for several reasons. It emphasized
Iraq's hope that it can undercut Butler by portraying his requests
as out of line. But the Security Council has already rejected
demands that Butler be dismissed or that his commission be
reorganized. Moreover, the council ordered the Iraqis to turn over
the document several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the prominence of al-Qaisi reinforces rumors that he is to
be sent next month to represent Iraq at the United Nations,
replacing Nizar Hamdoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi move may also wipe out whatever sympathy Saddam may
have found with Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has seen his
February agreement with Saddam violated repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   In general, al-Qaisi argued, the documents Butler wanted either
do not exist or were already accounted for earlier. As a possible
concession, the Iraqis said the contested air force document might
be examined in the presence of the secretary-general's special
envoy, Prakash Shah. Diplomats dismissed this as another Iraqi ploy
to circumvent the special commission, which is known as UNSCOM, and
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Butler fired back in a letter to Peter Burleigh, the U.S.
representative at the United Nations and this month's Security
Council president, detailing the most recent exchanges with Iraq.
He had written to Iraq this week outlining what information he
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree with Chairman Butler's assessment that this response
((by Iraq)) is not sufficient,'' said Crowley, the spokesman for
the National Security Council. ``It is our understanding that
UNSCOM has responded to the Iraqi letter, seeking further
clarification. Iraq still needs to provide further disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler said Friday that Iraq ``declines to furnish the
commission with any information on its biological weapons
program,'' preferring to wait for a review. But that was never
likely.
</P>
<P>
   He also told Burleigh that Iraq appears to be denying access to
archives in the Ministry of Defense, the Military Industrialization
Corp. and other departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access by UNSCOM to the archives, to be provided, as I hope,
through cooperation by Iraq, would be the most effective and least
controversial way of the commission obtaining the necessary
evidence for the accounting of Iraq's prohibited weapons
programs,'' Butler wrote. ``It would avoid seeking out such
documents through intrusive inspection which, as council members
are aware, has sometimes been the source of tension and blockage.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has furthermore refused to answer questions about the
extent of its production of the nerve agent VX, which can kill
within hours, and about whether it has been loaded into warheads.
Questions on missiles and inexplicable quantities of missile fuel
are also being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is also apparently trying to conceal important diaries and
memoirs of Iraqi military officers with knowledge of the extent of
Iraqi weapons programs, calling them ``state secrets.''

AIDE QUITS AS STARR VOLUNTARILY APPEARS BEFORE HOUSE PANEL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sam Dash, ethics adviser to independent counsel
Kenneth Starr, quit in protest Friday, dampening any public
relations value Starr might have gleaned from defending his
presidential impeachment recommendations before the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Dash, who served a quarter-century ago as Senate Watergate
counsel, sent Starr a letter saying the independent counsel
``unlawfully intruded on the power of impeachment'' by voluntarily
appearing before the committee Thursday ``as an aggressive
advocate'' for impeaching President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he was saddened by Dash's departure, Starr said he
respected the adviser's position, then added, ``Reasonable minds
can differ.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Judiciary Committee voted early Friday to move
the impeachment inquiry beyond Clinton's effort to cover up his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Republicans
on the panel want to examine whether the president was involved in
alleged attempts to conceal his encounter with Kathleen Willey, who
accused him of groping her during a private meeting adjacent to the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to expand the inquiry was made behind closed doors
shortly after midnight Friday as the panel ended a daylong hearing
that began the public portion of only the third presidential
impeachment inquiry in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   While committee Republicans solidly back a broader impeachment
investigation, a Republican congressman predicted the movement is
losing ground in the full House. ``If I'm correct, the votes aren't
there,'' said Rep. John Edward Porter, an Illinois Republican who
estimated that 50 GOP House members would vote against impeachment.
Republicans hold a 228-206 margin in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Starr spent 11 hours before the panel
defending his 453-page report to Congress alleging perjury,
obstruction of justice, witness tampering and abuse of power by
Clinton when he tried to conceal his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr fended off angry accusations from Democrats who challenged
his methods while raising few objections about the findings of his
report.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the cacophony of the Democratic attacks, ethical questions
raised about Starr's testimony _ it was a point raised by Rep.
Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas _ went overlooked until Dash announced
his resignation early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee twice interrupted Starr's opening statement and
later objected to his appearing before the committee as a witness
while at the same time serving as an advocate for impeachment of
the president. She cited American Bar Association guidelines that
warn lawyers to avoid the role of advocate if there is the chance
of being called as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee, who suggested that Starr should consider resigning
as independent counsel, said Friday, ``It is inconceivable that Mr.
Starr can be considered a reliable and objective witness while
serving as an advocate and proponent for the impeachment of the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   As hoped by Republicans and his staff, who gave Starr a standing
ovation late Thursday, the prosecutor's appearance during the
nationally televised hearings seemed to bolster his battered public
image.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN-USA Today poll during Thursday's hearings found that 67
percent of the people said Starr did a good or excellent job of
presenting his impeachment report. At the same time, public
approval of the Republican-engineered impeachment inquiry jumped
from 31 percent to 41 percent in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   A poll by CBS News found Starr was viewed favorably by 26
percent of Americans after his testimony, up from 18 percent a week
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the surveys found Americans opposed to impeachment by
almost 2-to-1, a margin that has remained steady for several weeks.
Also, Clinton's job approval rating remained above 60 percent,
virtually unchanged in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The polls were conducted before Friday's announcement of Dash's
resignation, which Starr called ``a gentle disagreement'' over the
independent counsel's role.
</P>
<P>
   Dash, a registered Democrat, has been paid $400 an hour _ up to
$108,000 a year _ to advise Starr on a wide range of issues over
the past four years. In addition to reviewing evidence and helping
decide whether indictments should be sought, Dash also played a key
role in breaking a months-long stalemate between Starr's office and
Lewinsky's lawyers. He brought the two sides together and Lewinsky
eventually cooperated with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, whose victories before the House Judiciary Committee
have been few, jumped on Dash's departure as a sign their criticism
of Starr's methods had struck home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the final word from a giant of American jurisprudence
on the methods, motives and ethics of Ken Starr,'' said Jim Jordan,
a spokesman for House Judiciary Committee Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Dash's criticism of Ken Starr's appearance before the
House Judiciary Committee is right on target,'' said Rep. Marty
Meehan, D-Mass. ``Ken Starr's willingness to make a case for
impeachment just reinforces the concerns many of us have had about
his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, against the objections of committee Democrats, the
GOP-controlled panel voted to subpoena Willey's attorney, Daniel
Gecker, and Nathan Landow, a Democratic donor whom Willey said
encouraged her not to tell Paula Jones' lawyers about a White House
encounter with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also voted along party lines to subpoena Robert S.
Bennett, Clinton's private attorney in Jones' recently settled
sexual harassment lawsuit against the president. Clinton, traveling
in Asia, immediately took issue with the committee's effort to
question Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, there has never been a case where a person's
lawyer was asked to come and testify,'' Clinton told reporters as
he boarded Air Force One for a flight from Tokyo to Seoul, South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Also subpoenaed was Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey,
Clinton's longtime friend and confidant. When Republicans on the
Judiciary Committee proposed questioning Lindsey, none of the
Democrats objected.

   The door to the global bond market has opened a crack, and
Argentina and some Latin American companies are starting to slip
through. Their success in borrowing money in the last few weeks is
a sign that the financial crisis that seemed so severe in emerging
markets and elsewhere just two months ago is easing.
</P>
<P>
   This reservoir of needed cash had been all but closed to
borrowers from emerging markets ever since Russia effectively
defaulted on its debt in mid-August. With the heat of the world
financial crisis turned up to white hot, investors were suddenly
demanding a crippling 20 percent return for lending in these
economically troubled nations.
</P>
<P>
   Now the picture is changing. The Federal Reserve began to cut
interest rates, and the International Monetary Fund revamped its
rescue strategy, allowing the fund to offer assistance to a country
before its economy plunged into deep trouble. Last week, the IMF,
the United States and other countries agreed on a $42 billion plan
to stabilize the Brazilian economy. If Brazil's economy collapsed,
many economists have said, that would be sure to set off a far more
serious worldwide economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But investors, although willing to dip a toe in emerging markets
once more, are still cautious about plunging back in, reflecting
the sentiment the Federal Reserve expressed when it cut its
interest rate target this week for the third time in less than two
months. ``Although conditions in the financial markets have settled
down materially since mid-October, unusual strains remain,'' the
Fed statement said. So investors are snapping up only those issues
with special extras that make the risk more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors have money to put to work in this market, but they
still need bells and whistles to attract them,'' said Rachel Hines,
managing director for Latin American capital markets at J.P. Morgan
&AMP; Co., a lead manager on a $1 billion Argentine issue on Wednesday,
which really pushed the door ajar.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are expressing the same caution about the stock markets
in Latin America, Asia and elsewhere, which have done quite well
lately. The Morgan Stanley Capital International index of emerging
markets is up 28 percent since Sept. 10 in dollar terms. The
Mexican market has bounced back 40 percent, Argentina 66 percent,
and Hong Kong 54 percent. In Thailand, where the emerging markets
collapse began in July 1997, the stock market is up 79 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those rallies have meant profits for those who went in near the
bottom but only cut the huge losses for investors who did not get
out in time. The Morgan Stanley index had dropped 59 percent from
its high before the crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Kleiman, the head of Kleiman International Consultants in
Washington, said he thinks these are just traders' rallies and do
not represent the return of money that will stay for the long haul.
He is telling his clients to go in ``only very selectively and only
if they are prepared to go in and get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Pelosky Jr., the global emerging markets strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., is also cautious, but in the
``glass is half full'' vein. ``A two-week trip through Korea,
Thailand, India and Hong Kong,'' he wrote in a recent report,
``left me feeling that the big question is no longer survival, but
how long before economies bottom. As such, it's time to gradually
begin looking back at the region for opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The modest reopening of the bond market is probably even more
important to the health of Latin American and Asian markets than
the bounce of the stock markets. Countries and companies all across
the globe are starved for capital. And if they do not get it, then
a recovery will be all that much more difficult. It was this fear
of a shut-off of lending of all sorts _ and the potential economic
collapse that would follow _ that prompted the Federal Reserve to
begin cutting interest rates in September.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ President Clinton met with his South Korean
counterpart Kim Dae Jung on Saturday to discuss what Clinton called
''disturbing signs'' that North Korea may be trying to thaw out its
frozen nuclear weapons program and advance its missile capability.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has refused to allow U.S. inspectors access to a top
secret underground construction site. U.S. officials believe North
Korea might be planning to build a nuclear reactor there capable of
producing enriched plutonium -- the key raw material in nuclear
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is also suspected of building additional launch
sites for ballistic missiles capable of carrying a nuclear warhead
to nearby Japan, the Washington Post reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   These worries follow North Korea's provocative launch last
August of a test missile that flew over northern Japan -- and near
to a U.S. Air Force base there -- before landing in the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are quite concerned by some of the news reports we have
seen,'' Clinton said Friday in Tokyo, at the conclusion of a
two-day summit with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. ''There
are some disturbing signs there.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, U.S. intelligence officials have been monitoring
activity at an underground construction site at Kumchangni, 25
miles from a known nuclear site at Youngbyon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dispatched a 12-person team to the North Korean capital
of Pyongyang last Monday and Tuesday to discuss the matter with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The team left on Wednesday, after failing to win permission from
the North Koreans to inspect the suspected site.
</P>
<P>
   One reason: the North Koreans, desperately short of cash, fuel
and food, tried to get the Americans to pay Pyongyang compensation
for conducting the inspections. The U.S. team rejected that
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was some discussion of conditions which were completely
unacceptable for such inspections,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and North Korean officials tentatively agreed to meet in
early December, at a location to be decided, to discuss how to move
forward on the issue of inspections of the suspicious site.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to find a way to solve this,'' said Jack Pritchard,
director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, who
was part of the mission to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's alleged efforts to rekindle its nuclear program
and to expand its ballistic missile capability come on the heels of
other disconcerting activities in the secretive authoritarian
state.
</P>
<P>
   Just last spring, South Koreans discovered a North Korean
submarine trying to ferry special forces into this country, similar
to an incident that occurred in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's economy is crumbling, and it faces grave food and
fuel shortages.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials aren't certain whether Pyongyang is intentionally
rattling its sabers to try to provoke attention -- and aid -- from
the outside world, and the United States in particular, or whether
North Korea's communist government is becoming increasingly
desperate -- and perhaps dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one can be sure whether the North Korean position is simply
a product of economic difficulties . . . or whether they really are
moving toward a more hostile posture,'' Clinton said. ''We will
evaluate that very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has tapped former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry
to lead a reassessment of U.S. policy toward North Korea, in
response to a Congressional mandate.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   There are serious concerns.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea and South Korea remain tense neighbors, divided by
the last Cold War fault line, the demilitarized zone, or DMZ, along
which some one million combat-ready troops face each from opposite
sides of a border proscribed by barbed wire and tank traps.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which sided with South Korea during the
1950-1953 Korean War, still keeps 38,000 American troops in the
South, as defense against an attack from the North.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and North Korea were again on a war footing as
recently as 1994, over North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
   With a diplomatic assist from former President Jimmy Carter, the
Clinton administration brokered in 1994 a so-called Agreed
Framework accord with North Korea that effectively froze
Pyongyang's alleged nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the United States, South Korea and Japan have
promised to build North Korea a pair of light-water nuclear
reactors, which produce only miniscule levels of weapons-grade
reactive material.
</P>
<P>
   Engineering and site preparation work has begun on those
reactors -- expected to cost more than $4 billion, the bulk of
which is to be paid by South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The president will remain here until Monday before making a
quick trip to the U.S. possession of Guam and heading back to
Washington Monday night.

 UNDATED: in September.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The success of the Argentine bond issues holds broader
significance, said Desmond Lachman, head of emerging markets
economic research at the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup.
``This does pave the way for more countries to come back into the
market in the months ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The enhancements that have made these issues popular include
guarantees of principal and interest payments, opportunities for
the buyers to sell the bonds back to the issuer if prices fall and
warrants that give the buyer the right to buy another bond in the
future at a possibly advantageous price.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some corporate issuers are considering making their
bonds attractive by tying the payment of principal and interest to
future revenue. Some countries are also reopening bond issues, a
move that investors like because, by increasing the pool, it makes
it easier to trade those bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest new issue to date came on Wednesday, the day after
the Fed cut rates in the United States. Argentina sold $1 billion
of seven-year notes in a deal led by J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank.
The bonus for investors was a warrant that gives them the
opportunity to buy an existing 30-year Argentine bond at a price of
$93.30 for each $100 on Dec. 4, 1999. The 30-year bond was priced
at $85.50 on Wednesday but will rally if the global financial
crisis abates further. By Friday, the price had already jumped to
more than $88.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Hines of J.P. Morgan, the issue was
oversubscribed, with orders nearing $1.5 billion. The yield on the
bond was 11 percent, 626 basis points _ or hundredths of a
percentage point _ over the comparable seven-year U.S. Treasury
note.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other deals that have been done recently are a $200
million seven-year note by Banco Santander Chile that was insured
by MBIA-Ambac International, a joint venture of two firms that have
traditionally guaranteed municipal bond issues. The insurance gave
the note a triple-A credit rating. Its yield was 6.585 percent, 210
basis points over comparable Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   YPF SA, the Argentine oil company, sold $100 million in 30-year
bonds on Nov. 4. The added attraction is that investors can sell
the bond back to YPF after three years at face value.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Petroleos Mexicanos, the oil company also known as
Pemex, was the first Mexican company to come back to the market
since the Russian crisis. It sold $600 million of 10-year notes
that can also be returned to the company after three years for
their face value. And Pemex is considering a bond offer in which it
will pledge its future oil revenues to pay off the principal and
interest.
</P>
<P>
   In late October and in November, the Argentine government
reopened two existing bond issues to raise $250 million and $300
million.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Chang, manager of emerging markets research at Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co., said there had also been some new issues in German
marks. These were aimed at small groups of investors and could be
handled at a slightly lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   Before this spurt, the market was dead. According to Merrill
Lynch, only $125 million of new Latin American debt was sold in
September and just $250 million in October. Now, in November, new
issues already total more than $1.4 billion. With the deals already
in the pipeline, Ms. Chang is forecasting $3 billion for the month.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Latin America, Ms. Chang said there was no new activity
_ yet. But she said Asian borrowers could come back into this
market if they chose to.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are tiptoeing back into emerging markets now that the
huge premium that issuers had to pay at the height of the financial
crisis has begun to shrink. In September, this premium, or spread,
spiked as high as 17 percentage points over comparable U.S.
Treasury securities, making the long-term interest rate on
sovereign debt 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That spread is down to around 10 points, but remains well above
the 4.5 points it was from February into May and further above the
3.3-point low it hit just before the Asian crisis really began to
hit the West in October 1997. Ms. Chang of Merrill Lynch said that
Argentina, even with the enhancement it included in its newest
issue, was paying about two percentage points more in interest than
it was before.

 &HT;    Jockeying for No. 1 nears wire
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ College football begins in the heat of
August, but a team that aspires to greatness will be remembered
ultimately for what it does in the final, cool days of November.
</P>
<P>
   Never has it been truer than for the five teams still in hot
pursuit of a national championship this year. Today, all five of
them play games that could define their seasons. If they win, their
national-championship dreams stay alive for another week. If they
lose, their hopes, four months in the making, will come to a sudden
end.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 Florida (9-1) visits No. 5 Florida State (10-1) in a game
both teams need to keep even a glimmer of hope alive. The winner
will be ranked no worse than No. 4 in Sunday's new polls and will
be in position to get into the race if two of the three undefeated
teams _ Tennessee, Kansas State, UCLA _ stumble down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   It is the regular-season finale for both teams, while the three
teams ranked above them all have tough games scheduled for Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing would be important no matter what the records were,
because of the rivalry,'' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said.
``But now, whoever wins still has a chance to slip into the
(national championship) race. But because we both have one loss
already, the loser is done. We know that, and so does Florida. That
makes this pretty big.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Tennessee (9-0) is in a similar position today when it
hosts Kentucky (7-3). The Volunteers had an emotional comeback
victory over Arkansas last week to hold on to their No. 1 ranking.
They have to beat Kentucky today to clinch the SEC East. While Big
Orange fans are celebrating a potential trip to the Fiesta Bowl,
coach Phillip Fulmer must remind his players daily that there is
still much work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time of year, your guys are beat up, banged up and
pretty drained emotionally and physically,'' said Fulmer, whose
team is the defending SEC champion. ``There are still a lot of good
teams out there when you get to this point of the season, and I
think we are one of them. The great teams, however, are the ones
which are able play through the hurt and the fatigue and still find
a way to win. That is now the challenge to our guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming mental fatigue, in the form of a celebratory
hangover, is the challenge facing No. 2 Kansas State (10-0) when
the Wildcats travel to Missouri (7-3). Kansas State won the biggest
game in school history last week when it beat Nebraska for the
first time since 1968. An emotional letdown would be natural. But
to let down after reaching one goal, coach Bill Snyder said, would
be falling short of the ultimate goal _ a chance to play for the
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team has worked incredibly hard to put itself in this
position,'' Snyder said. ``Now we have to maintain our focus and
block out the distractions. This team is capable of being very
special. And they know that.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 UCLA (9-0), which has had a series of near-losses to
inferior teams, appears to be the most vunerable today, as the
Bruins host cross-town rival Southern California (7-3). The Bruins
have clinched the Rose Bowl, but a win keeps them alive for the
national championship game in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the teams are playing either for pride or to improve
their bowl chances:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Columbus, Ohio, No. 7 Ohio State (9-1) is out of the
national championship picture but still could go to the Rose Bowl
with a win over No. 11 Michigan (8-2). The Buckeyes would have to
win, and Wisconsin would have to knock off Penn State. If the
Wolverines win, they go.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Starkville, Miss., a win by No. 9 Arkansas (9-1) over
Mississippi State (6-3) clinches the SEC West and forces a rematch
with Tennessee in the Dec. 5 conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
   _ In South Bend, Ind., No. 10 Notre Dame (8-1) can stay alive in
the Bowl Championship Series if it beats disappointing LSU (4-5).
The teams met twice last season, with the Irish winning in Baton
Rouge and the Tigers getting revenge in the Independence Bowl. LSU
must win to keep its bowl chances alive.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Birmingham, Alabama (6-4) tries to close out a respectable
comeback season with a win over Auburn (3-7) at Legion Field.
Auburn interim coach Bill Oliver might be coaching his last game
for the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Clemson, S.C., Tommy West will be coaching his last game
for the Tigers (2-8) when they host South Carolina (1-9). The
status of South Carolina coach Brad Scott remains uncertain.

 &HT;    For Gators, life at Doak is no joke
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The late Bear Bryant was asked once how he
felt about playing in LSU's famed Tiger Stadium, which in those
days was known to visitors as ``Death Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends,'' Bryant growled, ``on what kind of team I'm
taking down there.''
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much the way Florida coach Steve Spurrier views
today's trip to Doak Campbell Stadium, where his No. 4 Gators will
meet Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 5 Seminoles have not lost at home in 39 games (38-0-1).
The last loss was to Miami 17-16 in the famous ``Wide Right'' game
of 1991. The tie was 31-31 with Florida in 1994 after the Gators
blew a huge second-half lead.
</P>
<P>
   That tie is the closest Spurrier has come to winning in
Tallahassee, where he is 0-3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Because Florida State is so tough at home and has the nation's
No. 1 defense, they are listed as a slight favorite today, despite
playing without injured quarterback Chris Weinke.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play good in their ball park and we play good in ours,''
said Spurrier, whose team upset No. 1 Florida State last year in
Gainesville. ``You just have to find ways to get the lead, and then
maybe the crowd is not as much of a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Spurrier will bring a couple of extra weapons with
him today: A few new ``ball plays'' and the Gators' all-white
uniforms, which they wore in the 38-7 pounding of Georgia on Oct.
31.
</P>
<P>
   But Spurrier is concerned about one thing. Instead of trash talk
this week, the Florida State players actually have been saying nice
things about him. One said he had a ``brilliant'' offensive mind.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the Seminoles are laying low.
</P>
<P>
   The picks:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mississippi (6-3) at No. 14 Georgia (7-2), 1 p.m. : The Rebels
had a week off after getting pounded by Arkansas. Georgia needs to
improve its Citrus Bowl chances. If the Bulldogs can't stop the run
they'll be in trouble, but they should get the job done at home.
Georgia 28, Ole Miss 21.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 21 Georgia Tech (7-2) at Wake Forest (3-7), 1 p.m.: With
its road win at Clemson last week, the Yellow Jackets have shown
they are a solid, well-coached team. Wake Forest has talent but has
underachieved. It won't be easy for the Jackets, who might be
looking ahead to Georgia. Georgia Tech 24, Wake Forest 20.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 4 Florida (9-1) at No. 5 Florida State (10-1), 3:30 p.m.,
ABC: On paper, Florida should have a big edge because the Gators
have a healthy No. 1 quarterback and the Seminoles don't. But FSU
does have the better defense and the better kicking game. A field
goal by Sebastian Janikowski does it. Florida State 17, Florida 16.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 11 Michigan (8-2) at Ohio State (9-1), noon, ABC: The
pressure is off Ohio State for a change. Coach John Cooper has been
low-key. Michigan is playing great football, but the Buckeyes
prevail at home. Ohio State 14, Michigan 10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kentucky (7-3) at No. 1 Tennessee (9-0), 3:30, CBS: Kentucky
quarterback Tim Couch couldn't sleep this week because he's so
excited about going against the Volunteers secondary, ripped last
Saturday by Arkansas. Problem is, the Volunteers' running game will
limit Couch's time on the field. Tennessee 31, Kentucky 21.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 2 Kansas State (10-0) at No. 19 Missouri (7-3), 3:30 p.m.:
K-State invested every ounce of physical and emotional energy into
last week's win over Nebraska. The Wildcats will not be ready to
play a good Missouri team on natural grass. This week's Upset
Special _ Missouri 27, Kansas State 24.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 9 Arkansas (8-1) at Mississippi State (6-3), 12:30 p.m.,
Jefferson-Pilot: Can Arkansas recover from last week's devastating
loss to Tennessee? We think so, because the Hogs desperately want a
rematch with the Vols in the SEC championship game. If they beat
the Bulldogs in Starkville, the Razorbacks win the SEC West and get
exactly that. Arkansas 17, Mississippi State 10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Southern California (7-3) at No. 3 UCLA (9-0), 3:30 p.m. :
UCLA finally plays a team that has a defense. The Bruins have been
living on the edge against bad teams for a month. Today, they play
a good team. Upset Special II: Southern Cal 31, UCLA 27.
</P>
<P>
   _ South Carolina (1-9) at Clemson (2-8), 6:30 p.m., ESPN2: This
is the worst combined record these two teams have had for this
game. Clemson coach Tommy West was fired Thursday and will have his
guys emotionally ready. The future is still uncertain for South
Carolina coach Brad Scott. Clemson's a better team and will give
West a proper send-off. Clemson 24, South Carolina 14.
</P>
<P>
   _ Auburn (3-7) vs. Alabama (6-4) at Birmingham, 7:30 p.m., ESPN:
Alabama has a chance to turn last year's 4-7 into a respectable
7-4. A painful season at Auburn will hurt a lot less in the
offseason with a win over the Crimson Tide. Alabama gets the edge
with running back Shaun Alexander. Alabama 20, Auburn 14.
</P>
<P>
   Others:
</P>
<P>
   ACC _ North Carolina 28, Duke 14; N.C. State 21, Maryland 10.
SEC _ Notre Dame 31, LSU 17. The rest _ No. 12 Tulane 42, Houston
21; No. 13 Wisconsin 24, Penn State 17; No. 15 Oregon 31, Oregon
State 24; No. 20 Air Force 42, Rice 21; No. 23 Virginia Tech 21,
Rutgers 17; No. 24 Syracuse 31, Temple 10; Harvard 21, Yale 20.

 &HT;    Peres optimistic about peace progress
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Renewed Arab terrorism and the slim
approval of the new peace accords in the Israeli parliament and
cabinet are but bumps in the path to peace, former Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the agreement's) great impact is to remove a very
large obstacle on the road to peace,'' Peres told a group of
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same message he delivered Friday night to nearly 1,000
people jammed into the sanctuary at Temple Emanu-El. Several
hundred people were turned away, including some angry members of
the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any other agreement, it contains a certain number of
compromises and a little bit of ambiguity,'' he said when asked if
he approved of everything in the so-called Wye River memorandum
negotiated last month by President Clinton between PLO chief Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Shimon stopped in Palm Beach to spend a half-day on friend S.
Daniel Abraham's boat. He returns to Israel today.
</P>
<P>
   He called Abraham a friend of peace. Abraham, the founder of the
Slim-Fast Foods Co., brought Vice President Al Gore and Clinton to
his home for separate fundraising events last month.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-year-old politician is cast in the role of elder
statesman since he was defeated by Netanyahu in the 1996 elections.
He was prime minister for a year after the assassination of Yitzhak
Rabin ibn 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Peres, Rabin and Arafat won the Nobel Peace Prize in for
negotiating the Oslo accords in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye River agreement prompted a sudden surge in terrorism.
``It could be expected. For peace, you need a majority. For
terrorism, you need a tiny minority and you have it,'' he said.

 &HT;    Hogs seek title shot today at Miss. State
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STARKVILLE, Miss. _ After having their hearts broken at
Tennessee last week, the Arkansas Razorbacks are seeking redemption
_ and a berth in next month's SEC Championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas (8-1, 5-1) needs only a win today over Mississippi
State (12:30 p.m., Jefferson Pilot-Channel 36) to earn a second
chance at a Tennessee team it led until the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   But if Mississippi State can knock off the Hogs and beat
Mississippi on Thanksgiving night, then the Bulldogs can punch
their ticket to Atlanta and double the pain for ninth-ranked
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks left little doubt after a 28-24 loss that they
are eager for a rematch with the Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we told the team as we were leaving Knoxville
is that if you take care of this week, then you can play them
again,'' Arkansas coach Houston Nutt said. ``This is too hard of a
league to be looking down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas will be without kicker Todd Latourette, who was
suspended for the Mississippi State game after he was arrested and
charged with driving while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State (6-3, 4-2) features running back James Johnson
and an even more physical offensive line than Tennessee, which blew
the Razorbacks off the line of scrimmage most of the second half.
Johnson established school records with 237 rushing yards and 312
all-purpose yards in a 26-14 victory over Alabama last week and is
the school's single-season rushing leader with 1,277 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas has knocked Mississippi State out of bowl or SEC title
game contention the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players are more focused because there's more at stake,''
Mississippi State offensive coordinator Lynn Amedee said. ``We
haven't handled (being in this position) well. We haven't learned
how to climb the mountain yet.

 &HT;    Friedgen striving to find a solution
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No. 21 Georgia Tech can claim a share of its first ACC
title since 1990 with a victory over Wake Forest today. The Yellow
Jackets also would like to discover an offensive rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
   During the season, Georgia Tech has gone from an explosive
offense to one that finds some big plays when needed, such as the
last-minute drive to save a 24-21 victory over Clemson. What was
clear against the Tigers was that, when receiver Dez White is off
his game, Georgia Tech is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets are 7-2 and lead the ACC in scoring offense
with 34.1 points per game, but offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen
admits his unit might have peaked early last month.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech accumulated more than 400 yards in three straight
games _ 489 yards against North Carolina, 465 yards against Duke
and 403 yards against North Carolina State. Since then, however,
the Yellow Jackets have become easier to defend.
</P>
<P>
   As a testament to his recent frustration, Friedgen called a
reverse pass for flanker Mike Sheridan late against Clemson. It
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make something happen,'' Friedgen said. ``I
probably got a little impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   What does bother Friedgen is the number of offensive penalties
and the lack of overall improvement in the running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The option has been working for us,'' Friedgen said. ``But if
we didn't have the option, we'd be struggling. ... We haven't
gotten a lot out of the flanker. David Powell was making plays; he
stopped. When Kelly Campbell gets in a game, he's playing like a
freshman. ... Someone other than Dez has to make plays for us.
We're kind of back where we were prior to the season.''
</P>
<P>
   A reason: injuries. Friedgen thought Jon Muyres was the team's
best receiver coming out of the spring, but a foot injury has kept
him out all season. Losing two tight ends to suspension for taking
Andro-6 didn't help. But the loss that might have hurt the most was
tailback-fullback Charles Wiley, who tore an anterior cruciate
ligament in the N.C. State game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's put more pressure on (fullback) Ed (Wilder),'' Friedgen
said. ``It's taken a little out of the wishbone. ... In the
beginning of the year when I could rest Ed, we could use him at
tight end, and (defenses) wouldn't know if we were in a two
tight-end (set) or one. It's easier to predict what we're doing by
formation.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential injuries also are a worry. ``We end up having a lot of
things (in the game plan) in case we have to go to them (because of
injuries),'' Friedgen said. ``We don't get good at what we've got
to get down.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, he said, might be to simplify the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked so much of the kids,'' Friedgen said. ``I just have
to be careful. A lot of stuff looks good on paper, and it doesn't
work on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The best sign of an offensive rebirth was Hamilton's play in the
Clemson game. After being by limited by injuries against Florida
State and Maryland, Hamilton mixed runs and accurate passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that concerned,'' he said. ``We've just got to get
back in sync, blocking, catching, doing the fundamentals, and we'll
be fine. ... We can do that again. We've just got to get it all
going.''

 &HT;    No whistling Dixie for UGA, Ole Miss
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia and Ole Miss play in different divisions
of the SEC, but they enter today's game at Sanford Stadium in
strikingly similar situations.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams appear headed toward bowl games in supposed
rebuilding years, although each could improve its holiday plans by
winning the last two regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's Jim Donnan and Mississippi's Tommy Tuberville are two
of the nation's hottest coaches, which is a reason why fans of both
schools will be holding their breaths over the next month.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberville, 44, seems to be the only SEC coach who has been
mentioned more in the rumor mill than Donnan, whose Bulldogs are
22-10 in his two-plus seasons in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberville, a former defensive coordinator at Miami (Fla.) and
Texas A&AMP;M, has been mentioned as a candidate at Clemson, Oklahoma
and, more recently, Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit distracting,'' Tuberville said earlier this
week. ``Last Saturday, it was Oklahoma. Sunday, it was Clemson.
Now, it's more Auburn.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan's ties to Oklahoma _ he was the Sooners offensive
coordinator under Barry Switzer for five seasons, 1985-89 _ have
been a distraction for Georgia. Donnan, 53, first surfaced as a
candidate there in September, when the Sooners started their
five-game swoon under third-year coach John Blake. Speculation came
to a head last week, when CBS Sports analyst Craig James reported
that Donnan would replace Blake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take (Donnan) for his word about what he's going to do in
the future,'' Georgia athletics director Vince Dooley said. ``That
he's happy where he is, this is where he wants to be and he's got a
good program going. He has said that on two or three different
occasions, and each time he's stronger in making the point, I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners enter today's final game against Texas Tech with a
4-6 record, assuring Blake's third losing season in a row. Oklahoma
had gone 30 years without a losing season before Blake's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's Board of Regents will meet Sunday afternoon to
discuss Blake's future. Dr. Donald B. Halverstadt, an Oklahoma City
physician and vice chairman of the Regents, disputed speculation
that Blake's dismissal is a forgone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Blake's fate has not been sealed,'' Halverstadt said
Friday. ``The Regents have all taken the position that they will
wait and hear the evaluation and recommendation of the athletics
director and president before even beginning to talk about a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where Craig James got his information, but he
certainly didn't get it from O.U. There's absolutely no credibility
to the rumors out there, including Mr. James'. There has been no
discussion, no name suggestion, no plan, nothing with respect to a
change. At this point, we have a head coach, so there's no vacancy
to talk about filling.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, including ABC Sports analyst Dean Blevins, a quarterback
at Oklahoma in the 1970s, say a decision on Blake already has been
reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing with John has been a closed, done deal for some
time,'' Blevins told the Tulsa (Okla.) World. ``The (national)
coaching community thinks it's a done deal with Jim Donnan.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Pepperell High punter/kicker Jonathan Kilgo, one of the South's
top specialists, has committed to Georgia. Kilgo averaged 41.7
yards per punt, hit all 49 of his regular-season extra-point
attempts and connected on four of nine field goals, with a long of
50 yards. Georgia's punter, freshman walk-on Wynn Kopp of Athens'
Clarke Central High, is averaging only 34.8 yards on 32 punts this
season.

 &HT;    Early bird beats players to `Dirty Birds' trademark
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A man who has been hanging a ``Dirty Birds'' banner in
the lower southwest corner of the Georgia Dome for three seasons
beat two Falcons players in filing for trademark protection for the
phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Weiss, a 12-year season-ticket holder who manages Nicky's
Seafood, which is near the Dome, applied for the trademark through
his lawyer before right guard Gene Williams and deep snapper Adam
Schreiber.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are trying to capitalize on the sudden popularity of
the ``Dirty Bird'' dance created by running back Jamal Anderson and
tight end O.J. Santiago and performed by Falcons players following
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody can be happy,'' said Weiss, 30. ``I'm just
one of the little people. I'm not out for blood. I don't see any
reason we can't all get along.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Williams and Schreiber said they have no problem with
Weiss, whose attorney, Barry Kaplan, filed for his trademark
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``More power to this guy,'' Williams said. ``He can do his
thing, and we can do ours. First and foremost, our main concern is
winning football games and getting to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Weiss has been hanging a black, white and red banner
that reads ``DirtyBird Zone.'' He has also sold T-shirts and
sweatshirts with the same slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had much luck, since the team hasn't been good,'' he
said. ''Hey, I admit that if it weren't for the team winning, and
players scoring touchdowns and doing the dance and everything, my
shirts wouldn't sell.''
</P>
<P>
   The shirts being sold by Williams and Schreiber feature the
phrase on the front and such slogans as ``Life's short, play
Dirty'' on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber said, ''This was something we did for the players
first, and then we decided maybe the public would be interested.
It's just for fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Schreiber say they will have a web site _
dirtybirdsinc.com _ soon, and Weiss has a voice-mail message at a
telephone number _ 404-237-4433 _ where fans can order shirts.

 &HT;    `You can look ahead, but only one at a time'
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Jerry Rice had 10 receptions for 169 yards and a
touchdown. Gaudy numbers. However, when he was matched up against
the Falcons' Ray Buchanan, Rice was cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Iin the 31-19 victory over San Francisco, Buchanan played the
kind of game expected of him when the Falcons signed him as a free
agent on March 3, 1997. Not only did he shadow the incomparable
Rice, but his interception and exciting return to the 1-yard line
helped turn the game.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Buchanan's job is less daunting, but just as important.
Against the woeful Chicago Bears, the trick is to somehow muster
the emotion that propelled him and the team Sunday against the
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan addressed that issue and more during a conversation
with the AJC.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the week like, with the euphoria surrounding the
team reaching heights no one really expected?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's been really a lot of fun, more than anything else. I've
been in this situation before, and it's something that's really
good for the fans. As players, we've enjoyed it, too. But we still
have to maintain perspective, let it go and get on with business.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Niners win signaled to everyone that the Falcons have
turned the corner. When did you know this team could make the
transition?
</P>
<P>
   A: I knew it would happen when I got here, but I didn't know it
would happen this fast. But we'll take it. The key, though, is to
not get so happy with beating the 49ers that we think we've
arrived. Part of arriving is beating the teams you're supposed to
beat, and that's our thing now. We can't let up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So how do you muster the same emotion you had Sunday when
you're playing a struggling team like Chicago?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sometimes it's tough. But they are a team you have to watch
out for. We have to treat them like they are the 49ers. We have to
take advantage of them and their problems. It's not a time to try
to pad your stats, but it's a time when you continue to be
aggressive and make plays. And if you come with the same
motivation, you can do some big things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Bears' top receiver is Curtis Conway. He's hardly Jerry
Rice, but you can't sleep on him, either. How good is Conway?
</P>
<P>
   A: He's a good receiver, no doubt. He can take advantage of you
if you let him. But he'll only be as good as I let him. If I let
him run the field, then he can make some plays. But I don't plan on
doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your schedule is so favorable in the final six games. How can
you resist temptation to not look ahead?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, it's easy to stay focused. You can look ahead, but
only one at a time. You think of the playoffs and the home-field
advantage. All that's good _ if we play the way we're supposed to.

 &HT;    Santiago working out well for Falcons
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Perhaps no draft choice made since Dan Reeves took
over as coach has worked out better than tight end O.J. Santiago,
who was the team's third-round choice in the 1997 draft.
</P>
<P>
   After going the entire preseason and the first regular season
game without a reception, Santiago, a 6-foot-7, 267-pounder from
Kent University has caught 17 passes for 254 yards, and three
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   That reception total matches his production from his rookie
season, when he broke his leg in the 11th game, and Santiago has
become more important in the offense in the last month, as has FB
Bob Christian.
</P>
<P>
   As Falcons WRs Tony Martin and Terance Mathis have drawn
occasional double coverage and the team has not gotten much
production from WRs other than starters (just seven catches by
other wide WRs), the tight end has become very important.
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves took over the team, there were no TEs on the roster,
as the Falcons' old run-and-shoot offense didn't use them.
</P>
<P>
   The team signed TE Brian Kozlowski, who played for Reeves when
he coached the New York Giants, but did not pursue any free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had no tight ends,'' Reeves said. ''And (instead of going
after a free agent) we gambled a little because there were a lot of
tight ends available in the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those tight ends was USC's John Allred (6-4, 249), whom
the Bears chose in the second round. Fans may or may not see him
Sunday, whe the Falcons (8-2) play the Bears (3-7).
</P>
<P>
   Allred, started four games last year, and played in 15, catching
a modest eight passes for 70 yards. But this season, Allred has
played in just three games, has been inactive in four, and has not
caught a pass as Ryan Wetnight and rookie Alonzo Mayes have handled
the duties.
</P>
<P>
   Early inactives
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons on Friday de-activated WR/RB/KR Tim Dwight, making
this the fourth straight game he's missed since straining the
medial collateral ligament in his knee in the Oct. 25 game against
the Jets. Dwight returned to practice this week, but Reeves wants
to give Dwight another week to rehabilitate and rest his leg. WR
Ron Harris will return punts. . . . G/C Dave Widell was
de-activated for the ninth straight game. . . . DT Esera Tuaolo
also was placed on the early inactive list, meaning first-year
player Shawn Swayda, who was cut by the Bears last year after being
drafted in the sixth round, will dress for the second straight
game. Swayda has improved in practice. . . . LB Ben Talley was the
fourth player de-activated.
</P>
<P>
   Who is that guy?
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco 49ers general manager Dwight Clark was asked what
he knew about Falcon RB Jamal Anderson, who rushed 31 times for 100
yards and two TDs against the 49ers last Sunday in Atlanta's 31-19
win. Anderson also had 123 yards in a 31-20 loss at San Francisco
on Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know anything about him until he started running over
our players the other day,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who did not practice Friday, is still likely to play.
He said this ankle sprain is not as serious as the one he played
through last season.
</P>
<P>
   We meet again
</P>
<P>
   Christian, who played for the Bears from 1992-94 after playing
collegiately at Northwestern, said he figures Chicago is ''licking
their chops'' looking forward to this game.
</P>
<P>
   ''They probably look at it as a good time to get us, with us
coming off an emotional game last week,'' he said. ''They probably
think we'll be low emotionally this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Homecoming
</P>
<P>
   The Bears have five native Georgians on their team, including
cornerbacks Tom Carter and Walt Harris, who both are from LaGrange,
rookie deep snapper and backup T Patrick Mannelly, who played at
Marist, reserve WR Marcus Robinson, who played at Peach County
High, and DE Mark Thomas, a Lilburn native. . . . Falcon trainer
Ron Medlin's brother, Tony, is the Bears equipment manager. . . .
This will be the first time Chicago has played in the Georgia Dome.
The last time the Bears played in Atlanta was 1986, a 13-10 victory
in Atlanta Fulton County Stadium.

 &HT;    Tour peers pick O'Meara for top award
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Majors mattered most Friday at the PGA Tour awards
luncheon in St. Augustine, Fla., as Mark O'Meara was named PGA Tour
Player of the Year after taking the Masters and British Open in
1998, outpolling David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   The award capped a dream season for the 41-year-old O'Meara, who
became the first player since Nick Price in 1994 to capture two
majors in a season.
</P>
<P>
   With four wins and a runner-up finish to O'Meara at the Masters,
Duval, 27, won the PGA Tour money title with a record $2,591,031
and the Vardon Trophy for scoring average (69.13).
</P>
<P>
   Hale Irwin, with seven wins and over $2.8 million in earnings,
won a second consecutive Senior PGA Tour Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Marietta's Joe Inman won the Senior PGA Tour's Rookie of the
Year award after earning $653,902 and a win in the Pacific Bell
Senior Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed I'd ever have a second chance to play golf for
a living,'' said Inman, 50, of Atlanta Country Club. ``A year ago,
I was out of a job and wondering what I was going to do, and now
here I am standing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Colbert, who battled back from prostate cancer this year to
win the TransAmerica last month, was chosen the Senior Tour's
comeback. Scott Verplank received the PGA Tour's comeback award,
recovering from assorted injuries to finish 18th on the money list
with $1,223,436.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Stewart Cink, the 1997 PGA Tour Rookie of the Year,
presented the 1998 rookie award to Steve Flesch, who finished 35th
on the money list with $777,186. Bob Burns won the Nike Tour player
of the year award.
</P>
<P>
   Former Masters chairman Jack Stephens, who gave $5 million to
the PGA Tour's First Tee program, won the Card Walker Award for his
contributions to the advancement of junior golf. Sam Snead received
the PGA Tour's Lifetime Achievement award.
</P>
<P>
   Some other bests from 1998:
</P>
<P>
   _ Best putt: O'Meara's 20-footer to win the Masters on the 72nd
hole.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best shot: (tie) Hal Sutton's playoff 4-wood to six feet at 18
to win the Tour Championship at East Lake; Tiger Woods' third-round
fairway bunker shot at Doral _ 148 yards with a 7-iron _ to six
inches at the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   _ Worst investment: Golf stocks. Golden Bear and Lynx went belly
up. Callaway lost a third of its value. Nick Faldo's 900,000 shares
of Adams Golf stock went from $16 million to $4 million in a matter
of months.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best investment: The 2,356,002 range balls that Vijay Singh
struck to earn a PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best tournament of the year that wasn't a major: The Tour
Championship at Atlanta's East Lake Golf Club. It went so smoothly
it was scary.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best PR move: Tiger Woods dumping agent Hughes Norton.
</P>
<P>
   _ Worst PR move: Tiger Woods' decision not to defend at the
BellSouth Classic.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most popular win: Billy Andrade's victory in the Bell Canadian
Open _ his first in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   _ LPGA Tour Player of the Year: Se Ri Pak. Two majors. A major
difference in the Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Visibility award: LaGrange's Allen Doyle, the only player in
golf in 1998 to play the PGA Tour, Senior PGA Tour and Nike Tour.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best evidence that Matt Kuchar made the right decision: Justin
Rose.

 &HT;    Braves appear to lead in Jordan chase
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Brian Jordan Road Show closed down Friday in
Baltimore amid a growing suspicion around both leagues that the
former St. Louis outfielder will sign with the Braves next week.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan declared ``no team has an advantage'' after touring
Camden Yards, maintaining that the Braves, Orioles and New York
Yankees are his finalists. But the Yankees' renewed interests in
re-signing Bernie Williams and acquiring Albert Belle converted
Jordan from a candidate to a second or third alternative even as he
visited New York this week.
</P>
<P>
   And while Jordan was born in the Baltimore area and the Orioles
might be willing to go as high as $8million per year in a four- or
five-year contract, the Braves are in position to match deals and
can offer him a far greater chance to win a world championship than
Baltimore. That Jordan, his wife, Pam, and two children would not
have to relocate from their Atlanta home if he signs with the
Braves is also a significant plus.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Yankees nor New York Mets offered Jordan a contract
during meetings this week. While the finances have progressed from
the four-year, $30-million offer the Orioles reportedly floated
last week, Jim Turner, Jordan's agent, made it clear while in New
York that ``the Braves' interest is, I would say, extremely
sincere.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves general manager John Schuerholz will not confirm that the
Braves have made their first formal offer, but whatever happens
next will happen fast. Jordan and the Braves are intent on closing
a deal before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a need, it's a mutual desire,'' Schuerholz said.
``We've got to do our business and he's got to do his. We have to
build our team and he has to make decisions about his life.
Decisions made more quickly are better for both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   On the back burner
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz also spoke with free-agent center fielder Steve
Finley and his agent Tommy Tanzer by telephone Friday, formally
opening the possibility the Braves could have two new outfielders
before they are done this winter. Finley is in no hurry, has had
preliminary contact with nine teams and is scheduled to visit the
Arizona Diamondbacks Monday. It is still widely expected he will
wind up back in San Diego, where he has a strong relationship with
Padres owner John Moores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was making a connection _ just talking to the player and
his agent and making a connection,'' Schuerholz said. ``That's the
best way for me to characterize it. I know he expressed he was very
interested in our organization and told his agent so. Hence the
conversation today. We'll see where it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley is seeking a four-year deal with a starting price of
$14million.
</P>
<P>
   A hint of spring
</P>
<P>
   The Braves released their 1999 spring schedule, a 32-game list
that includes two meetings with the World Series champion Yankees,
another pair of April games in Turner Field with Baltimore and
Cleveland and an exhibition opener against Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The club also set reporting dates, with pitchers and catchers
scheduled in camp Feb. 17 to begin workouts the 18th. The rest of
the club reports Feb. 22 with the first full-squad workout Feb. 23.
Those dates are five days later than last spring, since Opening Day
falls on April 5, five days later than the 1998 season.40-man
adjustment
</P>
<P>
   The offseason 40-man roster the Braves just filed with the
National League _ the filing deadline was midnight Thursday _
included a pair of deletions. Left-hander reliever Adam Butler, who
appeared in eight games last season, was outrighted to Class AAA
Richmond while right-hander Dwayne Jacobs, 5-10 in Class A Danville
last season and 12-27 overall in four seasons with the
organization, was claimed by the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Added to the 40-man were Luis Rivera, a hard-throwing
right-handed prospect who was 5-5 in Class A Macon last season with
118 strikeouts in 92 2/3 innings, and right-hander Ismael Villegas,
who was 7-6 with three saves in Class AA Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Around the majors
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Marlins acquired catcher Jorge Fabregas from the New
York Mets for right-handed reliever Oscar Henriquez and cash.

ANALYSIS: CLINTON STILL NOT EXONERATED ON NON-LEWINSKY MATTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(SUBS 4th graf for smoothing)  (bl)  
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Both Kenneth Starr and the White House agreed
Friday that the independent counsel had ``exonerated'' Clinton on
several matters that Starr had long been investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Exoneration is not, of course, the same as an ethical gold star,
as one legal expert put it, and the exact facts in each of the
matters are different. The White House complained that Starr was
tardy in disclosing that he had found no wrongdoing on these other
matters and sought to define exoneration broadly, as covering
everything except the Monica Lewinsky saga.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's testimony to the House Judiciary Committee did not go
quite that far.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel said that he found no evidence
implicating Clinton in the dismissal of White House travel office
employees and the improper gathering of confidential FBI files of
government officials in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   On Whitewater, where it all started, Starr's testimony fell well
short of clearing the president of wrongdoing. Starr said that he
had prepared a draft impeachment referral on Whitewater late last
year, but had decided not to forward it to the Congress because he
was unsure whether the credibility of the witnesses against Clinton
was sufficient to make a strong case.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor's failure to bring charges is not the same thing as
granting a public official a clean bill of ethical health, lawyers
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a distinction between not being charged and being
exonerated,'' said Irvin Nathan, a Washington criminal defense
lawyer who served in the Clinton Justice Department. ``A prosecutor
doesn't give out gold medals for good conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the investigations of the travel office and FBI file
matters, colloquially known as Travelgate and Filegate, closed.
Starr said he is continuing to investigate both matters and could
pursue charges against lower-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, White House officials insisted that Starr had cleared the
president on all non-Lewinsky matters. And they complained that he
had been tardy in publicly disclosing his findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conclusions of innocence, no matter how belated, are
important,'' said Paul Begala, one of Clinton's top political
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   On Whitewater, Starr said his prosecutors had difficulty
``establishing the truth with a sufficient degree of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We drafted a report,'' he explained. ``But we concluded that
it would be inconsistent with the statutory standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel cited the cases where he was not still
pursuing the president as evidence of self-restraint. ``We are
proud not only of the cases we won, but also of our decisions not
to indict,'' Starr said, after citing the 14 criminal convictions
he had won on Whitewater, including those of former Justice
Department official Webster Hubbell and former Arkansas Gov. Jim
Guy Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, insisted that Starr's testimony was
tantamount to an admission that he had nothing with which to tar
the president on Whitewater. ``It seems that Ken Starr could not
bring himself to say the words, but a fair reading of yesterday's
statement certainly strongly implies that we're done on
Whitewater,'' said Jim Jordan, a spokesman for the Democratic
minority on the House Judiciary Committee. ``Our members, however,
feel very strongly that Starr was ethically remiss in not
exonerating the president months earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said his attempts to investigate President Clinton and
Hillary Rodham Clinton on Whitewater had been stymied by the
refusal of key witnesses, like Hubbell and Susan McDougal, a former
business partner of the Clintons, to cooperate. Starr indicted
Hubbell for a third time last week and plans to bring Mrs. McDougal
to trial on criminal contempt charges early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while Starr has not uncovered sufficient evidence on
Whitewater to bring criminal charges against the Clintons or
impeach the president, his office is still hoping for a
breakthrough. And while it remains unlikely that pivotal figures
such as Hubbell or Mrs. McDougal will ever supply one to Starr, his
investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
   But even Starr pn Friday acknowledged that he had exonerated the
president on several matters, though he was not specific. In a
letter Friday to Samuel Dash, who resigned Friday as Starr's ethics
adviser, Starr wrote, ``And it is important to note that my status
report on the overall investigation included exonerations for the
president on several issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As the recent indictment of Hubbell revealed, Mrs. Clinton is
not completely out of Starr's line of fire. The indictment refers
to her obliquely as the ``billing partner'' on a legal matter that
is at the heart of the new case against Hubbell. Even though it is
thought unlikely that Starr will bring charges against Mrs.
Clinton, he could embarrass her by calling her as a witness in the
Hubbell case.
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on the active aspects of the Whitewater
investigation during his testimony, Nathan said, Starr was making
``a half-hearted effort to show that there was more than Monica.''
He, too, faulted the independent counsel for offering only a
belated exoneration of the president in the travel office and files
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious his investigation concluded long ago that there
was no basis to bring charges on Filegate and Travelgate, '' Nathan
said. ``It was his responsibility to report that at the first
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives, meanwhile, were bitterly disappointed over
how Starr resolved the travel office and FBI files issues. Larry
Klayman, chairman of Judicial Watch, is representing government
officials who charge in a multi-million dollar class action lawsuit
that their files were unlawfully obtained by the White House.
Klayman said that Starr had done an ``unthorough'' investigation of
the travel office and files matters. He said that he has already
deposed about 20 witnesses in his case and that only two of them
had been interviewed by Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes up with virtually nothing,'' Klayman said. ``All he
comes up with is a stained dress. Most conservatives are very
disappointed in Ken Starr.''

PROGRESS REPORTED IN DAY-LONG SESSION BETWEEN PLAYERS AND OWNERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a chance to make some genuine progress toward
salvaging the season, National Basketball Association players and
owners seized the opportunity and apparently have made at least
modest compromises on their respective proposals during a marathon
bargaining session that began Friday morning and continued into the
night.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, which were continuing at 8:30 p.m. ET, represented
the first full negotiating session in more than three weeks for
both sides, and seemed to strike a chord of optimism unseen in the
NBA's labor dispute since late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the progress will eventually amount to the league ending
the lockout, now in its 143rd day, remains to be seen. But any
softening of stances on either side was seen as productive toward
bridging the vast economic chasm.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on both sides said they planned to meet late into the
night, the first time that had happened since Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether they had begun to close a 10 percent gap
in total revenue distribution - the owners currently want a 50-50
split, while the players said they would install mechanisms to pay
the owners back once their take reaches 60 percent. But one
participant in the meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said minor alterations to a proposed escrow plan were being
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Implementing the escrow arrangement is considered one of the
biggest stumbling blocks in negotiations, along with limiting
high-end salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The escrow plan would take effect in the second or third year of
the proposed deal and would entail the players putting aside a set
amount of their salaries at the beginning of the season. Once a
percentage of salaries paid out to players had been exceeded _
somewhere between 50 percent and 60 percent of the league's $2
billion annual revenue _ the money would be used to pay the owners
back.
</P>
<P>
   The players have previously proposed putting 10 percent aside,
while the owners want the figure to be enough to cover the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides began talking around 10:30 a.m. Friday after they
filed into a midtown Manhattan hotel. They talked for about two
hours.
</P>
<P>
   One team official, who had spoke with a participant in the
meeting late Friday, said that the owners were prepared to call a
halt to the talks before lunch when the players made a minor
compromise in their proposal. The official did not say what the
compromise was, but it apparently sparked the owners to alter their
proposal soon after.
</P>
<P>
   They returned from lunch and worked for another four hours
before taking another break and were said to be interested in
negotiating late into the night. By Friday night, the mood had
changed dramatically from earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   When the two parties filed in, an aura of pessimism abounded.
Both sides had said they had no interest in moving off their
numbers, and the idea to bring almost 20 players into town to talk
with seven of the owner's nine-member labor relations committee
seemed a gamble at best.
</P>
<P>
   With no substantial progress since a marathon session on Oct. 28
_ a meeting that broke at 1 a.m. _ several observers predicted a
quick halt to the talks followed by another week to two weeks of
silence and the requisite gauging of when the season would be
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Without a deal Friday night, a seventh week would be stricken
from the schedule and the earliest the season could probably start
would be Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have any reason to think we'll make any
progress,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said as he entered
the hotel. ``We certainly want to, but I don't have my hopes up
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Said the Seattle center Jim McIlvaine a member of the union's
negotiating committee, ``There's a sense that nothing's going to be
done right now.''
</P>
<P>
   After talking to players from more than 25 of the league's 29
teams on conference calls for the past two weeks, union officials
said their orders were to withhold any more concessions until the
owners showed an inclination to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, in fact, this week sent a letter to every owner, team
president and general manager outlining the proposals. He wrote
that it would be ``an enormous miscalculation to further test the
players' resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they are about to top $300 million in salaries lost and
withstood their first dissenting words this week _ Wizards guard
Tim Legler vented frustration at the superstars and urged players
to sign a deal in a Washington Post article on Wednesday _ the
union has remained steadfast.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as a testament to their resolve, the players installed
Legler on their negotiating team Friday. ``I guess the issue is
discussing the proposals that were on the table and seeing whether
or not there's any possible movement,'' said Billy Hunter, the
union's executive director, Friday morning. ``As I've said before,
if they are inclined to move off their position, then we are
prepared to discuss whether we're ready to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the players gave in first did not seem to matter.
For the first time in almost a month, progress was made.
</P>
<P>
   Indicative of either the urgency or frustration on both sides,
union president Patrick Ewing mingled with a league official during
lunch outside the meeting room. He implored the official to keep
negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go back at it,'' Ewing said, smiling. ``I want to
play.''

COMPOSED HINGIS AND POWERFUL DAVENPORT GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a method to their madness.
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis, without a title since May and without the No. 1
ranking she had owned for 80 weeks, needed to avenge last year's
loss in the Chase Championships to Mary Pierce if she had any hope
of ending 1998 on an upbeat note.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the second-seeded Hingis kept her composure from
start to finish in the course of a 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 victory over the
sixth-seeded Pierce, last year's runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Davenport, now the world's No. 1 player, longed for a
rematch with Steffi Graf, who had the temerity to perform like a
No. 1 player when she upended Davenport last Sunday in the
Philadelphia final.
</P>
<P>
   But to get a second crack at Graf, who is lurking ahead in the
semifinal round of this year-ending tournament, Davenport needed to
make a stepping-stone out of Natalie Tauziat on Friday night in the
quarterfinals, and that is exactly what she did at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   With a viciously effective blend of power and economy, Davenport
needed just 54 minutes to crash her way past eighth-seeded Nathalie
Tauziat, 6-0, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Once Hingis grew accustomed to the sonic pace of the Pierce
forehand, she began to coax mistakes from it, and once Pierce got
nervous about relying on her forehand, the remainder of her weapons
suffered a breakdown, too. A backhand return beyond bounds gave
Hingis the first set. A lethal crosscourt backhand into Pierce's
forehand corner gave Hingis the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of wanted revenge for what she did to me last year,''
Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by Davenport brought her 1998 record against Tauziat
to 5-2. Of their 14 career meetings, the French woman had managed
to claim only three, but Friday night's collision was hopelessly
one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I entered the match pretty late,'' Tauziat, this year's
Wimbledon runner-up, said about her invisibility in the 19-minute
opening set, ``and she played pretty good. Didn't make a lot of
mistakes tonight, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Revenge might not be the most noble motive for laying it on the
line out on the court, but at this late date in the interminable
tennis season, sometimes it becomes a player's best reason for
lacing up her sneakers, and on Friday night it earned the revenge
she needed and brought Davenport the rematch she craved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, she's obviously playing the best tennis right now, and
you always kind of want to go up against the best,'' Davenport said
about the resurgence by the 29-year-old German, who has compiled a
12-match undefeated streak and has collected two consecutive
titles, at Leipzig, Germany, and Philadelphia, since making her
comeback from wrist surgery in September.
</P>
<P>
   During that rampage, Graf became the only player to defeat the
world's top three players in a four-match span by ousting Martina
Hingis and Davenport in Philadelphia and dethroning third-seeded
Jana Novotna, this event's defending champion, in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The unseeded Graf's elimination of Novotna brought the
30-year-old Czech veteran the unwanted distinction of becoming the
first defending champion in the history of this event to have her
title defense snuffed in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, whose best result here came in 1994 when she was
runner-up to Gabriela Sabatini, admitted she felt relieved not to
have to face the Graf juggernaut any earlier than the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   That is how convinced she is that Graf's latest two titles (all
told, she owns 106) have only served to escalate her appetite for
more. After all, Davenport, with a tour-leading six titles to her
credit this year, feels much the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really like to cap off a great year by winning this
tournament; hopefully if I can raise my game a little bit more and
I can come away with the title,'' said Davenport who, while she
trails her career rivalry with Graf by 7-3, would love to be able
stake bragging rights to her 1998 rivalry with the German.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're 2-2 for the year,'' said Davenport, who has lost
their last two confrontations. ``Maybe I'll go up 3-2 before the
year is out.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: SEEING RED OVER THE GREENMARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 21: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four glorious days a week, New York City's largest Greenmarket
converts a stretch of tarmac into a grand agricultural oasis at
Union Square. Mounds of sweet yellow peppers, tubs of newly cut
roses, crusty black bread, fish, eggs, honey, mushrooms _ such
delicacies entice discerning buyers, schoolchildren, even tourists
to inspect some of the best and most photogenic produce in the
city. These same four days a week, the market also serves as my
neighborhood grocery. It is our outdoor community center, and ever
since a cow appeared one day at the milk stand, I think of the
Greenmarket as our answer to a weekend place in the country.
</P>
<P>
   So on a recent Saturday when the man selling potatoes implied
that the city was about to bulldoze our Greenmarket, I became
instantly indignant. Like 18,000 others, I signed a petition to
save the market. Now, after seeing the city's plans, I want my
signature back.
</P>
<P>
   The Parks Department would spend $2.6 million to build a little
parkette: a cluster of trees around a shallow fountain and the
resident statue of Gandhi. This new green area would be at the very
tip of the Greenmarket, not anywhere near the main section around
the north end of the park that includes up to 70 separate vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would also turn an underused area into a place to muse,
sketch, smooch, smoke or merely rest on several very public
benches. Yes, the 25 new trees will squeeze a few stalls together
on Saturdays in late summer, and, yes, it might take the trucks a
little longer to move in and out. But given the fact that the
impact on the market is extremely modest and the rest of us will
have a place to read on days when the farmers are elsewhere, it
looks like a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   So why the rumpus? Union Square has protest in its very dust.
Unions once rallied there. Emma Goldman shouted above the police
whistles for women's rights. The old Communist Party building still
exists, now a Toys ``R'' Us store.
</P>
<P>
   When this proud old trouper of a park turned to drugs in the
1970s, the community struggled to reclaim the square by encouraging
farmers to sell their wares at big-city prices. The first brave
Greenmarket farmers set up stalls in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when a few concerned citizens raised a cry that the mayor
was planning to revive an old, unpopular renovation that would
remove 20 or more farmers, the neighborhood went on full alert.
That plan, however, has no money and little support. Instead the
proposal now proceeding noisily through community boards has been
reworked to reflect the demands of Greenmarket managers, local
residents and customers.
</P>
<P>
   With a few layers of approval to go, the entire process has
provided hard lessons. At the city, it's a reminder that the
Greenmarket rests on hallowed ground. For me, it's a warning to
keep a good grip on myself when buying potatoes. &QL;

PATRIOTS' HARTFORD DEAL SPURS SEASON-TICKET REQUESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass.)  (bl) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The day after the governor of Connecticut
announced a deal to build a new football stadium for the New
England Patriots in Hartford, a Patriot official said Friday that
the team had received 3,000 requests for 10,000 season tickets, and
business leaders said they were interested in leasing the luxury
suites that would be critical to the team's success.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the negotiations between Gov. John G. Rowland
and Patriots owner Robert Kraft first became public knowledge, some
people questioned whether this long-depressed state capital could
attract enough corporate support, and whether it could fill seats
with converted Jets and Giants fans as well as with the faithful
from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But corporate leaders here said concerns about the team's
economic viability were probably overblown. ``Those people are
being unduly pessimistic,'' said Lawrence Gottesdiener, whose
company, Northland Investment Corp., of Newton, Mass., owns the
Metro Center, an office complex near the Hartford Civic Center, and
three other commercial buildings in the area. ``They will be able
to sell seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of the requests for season tickets, which started pouring
in shortly after the deal was announced Thursday, were from
Connecticut residents, a Patriots spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, the state will build a $350
million, 68,000-seat stadium as part of a $1 billion development
along the Connecticut River that will include a hotel, convention
center and sports stores. The team is scheduled to move to Hartford
in the fall of 2001 from its current home in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium is to have 125 to 150 luxury suites and 6,000 club
seats, which typically feature comfortable chairs and waiter
service. Luxury suites generally cost $50,000 to $100,000 each for
eight league games and two exhibition games. Club seats can range
from $1,000 to several thousand dollars a season.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Keith Anderson, a spokesman for the Travelers insurance
operations group in Hartford, a division of Citigroup, said that it
was too early for the company to decide whether to buy a luxury
suite or club seats.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson did say that the company was considering the
purchases. ``All I can tell you is that the reaction among
employees is one of enthusiasm,'' he said, adding that Citigroup
has about 7,000 employees in the area. ``Already, we have been
getting calls about tickets. If the response of our employees is
any indication, this stands a very good chance of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Morgan, a group senior vice president of the Hartford
Financial Services Group, a venerable financial services and
insurance company here, echoed that sentiment. ``We have always
been supporters of sports and the arts in Hartford, and I suspect
we would be with the Patriots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe McGee, vice president of the Southwestern Connecticut Area
Commerce and Industry Association in Stamford, said that a crucial
factor in the team's success might be whether Patriots games are
televised regularly on cable stations that can be seen in Fairfield
County, an affluent suburb of New York City that is home to the
headquarters of many Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that when the team and the state were close to a
similar deal in 1993, there was significant interest among
Fairfield County-based corporations in the 80 luxury seats offered
then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some companies were interested, and some had concerns because
they had arrangements with the New York teams,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Samek, 44, of Kensington, who grew up watching Giants
games on television every Sunday with his father and brother, said
abandoning the New York team was unthinkable. ``I'll buy Patriots
season tickets,'' said Samek, who went to both Giants Super Bowl
games, one in Pasadena, Calif., and the other in Tampa, Fla. ``It's
one way of assuring yourself of a ticket to a Giants game someday
down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to attracting support from corporations in
Connecticut, the team will need to retain the allegiance of
companies in Boston. Some large companies, like BankBoston, have
already said that they plan to support the Patriots in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a sky box now that we use to entertain clients, and we
will have a sky box in any stadium as long as the stadium is
located in a state where we do business,'' said Bruce Spitzer, a
BankBoston company spokesman. ``We have a large franchise in
Connecticut. Our colleagues there are very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the Boston area, however, are as upset as
football fans in Baltimore were when their beloved Baltimore Colts
moved to Indianapolis in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a greater indication of what is wrong
with our government system,'' said Jeff Keith, the marketing and
public relations manager for Spike Technologies in Nashua, N.H.
``There are hundreds of thousands of businessmen, fans and
taxpayers throughout Massachusetts who would have done anything to
get the deal done and keep the Pats in New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many fans of Boston sports teams, he directed special ire
at the speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives,
Thomas Finneran, whose fiscal restraint forced Kraft to flee to
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man has single-handedly insured that Boston will lose yet
again another landmark,'' said Keith, who has held season tickets
for six years. ``Any businessman, or legislator, worth his salt can
easily see the positive financial impact a professional team of the
Patriots' caliber has on the overall economy.''

<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ If ever an academic department was hot, it was
the English department at Duke University in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, when it was famously reinventing itself. Recruiting
star professors, it bounded up the national rankings and became for
a time the capital of cutting-edge literary studies as well as many
a conservative's favorite example of academic excess.
</P>
<P>
   The department's biggest names included Stanley Fish, its
flamboyant chairman; Frank Lentricchia, whom The Village Voice once
called ``the Dirty Harry of contemporary critical theory;'' Eve
Kosovsky Sedgwick, co-founder of the growing academic field of
``queer theory,'' and, fleetingly, Henry Louis Gates Jr., now the
ubiquitous chairman of Afro-American studies at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past year, the department has appeared to be
self-destructing. Professors have been at war with each other. Many
of the best-known have left. When an external review team paid a
routine two-day visit last spring, it reported having found the
department ``without anything we would be disposed to describe as
an undergraduate or graduate curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the university has placed the department in something
resembling receivership, overseen by an executive committee (headed
by a dean from the botany department who is an authority on plant
respiration). The committee is overseeing the search for a new
department chairman and the first of perhaps a half-dozen new
professors to replace the ones who have left.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the department can come up with three to six excellent
hires, that will signal to the rest of the academic community that
this enterprise is still in business and at the same high level,''
said Fish, now white-haired and 60, who is preparing to leave Duke
next month to become a dean at the University of Illinois in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we blow it _ and I don't know why we would, but if we were
to blow it _ then after about a year or two another word will
settle in. And this will be the word that, `Well, that was nice
while it lasted but it's over.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to say whether the discord in the department
will have any effect on enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval at Duke offers a glimpse into the arcane world of
an academic department, one in which a complex mixture of
ideological, generational and personality differences among its 40
members led to explosive skirmishes over hiring and tenure,
graduate-student admissions and the distribution of departmental
tasks and perks.
</P>
<P>
   As some professors see it, the story is a cautionary tale for
universities hoping to emulate Duke's success in building a
national reputation by strategically hiring star scholars; they say
the department's problems stem in part from resentments that took
root after celebrated outsiders never became fully integrated into
departmental life.
</P>
<P>
   But Duke's difficulties also reflect tensions in English
departments nationwide at a time when many havebeen struggling to
redefine their mission. Where most once agreed that their primary
role was the passing down of an agreed upon heritage of classic
literary texts, that rationale has been challenged in recent
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the postmodern world, some of those working within
literature are using literature as an instrument to try to affect
social change,'' said James Applewhite, a 63-year-old poet and
English professor at Duke. ``I think the problem of our department
was, in the new era, once literature becomes politics, then
politics is a matter of contention rather than consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, five full professors, including Fish and Ms. Sedgwick, are
leaving or have left Duke. In addition, Lentricchia has switched
departments; another English professor has become a vice provost.
Their reasons for defecting vary, but they include the dissension
within the department, unhappiness with its leadership and
opportunities elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the department quite an unpleasant place by the time I
left,'' said Ms. Sedgwick, who said she had moved to New York City
in part to be nearer her husband after learning that she was
experiencing a recurrence of an old cancer. ``I would say
two-thirds of the decision had to do with my loss of respect for
the department I was in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the announcements, the review team arrived for
the department's five-year check-up. Four English professors from
other major research universities spent several days meeting with
members of the department who, said Cathy Davidson, a Duke English
professor, used the occasion ``almost as a confessional and went in
and just sort of evacuated.''
</P>
<P>
   In late May, the team delivered its findings in a confidential
report (leaked posthaste to a student newspaper). The department
was ``in a seriously weakened condition,'' the group wrote. Morale
was ``desperately low.'' Dislike for the chairman, Marianna
Torgovnick, a protege of Fish, was pervasive; some professors
wanted her term cut short ``at whatever emotional and professional
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not to say that the department lacks excellent
faculty,'' the report said. ``But the current department, except by
virtue of its afterglow, cannot reasonably be considered
top-ranked.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early 1980s, the Duke department was a traditional
sort of place. Its members were mostly men, mostly white, mostly
getting on in years: interpreters of literary figures, writers on
esthetic themes, relatively untouched by the intellectual trends
transforming their field. The department seemed in danger of
becoming an old boys' club.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to raise Duke's profile, the university administration
decided to build up the English department. In 1984, it lured
Lentricchia away from Rice University. At his suggestion, it
recruited Fish from Johns Hopkins to head the English department
and Fredric Jameson, the Marxist critic and literary theorist, to
run the program in literature.
</P>
<P>
   They in turn recruited more stars: Barbara Herrnstein Smith, who
was about to become president of the Modern Language Association;
Janice Radway, who had recently studied the romance-novel genre;
then Ms. Davidson, Ms. Sedgwick and Gates, along with Lee Patterson
and his wife, Annabel Patterson, both now at Yale. Ms. Sedgwick is
a pioneer in ``queer theory,'' an approach to literature that goes
into the study of sexuality and refuses to divide the world neatly
into homosexual and heterosexual.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the department was seen as a hotbed of literary
theory. In the area of gender and literature, U.S. News and World
Report would eventually rank the graduate program first in the
country. Graduate student applications increased four-fold between
1985 and 1991. The department vaulted upward in the National
Research Council rankings, from 27th in the country to 5th. (And
certain attributes of Fish found their way into the work of his
friend, David Lodge, the author of several novels satirizing
academic life.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, an external review team reported with admiration: ``We
were struck by the chorus of testimony we heard from faculty
outside the department that English has become a kind of engine or
life-pump for the humanities at Duke, a supplier of intellectual
energy and stimulation for the university at large. It is not easy
to produce changes of this sort.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit is widely given to Fish. In six years as chairman, Fish
kept the university's resources focused on the department, acquired
for it prime office space in the Gothic building that houses the
president's office, and presided over what one administrator called
``a high-maintenance bunch of people, let me tell you'' with such
apparent impartiality that even potential enemies came to believe
he had the department's best interests at heart.
</P>
<P>
   His style was not, however, notably democratic. He is said to
have abolished the department's bylaws. (As he tells it, there were
no bylaws when he arrived; he simply swept away rules that were
making people unhappy.) His preferred leadership method was working
the halls. Asked when he was going to hold a meeting, he answered,
``When there are no more issues.''
</P>
<P>
   There were always more issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in some ways a classical pitched field of postmodern
versus more traditional types of scholars and critics,'' said
Reynolds Price, the novelist and a member of the department since
1958. ``The general good will that Stanley inspired made those
differences seem a good deal less important than they turned out to
be when Stanley wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   The strain became increasingly apparent in the years after Fish
stepped down as chairman in 1992. Camps and cliques took shape. The
various factions were shifting and difficult to define, but many
believe they were determined, at least in part, by degrees of
enthusiasm, or lack of it, for such areas of study as gender and
sexuality, African-American studies and theory.
</P>
<P>
   To some, like Lentricchia, the department had become dominated
by ideologues who measured the quality of one's scholarship by
whether it was ideologically correct. To others, there appeared to
be, as Ms. Sedgwick put it, ``a whole group of faculty who really
felt that the department was too theoretical, too queer, too
African-American.''
</P>
<P>
   Open warfare broke out over such things as hiring, promotions,
graduate student admissions and issues like which faculty members
had money to bring in outside speakers. There were also longer-term
resentments about teaching-load disparities and a perception that
some stars bore little of the administrative burden.
</P>
<P>
   The antagonisms became especially bitter after Ms. Torgovnick
took over in 1996 and, her critics say, adopted Fish's
authoritarian style without his charm. They accuse her of having
favored her friends, manipulated meetings, even doctored minutes _
all charges she denies. People in every camp ended up feeling like
members of an embattled minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that all the problems are solely the result of
her mismanagement,'' said Michael Valdez Moses, a 41-year-old
associate professor who describes his field of specialization as
Anglophone post-colonial literatures. ``But it's certainly the case
that she made what would be by any stretch of the imagination a
difficult situation into an impossible, particularly ugly one.''
</P>
<P>
   What kind of department will emerge is unclear. The curriculum
may become somewhat more structured than in the past. But many in
the department are skeptical that the curriculum is really a
problem, since the Duke department is more successful than most in
landing graduate students in scarce academic jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Many are equally dubious about the review committee's complaint
that they lack an ``overarching departmental mission,'' a vision of
what the department wants to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   `If there is an English, French or literature department in the
country that has found the new sense of mission and given it a good
formulation, it has a very marketable product because lots of other
departments would want to buy the kit,'' Fish said. ``But I don't
myself know of any. So the lack of clear mission is a feature, I
believe, now of the profession and not just this department.''

   Carol Henning Shaw; Mothers' Voices Organizer
</P>
<P>
   Carol Henning Shaw, an early organizer of Mothers' Voices, a
national group working for the prevention and cure of AIDS, died
Thursday at her home on the West Side of Manhattan. She was 59.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shaw was moved by the fate of her stepdaughter, who was
found to have AIDS when she was 27, to join Mothers' Voices, which
recruits mothers as educators on sexuality and the risks of
unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mrs. Shaw and her stepdaughter, Pamela Ann Shaw, became
leaders in the movement for AIDS research and education, meeting
with President Clinton in 1994 to urge him to increase spending for
these purposes. Pamela Shaw died in 1995 at the age of 31. Her
stepmother remained active in lobbying, demonstrating and
fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shaw was born in Westwood, N.J. She graduated from Skidmore
College, and did public relations work in the securities field.
</P>
<P>
   A food expert by avocation, she was a news assistant and recipe
tester in the style department of The New York Times for the last
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shaw is survived by her husband, Donald H. Shaw; her
mother, Martha Henning of Westwood; two other stepdaughters,
Victoria Louise Shaw-Williamson and Donaly Shaw, both of Manhattan;
and a sister, Jean Cockcroft of Westwood.

</P>
<P>
   Robert H. Whitstock, a retired vice president of the Seeing Eye
organization in Morristown, N.J., which trains guide dogs and those
who use them, died on Oct. 16 at the home of a daughter, Holly
Seeger, in Palisades, N.Y. He was 68 and lived in Cortland, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He had a brain tumor, said his wife, Mary Jane.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, he was struck by a car and blinded when he
was 7. He attended the New York Institute for the Education of the
Blind and graduated in 1952 from Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y.,
and from Harvard Law School in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Seeing Eye staff in Morristown in 1957 and became
the organization's principal field representative, traveling widely
in the United States and Canada and addressing many audiences.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to be vice president of field services in 1967 and
vice president for programs in 1977. He retired in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his daughter Holly, and his wife of 44 years, Mary Jane
Noonan Whitstock, he is survived by two other daughters, Ivy Bryan
of Yardley, Pa., and Laurel Carfaro of Morristown; two sons,

EDITORIAL: KEEP THE 9TH CIRCUIT INTACT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif., Hawaii, Nev., Ore., Wash.)  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sat., Nov. 21:
</P>
<P>
   For years, conservatives have been trying to break up the Court
of Appeals for the 9th Circuit because they have been unhappy with
some of the court's rulings on environmental issues and death
penalty cases. Republicans in the Pacific Northwest have been
particularly vocal in clamoring for their own circuit, believing
that the San Francisco-based appeals court does not understand
their values.
</P>
<P>
   A commission led by former Supreme Court Justice Byron White
will report on the issue to Congress next month. Its draft proposal
would significantly alter the court's structure without formally
cutting the circuit in two. The appellate judges would be assigned
to three regional divisions _ one for the Pacific Northwest states,
one for northern California, Hawaii and Nevada, and one for
southern California and Arizona. These would function as
semi-autonomous units, but conflicting rulings would be resolved by
a seven-judge panel selected from the entire circuit.
Administration would remain under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is more reasonable than splitting the circuit. But it
is still a change for which a compelling case has not been made. A
simpler way to improve the court's performance is for Congress to
fill its vacancies. For most of the last four years, 10 out of 28
judgeships in the 9th Circuit have been vacant. Currently, only 22
are filled. In many cases judges from district courts or other
circuits are asked to sit on panels hearing oral arguments. Simply
reducing the excessive reliance on visiting judges could lead to
more consistent rulings.

SPORTS COLUMN: AFTER APOLOGIES, HUMILIATION REMAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Va., La.)  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Hampton, Va., and Lubbock, Texas, a calm has been shattered.
A women's college basketball game canceled. Two communities, one
largely black and one largely white, are left to wonder whether
games are all they have in common, whether this latest wound will
ever heal.
</P>
<P>
   The healing process began in earnest Friday when Lubbock Mayor
Windy Sitton flew to Virginia to apologize to Hampton University's
president, the head women's basketball coach and the team for
events that have Lubbock defending itself from being painted as an
intolerant city with a racist police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so sorry,'' Sitton said.
</P>
<P>
   From Lubbock, Ken Walker, the 48-year-old chief of police, said:
``I hate that it happened. I wish it hadn't have happened. It did.
We can't go back and change it. Do we wish it hadn't happened?
Absolutely. Especially since the coaches didn't do anything. They
were at the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   For Patricia Bibbs, Hampton's second-year head coach, maybe
Lubbock is the wrong place at the wrong time. She stood by Friday
afternoon, listened graciously to Sitton, and accepted an
outpouring of support.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, she must have been wondering how would she get
back those intangibles that had been snatched away by police last
Monday in Lubbock. In 15 years as a highly respected head coach _
13 at Grambling, 2 at Hampton _ she has always been known for
professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bibbs, her husband and an assistant coach find themselves
reconciling anger, hurt and feelings of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's president, Dr. William Harvey, said at a news
conference Friday: ``The apology is all well and good, and I
believe that she is sincere, but you can't undo what's been done.
No one should have to endure that kind of humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   The events leading to the news conference began Monday when
Bibbs took her Pirates team to Lubbock for a game with 12th-ranked
Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   In a startling series of events, police arrested Bibbs; her
husband, Ezell Bibbs Jr., 46, and an assistant coach, Vanetta
Robinson Kelso, 36, after a Lubbock woman reported that the women
had tried to engage her in a ``pigeon drop'' scam in a Wal-Mart
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone after practice Friday, an emotional
Bibbses told of the humiliation of being handcuffed and placed in
the back of a squad car.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think of was having my team see me like this,''
she said. ``I saw one of my assistant coaches come out to the
parking lot. I just yelled at him: `Please don't let them see me
like this. Keep them away.'
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I get that back? How can I get that back?''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, after reviewing security videotapes from the Wal-Mart
store, police said that the arrests were a case of mistaken
identity and that no charges would be filed. But legal action is
very likely _ by Hampton. Officials at the university _ one of the
most prestigious of the nation's traditionally black schools _
hired lawyer Johnnie Cochran to investigate the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In Lubbock, police and politicians insisted that race was not a
factor in the arrests. Bibbs, who was born in Choudrant, La., and
raised in Monroe, sees a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I'm a professional person, my husband's a professional
person,'' she said. ``You tell someone that you are here to play
Texas Tech, and they don't want to listen to that. They didn't want
to to listen, and they didn't listen. I kept telling them: `I'm a
friend of Marsha Sharp. We're playing her team, you can check it
out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, Texas Tech's head coach since 1981 and a longtime friend
of Bibbs, called the arrest bizarre and said she was devastated by
the events. But asked whether she thought the arrests were racially
motivated, Sharp said: ``My gut feeling is that that's not what
we're dealing with here. I went to her hotel and talked to Coach
Bibbs and the players. I just told them how sorry I was this
happened and that we would do anything we could to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibbs was selected the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference coach of
the year last season, and her team was the MEAC co-champion. She
arrived from Grambling State, where the women's basketball program
was placed on two years of probation by the National Collegiate
Athletic Association in 1997 for violations committed under Bibbs.
This season Bibbs packed her early schedule with powerhouse teams,
not simply for the lucrative financial guarantees that smaller
programs receive to play larger programs in their home arenas, but
to get battle tested for the coming season.

   The events of the last week have thrown the season into free
fall. Even during Friday's news conference with the mayor of
Lubbock, Bibbs kept flashing back to the parking lot. Watching the
police going through the van. Watching her assistant coach, Kelso,
who is five months pregnant, vomiting in the squad car after her
arrest. Going to the jail and sitting in a dingy cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so scared,'' she said. ``I've only seen this stuff on
television, and I've read about it, but it's scary. You don't know
what they're going to do, and we didn't see any black police
officers the whole time we were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Through tears, Bibbs said the mayor's apology may have removed
the nail, but the hole is still there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in education for 26 years,'' she said. ``I deal with
young ladies. Everybody who knows me knows that I'm a professional
person. I'm a lady. I carry myself like that, I acknowledge that
all the time. I have one of the best-dressed teams. Look what
they've done to me. How can you get that back? I've got to go into
these homes, recruiting these athletes, talk to their mothers. How
can I get that back?''

SALE OF YANKEES IS REPORTED NEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Steinbrenner is close to completing a deal to
sell a majority interest in the Yankees to Cablevision, a media
company that owns the Rangers, the Knicks and Madison Square
Garden, two business associates of Steinbrenner's said Friday. The
sale will probably be concluded early next year, they said, and
would keep Steinbrenner in charge of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know there's nothing that's been signed,'' said a
lawyer involved with the team, ``but they are probably close to a
handshake. It's very, very warm.''
</P>
<P>
   One detail yet to be resolved is how much some of the minor
partners would be paid for their shares. It is not clear how large
an obstacle that could be to the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't finalized it yet,'' another associate said of
Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few things he has to work out,'' he said, but
added that it was likely that the deal would be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner said in a telephone interview Friday that he had
not reached a deal to sell a majority interest in the team, but he
acknowledged that a sale was a topic of discussion at a partners'
meeting in Cleveland on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed the possibilities before us, and we have
several,'' Steinbrenner said. Asked if talks with Cablevision
continued, he said: ``They've been ongoing for over a year and a
half. They're not the only talks. But there is absolutely nothing
at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer who discussed the pending sale, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said that in the deal under consideration,
Steinbrenner would not sell his entire 60 percent share of the
Yankees but ``a significant portion'' of it. He said he also
understood that some of the limited partners would sell their
shares, but others would retain their interests.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Friday night how large a stake in the team
Cablevision was preparing to buy. But under the terms being
negotiated, the team's value would be placed at more than $600
million, according to one person close to Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner and Cablevision have been discussing a deal off and
on for most of the year. At one point the talks cooled off, only to
be revived as the Yankees headed toward the end of the World
Championship season.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision, a Long Island company run by Charles Dolan, sees
the Yankees as a valuable property because of the television
programming they provide. Cablevision currently has rights to the
Yankees under a 12-year, $486 million contract, and would almost
certainly have to pay even more for a new deal. At those prices,
Cablevision executives figure, they might as well own the team.
</P>
<P>
   Completing his 26th year as the team's principal owner,
Steinbrenner has long said he would not sell the Yankees. He never
seriously considered previous offers. When Madison Square Garden
owned cable rights to Yankee games, before it was bought by
Cablevision, its officials, too, tried to buy at least a part of
the team, but got nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But now the timing favors a sale. Steinbrenner has acknowledged
that he is not getting any younger _ he is 68 _ and neither his
sons, Henry and Harold, nor his son-in-law, Steve Swindal, has
expressed an interest in owning and operating the team.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Henry Steinbrenner, known as Hank, was once briefly involved in
the team operation about a dozen years ago. Harold Steinbrenner and
Swindal are general partners of the Yankees but have played no
visible role in the operation of the club.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner would not have to own a majority of the club
to be the managing partner. He owned less than 50 percent when he
and his partners bought the team from CBS for $10 million in 1973,
and he was the managing partner. More recently, Walt Disney Co.
bought 25 percent of the Anaheim Angels from Gene Autry and became
the managing partner.
</P>
<P>
   The only difference would be the oddity of Steinbrenner's
working for someone else. As the managing partner, he would have a
free hand in running the Yankees, but he would still be acting in
that role under an agreement with the majority owner.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known how long that agreement would keep him in that
position.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the Yankees has always been high, but the club's
price tag has become even more lucrative with their two World
Series championships in the last three years. Dolan of Cablevision
obviously likes what the Yankees have done for Cablevision in that
time and would welcome Steinbrenner's continued operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very fond of Chuck Dolan,'' Steinbrenner said Friday.
``We're both from Cleveland.''

 &HT;    Costly `golden fleece' remains king of wools
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the years, cashmere has been a symbol of elegance and
sublime taste. Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn and Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis in their pullovers and matching cardigans come to mind. And
this past month, TV personality Oprah Winfrey appeared on Vogue's
cover in Ralph Lauren's elegant strapless navy cashmere dress for a
cool $6,300.
</P>
<P>
   This season, designers also have a soft spot for cashmere,
turning it into sweater sets, mufflers, gloves, dresses and
traditional coats.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the world's most luxurious wools, cashmere is as
smooth and soft as silk with the coolness of cotton. But where does
it come from?
</P>
<P>
   Most high-quality cashmere comes from the underbelly of goats
living in the remote mountains of China and Mongolia. It takes the
fleece from one goat to produce a scarf or pair of gloves, fleece
from three to four goats for a woman's sweater, eight goats for a
dress and 24 goats for a long coat. The hair on the back of the
goat is the least desirable because of its exposure to the
elements; therefore, it's used for less expensive cashmere
products. Finally, the longer the goat hair, the finer and softer
it will be. And more costly.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a pink cashmere pullover from Lauren runs $375
while a similar-looking lambs-wool sweater from J. Crew will set
you back $58. And a trio of Lauren's strapless evening cashmere
dresses ranges from $2,295 to $6,300.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cashmere, you pay for what you get, and getting
it can be costly. Price notwithstanding, cashmere continues to be
one of the creme de la creme wools.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple matter of supply and demand, according to Jan
Mehalick, seller of fine cashmere and president of Ballantyne
Cashmere in New York. ``It's a luxury product that people want,''
she says. ``While the demand is strong, the supply is limited. One
goat produces only about 4 to 6 ounces of high-quality cashmere
fleece a year. And it takes three to four goats to produce one
sweater. That's why cashmere is often referred to as the golden
fleece.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting cashmere to market is also an arduous and expensive
task. ``Making a sweater is labor-intensive,'' says cashmere
importer Dick Forte of Dawson Forte Cashmeres in Massachusetts.
``Every spring, each goat has to be combed by hand. And there are
15 million goats in China and 9 million in Mongolia.''
</P>
<P>
   After the herdsmen remove the down, which grows under the goat's
thick outer hair, they also collect every bit of down from twigs
and underbrush. Raw cashmere is dirty and must be cleaned. Next the
coarse hair and down hairs are separated by a mechanical process
called dehairing. Finally, it's sold to mills, in China, Italy and
Scotland, to be spun into thread and woven into yarn.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, according to Forte, the world market for cashmere
sweaters was about 8 million. This was divided equally among
consumers in the United States, Europe, Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
   However, figures will likely increase this year. ``The U.S. will
have the strongest demand, followed by Europe. Sales will be weak
in Japan and China because of the Asian financial crisis,'' Forte
predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Often you'll hear talk about single-ply or two-ply cashmere
sweaters. This refers to the number of hairs twisted together to
form the thickness of the yarn, not the quality of the cashmere.
Plys range from single to 14. A single-ply pullover is lighter than
a 12-ply pullover.
</P>
<P>
   To make certain that you are getting the best quality cashmere,
Karl Spilhaus, director of the Cashmere &AMP; Camel Hair Institute in
Boston, and Forte offer these suggestions for selecting cashmere:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Check for the density of the cashmere. Hold a sweater up to
the light. If you can see through it, that means it was loosely
knit and won't hold up.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Grab a sweater on each side and gently pull. If it snaps back
quickly, the sweater was knit correctly. If it's limp, the sweater
was loosely knit and will easily pill. Also, it won't last much
beyond a season's wearing.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Watch out for so-called bargains. If the price is too low, it
probably isn't made from top-quality cashmere. The average price of
a sweater is $200.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Buy trusted labels from reputable stores.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sometimes garments sold as 100 percent cashmere actually are
blended with sheep wool. A true cashmere should be soft and feel
good to the touch. It's not fuzzy or spongy.
</P>
<P>
   CARE TIPS
</P>
<P>
   Taking care of your cashmeres
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hand-wash cashmere knits in cold water with a gentle soap such
as a baby shampoo. Never put in a dryer. Lay flat on a towel to
dry. Use a steam iron for a touch-up. Woven cashmere jackets and
coats should be dry-cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fold your sweaters with tissue and store flat in a drawer to
preserve the garment's shape. Never hang your cashmere.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Treat stains quickly. Rinse immediately with cold water. Hot
water may set the stain. Allow to dry away from heat, then brush
with the nap.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Give garments at least a 24-hour rest between wearings.
Wrinkles will vanish.

 &HT;    With his Old World training and his New World restaurant,
Guenter Seeger has become one of the nation's top chefs
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not long after Guenter Seeger arrived in Atlanta, the
chef ordered some expensive, imported white truffles for his
restaurant, the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton. Whoever received
the shipment must not have known a truffle from a turnip, because
the package full of musty, tasty fungus was thought to smell funny
and was tossed in the trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We searched through the Dumpster, but it was too late. My
truffles were gone,'' Seeger says. Though it has been a dozen
years, he still looks irritated as he considers the shameful waste
of it all over a flute of his private-label G. Seeger's champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The chef is telling the story to make a point. When he came here
in 1985, the level of dining sophistication was such that the staff
at even a haute establishment such as the Ritz could not always be
trusted with truffles. The local dining scene has grown strikingly
more competitive and accomplished since then. Just this month,
Esquire magazine named an Atlanta place its best new restaurant of
the year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The place is Seeger's, the dining room he opened last fall after
leaving the Ritz. Most nights, the chef can be glimpsed there
personally shaving truffles into his guests' soup bowls like a
solicitous waiter with a pepper mill. One cannot be too careful
with good ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   At 49, Seeger is Atlanta's most-honored chef _ the only toque in
town to have won an award from the James Beard Foundation, one of
the food world's highest laurels. Esquire dining critic John
Mariani regards him as one of the finest chefs anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike some other chefs with far-flung reputations, Seeger
is not lining up TV appearances, promoting cookbooks or signing
deals to franchise restaurants. He expresses no ambition to join
Wolfgang Puck or Emeril Lagasse as the next epicurean merchandising
logo. In a characteristic bit of understatement, there's no sign in
front of his restaurant at 111 W. Paces Ferry Road in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems to bother people, that I didn't put a big fish or
perhaps a big carrot in front,'' Seeger says. He had no intention
of placing his name on the door either until his wife talked him
into it; he had wanted the restaurant to be like a speak-easy for
foodies, with diners knowing to ring the bell if they wished to be
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   After years of working in the clubby Englishness of the Ritz,
Seeger wanted the new restaurant to radiate his sensibility. It is
housed in a 1920s bungalow that he and 27 investors spent $2
million to gut and rebuild as a spare, modern space not unlike an
art gallery. Seeger chose virtually everything, from the Riedel
stemware to the servers' black suits to the eye-opening photographs
that show food provocatively posed on naked models (one could be
titled Veal Loin a la Loin, with a garnish best left unmentioned).
The restaurant is a perfect reflection of the man _ an eccentric
mixture of Old World dining traditions and New Age fashions,
encased in an armor of Teutonic discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some chefs get off work and go home to drink beer and watch
football. That's not Guenter. He's interested in art, fashion,
design _ he has a total esthetic vision,'' says Shaun Doty, who
trained under Seeger and is now chef at the downtown Atlanta
restaurant Mumbo Jumbo.
</P>
<P>
   The vision begins with the food.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   It's Friday morning, and Seeger is sitting in his restaurant
planning the evening's menu over an espresso. Tall and thin, with a
monk's soup-bowl haircut and an abbreviated beard out of a
Renaissance painting, he looks like an underfed graduate student
poring over his textbooks. For 30 minutes he contemplates the
possibilities, referring to a kitchen inventory as he pencils in
changes to the previous day's bill of fare. He alters the menu by
as much as a third every morning, regularly surprising his staff
with new variations seemingly conjured from the top of his head.
Finally, he summons his longtime chef de cuisine, Daniel
Porubiansky, and issues marching orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some beautiful beets, Daniel.'' He pronounces it
Dan-yell, as if it were French. ``I want this beet salad toasted in
nasturtium oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The assistant looks puzzled. Toasted? The light bulb turns on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tossed?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ya, tossed.''
</P>
<P>
   When Seeger talks about produce in his meaty German accent, he
is harking back to his roots. He grew up near Baden-Baden, between
the Rhine and the Black Forest, the third of four children in a
prosperous family of fruit brokers. He worked in the business as a
teenager, learning to judge food at the source, and has never
forgotten the lessons. Not for nothing does his menu cover feature
a photograph of a red torpedo onion, looking as sleek as a Mercedes
roadster.
</P>
<P>
   The menu consultation finished, Seeger decides to visit the man
who grew the torpedo onion. Hopping into his silver Audi sedan, he
drives an hour north to see Andrew Goldstein, an organic farmer
near Dawsonville, Ga., one of a network of growers and suppliers
that Seeger has cultivated and calls on regularly. He hugs
Goldstein, and the two head off into the fields in a golf cart,
Seeger happily munching cilantro leaves from one hand while the
other clutches a cell phone. When they return, the chef takes a
platter of mushrooms and cooks an impromptu vegetarian lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He respects farmers and treats us as peers,'' says Lucy
Calhoun, who grows microgreens and other produce for Seeger's at
Ashland Farm in Walton County, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Calhoun spread has become one of Seeger's favorite
places. He took his future wife there for their first date in 1992.
They strolled, picked vegetables, cooked together. Two years later,
they returned to be wed and feted in a white-tablecloth dinner
served by the staff of the Ritz in formal attire. Ever the
contrarian, the groom wore white.
</P>
<P>
   Laureen Seeger, a trial lawyer who grew up in Milwaukee, Wisc.,
is his second wife (his first marriage, to a German woman, ended in
1991). The couple lives in Pine Hills, a quiet neighborhood in
Atlanta, in a half-renovated ranch home that has a two-story modern
addition in the middle with an open kitchen visible through a bank
of windows _ visualize the High Museum of Art(Ga.) crashing into
Levittown. Their mornings are just as curious. As Laureen scrambles
to get to the office and a nanny arrives to take care of Angela,
their 16-month-old daughter, Guenter begins his day with an hour of
kung fu and chi kung exercises in the back yard. On most
afternoons, Angela joins her father for dinner at the restaurant.
On Sundays, his only days off, he usually cooks for the family at
home.
</P>
<P>
   A peek into his Sub-Zero reveals yogurt, cheeses, beer, plenty
of veggies _ but not a soft drink in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guenter doesn't believe in processed foods,'' his wife says.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Seeger had never been to America when he was hired to run the
dining room of Washington's Regent Hotel in 1984. The New World was
quite an education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried not to judge Americans by what they eat,'' he says _
but being a continental chef, he couldn't help it. Take fast food,
which he despises. ``People think they have no time, so they put
anything in their stomachs to make them not feel hungry. I try not
to let it frustrate me.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeger had a traditional European restaurant education, starting
with an apprenticeship at 13 and moving through every dining job
from waiter to bartender. At 28, he opened his first restaurant on
the edge of the Black Forest and earned a Michelin star for his
innovative French-influenced cooking. After the Washington venture
failed, the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain brought him to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys living here now _ he adores the Georgia countryside _
but he was hardly impressed with the city at first.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the native cuisine. Seeger is not a great fan
of Southern cooking. Fried chicken? ``I don't get anything out of
it.'' Barbecue? ``They've got something there, but a lot of it is
too sloppy.'' Greens? ``I love the vegetables, but what's Southern
about that? They have greens in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Seeger has incorporated quite a few Southern foods
into his menus and has even been known to shave truffles into
grits. What he dislikes is the Southern way of cooking, especially
frying. He has made exceptions, though. Colleagues at the Ritz
remember the time he was planning a breakfast and wanted to know
the secret of making light, fluffy biscuits. He sat down with a
hotel housekeeper who knew about such mysteries and learned from
her.
</P>
<P>
   Seeger was particularly displeased with the pool of restaurant
talent he found here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality and craftsmanship of servers in Atlanta sucks,''
he says. ``It's getting better, but it's not the same level of
professionalism as Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his uncompromising standards and strong opinions, it's
little wonder that Seeger soon acquired a reputation as arrogant,
egocentric and temperamental.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a maniac in the beginning,'' says Troy Thompson, who
worked with Seeger at the Ritz and is now chef at the Atlanta
restaurant Fusebox. ``He would swear and yell and belittle
everyone. But we put up with it because he had so much to offer. We
were learning from the master, living on espresso, bread and the
energy of the food.''
</P>
<P>
   Feelings were no doubt bruised, but the results were
unassailable. In his 12 years there, Seeger made the Dining Room
Atlanta's top-rated restaurant, winning a rare five stars from the
Mobil guide.
</P>
<P>
   His initial venture outside the Ritz was less successful. In
1993, Seeger signed on as consulting chef for a Parisian-style
brasserie in Atlanta, Resto des Amis. The food was good; Esquire
named it one of the nation's best new restaurants. But the business
was mismanaged and the doors closed within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally screwed up. I never got paid,'' Seeger says.
</P>
<P>
   The Resto experience was fresh in his mind when Esquire's
Mariani returned to Atlanta last year to try Seeger's. Again, he
loved the food. But he had a pointed question for the chef: ``Are
you going to be in the kitchen this time?''
</P>
<P>
   Seeger assured him that unlike Resto, where he was merely a
consultant, the new place is his baby. He owns 54 percent of the
enterprise and is there almost every evening, usually not leaving
until after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The food certainly bears his imprint. Like Miles Davis playing a
muted trumpet solo, Seeger has stripped his cooking down to its
bare essentials. He offers a set five-course menu ($62) and
eight-course menu ($80) that stress the finest ingredients
presented crisply and simply in nouvelle-small portions. A recent
menu went from smoked salmon over a potato pancake to an onion tart
with pecan sauce to halibut poached in duck fat with bok choy to a
baked pear with vanilla sorbet and spiced red wine sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put 10 things on one plate,'' Seeger explains. ``This
is very personal cooking. That's why I'm not opening 10
restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone likes his Bauhaus style in the kitchen. Everytime
Seeger's has been mentioned in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's
dining columns, readers have e-mailed and written to dissent from
the praise. In a typical letter, Linda Valadez of Roswell, Ga.,
complained of leaving hungry and feeling ripped off.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one thing that rankles some diners, it's the charge
for Vittel bottled water. When Seeger's opened, the French water
was automatically brought to tables with no mention that it would
cost $3 a person. Seeger concedes that it was a mistake not to note
the charge on the menu, and he has since done so. But he has not
changed his mind about serving imported bottled water without
asking, instead of the domestic tap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know that the tap water in this town has more chlorine
than a swimming pool?'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs are paid to be food snobs, and Seeger takes his job very
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more than 3 million people in Atlanta. I cannot
please them all,'' he concludes. ``If that was what I wanted to do,
I would open a McDonald's.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   No one would mistake the kitchen at Seeger's for the Golden
Arches. It occupies two-thirds of the restaurant's space and
glistens with the latest equipment, including a custom-built Morice
stove from France that, at 6 by 9 feet, is larger than some
apartment kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is so beautiful and clean, it just blows my mind,''
says Nimma Osman, a Fayette County(Ga.) high school senior who
wants to be a chef and is helping out in the restaurant on
weekends. ``People tell me not to expect this in real life.''
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen is indeed like a fantasy stage, with windows on
three sides where guests can watch Seeger drizzle sauces and add
the last painterly touches to his dishes. His staff, most of them
barely half his age, treat him with deference. He often wears a
wireless head mike, like Madonna, so he can issue instructions to
them over speakers in the ceiling. They call for him when they need
fish or meat cut, a task that only he performs.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe maturity and a new family are mellowing him, but in the
course of this evening's dinner rush, Seeger's temper simmers over
only once. It happens when a platter of main courses sits for a
minute or so before a server picks it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is this halibut here?'' Seeger demands. ``What the hell is
happening!''
</P>
<P>
   Several voices murmur at once. ``Yes, chef. Yes, sir. Won't
happen again.'' You half-expect to see someone click heels and
salute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an artist, not a diplomat,'' says restaurant manager
Claude Guillaume, with a shrug. ``He raises his voice, but I have
never seen him throw anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And like a true artist, Seeger maintains total concentration. At
one point during the dinner bustle, a fire engine screams down West
Paces Ferry, and most of the heads in the kitchen involuntarily
turn to follow the flashing red lights. Not Seeger. He is hunched
over a plate, placing squab just so on a bed of sauteed spinach.
What matters is before him. He is in his kitchen, with his food,
engrossed in a world of his creation.

   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ On an apple-crisp fall day in the Savannah
National Wildlife Refuge, 10-foot alligators bask in the sun along
the banks of lazy tidal creeks that meander through the broad
freshwater marshes. A bald eagle soars overhead. Red-winged
blackbirds dart through stands of wild rice sagging with ripened
grain.
</P>
<P>
   With its freshwater marshes, bottom land hardwoods, tidal rivers
and creeks and fields of wild rice, the 26,400-acre refuge is one
of the most important wildlife preserves on the East Coast,
especially for migrating birds. Twenty-one species of warblers have
been seen here during fall migrations. During the winter, thousands
of ducks fill the refuge's impoundments, including the rarely seen
cinnamon teal, Eurasian wigeon and fulvous whistling duck.
</P>
<P>
   But the sanctuary is under threat, federal wildlife officials
and conservationists warn. A few miles downstream, the Georgia
Ports Authority is forging ahead with plans to deepen the Savannah
Harbor by 6 feet to accommodate a new generation of gigantic
container ships. The deepening would extend 26 miles up the
Savannah River from its mouth at the Atlantic to the Ports
Authority's terminals immediately upstream from Downtown Savannah.
The cost would be about $213 million, with about $143 million paid
by the federal government and the rest by the state. It would be
the fourth time since the late 1800s _ when the shipping channel
was 24 feet deep _ that the depth has been increased to float
ever-bigger ships.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the Savannah
refuge, says the new proposal would allow salt water to creep
several miles up the Savannah River and into the creeks and rivers
that beribbon the refuge. The salty water, the agency says, would
convert more than 1,100 acres of freshwater marsh into salty or
brackish wetlands, wiping out some of the the East Coast's largest
remaining fresh wetlands, which now support 64 bird species.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh marshes have a far greater diversity of plants and
animals than salt marshes, biologists say. Most waterfowl species
are dependent on these freshwater systems to provide the food
necessary to overwinter and prepare for the spring breeding season
</P>
<P>
   ``The deeper you dredge the shipping channel, the higher up the
river the salt water will come,'' Sam Drake, the refuge's manager,
said. ``The damage to this refuge would be irreparable.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he says endangered species like the shortnose
sturgeon could become extinct in the Savannah because of the
salinity. The river's once-abundant striped bass fishery, still
recovering from another project to maintain the shipping channel's
depth, could become only a memory.
</P>
<P>
   The Ports Authority wants to dredge Savannah's shipping channel
from its current 42 feet to 48 feet. The harbor is too shallow to
float the new breed of superships that dwarf the Titanic and
require deeper water, authority officials contend. More than a
dozen of those vessels already are plying the oceans. Others are
being built.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie McCurry, manager of legislative affairs for the Ports
Authority, said intensive environmental studies slated to begin
next year and mitigation plans will answer criticisms of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to have a project that kills all the fish and
destroys all the freshwater wetlands,'' he said. ``There are people
who assume that, but we are obligated to do otherwise.'' Any
environmental damage can be repaired or mitigated, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, as well as several conservation groups, dispute
that. They say the authority's mitigation plans as currently
conceived are unacceptable. ``They are seriously flawed,'' said Sam
Hamilton, director of the FWS' regional office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's agency doesn't have the power to stop the Ports
Authority's plan. But its objections carry considerable weight with
the EPA, which does. Under federal law, the EPA has the authority
to veto the project if it is not environmentally sound.
</P>
<P>
   While the EPA would not make such a decision until additional
environmental studies are completed _ which could take several more
months _ agency officials say they also have serious misgivings.
``The proposed mitigation measures will not adequately minimize or
compensate ... adverse impacts,'' says John Hankinson, EPA regional
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The Ports Authority says it would buy 3,000 acres of freshwater
marshes elsewhere and donate the property to the refuge to make up
for the 1,100 acres that would be wiped out by the deepening
project. But Hamilton and others say there is very little
freshwater marsh available for purchase, and the scarcity of such
wetlands makes it imperative that all the remaining marshes be
preserved.
</P>
<P>
   They note that the Savannah refuge contained about 6,000 acres
of freshwater marsh when it was established in 1927. By 1997, due
to the cumulative effects of deepening Savannah Harbor over the
decades, the marshlands had declined to 2,800 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed project would reduce the freshwater marsh acreage
to about 1,600 acres, or about 27 percent, of the original amount.
Drake points out that the refuge has never fully recovered from
another misguided effort by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1977 _
the building of a ``tide gate'' on a 605-foot-long concrete
spillway across the Back River, a tributary of the Savannah, to
maintain the water depth of the main shipping channel. The gate was
opened during the incoming tide, but was closed during the outgoing
tide. The water behind the gate was then forced into the main
shipping channel, where it helped prevent the buildup of silt and
reduce the need for dredging.
</P>
<P>
   But the tide gate also increased salinity levels in the refuge,
converting wide swaths of freshwater marsh into salt marsh and
killing scores of cypresses and other trees. The higher salinity
also almost wiped out the striped bass fishery in the Savannah
River, which once was home to the biggest populations of the fish
in Georgia and South Carolina and attracted legions of anglers.
Production of striped bass eggs declined by 95 percent after the
gate was installed.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the environmental damage, the corps ceased operating
the tide gate in 1990. Since then, some of the freshwater marshes
have recovered. The striped bass fishery has perked up, though not
yet fully rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when we thought the refuge would begin to recover from
the tide gate, this deepening project comes along,'' Drake said.
``It just never stops; it's a constant battle to protect this
refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Savannah refuge is the second Georgia wildlife preserve to
be threatened by outside projects in as many years. The Fish and
Wildlife Service and conservationists have been battling the DuPont
Co. over its proposal to strip mine 38,000 acres next to the famed
Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge in South Georgia for titanium
ore.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont officials say the mining could be done safely without
harm to the swamp, but Fish and Wildlife officials _ as well as
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt _ say there is no way the company
can guarantee that. Babbitt has asked DuPont to abandon its plans;
the company is still studying its options. The Savannah Harbor
proposal, which would deepen 26 miles of the shipping channel up
the Savannah River, also has made strange bedfellows out of some
old enemies _ the huge corporations whose plants pollute the river
and the environmentalists who have historically battled them. One
of those firms, the Union Camp Corp., whose sprawling Savannah
paper mill ranks as one of Georgia's biggest polluters, is worried
that the deepening project would cause further degradation of the
Savannah River and force the firm to increase its treatment of
waste water at considerably higher expense.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental concerns aside, some shipping industry experts say
the Ports Authority is embarking on an economic folly: There is no
certainty, they say, that the super container ships will ever call
regularly at Savannah on a regular basis. ``I've read the Ports
Authority's (economic study) for this project, and it is ludicrous
to think this deepening can be justified,'' said Fred K. Peeples,
chairman of a holding company that owns three marine terminal
facilities at Savannah. ``The environmental damage would outweigh
the economic benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ports Authority, however, says increasing the harbor's depth
to 48 feet is the key to the future economic viability of the port
of Savannah, the nation's 10th busiest container ship port. Driving
the authority is the never-ending competition among ports to
accommodate bigger ships carrying more cargo. Shipping companies
constantly look for ports deep enough to accept their bigger ships,
and Savannah aims to make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah is competing to be named one of three ``megaport hubs''
on the Eastern Seaboard. Ports in New York and Virginia likely have
a lock on the other two slots in the new ``hub-and-spoke'' system _
similar to how airlines operate _ that is being devised for East
Coast ports to accommodate the new breed of container ships.
</P>
<P>
   Ports that don't make the list will be relegated to ``feeder''
status, transporting smaller amounts of cargo to the large ports
for shipment overseas. Ports Authority officials say port traffic
in Savannah could drop by nearly 50 percent if Savannah Harbor does
not achieve ``hub'' status.
</P>
<P>
   Without the project, Savannah ``will be far behind the other
ports,'' said Owen Wu, vice president of the Evergreen America
Corp., one of the major shippers that calls at Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Ports Authority, the port of Savannah was
directly or indirectly responsible for 67,636 jobs in 1997 in
Georgia, including workers in the state's major industries _
carpet, timber, agriculture, mining _ that ship their products
through the Savannah. On almost any day, thousands of tons of
kaolin from mines in Middle Georgia, tons of carpets from mills in
Dalton and paper products from coastal mills are loaded onto ships
for export. Altogether, 8,799,866 tons of cargo moved through
Savannah in fiscal year 1998, which ended June 30. That's a 4.3
percent increase over the previous fiscal year. A total of 1,546
vessels called at the port.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other businesses, including Wal-Mart and Home Depot,
import thousands of products through Savannah. The Atlanta-based
Home Depot, for instance, opened a 1.4 million-square-foot
distribution center at the port last year to distribute imported
products to stores all over the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah's closest competitor for megaport status is Charleston,
S.C., which is deepening its harbor from 40 to 45 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah's port has undergone several deepening projects to keep
up with its competitors. Near the turn of the century, the port,
including parts of the main shipping channel, was still littered
with the wrecks of scuttled ironclads and other ships destroyed
during the hasty Confederate evacuation of Savannah in 1864, as
Sherman's troops bore down on the city.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1896, a 24-foot-deep channel was dredged and most of
the obstructions removed, signaling the beginning of an effort to
diversify the cargo passing through the port.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, the Georgia Ports Authority was formed, and dredging
deepened the harbor to 38 feet to accommodate the bigger ships
exporting pulp, paper, paperboard and other products produced by
the sprawling mills that had sprung up along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Container ships first became prevalent in the 1960s, with
maximum drafts of 23 feet to 26 feet and carrying capacities of 600
to 1,000 container units. A 20-foot-container unit, or TEU, is an
industry term referring to a standard 20-foot-long container.
</P>
<P>
   One TEU is the standard container hauled by semitrailer trucks.
</P>
<P>
   As worldwide trade grew, so did the size of container ships, due
to technological advances. Shipping experts say the larger ships
save money because they carry the same size crews as their smaller
counterparts but use fuel more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the bigger ships, the Savannah Harbor was dredged
to a 42-foot depth in 1994. But even at that level, more than half
of all the container ships that now call on Savannah are so big
they they either have to ride in at high tide when the harbor depth
rises to 49.5 feet, or carry less cargo. Carriers lose money when
their ships haul smaller loads or have to be anchored at sea
waiting for high tide.
</P>
<P>
   Now, container ships with maximum drafts of 47.5 feet, which can
carry more than 6,000 TEUs, are sailing. The Regina Maersk,
operated by the Denmark-based Maersk Line, is being used as the
ship model for the deepening of the Savannah Harbor. At 135 feet
wide and 1,043 feet long _ longer than the Eiffel Tower is tall _
the 2-year-old Regina is the biggest container ship ever to call at
a U.S. port. When fully laden, it has a draft of 47.5 feet but
requires safe navigation water depths up to 52 feet _ ships must
have at least a 4-foot safety zone between their hulls and the
riverbed.
</P>
<P>
   At 48 feet deep, Savannah's shipping channel depth would
increase to about 55.5 feet at high tide, buoying the Regina in
enough water for safe navigation when the tide is right. The lower
depth also would allow the smaller container ships unrestricted
access to the harbor even at lower tides.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of the superships are in service, and more are being
built. The Ports Authority had hoped to have the deepening project
under way early the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Ports Authority has spent millions in state funds to study
the feasibility of deepening the Savannah Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups, however, say no number of studies may be able to
convince them of the environmental and economic soundness of the
project. One criticism is that the Ports Authority put the project
on an unusual ``fast-track'' process, rushing to submit the
proposal for congressional authorization before its benefits or
environmental impacts could be sufficiently assessed.
</P>
<P>
   The result was environmental and economic feasibility studies
thicker than an Atlanta residential phone book riddled with
``serious flaws,'' said Wesley Woolf of the Southern Environmental
Law Center's Atlanta office. ``There is no way to determine from
these documents what the true environmental and economic impacts
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and more than a
dozen other conservation groups _ and even some shippers _ agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought for a minute that this project would benefit
Savannah, I would not hesitate to support it,'' said Frank Peeples,
whose company owns three shipping terminals in the port city. ``But
I don't see how (the Ports Authority) can expect us to swallow what
they have come up with.''

 &HT;    Wolfe and the Watch sign off
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar, Lyle Harris and Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tom Wolfe said buh-bye to the City Too Busy to Stop
Buying His Book on Friday with a last-minute signing at Hartsfield
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has really been a great time, despite all the people who
said I was trying to burn Atlanta,'' the author said after putting
his florid signature on about 100 copies of ``A Man in Full'' for
fans queued up at Waterstone's Booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was wonderful. And of course I'll be back, because I
have a lot of friends here now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe's wife, Sheila, stood in the background sipping a
Starbucks coffee and effusing about her hubby's latest roman a
clef.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book was much better than anything he's written before,''
said the she-Wolfe, dressed in all black to her husband's trademark
all-white get-up. ``The characters were much more sympathetic, and
it was more psychological than `Bonfire (of the Vanities).' ''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local real estate developer Taz Anderson is somewhat
less impressed with ``A Man in Full.'' He's reviewing the weighty
tome for the Atlanta Business Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's qualification: He comes pretty close to being a clone
of Wolfe's ``man in full,'' fictional developer Charlie Croker.
He's the right age, has the same bum knees and is a former Georgia
Tech football player.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson says there's a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie's got one artificial knee, and I've got two,'' laughed
Anderson when we rang him up.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a preview of the review: While Anderson admits that
Croker is ``a pretty neat guy in the end,'' he's not especially
thrilled with Wolfe's other depictions of his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta has certainly been mischaracterized in the book,''
Anderson says. ``That's not Atlanta today. His assessment might
have been accurate 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, folks, we terminate our Wolfe Watch. We'd love to
keep it going, but the guy's left town. And we need the space for
Elton John anyway . . .
</P>
<P>
   Easy, writer
</P>
<P>
   According to the Washington newspaper Roll Call, actor Dennis
Hopper is a Newt Gingrich fan. ``You are a great statesman,'' he
told the retiring House speaker in a letter. ``Your confrontations
will be missed, your resignation saddens me. When you want to run
for President, I will be there. You have done so much more than
anyone in a long time for our country. Make some money, have a
life, come back,

 &HT;    Making (air) waves
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino and Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's 1980. Twenty-two-year-old Vikki Locke is sitting
in a reception room at a Cleveland radio station, waiting nervously
for her first job interview. The door to the boss's office is flung
open and a young woman screams ``Screw you!'' A man shoots back,
``Screw you! Get out. You're fired!''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is literally happening right in front of me,'' Locke
recalls, her ice-blue eyes still wide from the memory. ``Then he
looks at me and says, `Are you my 2 o'clock?' And I nod yeah. Then
he looks at the other girl and, I truly believe to spite her, turns
to me and says, `You got the job.' '' Thus Locke became one of two
women in a 14-person news department at the radio station, covering
fires and car crashes. She says she also got her boss's coffee,
picked up laundry for his wife, worked 90 hours a week and was paid
no overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to six years later. Leslie Fram had grown up in
Fairhope, Ala., ear glued to the fuzzy fabric speaker on her
parents' ``Bonanza''-era stereo console, slowly turning the dial to
pick up rock stations from faraway Chicago or New Orleans. It
didn't matter that she did not hear one female voice in between the
songs, `` 'cause I was a radio junkie and I knew this is what I
wanted to do,'' she says. But even that didn't prepare her for her
first job in 1986 at a tiny AM Top 40 station in Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boss took me out for a cup of coffee,'' she remembers.
``And the very first thing he said to me was, `I have to be honest
with you. I've never liked women on the air.' '' In spite of the
less than supportive introduction, Fram worked the graveyard shift,
persistently asking her boss for advice. ``I remember he listened
to one of my tapes, threw it across the table and said, `You
haven't improved one bit,' '' she laughs. ``That was my
introduction to radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironic. Today, Locke and Fram are two of the most powerful
players in the Atlanta radio market, the 12th-largest in the
country and once a men-only arena. Locke is half of the Steve &AMP;
Vikki morning team at Top 40 station Star 94; Fram is program
director of modern rock station 99X and one-third of the morning
team of Barnes, Leslie &AMP; Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is not television, where female anchors such as
Brenda Wood at WAGA and Monica Kaufman at WSB have come to dominate
salaries and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, no females host a major morning-drive show on their
own. When they do appear in the mornings, such as V-103's former
co-host Carol Blackmon, they are often relegated to second-degree
status. (Blackmon's situation recently turned ugly when her
decade-old show was dismantled by management and she disappeared in
a messy exit after claiming her co-host Mike Roberts received a
better severance deal.)
</P>
<P>
   There are only two female program directors on major stations
here, and one female general manager _ Mary Catherine Sneed at rap
station Hot 97.5).
</P>
<P>
   But while the road up the dial has not exactly been static-free,
strong-willed women have become a growing force in the field in the
'90s, and their touch is often shaping what listeners hear when
they flip on their radios in Atlanta. As commuters trek from
downtown offices to the suburbs, they can hear Z93's Kaedy Kiely
serve up classic rock. Melissa Summers keeps company middays as the
host of her own show at adult R&AMP;B station Kiss 104.7. Moby may be
the name on the billboard, but salty Deborah Richards has been the
female voice behind the man in the mornings _ five of them _ at
country station Kicks 101.5 for 15 years. Spunky Dallas McCade
spins country music solo on Y-106.7 middays. So does Mara Davis at
classic rock station Z93. WSB consumer adviser Clark Howard heads
the top-rated afternoon drive show in town, but he does it with the
help of a staff of six women, headed by the sweetly aggressive Kim
Curley. Even Atanta's favorite liberal-basher, Neal Boortz, doesn't
take a phone call unless it's first screened by his
producer/planner Belinda Skelton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's a tough field for women,'' Richards says, winding
down after spending the morning reading the news at Kicks 101.5 and
laughing at Moby. ``The business is still dominated by men; you're
dealing mostly with men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a boy's club,'' Locke agrees. ``Once you know how to get
in, you're fine. It's kind of like you've got to be better than the
rest. Better than the boys. I still blush to this day, but when the
guys push my buttons, I dish it back and they back off. I had to
take off that naive side. You have to be aggressive. This is your
job, and you either do it or get out.''
</P>
<P>
   The business has come a long way in 30 years. Back in the '60s,
when every teenager in town had their dial set to Atlanta's first
rock station, WQXI-AM (Quixie in Dixie), not one woman disc jockey
manned a mike. In 1971, prompted by a lawsuit from the National
Organization for Women, the FCC issued rules requiring TVand radio
broadcasting companies to actively recruit women. As a result,
female voices began infiltrating the airwaves, first in the news
and public service departments, and eventually as disc jockeys. But
most were relegated to the role of giggly girl sidekick to a
higher-paid and higher-profile man.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember back when Gary McKee was doing mornings at 94Q
(Atlanta's top FM rock station in the '70s), and Yetta Levitt was
on the show,'' Richards says, ``Levitt was one of Atlanta's first
female jocks who carved out a significant reputation for herself
with listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put up this big billboard in Buckhead that said, `McKee
Makes the Mornings.' I think maybe Yetta ragged him on the air
about it, so somebody went up there and put in tiny little print:
`And Yetta too.' ''
</P>
<P>
   By the '80s, inspired by women such as New York's ``Nightbird''
Alison Steele, a bolder generation of females began breaking down
barriers that traditionally had prevented them from landing primo
spots on the air. One was Kiely, a gutsy Emory Universtiy(Ga.)
student who wanted to go into broadcasting because she loved rock
'n' roll. ``It was 1981, and 96rock was the station at that time,''
she says. ``I sent in a tape and a cover letter, and I said right
up front, `You don't have a single woman on the air.' It made them
listen to my tape, and that's how I got in the door.'' The hard
rock station hired Kiely as its first female jock, and eventually
she was given the lucrative afternoon drive shift.
</P>
<P>
   Even though barriers began softening, illogical taboos were _
and still are _ rampant in the industry. Until Z93 put Kiely in
afternoon drive following Mara Davis, 29, who holds down the 10
a.m. to 3 p.m. midday shift, few radio stations would put women
jocks back to back. Davis points out today that ``it even used to
be that radio would never play two female artists in a row,''
reflecting a widely held industry belief that women prefer
listening to guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my very first boss told me, `Women don't want to
hear women's voices,' '' Locke says. ``I said, `Show me the
statistics. Back it up. I want to see the stats. And he never did.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-secretive world of salaries is also a challenge for
women in radio. Few, if any, have attained the paychecks of top
morning men such as Moby ($400,000 a year plus), former V-103 host
Roberts (reported to be in the same range) or Steve McCoy, who _
yes _ makes more money than Locke. She is super-protective of her
co-host, pointing out that he has been in the business longer and
that it was ``The Steve McCoy Show'' when she arrived. When pressed
about the issue, she only laughs and says, ``Well, you know where
he lives (tony Country Club of the South), and I live in a Torrey
home.'' (Torrey, endorsed on the air by Locke, builds homes in the
$200,000 range).
</P>
<P>
   Locke, however, has apparently joined the ranks of women who
have learned how to negotiate with swagger and spit. ``I say more
power to anybody who can get it,'' Locke says. ``When my contract
came up, I went in and was gutsy and said, `This is what I want.'
I'm treated very well.'' Another trailblazer is ``Atlanta's
Girlfriend,'' Summers, 30. When her contract came up for renewal at
her former home, top-rated urban station V-103, Summers did
something few women in Atlanta radio have attempted: She hired an
attorney to negotiate the deal for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it was very unusual, what I did,'' she says, taking a
break from her midday show at adult R&AMP;B station Kiss 104.7. ``A lot
of the time we're not treated the same when it comes to pay. We're
not very aggressive. We don't go after what we feel is our just
due, and then we're just going to get what's offered. The men don't
have to fight as hard for the same things. When I went through my
negotiations, I went in as a businessperson, not as a woman. I
didn't take anything personally, and a lot of women don't know how
to take that kind of control. They (management at V-103) weren't
used to dealing with a woman like that. More women would learn to
be more effective and get more of what they want if they could
learn how to deal with men, with their egos.''
</P>
<P>
   When the dust settled, Summers jumped ship to the competition,
nearly doubling her salary.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone concedes, however, that salaries are still
largely disproportionate between men and women in the industry.
According to a recent survey by the trade publication Radio &AMP;
Records, the average yearly salary for a general manager in the
Atlanta market (virtually males-only) is $286,000. Morning drive
hosts, mostly guys, earn an average of $195,000 a year. Evening
disc jockeys (often the domain of women) are paid about $55,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to think we have progressed as a society where
those things don't matter as much as they once did,'' says Gary
Lewis, the general manager who put Kiely and Davis into key
positions at classic rock station Z93. ``A lot of this is a
holdover from the days when people considered having women on the
radio avant-garde. But that was the way it was. It was the radio
landscape, just as it was the TV landscape. You had
Huntley-Brinkley and Walter Cronkite. Women were a novelty. But as
doors opened, they got to practice their craft the way men had been
able to do for years, and they began to distinguish themselves. You
are starting to see the results today.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the issue of sexual discrimination. Anyone who has
watched New York shock-jock Howard Stern rub oil on a bare
stripper's butt (which he does regularly on his syndicated show,
which airs nightly on the E! entertainment channel) knows radio is
still often built on blatant misogyny. And sometimes that spills
over into the inner workings of business, affecting the way women
employees are treated on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one has made headlines in Atlanta's conservative
climate, a few women here have filed complaints against their male
co-workers, though most suits are settled quietly before they ever
go to court. The stories are rampant throughout the industry.
There's the one about the female sales director who forced the
ouster of the general manager for calling her a ``stupid bitch'' in
front of co-workers. One female morning personality quietly left
her station, with a check in return for her silence, after citing
verbal abuse from management.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, longtime morning jock Blackmon _ half of the
top-rated morning show at V-103 _ cried foul when her partner, Mike
Roberts, received what she claims was a better settlement from
station management when their show was dissolved.
</P>

   ``Without getting into specifics, there was a gross disparity in
our packages and treatment,'' Blackmon says of the severance deals.
``Even though I was acting and working outside of a contract,
still, I don't think that should eliminate fair treatment. Where
the time frame for (severence) payments was months for me, it was
more than a year for Mike. . . . I've had sisters from other
markets calling me and asking, `How do you deal with this? How do
you stand up to this kind of treatment?' ''
</P>
<P>
   However, Blackmon concedes that her situation, like those of
many of her female counterparts, is rooted in the very history of
the show. ``The reality is, when I came on the show, it had already
been established as Mike's show. The first few years, it was `The
Mike Roberts in the Morning Show With Carol Blackmon.' The name
even suggested it was an afterthought. It eventually changed into
`The Mike &AMP; Carol Show,' but I'd be lying if I didn't say he was,
in many ways, looked at as the cornerstone of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in spite of having her face plastered on MARTA buses
alongside Roberts', Blackmon says, ``I made less than half of what
he made. Far less.''
</P>
<P>
   V-103 general manager Rick Caffey could not be reached for
comment on Blackmon's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the age-old dilemma of the woman as sidekick,'' says
Richards, who plays straight gal to the irreverent Moby at country
station Kicks 101.5. ``The morning man wants your loyalty to be to
him, but you're torn between your loyalty to the show and your
loyalty to the station. So, when there's a break, the station will
either perceive you as their person, or the team's person. I think
she (Blackmon) probably got stuck in that same thing. It's like
``Mike &AMP; Fill in Name of Female.''
</P>
<P>
   As in many other fields, the first women in radio were often so
appreciative of their very existence in the studio that they put up
with gross behavior that wouldn't be tolerated today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear stories,'' laughs WSB's Kim Curley, who has produced
both the Clark Howard and Neal Boortz shows. ``Back in the '70s,
radio was the kind of place where drugs were done on tables and
people had sex in production rooms, but it's not like that anymore.
There are still some guys around with that mentality, but they're
dinosaurs. That kind of attitude just isn't tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the biggest thing we fight is the number of women out
there who would gladly grant sexual favors to get where they are
going in this business,'' she says. ``It makes all women look like
bimbos.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of the dozens of women interviewed for this article said
they feel like they have experienced sexual harassment in the
workplace. But that testimony may stem from the fact that women in
radio often have a very broad view of just what constitutes abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever treated me that way,'' says Kiely, who has spent
more than a decade in rock radio. ``I think there were some of
those experiences, but it's the way you view it. It's the nature of
the environment. There used to be a lot of partying, wining and
dining, lots of drinking, but the environment has changed very
much. I never ran into a situation where some guy said, `I'll give
you that if you do this.' I never had someone grab my butt or tell
me to do something to get where I am. I have never been treated
with anything but respect from the men around me.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything seems to be the driving force behind opportunity for
women in radio today, it's the almighty dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Norm Schrutt, the gruff industry veteran who ran Kicks 101.5 for
nearly two decades and now is a talent agent, puts it this way:
``Managers really don't care if you're male, female, white or black
as long as they get an audience. Program directors and management
have realized that talent is talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Z93's midday jock Davis concurs. ``There's no difference between
men and women when it comes to numbers. When you're getting
ratings, you're getting ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s, radio's response to women opened up significantly
when the Arbitron books showed they could pull in listeners. More
women in Atlanta listen to Vikki Locke in the morning than any
other DJ. On a national level, Dr. Laura Schlessinger has become
one of the country's top talk hosts, propelling stations like WSB
to the top of the ratings pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio is like any other industry. It follows the money,''
Richards says. ``As women become more conspicuous and desirable as
consumers, they become more desirable as decision makers and
performers in the business. The only reason women have come as far
as they have is because they now have power as consumers. It has
never been an issue of sex. It has always been an issue of money.
But guess who buys the cars? Guess who makes airline reservations?
Radio has figured that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Strolling through a 99X corridor lined with glass-encased CDs of
the nation's top rock acts, Fram has risen on the tide of high
ratings to be one of the most respected people in Atlanta radio.
Not only does the tiny powerhouse hold down the morning show (with
the antics of Jimmy Baron and Steve Barnes) but she is the
station's program director and ambassador to the community through
endless personal appearances. But she always makes it a point to
add one other task to her plate at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get letters or e-mails from girls who are interested in
doing this, I respond to every one of them,'' she says. ``I feel
like it's my responsibility, because when I grew up, I didn't have
one single role model. I can't tell you how lucky I feel; I have
the best job in the world. It's not really a male vs. female thing
anymore. It's being able to go out and fight for what you
believe.''

 &HT;    Skewed scholarship: Stewartian theories lose out to Roseanne
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The City by the Bay has many charms, enough that the assistant
professors and graduate students gathering there next month can do
without Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   This is quite a surprise. Roseanne is worth their time, but
Martha Stewart is not?
</P>
<P>
   Each December, the Modern Language Association _ the
professional organization for college English teachers and graduate
students _ holds what amounts to a freak show-cum-job fair. When
the MLA convenes in San Francisco, there will be the usual strange
goings-on, but they couldn't be stranger than those of eight years
ago. The MLA met in Chicago that year, and the Windy City, hog
butcher to the world, stacker of wheat, stormy, husky, brawling,
witnessed a spectacle for which Carl Sandburg would have found no
words. The halls of the Hyatt Regency resounded with discourse on
hegemony and homophobia _ staple topics at the MLA _ and a man
named Michael Moon presided over a session on sodomy as seen from a
literary perspective. Friends tell me it was the best MLA ever.
</P>
<P>
   Dissecting Martha
</P>
<P>
   You're never prepared for what the humanities departments are
into these days. Roseanne, the subject of a paper at this year's
MLA (``This Is My Life: Roseanne, Celebrity and the Poetics of
Women's Autobiography''), is serious scholarship in the English
department. You'd think Martha Stewart would be riper yet. When
Kyla Wazana, a doctoral candidate at Stanford University, and Zoe
Newman, a graduate student at the University of Toronto, sounded
the call for MLA papers earlier this year, their language made a
familiar clang and clatter. ``Our panel,'' they wrote, ``seeks to
consider the following questions:
</P>
<P>
   ``How does Stewart's work serve to construct notions of
whiteness and middle-class heterosexual identity?
</P>
<P>
   ``How is Stewart produced by the culture of late capitalism?
</P>
<P>
   ``What would (literary theorist) Judith Butler make of Stewart's
aggressively heterosexual performance?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do camp parodies of Stewart represent queer subversions of
dominant discourses?
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the function of nostalgia in Martha Stewart? Is it an
`imperialist nostalgia' in (theorist) Renato Rosaldo's sense of the
term?
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the significance of Stewart's aesthetic of cleanliness
and perfection? Bearing in mind (Anne) McClintock's work in
`Imperialist Leather,' what is the connection between 19th century
discourses of dirt and purity and Stewart's postmodern urban
aesthetic?''
</P>
<P>
   Not even Tom Wolfe could satirize this. ``Imperialist Leather''
. . . Dirt and purity . . . Queer subversions of dominant
discourses. This is self-parody that doesn't know how good it is.
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea Martha Stewart was so ``aggressively
heterosexual.'' Neither did I know she was part of the life cycle
of capitalism, which always seems to be at the point of rigor
mortis without ever quite giving up the ghost. I was in graduate
school 30 years ago and the sociologists and political scientists
were ready to pull the plug even then. You want to ask, ``Is the
thing going to die or not?'' How is it that the English professors,
of all people, are now the pathologists?
</P>
<P>
   A `learning' experience?
</P>
<P>
   But Martha Stewart, prime material though she is, missed the cut
for this year's MLA. ``There was some question about what you would
learn from it,'' Phyllis Franklin, the MLA's executive director,
told The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Never has that been a consideration at the MLA before, and it's
not stopping young academics from plowing ahead with books and
treatises on Stewart. ``She represents the parvenu class entering
the leisure class,'' Linda Robertson of Hobart and William Smith
Colleges told the Times.
</P>
<P>
   Well, so what? A lot of people fill that vague role and roles
like it. Why study them? Why write papers and books about them?
</P>
<P>
   One answer _ frequently given _ is that there's no need for a
40th book on the structure of Milton's ``Paradise Lost.'' The
humanities led themselves to a dead end and turned off the engine.
Insecure about their standing in an age of science, they began
whipping up ``theory.'' They began speaking and writing in a
strange tongue, and younger adepts began to invest anything in
sight with profound significance.
</P>
<P>
   Even floral arrangements and bed linens. One young scholar,
reverting briefly to her native English, wrote of the meaning of
Martha: ``You're born on a sheet and you die on a sheet.'' Now
that's lovely. It has the ring of poetry, if not the weight of
theory.
</P>
<P>
   When the MLA told Kyla Wazana and Zoe Newman, ``Not this year,''
no one was more let down than the subject herself. ``I sighed a
little sigh of relief that finally someone, maybe in a kind of
overreaction, was taking me a little seriously,'' Stewart told the
Times.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't think to ask if anyone took them seriously.

 &HT;    Tennessee history set to go round and round
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson

<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Red Grooms puts the merry in merry-go-round.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his gigantic installations, the ebullient Nashville
native has been taking the starch out of the New York art scene
since he moved to Manhattan in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday in Nashville,Grooms will unveil a rowdy tribute to his
hometown: a carousel crowded with a cheerfully grotesque parade of
characters from Tennessee's past and present. Located just blocks
from the Ryman Auditorium in the heart of the city's entertainment
district, the Tennessee Fox Trot Carousel promises to become a
hybrid of low and high art, tourist attraction and history lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks absolutely unique,'' said a boggled Earle Howard as
he stood recently in Riverfront Park. The retired physician,
visiting from Colorado, watched workers move among the multicolored
figures, adjusting machinery and buffing Andrew Jackson's
fiberglass coattails. A few poles over from Jackson was a resinous
Davy Crocket, locked in combat with a roaring bear. ``I've never
seen anything like it,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 36 figures chasing one another in this
three-dimensional frieze, which is packed and layered with visual
puns. Bluesman Leroy Carr is seen stepping out of the horn of a
huge Victrola, fingering a keyboard that floats mysteriously in
space. (The 78-rpm record on the turntable is his hit ``Aggravatin'
Papa.'') The Goo Goo Boy bares a cavernous mouthful of
shoe-box-size teeth as he prepares to bite into the time-honored
Nashville treat.
</P>
<P>
   Children who want to tour with country music queen Kitty Wells
can climb onto the back of her wheelie-popping tour bus; a
crown-wearing likeness of Kitty emerges from the front, strumming a
guitar. (The real Kitty Wells recently dropped by the construction
site and approvingly autographed her image.)
</P>
<P>
   How does the artist like people sitting on his art? ``I love the
idea,'' said Grooms, 59, from his Manhattan studio. ``I like that
intimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some notable Tennesseans and their families
weren't thrilled to be immortalized as beasts of burden and forbade
the use of their likenesses. ``It turns out that not everybody
thinks it's such a great memorial, being a carousel figure,'' said
Grooms, who couldn't talk the families of Roy Acuff and Minnie
Pearl into participating.
</P>
<P>
   Grooms first visualized this interactive sculpture in 1993, as
the center of a country-themed amusement park he wanted to call
Redville. Grooms and Nashville wheel Will Byrd, who produces
concerts and events including the yearly Fan Fair, approached Mayor
Phil Bredesen, and the trio focused the idea into a single
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   During the intervening years, Grooms and assistant Tom
Burckhardt moved from sketches to Styrofoam models. A Brooklyn,
N.Y., carousel company called Fabricon created molds from the
sculptures, then cast the figures out of resins and fiberglass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aesthetically, this is beyond anything I've ever done
before,'' said Fabricon chief Marvin Sylvor, showing a visitor into
the prefabricated metal pavilion that shelters the outdoor
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Grooms' 90-year-old mother, Wilhelmina Grooms of Nashville,
contributed some start-up money. Then Byrd's wife, Trudy, began
seeking private contributions to pay the $1.8 million cost of the
finished attraction, persuading companies and individuals to
sponsor figures at $50,000 a pop. Bredesen, a self-made
millionaire, contributed $100,000 of his own money, sponsoring the
Andrew Jackson figure and also the Chigger, a scary depiction of
Tennessee's noisome insect.
</P>
<P>
   The city also offered a 40-year lease on a prime piece of real
estate on the Cumberland River for a dollar a year. Bredesen sees
the carousel as uniquely Nashville, a nonprofit attraction that
will become as much a part of the city's visual character as the
Arch in St. Louis or the Cyclorama in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Cyclorama, this is artwork you can climb on and
ride. A ticket will cost $1.50, and patrons will be serenaded by
hurdy-gurdy versions of ``The Tennessee Waltz,'' ``Hey, Good
Lookin''' and other country hits.
</P>
<P>
   Grooms, who will fly down for the opening, fell in love with the
carnival as a lad and enjoyed creating an art object that would
separate the marks from their cash. ``To get people to cough up
their money to see stuff is fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The carousel should generate $225,000 per year, with $100,000 of
that earmarked to support the arts in Nashville and the rest slated
for management and operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the reigning humorist in American art by The New York
Times, Grooms exudes the kind of whimsy appropriate for the city
that gave us the Grand Ole Opry, says Bredesen. ``A lot of people
in Nashville take their art very seriously, and if it's not painted
by an impressionist they don't want to hear about it,'' he said.
``This is an interesting way to tweak that side of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   At 48 feet in diameter, the carousel is Grooms' biggest single
project, even bigger than the Ruckus Manhattan environment that was
recently displayed in Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   As such, it's a priceless piece of public art. Yet the children
who are magnetically drawn to hop onto Chet Atkins and his flying
Gibson guitar, or sit behind the wheel of the Jersey-spotted Purity
milk truck (the horn goes ``moo''), provide the kind of endorsement
Grooms values most.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at it as an art project,'' said Byrd, ``and Red keeps
talking about it as a kiddie ride.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Foxtrot Carousel opens to the public with a brief
ceremony at 10 a.m. EST Friday Information: 615-242-5546.

METS TRADE A CATCHER NOT NAMED HUNDLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets traded their backup catcher Friday. And no,
he was not Todd Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   As general manager Steve Phillips pointed out, Hundley is not
considered a backup. How long the former all-star catcher will
remain with the Mets, though, is anybody's guess, as the Mets and
Baltimore Orioles attempt to work out a deal for him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Phillips dealt Jorge Fabregas to the Florida Marlins
for Oscar Henriquez, a hard-throwing right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   For Fabregas, 28, who grew up in Miami, the Marlins will be the
fifth organization he has been with in the last three years. After
being acquired by the Mets from the Arizona Diamondbacks with
Willie Blair in the Bernard Gilkey deal at the July 31 trading
deadline last season, Fabregas hit .188 in 20 games as Mike
Piazza's backup.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6-inch Henriquez was one of three players the Houston
Astros traded to Florida for Moises Alou before last season.
Henriquez, 24, was 0-0 with an 8.55 earned run average in 15 games
for Florida and 1-0 with a 2.56 ERA and 11 saves for Class AAA
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big power pitcher,'' Phillips said of Henriquez, adding
that the pitcher will have to earn his way onto the Mets' roster.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Hundley will probably be elsewhere. ``I'm not locked
into any date or deadline,'' Phillips said when asked when a trade
would be made.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's backup now, Phillips said, is Todd Pratt or Vance
Wilson. And Hundley? ``Even if he's there,'' Phillips said, ``Todd
is too good a player to be portrayed as a backup.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is apparently working on a deal with Milwaukee for
second baseman Fernando Vina, a Mets utilityman in 1994 who came
into his own last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers are believed to have asked for the right-handed
pitching prospect Octavio Dotel and outfielder Jay Payton. The Mets
are believed to be more likely to part with Payton than with Dotel,
but Phillips said neither player was certain to be included in any
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Mets are trying to trade for a second baseman, they
have yet to hold serious discussions with the representative for
the free-agent third baseman Robin Ventura. Phillips did speak
Friday with Ventura's agent, John Boggs, but apparently told him
that he wanted to see how some other developments played out before
making any offer.
</P>
<P>
   One possible development involves the free-agent outfielder B.J.
Surhoff, who has been seeking a guaranteed fourth year in any
contract offer from the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not changed any offer today to Surhoff,'' Phillips
said. And so the Mets, who have offered Surhoff a three-year deal
for $17.25 million, apparently must wait for Surhoff to visit the
Pittsburgh Pirates on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Brian Jordan. Phillips indicated he had been
hoping to talk with Jordan's agent, Jim Turner, but had been unable
to do so.

 &HT;    Fagan pays to get seized Bentley back
 &HT;    By George Bennett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ After sitting six months beneath a
special $500 cover in a Florida Highway Patrol garage, kidnap
defendant and Palm Beach socialite Stephen Fagan's $100,000 Bentley
was returned to its owner Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan regained the maroon sedan with its Mar-a-Lago Club
windshield sticker as part of a settlement in which he paid FHP
$12,500 and let the state keep a 1998 Honda Accord that was seized
along with the Bentley in May, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   FHP considered the cars contraband because Fagan falsely
registered them as ``William S. Martin,'' the alias he used after
taking his daughters from his ex-wife in a 1979 Massachusetts
custody fight.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan disputed the contraband characterization and argued the
seizure was unconstitutionally excessive because title fraud
carries a maximum $5,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, in which Fagan admits no wrongdoing, has not yet
been filed at the county courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   FHP General Counsel Jon Whitney said the state settled because
the constitutional issues raised by Fagan could have led to years
of litigation and appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan declined comment. His attorney, Douglas Duncan, called the
agreement ``just a simple economic decision for Mr. Fagan to
resolve this matter and concentrate on the case in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's attorney said the settlement will allow his client to
focus on his kidnapping defense in Massachusetts. Fagan has
maintained his innocence, saying he snatched his daughters to
rescue them from abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's next court appearance on the Massachusetts kidnap
charges is scheduled for Dec. 4. The Bentley is a 1997 Brooklands
model purchased for $134,000 last year. At the time it was
confiscated, it had 846 miles on the odometer and Fagan was in the
process of selling it to Braman Motorcars for $100,000. Duncan did
not know his client's current plans for the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan bought the Bentley for $134,000 in 1997 and was in the
process of selling it to Braman Motorcars for $100,000 when FHP
seized it. FHP bought a $500 cover made of a breathable DuPont
fabric to protect the car in storage. As part of the settlement,
Fagan was given the cover after reimbursing FHP for its cost.

DESPITE COURT ORDER, JERSEY CITY TEACHERS STRIKE FOR SECOND DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ Teachers here defied a judge's back-to-work
order Friday and extended their strike to a second day, crippling
the state's second largest school district, where five public high
schools were closed and grammar schools were open only half a day.
</P>
<P>
   The attendance rate at grammar schools was 30 percent, down from
the usual 90 percent, district officials said. But the day was
relatively peaceful compared with Thursday, when several schools
descended into chaos because there were too few substitute teachers
to supervise the students.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the trouble Thursday _ including fights in the hallways,
students overturning furniture and throwing bricks and bottles, and
the looting and vandalizing of businesses _ occurred in and around
the high schools.
</P>
<P>
   School officials returned to court Friday and persuaded Hudson
County Superior Court Judge Martin Greenberg to fine the Jersey
City Education Association, the union representing the striking
teachers, $100,000 a day for each day it defied his back-to-work
order.
</P>
<P>
   A negotiating session is scheduled for Sunday afternoon, said
Schools Superintendent Richard DiPatri. But he added that if an
agreement is not reached, the district will seek to impose fines
against individual union members, too.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think we're talking about money here,'' DiPatri said about
the concerns of the union, which, among other things, include a
call for a pay raise in a new three-year contract. ``I cannot
succumb to demands that I think are outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the judge's order Thursday that they return to work,
teachers picketed the schools Friday morning, holding signs
criticizing DiPatri, whose management they say is at the heart of
their strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``This superintendent has said publicly that every teacher
should come to work with a little anxiety, and that every principal
should have twice as much anxiety,'' said Thomas Favia, the
president of the union, which represents 2,500 teachers and 1,000
support personnel. ``In my 42 years here, I have never seen an
atmosphere of fear more prevalent in our district.''
</P>
<P>
   The district has been under state control for 10 years because
of poor performance, but union members say that DiPatri is the only
superintendent since the takeover who has driven them to strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is not the issue,'' Favia said. A teacher in the Jersey
City system earns, on average, $58,254, compared to the statewide
average of $52,000, district officials said, and the union is
seeking a pay raise of 5.2 percent in each of the three years.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference this morning, Police Director Michael
Moriarty said about 50 police officers were assigned to the schools
in the two days of the strike _ about twice the normal contingent.
In addition, the Board of Education has hired about 60 or so
off-duty officers at $25 an hour. But he said more security
personnel could not have prevented the bedlam that erupted inside
the schools Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The district had only about 200 substitute teachers on hand _
even though they knew for weeks the teachers might strike _ to
oversee 36 schools with an enrollment of 36,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bret Schundler on Friday urged teachers to go back to
work, and he appealed to the school administration to work harder
to recruit enough substitute teachers to avoid Thursday's chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's three things that the mayor can do,'' Schundler said.
``You can encourage the teachers to go back to work; you can
provide the resources to make sure there's a safe environment for
the students; and you can appeal to the community to support the
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers who were walking around the city's downtown during
what would normally have been school hours said they were told to
listen to the radio to find out whether there would be class
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Carmelo Valez, 17, a sophomore at Dickinson High School, and his
friend Richard Gonzalez, 17, a senior at Ferris High School, spent
the gray day on Friday in-line skating downtown. They said they
knew they would have to make up these missed days in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to trade a nasty day for a good day,'' Valez said.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally around noon Friday, teachers celebrated their unity,
saying that about 98 percent of the membership of the union had
stayed off the job to show their support for its position on the
new contract.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that most teachers have brought up is the practice,
introduced under DiPatri, of having teams of educators enter
classrooms unannounced to evaluate teachers, and then not giving
the teachers a chance to respond to the teams' written report. They
also said they are also opposed to the district's proposal to
extend the school year by two days, and the school day by 15
minutes, while cutting the lunch period to 30 minutes from the
current 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in my profession,'' said Oscar Velez, who teaches
health and basic skills to seventh and eighth graders. ``I believe
we are professionals. But I believe we are being treated in a
childlike and condescending manner.''

ASBURY PARK SEEKS OUSTER OF ATHLETIC DIRECTOR IN FOOTBALL SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASBURY PARK, N.J. _ The Asbury Park Board of Education has taken
legal steps to dismiss the high school athletic director, whose
decision to allow two academically ineligible students to play
football forced the school's team to forfeit an undefeated season.
</P>
<P>
   Board members filed a formal complaint Thursday, asserting that
athletic director Stephen Kessler was either grossly negligent or
had deliberately overlooked at least one player's academic record.
</P>
<P>
   The board also censured the district's superintendent, Robert
Mann; the high school principal, Daniel Murphy, and the students'
special education supervisor, Linda Burgess, saying they should
have uncovered the situation. `` Kessler should have known,'' said
Charles Harris, a board member. ``The fact that he said he
misinterpreted the ruling, that was no excuse. There was too much
at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The team, the Blue Bishops, forfeited six of its eight winning
games last month after Kessler reported that he had mistakenly
allowed a newly classified special education student to play. Then,
on Nov. 3, after reviewing students' records, the district reported
that a second ineligible student had been on the field all season,
and the team's record was changed from 8-0 to 0-8 under a ruling by
the New Jersey Interscholastic Athletic Association.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler has been the target of anger in the community and
received a death threat Oct. 28. Still, he intends to fight for his
job, his lawyer, Michael Schottland, said.
</P>
<P>
   As a tenured employee who has worked in the district for more
than 30 years, he cannot be dismissed until a formal complaint is
filed and hearings are held by the state Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Schottland said his client admitted that he misinterpreted rules
of the scholastic athletic association that require newly
classified special education students to wait a semester before
playing team sports. The youth in question was classified in July
and began playing in August.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler did not accept blame for allowing the second boy to
play. He needed a special waiver because he had completed 25 of the
required 27.5 semester credits the previous year. Schottland said
the special education supervisor, Ms. Burgess, had granted
permission to the student. She would not comment on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Schottland said that the board was using Kessler as a scapegoat
and that it should have instead appealed the athletic association's
ruling on the ground that it set educational policy, which only the
State Department of Education can do.

FEDERAL JUDGE VOIDS ARIZONA'S BIBLE WEEK
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge Friday cancelled Bible Week in Arizona, saying
the governor's proclamation had enough religious overtones to make
it un constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull, through a spokes person, vowed to fight the
prelimi nary injunction against her Bible Week decree.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Roslyn Silver did not order Hull to rescind
her Nov. 5 recognition of Bible Week. But her temporary finding
that it is unconstitutional has the effect of voiding it.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of three citizens,
sued Hull on Thursday saying the decree violated both the U.S. and
Arizona constitutions. It asked for the hearing on Friday so the
judge could rule before Bible Week was scheduled to begin on
Sunday.
</P>

   On Monday, the ACLU won a temporary unjunction against the city
of Gilbert preventing it from declaring the week. Judge Silver
issued that order as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is never an easy question,'' Silver said Friday,
``determining the parameters of establishment (of reli gion,)
because its constantly in tension with the freedom of expres sion
of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The date for the permanent in junction hearing was not set
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are glad to get a hearing because we will fight the
ruling,'' said Francie Noyes, spokeswoman for Hull.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing for Gilbert's injunc tion is set for Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Tucson's mayor said he would rescind his Bible Week
proclamation after the ACLU threat ened to slap that city with a
similar suit.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU has informally chal lenged Bible Week proclamations by
other cities and states in years past, but Arizona's twin actions
mark the first time the decree has been challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ruling marked the first time a declared Bible Week was
voided by court action.
</P>
<P>
   The state's proclamation called the Bible ``the foundational
docu ment of the Judeo-Christian princi ples upon which our nation
was conceived,''and ``a constant source of moral and spiritual
guidance for Americans.'' It says National Bible Week has ``helped
to strengthen spiritual understanding throughout our nation by
encouraging personal reading of the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   The wording was provided by the New York-based National Bible
Association, which every year re quests every governor and every
mayor to proclaim the week.
</P>
<P>
   The National Bible Association has declared Bible Week every
year since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The state argued that its procla mation recognized the Bible as
only a cultural and historical document, not primarily as a
religious book.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bible Week) offers a signifi cant secular purpose,'' said
Eliza beth Teply, assistant attorney general. ``That purpose is
reading the Bible for any reason.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought a strong rebuttal from Steven Montoya, arguing for
the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is to really trivialize the Bible,'' he said. ``To say
the Bible has nothing to do with religion is like saying the
Constitution has nothing to do with civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Teply said the state also ques tioned the harm done by the
proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   She said the original document was sent back to the New
York-based National Bible Association, which requested the
proclamation from Arizona and every other state. She said no
activities were planned and citizens were free to ignore the
proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not require any citizen to do anything. It does not
stop any citizen from doing anything'' she argued.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya said that his clients can still have their civil rights
violated, even if the proclamation is not pushed on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean (the state) can get away from doing illegal
things undercover or behind closed doors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversy, the Na tional Bible Association said
Friday it will continue to ask states, cities and towns to proclaim
Bible Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine we would all be upset because of one incident
in Arizona,'' said Tom May, the Bible association's president.
</P>
<P>
   May said the group asks govern ment to proclaim Bible Week so it
can garner publicity.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, 26 states and more than 400 cities had proclaimed
Bible Week.
</P>
<P>
   But some of those cities had no idea they honored the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' said Nadia Wiggins, spokeswoman for Las Vegas,
before she checked and confirmed that Bible Week was decreed in Sin
City. ``I've never heard of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me double-check that,'' said a woman in the Lodi, Calif.,
clerk's office who didn't want her name used. She said a
proclamation was issued in October, but there was no hubbub about
it.
</P>
<P>
   In the space alien-loving city of Roswell, N.M., the Bible Week
issue has also not been a point of controversy, said a secretary in
Mayor Bill Owen's office who didn't want her name used.
</P>
<P>
   May said some local newspapers will note the proclamation as
it's passed by city councils.
</P>
<P>
   A search of the nation's major newspapers found little mention
of the Bible Week proclamations in this or other recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The only newspaper story found about Bible Week was in the
Neighbor section of the Chicago Daily Herald, which noted that the
village council in Palatine, Ill., had made the proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   May admitted that the govern ment proclamations do little to get
the word out about Bible Week. The group relies more on its
television shows, billboards and paid adver tisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``By all means, (government proclamations) is not the most
important thing we do,'' May said. ``If we had to do without it, we
are certainly not going to come to a screeching halt in the life of
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a shame to have to delete the government sector
from a project that has been endorsed by every other sector of
society.'' &QL;

RESIGNATION LETTER FROM ETHICS ADVISER, AND STARR'S REPLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., double parentheses should be set as brackets)  
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are the texts of the letter of
resignation submitted Friday by Samuel Dash, ethics adviser to the
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, protesting Starr's decision to
testify in the House impeachment hearing against President Clinton,
and of Starr's letter in response:
</P>
<P>
   Dash's Letter
</P>
<P>
   I hereby submit my resignation as outside consultant and adviser
to you and your Office of Independent Counsel, effective at noon
today.
</P>
<P>
   My decision to leave has nothing whatsoever to do with the many
unfounded and misinformed attacks on your conduct as independent
counsel. Through most of your tenure, I have been fully informed by
you and your staff on all major decisions made by your office. I
have advised you on these matters and have approved most of the
decisions made. On some I agreed with you and your staff at the
outset. As to others, where I disagreed, you showed your
willingness to be open to my advice and you came to different
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   From my special vantage point, as an experienced professional
outsider with no personal or professional stake in the outcome of
your investigations, I found that you conducted yourself with
integrity and professionalism, as did your staff of experienced
Federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   I resign for a fundamental reason. Against my strong advice, you
decided to depart from your usual professional decision-making by
accepting the invitation of the House Judiciary Committee to appear
before the committee and serve as an aggressive advocate for the
proposition that the evidence in your referral demonstrates that
the President committed impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   In doing this you have violated your obligations under the
independent counsel statute and have unlawfully intruded on the
power of impeachment, which the Constitution gives solely to the
House. As independent counsel you have only one narrow duty under
the statute relating to the House's power of impeachment. That one
duty, under Section 595(c) of the statute, is to objectively
provide for the House substantial and credible information that may
constitute grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The statute does not, and could not constitutionally give the
independent counsel any role in impeachment other than this single
informing function. The House is not dependent on the independent
counsel for information related to its impeachment role. It can get
its information from many sources, including through its own
process, and does not need a referral of information from the
independent counsel before it can decide to have an impeachment
inquiry. The referral you made to the House was proper under the
statute.
</P>
<P>
   But your role and authority as a provider of information to the
House stopped there. You have no right or authority under the law,
as independent counsel, to advocate for a particular position on
the evidence before the Judiciary Committee or to argue that the
evidence in your referral is strong enough to justify the decision
by the committee to recommend impeachment. Constitutionally, as you
have recognized, the House has the sole power of impeachment. As an
executive branch independent prosecutor you may not intrude on that
sole power, even if invited by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Your referral to the House under the statute presented all the
evidence you had about the Lewinsky matter which you believed was
substantial and credible. As I have said, that was your only lawful
responsibility under the statute governing your office. The House
committee has excellent lawyers advising it and did not need you to
summarize your referral and to argue for impeachment. Indeed, the
committee does not have a right to impose upon you as independent
counsel to be its prosecuting counsel for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   By your willingness to serve in this improper role you have
seriously harmed the public confidence in the independence and
objectivity of your office. Frequently you have publicly stated
that you have sought my advice in major decisions and had my
approval. I cannot allow that inference to continue regarding your
present abuse of your office, and have no other choice but to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's Letter
</P>
<P>
   I have received your letter of today. As you know, I have the
greatest respect and admiration for your integrity, your wisdom and
the invaluable assistance you have provided throughout my tenure as
independent counsel. You were there at the beginning, and save for
a teaching sabbatical, you have been there throughout.
</P>
<P>
   I am, of course, also gratified by your statement that you
``found that I conducted (my)self with integrity and
professionalism as did ((my)) staff of experienced Federal
prosecutors.'' As you and I frequently discussed, we are fortunate
to have on our staff experienced and dedicated career prosecutors
who have performed outstanding service at the highest levels of the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   With deep respect, however, I must say that your letter reflects
an inaccurate view of the law, as well as of the events that
unfolded yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental legal point on which we part company is the
following: Because the statute requires a written referral of
information that ``may constitute grounds for an impeachment'' _
and you supported our referral _ it seems to me that it cannot
reasonably be a violation of law to personally appear before
Congress, at its invitation, to summarize and explain the substance
of a referral and the process that went into it. Moreover, the
statute speaks to this point. The second sentence of Section 595(c)
of the statute states: ``Nothing in this chapter ... shall prevent
the Congress or either house thereof from obtaining information in
the course of an impeachment proceeding.'' For that reason as well,
an independent counsel can hardly cite the independent counsel
statute as a basis for refusing to cooperate and appear before
Congress in an impeachment proceeding, as you suggest we should
have done.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to stress that I did not ask to appear before
the committee. I was invited to appear. And as a practical matter,
moreover, I believed _ and I think virtually all members of the
committee would agree _ that it was thoroughly appropriate and
worthwhile to provide an oral rendition of the key points of the
written referral, to provide a general status report on the state
of the overall investigation and to discuss the process that went
into the investigation and referral. No member of the committee
expressed the objection that you have raised. And it is important
to note that my status report on the overall investigation included
exonerations for the President on several issues.
</P>
<P>
   You suggest that by appearing, I harmed public confidence in the
independence of the office. With respect, I disagree with that.
Indeed, had I chosen to refuse the invitation to testify, I believe
that would have harmed public confidence in the office. A refusal
to appear would have suggested that we have something to hide, or
that we are unwilling to defend and stand by the written referral.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, I emphasized yesterday that the House has the sole
power to impeach. I said it over and over and over again. I could
not have been more clear. I stated that Congress has the absolute
and unfettered discretion to discard the referral, use it, or hold
hearings on other issues. As Congressman Graham said, a House
member voting on impeachment may choose to consider a wide variety
of factors, and I did not purport to provide any guidance on what
factors a member should apply, or how to balance all of the
factors. My abiding concern was merely the evidence, the law and
the process that my colleagues and I used.
</P>
<P>
   In closing, let me again thank you for years of service. Today's
developments will not alter my deep affection for you and profound
appreciation for all you have done for us.

PATRIOTS' MOVE TO CONNECTICUT STIRS RANCOR

<P>
   New England is generally viewed as a bastion of civility, a
place where Frostian musings about good fences making good
neighbors do not immediately elicit cries to shut up. But in recent
days, trash talking has replaced poetry recitals in the meadows and
mill towns to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is calling Hartford, the proud Connecticut city built on
insurance policies against bathtub falls and death, a ghost town
for yahoos. Hartford counters by dismissing Boston, the noble
Massachusetts metropolis that sees tragedy of Greek proportion in
every Red Sox defeat, as a grimy, creaking haven for sore losers.
</P>
<P>
   Only Providence, the Rhode Island home to liberty and la Cosa
Nostra, demonstrates having learned a lesson from the American
Revolution. It democratically thumbs its nose at everyone.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of all the discontent, waged in newspaper columns
and on radio airwaves, is this week's announcement by Robert Kraft
that he will move his National Football League team, the New
England Patriots, from Foxboro, Mass., to Hartford in time for the
2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the issue merely reflects a series of business
decisions: Massachusetts refused to placate the wealthy owner of a
sports franchise with the subsidies that he sought, and so he went
to a place where he felt more wanted, to a city looking to
jump-start its revitalization.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, it speaks to the pull of regional identity,
love for one's sports idols and contempt for one's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Shaughnessy, a sports writer for The Boston Globe, greeted
the prospect of losing the Patriots with a front-page polemic on
Thursday against Kraft's choice of Hartford, whose charms
apparently are lost on him. He called the city a ``yahoo sports
town'' and ``America's file cabinet,'' a place where ``poor souls''
wander ``dead streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent ``Buddy'' Cianci, the mayor of Providence, whose city
also wooed the Patriots, asked: ``Have the rules changed? Has
Hartford become the celebrated city of the Northeast?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can marry an ugly woman for enough money, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Jim Shea of The Hartford Courant raised his own pen
in defense, smearing Boston with ink. ``The best thing about Boston
is Cape Cod,'' he said. ``Boston has the charm of a storm sewer.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the common Boston lament that its residents would rather
watch the ice sport of curling than travel to Hartford for a
Patriots game, Shea wondered: If it weren't for Boston fans, who
would urinate in the streets, pick fights and ``wander around
stinking drunk''?
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges are nasty enough to make Boston's residents forget
how to spell ``Yastrzemski'' and make Hartford's denizens forget
that the big G. Fox department store on Main Street is still
vacant.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, the dispute seems driven more by sports
writers and commentators than by deep-seated resentment. First, the
spokeswomen for the mayor's offices of Boston and Hartford said
they were rarely asked about rivalry between the cities. More
often, they say, their squabbles are with Providence and its
irrepressible mayor, Cianci.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Patriots play in Foxboro, which is 30 miles from
Boston, a city the team abandoned with such ill feeling years
earlier that it changed its name from the Boston Patriots to the
New England Patriots. Among certain Yankees, once a Benedict
Arnold, always a Benedict Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Goddard, the spokeswoman for Boston's mayor, Thomas
Menino, said, ``Many people in the city of Boston feel that the
team has not had loyalty to the city, that it has purposely tried
to shed its Boston image by moving elsewhere in Massachusetts and
changing the name of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, everyone agrees Hartford could use a pat on its hunched
back. Boston has the Red Sox and the Bruins. Hartford, which also
has economic woes, recently saw its only professional sports
franchise, the Whalers hockey team, flee to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if people would see what we're all about
before calling us yahoos,'' said Nilda Torres, the executive
assistant to Hartford's mayor, Michael Peters. ``All we keep
hearing is `Did you hear that Boston's radio stations are taking
more swipes at us?' I mean, it's not our fault.''

N.J. TAKEOVER OF HMO STALLED BY BANKRUPTCY COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ The state takeover of the HIP Health Plan
of New Jersey was stalled Friday by proceedings in a federal
bankruptcy court in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Joseph Farnan Jr. of that court issued a temporary
restraining order Friday blocking the state takeover of HIP. The
order also blocked HIP from breaking its contract with Pinnacle
Health Enterprises, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the
Delaware court. The judge said the loss of the contract would
interfere with Pinnacle's efforts to begin reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this order, Judge Jack Lintner of New Jersey Superior
Court did not immediately grant the state's motion to complete the
takeover of HIP, the state's fourth-largest health maintenance
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Mansue, president of HIP Health Plan of New Jersey, said the
judge observed that the ``issue of jurisdiction was a gray area''
in the case and that he would direct state officials to supervise
HIP until Dec. 1, when a full hearing on Pinnacle's temporary
restraining order would be held in bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
   But even that could change sooner than expected, the New Jersey
commissioner of banking and insurance, Jaynee LaVecchia, said in an
interview. She added that Lintner had directed New Jersey state
attorneys to move as soon as Monday in the Delaware bankruptcy
court ``to dissolve the restraints'' blocking the state takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mansue said in a telephone interview that ``the judge is
trying to make sure that because of these questions there will be
continuity of care.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinnacle, which provided medical care to HIP's customers in
exchange for 91.5 percent of the premiums collected by HIP, is
supposed to continue to provide medical and other services, Ms.
Mansue said. But officials of Pinnacle, which has invested $140
million in the HIP deal, could not be reached for comment after the
day's court actions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mansue said that, in a worst-case scenario, if Pinnacle were
to stop providing medical care, the state, under the terms of the
supervision order, would provide those medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the courts were taking action Friday, the state was
sending a message to HIP's 194,000 members through Ms. Mansue and
from state workers who were traveling to HIP and Pinnacle health
centers: The doctor is still in.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Kantrowitz, a registered nurse with the state Department of
Health and Senior Services, approached a man sitting in the waiting
room of the center here Friday afternoon, and insisted that nothing
would change. She said HIP had broken with Pinnacle because the
Virginia-based medical management company had violated the terms of
the contract they entered into a year and a half ago. Now, she
said, the state was coming in to supervise things and all would go
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sign outside might be the only thing that changes,'' said
a smiling Ms. Kantrowitz, pointing to the ``HIP Health Plan of New
Jersey, Pinnacle Health Enterprises'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 27, state officials moved in state court to take over
HIP and to end its contract with Pinnacle, noting that the health
maintenance organization was more than $20 million in debt and owed
tens of millions in unpaid claims to hospitals and doctors.
Initially, HIP and Pinnacle fought the takeover move together.
</P>
<P>
   But amid an angry exchange of charges, HIP moved to break its
contract with Pinnacle and joined the state in requesting that the
court put them under state supervision. HIP charged that Pinnacle
had failed to use more than $345 million in premium payments it
received over the last 18 months to pay off claims incurred by plan
members. But, judging from interviews with patients leaving two of
the Pinnacle centers Friday, there was little need for Ms.
Kantrowitz's calming bedside manner.
</P>
<P>
   John Thomas, a driver with a limousine service who lives in
Union Township, said he had heard about the health maintenance
organization's financial problems but had seen no signs of it
himself. He had requested an emergency appointment for Friday and
had gotten it without difficulty. When he arrived, the waiting room
was practically empty, and he got in to see the doctor within
minutes. ``They're right on the ball,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   But he did note that the plan's handling of a hospital bill he
had incurred a year ago had left much to be desired. ``It's a $100
bill and the hospital is hounding me, and I call HIP and wind up
waiting on hold listening to that music for 20 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems facing HIP and Pinnacle is an estimated $46
million in overdue and unpaid claims owed to about a third of the
112 hospitals represented by the New Jersey Hospitals Association.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of a HIP/Pinnacle health center in Edison, Monica
Gonzalez, 26, and her mother, Cecilia, also said they had heard
about the plan's problems but had not seen any change in the
service, which they termed ``excellent''.

<P>
   Iraq threw up a new roadblock to the work of U.N. arms
inspectors Friday, less than a week after agreeing to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest twist in the dispute between the United Nations
and Iraq over the prohibited arms, Iraq balked at handing over
documents on chemical and biological weapons and missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British officials have warned that air strikes remain
an immediate option if the government of Saddam Hussein does not
honor its pledge last Saturday to renew cooperation with
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James Rubin, warned Iraq on
Friday evening that it must meet its pledge. ``Iraq must provide
further disclosure,'' he said. ``The Iraqis must respond quickly to
the requests for information.''
</P>
<P>
   But the initial Western reaction was muted.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British forces are standing by within striking distance
of Iraq and could be sent into combat in hours, U.S. officials have
said. The forces include warships, dozens of F-14 and F-18 fighters
and more than 20,000 soldiers, sailors, aviators and marines.
</P>
<P>
   Statements by Iraq indicate that it believes it can balk on
major issues pending a comprehensive review of its relations with
the United Nations. But that review, the Security Council decided
on Oct. 30, cannot take place until there is full cooperation with
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq appears to be defiant on several fronts, including in its
crucial biological-weapons program, potentially the most
immediately dangerous. With the right components _ and Iraq is
suspected of hiding a large quantity of them _ biological weapons
can be produced in days.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation, which has come sooner than expected, raises
questions about Saddam's understanding of the seriousness of the
threat he faces and the limited diplomatic help he can expect _ if
any _ from former supporters like Russia, China and France.
</P>
<P>
   Experts had assumed it would take the appearance of a
spot-inspection team to provoke Iraq. These teams are only
beginning to be assembled, however, as routine monitoring systems
are restored after a week-long break.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the renewed confrontation are Iraqi documents
that Richard Butler, the chief inspector, has said are critical to
a full accounting of what prohibited weapons Iraq possessed before
the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf. Without those records, it is all
but impossible to determine what arms remain or have not been
accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Among the disputed documents is at least one that President
Clinton confidently predicted on Sunday would be turned over, to
the surprise of some diplomats: an Iraqi air force account of what
kind of ammunition was loaded and used _ or destroyed _ in the
1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. inspectors say they believe that the missing document _
literally snatched away from inspectors who discovered it in July _
indicates that Iraq may have been left with more chemical and
biological munitions than it has declared when the war with Iran
ended.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Friday night to Butler, Iraq's deputy foreign
minister, Riyadh al-Qaisi, said the request for the document had
overstepped the bounds. ``The request you made seems to be
provocative rather than professional,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter is interesting for several reasons. It emphasized
Iraq's hope that it can undercut Butler by portraying his requests
as out of line. But the Security Council has already rejected
demands that Butler be dismissed or that his commission be
reorganized. Moreover, the council ordered the Iraqis to turn over
the document several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the prominence of al-Qaisi reinforces rumors that he is to
be sent next month to represent Iraq at the United Nations,
replacing Nizar Hamdoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi move may also wipe out whatever sympathy Saddam may
have found with Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has seen his
February agreement with Saddam violated repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   In general, al-Qaisi argued, the documents Butler wanted either
do not exist or were already accounted for earlier. As a possible
concession, the Iraqis said the contested air force document might
be examined in the presence of the secretary-general's special
envoy, Prakash Shah. Diplomats dismissed this as another Iraqi ploy
to circumvent the special commission, which is known as UNSCOM, and
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Butler fired back in a letter to Peter Burleigh, the U.S.
representative at the United Nations and this month's Security
Council president, detailing the most recent exchanges with Iraq.
He had written to Iraq this week outlining what information he
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree with Chairman Butler's assessment that this response
((by Iraq)) is not sufficient,'' said Crowley, the spokesman for
the National Security Council. ``It is our understanding that
UNSCOM has responded to the Iraqi letter, seeking further
clarification. Iraq still needs to provide further disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler said Friday that Iraq ``declines to furnish the
commission with any information on its biological weapons
program,'' preferring to wait for a review. But that was never
likely.
</P>
<P>
   He also told Burleigh that Iraq appears to be denying access to
archives in the Ministry of Defense, the Military Industrialization
Corp. and other departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access by UNSCOM to the archives, to be provided, as I hope,
through cooperation by Iraq, would be the most effective and least
controversial way of the commission obtaining the necessary
evidence for the accounting of Iraq's prohibited weapons
programs,'' Butler wrote. ``It would avoid seeking out such
documents through intrusive inspection which, as council members
are aware, has sometimes been the source of tension and blockage.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has furthermore refused to answer questions about the
extent of its production of the nerve agent VX, which can kill
within hours, and about whether it has been loaded into warheads.
Questions on missiles and inexplicable quantities of missile fuel
are also being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is also apparently trying to conceal important diaries and
memoirs of Iraqi military officers with knowledge of the extent of
Iraqi weapons programs, calling them ``state secrets.''

NOTE-TAKING BY JURORS IS ENDORSED BY HIGH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York state's highest court gave formal approval
Friday to an increasingly common practice: judges allowing jurors
to take notes during trials.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the Court of Appeals ruled that judges
had the discretion to permit jurors to take notes. In one sense,
the ruling simply confirmed an existing custom in courtrooms around
the state. But the strongly worded decision was also intended by
the court as a signal to judges to encourage the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges, lawyers and court clerks typically take notes during
the trial,'' Judge Richard Wesley wrote in the ruling. ``In light
of the pervasive use of note-taking by others at trial to manage
information, we are of a view that allowing jurors to take notes is
long overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   Many federal courts and appellate courts in other states have
permitted note-taking by jurors, Wesley wrote, and each of New York
state's four regional appeals courts have issued rulings allowing
the practice. But until now, the Court of Appeals had not given its
formal approval to taking notes during a trial. It will still be up
to individual judges to decide whether to permit jurors to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Under longtime U.S. common law, jurors were not allowed to take
notes because of high illiteracy rates, Wesley wrote. The courts
were afraid that jurors who could read and write _ and who took
notes during a trial _ would dominate deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals ruling came in a 1995 case in which a man,
Resean Hues, was accused of selling $20 worth of cocaine to an
undercover police officer in Ithaca. The judge in Hues' trial on
charges of the sale and possession of a controlled substance
allowed jurors to take notes, although he also cautioned them about
limiting the use of notes during their deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Hues was convicted in December 1995 and sentenced to a prison
term of 5 to 10 years. His lawyer argued in an appeal that the
decision to permit note-taking, particularly without a request to
do so from a juror, had deprived Hues of a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   A state appeals court upheld the conviction, endorsing the
note-taking, as did the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the practice contend that note-taking can distract
jurors from listening to testimony and can cause them to rely on
written notes that may be inaccurate, instead of relying on their
own memory or the court record.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals said that, with some cautionary
instructions by a judge, most of the pitfalls could be avoided. The
court also noted many potential advantages. ``Note-taking can serve
as a legitimate aid in absorbing and synthesizing information, as
well as refreshing memory,'' Wesley wrote. ``Jurors today are often
involved in longer trials, dealing with difficult issues. As cases
have become increasingly complex, courts should have the option to
allow jurors to take notes to aid their memories and to enable them
to consider the evidence in a more informed fashion. In addition,
note-taking may help focus a juror's attention on the proceedings
and prevent the juror's attention from wandering.''

KRAFTS HITTING THE JACKPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Move the Kraft family to the top of the leaderboard. They have
just made the best stadium deal in National Football League
history.
</P>
<P>
   And good luck to those people who buy seats in the proposed
Hartford stadium, where the Krafts say they intend to relocate the
Patriots in 2001. Whether you buy a luxury box, club seat, or just
a plain old seat, you will pay top dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The top club seat in the NFL (Washington) currently runs $2,500
per season. The Patriots will charge $5,000 per club seat.
</P>
<P>
   I'm told the average NFL box goes for about $80,000. The ones in
Hartford will go for $100,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots can sell all the expensive seats and generate
local TV-radio income plus stadium advertising the way they have in
Foxborough, they figure to be the top-grossing team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider this and ask yourself why.
</P>
<P>
   In his last four years with the Red Sox (1993-96), Roger Clemens
had a 40-39 rec-ord, a 10-9 average per season.
</P>
<P>
   In his two Cy Young years with Toronto, he's gone 41-13, a 21-7
average.
</P>
<P>
   In his last four years in Boston, he started 110 games, about 28
per season. In Toronto, he's started 67 games, 34 per season.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern holds up for several other averages when comparing
his last four years in Boston with his two in Toronto: complete
games (3 here, 7 there), shutouts (1-3), innings (189-250),
strikeouts (180-281), and home runs allowed (17-10).
</P>
<P>
   It seems quite obvious that Clemens, whose last Boston contract
carried him from age 31 to 34, wasn't pitching with the same zeal
he did in Toronto at ages 35 and 36.
</P>
<P>
   He has claimed in the past that the reason he pitched better in
Toronto is defense. How does that help you get 100 more strikeouts
per season?
</P>
<P>
   As I've said all along, Clemens took 3 1/2 years off here on
cruise control, making sure he could get to the next contract.
</P>
<P>
   Sports fans can beef that Lawrence Taylor doesn't belong in the
Pro Football Hall of Fame in light of his drug problems, but every
time he went on the field, he played his heart out. It's the same
with Pete Rose, banned from the Baseball Hall of Fame for gambling
on games.
</P>
<P>
   When Clemens becomes eligible for the Hall, can the voters
possibly say that every time he went to the mound, he gave
everything he had?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no tougher coaching job than Pete Carroll faces. It is
bad enough that his Patriots are banged up and underachieving, but
trying to keep the team focused when the owner has said it is
leaving town will be next to impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happened in Cleveland. Coach Bill Belichick had a
4-4 record and the Browns were tied for first place in the AFC
Central when the announcement was made that they were going to
Baltimore. The team went 1-7 the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a chance after that,'' said Belichick, now a
New York Jets assistant. ``When we had the players at the field, we
could keep them focused on what they had to do. But once they left,
it was impossible. The distractions came from the outside _ family
and friends talking about moving, selling houses, changing schools.
It was a terrible situation. The only game we won the rest of the
way was our final game at home. We beat Cincinnati. The fans were
so angry, they were throwing seats out of the upper deck. We
changed (directions on the field) four times in the fourth quarter
alone. The fans were so out of control in the Dog Pound, whenever a
team was headed in that direction, the officials stopped the game
and headed the offensive team toward the other end.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees are heading toward a sale, although it
probably won't be finalized until next year. Owner George
Steinbrenner will sell the team to Chuck Dolan, owner of
Cablevision. The guessing is that the team will go for somewhere
between $500 million and $800 million. If the sale is completed,
Steinbrenner will still run the team ... The Red Sox and Albert
Belle are waiting to see what happens with the Yankees and Bernie
Williams. The Yankees say Williams is their first priority. If they
sign him, Boston feels it will be the front-runner to get Belle.
Belle and his agent are waiting as well. As for signing a major
free agent, the Red Sox don't expect anything to happen until early
next week ... Friday marked the first time the NBA owners and
players made significant movement in their stalled labor
negotiations in a long time. Reportedly, the players came in with a
proposal that prompted the owners to stay in the room all night,
talking rather than walking. At least it's a start ... If the NBA
season resumes, the Celtics hope to complete a trade that would
send Antoine Walker to Miami for Jamal Mashburn and P.J. Brown. It
will be up to Pat Riley and the Heat to pull the trigger. Their
decision might depend on what Michael Jordan does. If Jordan does
not return to Chicago, Riley might figure he can go all the way
with three All-Stars like Alonzo Mourning, Tim Hardaway, and
Walker, who thinks he's a perennial All-Star ... Envision this.
Four hours after the Bills beat the Patriots last Sunday in
Buffalo, Doug Flutie was back on the field in Rich Stadium throwing
passes _ to his friends and relatives in a game of touch football.
He did the same thing hours after he beat Jacksonville a month ago.
Can you think of any other NFL player who would do that?

PACT WITH CONNECTICUT A WINDFALL FOR PATRIOTS OWNER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Connecticut's offer to New England Patriots owner Robert K.
Kraft to relocate the team to Hartford contains some extraordinary
guarantees, including a promise to pay Kraft as much as $175
million in cash over the first 10 years if he fails to sell out
premium seats.
</P>
<P>
   Fine print of the memorandum of understanding Kraft signed
Thursday with Connecticut Governor John Rowland also shows that,
beyond giving the Patriots a $280 million stadium rent-free, the
state will also promise to pay:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)As much as $200 million or more over 30 years for stadium
improvements and renovations.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)All the costs of buying and cleaning the stadium site,
which could run far past the $70 million now estimated, as well as
construction of thousands of parking spaces and new highway ramps
to hold post-game traffic jams to under an hour.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Up to $15 million for a Patriots training facility in
Connecticut, which the team would have no obligation to use for
their pre-season summer camp, now held at Bryant College in
Smithfield, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The state also promises to charge Kraft no rent for the land on
which Kraft would build a new $50 million convention center hotel,
no property taxes for the stadium, hotel, or an entertainment
pavillion, and three years' notice before voiding the revenue
guarantees _ ample time for the Patriots to shop for a new home.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Kraft would operate and manage the new facility,
as well as receive revenues from other events staged there, the
state will foot the bill for all property and casualty insurance
and general liability insurance on the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's move to draw the Patriots from Foxborough, Mass.
follows a spate of lavish deals by cities such as Baltimore,
Nashville, and St. Louis to use taxpayer money to lure National
Football League franchises to their cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford plan, according to a copy of the memorandum of
understanding obtained by the Globe Friday, is even more lucrative
for Kraft than initially reported, full of a range of bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots vice president of business operations, Andy
Wasynczuk, said Friday evening, ``This is very much the proverbial
win-win. This thing will in fact pay for itself over the 30-year
lease.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Kraft attorneys closely involved in negotiating the deal,
Richard Karelitz and David Engel, declined to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Nuala Forde, a Rowland administration spokeswoman, said Friday
accountants Rowland hired forecast the project will generate $450
million in tax revenues over 30 years, roughly paying for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to be revenue-neutral, and the numbers bear that
out,'' Forde told reporters in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The state's promise to Kraft to guarantee revenues for the
stadium's luxury boxes and premium seats, at a rate of up to $17.5
million a year for at least 10 years, appears to be an unusually
generous step for any state or local government.
</P>
<P>
   The only comparable deal in professional football appears to be
a revenue guarantee worked out in St. Louis as part of a deal to
lure the NFL Rams from Los Angeles, but that was funded by a local
business group, not the city or state.
</P>
<P>
   The city of San Diego also made a deal three years ago to buy
unsold tickets from the Chargers team in exchange for the team
funding a major stadium renovation, amounting to a few million
dollars each season, and not covering luxury seats.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for the 68,000-seat stadium on the Connecticut River,
which must be approved by the Connecticut Legislature by year's
end, calls for 6,000 club seats renting for $5,000 per year plus
the cost of tickets, and 125 luxury suites renting for $100,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   Two sections of the deal promise that ``the state will pay to
the team'' up to $10 million for unsold club seats every year and
$7.5 million for unsold luxury suites every year for the first 10
years after the stadium opens in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The $17.5 million figure is to be adjusted every year according
to a National Football League-wide average price for such deluxe
seats, as determined by an accounting firm hired by Kraft, meaning
it could grow by millions more over the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The state commits to maintaining the guaranteed cash payments
for 10 years, and cannot opt out of the payments without three
years' notice. If the state refuses to continue making the payments
to Kraft, ``the team may, among other things, at its option,
terminate the lease,'' the memorandum says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not unprecedented,'' Wasynczuk said of this
aspect of the deal, adding that it creates ``a mechanism by which
we and the state work very hard together to market the seats to the
business community and others'' to ensure they sell out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation is that they won't kick in,'' Wasynczuk said.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 percent admission tax that Connecticut is relying on to
help pay off construction bonds is said to apply to ``all licenses
and tickets, including the full value of club and suite tickets,''
but it does not explicitly state that the 10 percent tax also
applies to the yearly rental costs of $100,000 for luxury boxes and
$5,000 for premium seats.
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk said the 10 percent tax does cover the luxury rents,
but this could not be independently confirmed Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Among many other benefits being offered by Connecticut to the
Patriots:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The state will pick up the cost of stadium renovations,
paying up to $20 million the 10th year of stadium operations, $55
million the 20th, and $110 million in the 30th year. All sums
increase with the Consumer Price Index, which could leave the state
liable for more than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Kraft will be charged no rent for land on which he will
build a football-themed ``dining and interactive entertainment
facility'' next to the stadium, and will get all its profits.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)``The state will not unreasonably withhold its consent''
if Kraft wants to sell ``personal seat licenses,'' a newly popular
method of NFL stadium financing, in which people pay a fee to
retain the right to buy a season ticket for a given seat.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The stadium developer hired by Kraft will have to pay
construction workers prevailing wages or sign a project labor
agreement reserving jobs for union members, but ``will not be
required ... to comply with applicable state contracting or bidding
requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The team, as a byproduct of revenues, is paying I believe an
unprecedented amount towards the financing of the project,''
Waynczuk said. ``All the other projects are basically taxing
non-users of the stadium to make the stadium succeed.''

VAUGHN SOON AN ANGEL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now it's the Angels' turn to wonder if they can take Mo Vaughn
at his word, at least as it applies to statements attributed to him
in print.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the free agent first baseman was quoted as saying
that once a ``few loose ends'' were addressed, he could be signing
with the Angels by early next week, his agents were cautioning
Friday that they weren't done talking with other clubs, according
to sources familiar with negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers remain interested in Vaughn, those sources say,
though new general manager Kevin Malone appears hamstrung in his
efforts to make a bid for Vaughn until he finds a taker for his
incumbent first baseman, Eric Karros, and possibly outfielder Gary
Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Red Sox, who parted ways with Vaughn last week,
did not advance in their pursuit of free agent left fielder Albert
Belle. According to a spokesman for agent Arn Tellem, there was
``nothing new'' in negotiations for Belle, who also has had talks
with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also are preparing to meet with free agent center
fielder Bernie Williams and his agent, Scott Boras, who was in
Atlanta this weekend meeting with the Braves about another client,
free agent pitcher Kevin Brown, a Georgia native. The meeting with
Williams could come Monday and is expected to involve manager Jimy
Williams, who last week met with Belle in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who have remained in constant contact with Vaughn
since making their original offer of a six-year, $72 million deal,
have been in regular touch with his agent, Tom Reich, and further
talks are expected to carry into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Angels players and coaches, including Hall of Famer
Rod Carew and Massachusetts native Gary DiSarcina, have called
Vaughn imploring him to sign with Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   In comments published in the Boston Herald, Vaughn said a deal
with the Angels was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some work to do and loose ends to tie up, but from the
way things appear, the deal could be done by as early as next
week,'' said Vaughn, who also shot down industry speculation that
he might consider a return to the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way I would go back to the Red Sox,'' Vaughn told the
Herald. ``I'd sit out the year if I had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn told the Herald that the deal could approach $80 million.
Sources said the Angels may have sweetened their original proposal
with incentive clauses and performance bonuses that could make the
deal worth close to the higher number.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have been extremely aggressive in pursuing Vaughn,
who has not received offers from other clubs. They remain hopeful
that a deal can be struck by Monday, Thanksgiving at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn turned down a five-year, $63 million offer from the Red
Sox, who subsequently broke off negotiations.

JERRY'S DELI BUYING BACK SHARES AS SHARES HIT $1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- These days, buying a stake in Jerry's Famous Deli
costs a lot less than eating at one of the company's trendy
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Studio City-based chain, which has four stores in
the San Fernando Valley, closed at $1 Friday, up 21.875 cents. It
was the first time in 14 consecutive days that the stock managed to
reach the $1 mark after hitting its low mark of 78.125 cents
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has plunged so far in the past year that everything on
the menu is now more expensive than a share of the publicly traded
company. In fact, for the cost of Jerry's New York prime steak with
fries, sliced tomatoes and onions you can own nearly 20 shares of
the company, which operates 11 restaurants and one specialty market
in California and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The small bump-up in the share price Friday put it at an
important threshold. If the stock had stayed below $1 for 30
consecutive trading days, Jerry's could have faced delisting by the
Nasdaq exchange.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the company said before the markets opened Friday
that it was pouring an additional $700,000 into a stock repurchase
program initiated Sept. 21. So far the company has bought back
83,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer Christina Sterling said directors hope
the stock buyback can help boost the share price and stave off
delisting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely part of that, plus we feel that at this price
the stock is really undervalued,'' she said of the program. ``The
book value is $1.80, so it's the best investment we can do right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The book value is the net asset value of a company. It can be a
guide in selecting underpriced stocks and is an indication of the
ultimate value of securities in liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry's just completed a tough third quarter in which net income
fell to $9,830, or breaking even per share, from $104,045 in the
1997 third quarter. Sales were $17.2 million vs. $13.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   During the period, Jerry's saw its interest expense shoot up 140
percent because of the purchase of the Epicure Market in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But Chairman Isaac Starkman is not happy with the balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dissatisfied with anything less than increasing
same-store sales and profitability,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The company has hired restaurant consultant Peter Sirkin to beef
up operations. Changes could include a new menu mix and a marketing
campaign next year, Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry's identity might be one problem. The restaurants are in
three markets -- Los Angeles, Miami and Boca Raton, Fla. -- and the
company does not draw any analyst coverage, so it's hard to spread
the word among investors.
</P>
<P>
   How about adding ``Jerry's Investors Stake'' to the menu as a
daily special, with the price subject to change, of course? That
way customers could order a part of the company to go.

KEATING STILL PITCHING HIGH-FINANCE IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ Charles H Keating's 4{ years behind bars
haven't dampened his enthusiasm for money, but the circles he moves
in are not what they once were.
</P>
<P>
   Where he once held court with the nation's rich and powerful,
the onetime global financier found himself Thursday in a tiny
Scottsdale motel conference room telling a handful of CPAs and
investors where to put their money: microchips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm right _ I know I'm right,'' Keating told a rapt audience
of budding tycoons. ``My instincts are still right.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an unspectacular _ but not uninteresting _ performance by
the former millionaire, part of a continuing effort by Keating to
resurrect himself since the overturning of convictions for state
and federal racketeering, fraud and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Keating has been free from prison since 1996 as lawyers battled
over the convictions, which stemmed largely from the sale of
millions of dollars in junk bonds to investors, allegedly
fraudulent land sales and the eventual collapse of his Lincoln
Savings in 1989. The collapse left many investors in ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors are now contemplating whether to retry him,
while California prosecutors are trying to have his state
conviction reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving prison, the 74-year-old Keating separated, at
least temporarily, from his wife and worked for a California
telecommunications company. He has kept his local business contacts
going as well. He is often seen dining in local hot spots,
sometimes with former associates like Conley Wolfswinkel, another
prominent figure in the savings and loan scandals.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Keating applied for a passport to travel to Belize,
where he hoped to consummate an offshore business deal. A federal
judge halted the travel and briefly put Keating back in jail to
remind him of restrictions imposed by the court.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Keating was one of four speakers at an
International Tax and Asset Preservation Academy seminar about
investing overseas and shielding assets from taxation. The academy
lists a Scottsdale address.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other speakers was a Bahamian businessman promoting
offshore investments to minimize taxes and shield assets from legal
adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   The speaking engagement is the latest evidence that Keating,
though faced with a $3 billion civil judgment against him, is not
content to sit out his freedom in idle retirement.
</P>
<P>
   While Keating's wings were clipped by the courts, his notions
about high finance still soar. During his half-hour talk Thursday,
he was interrupted by applause several times as he touted worldwide
moneymaking opportunities and railed at the federal government's
intrusions into his entrepreneurial adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Though he walked with a slight limp caused by a hip problem,
Keating showed no outward signs that prison had taken a toll. At
one point he even joked about his fall from power, saying, ``I
didn't have a slide, I had a . . .'' He used a hand gesture to
mimic a steep drop.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed casually in a brown checkered blazer and a blue polo
shirt, Keating was relaxed and conversational as he spoke about his
interest in emerging technologies. He predicted that investments in
new technologies and companies putting them to use would be the
most lucrative of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   He also predicted the next decade would be the most lucrative in
history. ``I think the future is almost unlimited,'' Keating told
his pupils.
</P>
<P>
   Though he acknowledged the economy is a different one than when
he was in his prime more than a decade ago, Keating said, ``There's
room for an old goat like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Advances in microchip technology and fiber-optic communications
have made affordable high technology available worldwide to small
companies, he said. Those companies are exploiting the explosion of
interest in technology abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Keating predicted the fast advancement of technology will
``create wealth for more people in large amounts than ever in the
history of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We run at our peril not to get into this type of thing,'' he
told investors.
</P>
<P>
   He specifically cited Global Crossing Ltd., a Bahamian
corporation headed by onetime California investment banker Gary
Winnick. Keating said Winnick, working with former junk-bond king
Michael Milken, raised $1 billion in junk bonds to compete with
AT&AMP;T and finance a venture that is laying broad-band, undersea
fiber-optic cable.
</P>
<P>
   Begun last year, Global Crossing is now trading on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within 18 months, you'll see technological advances
quadruple,'' Keating predicted. The explosion will make millions
for those who get in on the ground floor, he said, because start-up
companies around the world will be ``starved for capital.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It empowers the masses,'' Keating said of the technology boom.
``This is going to make people wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Keating spent little time dwelling on his personal
downfall during the last decade, he repeated past claims that
federal regulators pulled his empire out from under him before he
could salvage it financially.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government and I never got along,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When regulators took over Lincoln Savings, he charged, it left
him no way to service his debts, leading to the failure of
Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp., and its
spinoffs. Among his losses was the Phoenician, a resort which he
noted is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars and would have
been a hugely lucrative asset.
</P>
<P>
   Keating said he is still upbeat in the wake of his fall from
grace, telling the seminar, ``I've had a problem all my life being
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest change _ aside from the drop in his net
worth _ is Keating's new desire for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   As he left the seminar Thursday night accompanied by longtime
personal secretary Carol Kassick, Keating was intercepted by a
reporter hunting an interview. Keating slipped him a tip sheet on
hot technologies, saying, ``Here, make some money _ so you can
leave me alone.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he declined further comment and spun out the door. &QL;

PACT WITH CONNECTICUT A WINDFALL FOR PATRIOTS OWNER

<P>
   Connecticut's offer to New England Patriots owner Robert K.
Kraft to relocate the team to Hartford contains some extraordinary
guarantees, including a promise to pay Kraft as much as $175
million in cash over the first 10 years if he fails to sell out
premium seats.
</P>
<P>
   Fine print of the memorandum of understanding Kraft signed
Thursday with Connecticut Governor John Rowland also shows that,
beyond giving the Patriots a $280 million stadium rent-free, the
state will also promise to pay:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)As much as $200 million or more over 30 years for stadium
improvements and renovations.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)All the costs of buying and cleaning the stadium site,
which could run far past the $70 million now estimated, as well as
construction of thousands of parking spaces and new highway ramps
to hold post-game traffic jams to under an hour.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Up to $15 million for a Patriots training facility in
Connecticut, which the team would have no obligation to use for
their pre-season summer camp, now held at Bryant College in
Smithfield, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The state also promises to charge Kraft no rent for the land on
which Kraft would build a new $50 million convention center hotel,
no property taxes for the stadium, hotel, or an entertainment
pavillion, and three years' notice before voiding the revenue
guarantees _ ample time for the Patriots to shop for a new home.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Kraft would operate and manage the new facility,
as well as receive revenues from other events staged there, the
state will foot the bill for all property and casualty insurance
and general liability insurance on the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's move to draw the Patriots from Foxborough, Mass.
follows a spate of lavish deals by cities such as Baltimore,
Nashville, and St. Louis to use taxpayer money to lure National
Football League franchises to their cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford plan, according to a copy of the memorandum of
understanding obtained by the Globe Friday, is even more lucrative
for Kraft than initially reported, full of a range of bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots vice president of business operations, Andy
Wasynczuk, said Friday evening, ``This is very much the proverbial
win-win. This thing will in fact pay for itself over the 30-year
lease.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Kraft attorneys closely involved in negotiating the deal,
Richard Karelitz and David Engel, declined to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   Nuala Forde, a Rowland administration spokeswoman, said Friday
accountants Rowland hired forecast the project will generate $450
million in tax revenues over 30 years, roughly paying for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to be revenue-neutral, and the numbers bear that
out,'' Forde told reporters in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   The state's promise to Kraft to guarantee revenues for the
stadium's luxury boxes and premium seats, at a rate of up to $17.5
million a year for at least 10 years, appears to be an unusually
generous step for any state or local government.
</P>
<P>
   The only comparable deal in professional football appears to be
a revenue guarantee worked out in St. Louis as part of a deal to
lure the NFL Rams from Los Angeles, but that was funded by a local
business group, not the city or state.
</P>
<P>
   The city of San Diego also made a deal three years ago to buy
unsold tickets from the Chargers team in exchange for the team
funding a major stadium renovation, amounting to a few million
dollars each season, and not covering luxury seats.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for the 68,000-seat stadium on the Connecticut River,
which must be approved by the Connecticut Legislature by year's
end, calls for 6,000 club seats renting for $5,000 per year plus
the cost of tickets, and 125 luxury suites renting for $100,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   Two sections of the deal promise that ``the state will pay to
the team'' up to $10 million for unsold club seats every year and
$7.5 million for unsold luxury suites every year for the first 10
years after the stadium opens in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The $17.5 million figure is to be adjusted every year according
to a National Football League-wide average price for such deluxe
seats, as determined by an accounting firm hired by Kraft, meaning
it could grow by millions more over the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The state commits to maintaining the guaranteed cash payments
for 10 years, and cannot opt out of the payments without three
years' notice. If the state refuses to continue making the payments
to Kraft, ``the team may, among other things, at its option,
terminate the lease,'' the memorandum says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not unprecedented,'' Wasynczuk said of this
aspect of the deal, adding that it creates ``a mechanism by which
we and the state work very hard together to market the seats to the
business community and others'' to ensure they sell out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation is that they won't kick in,'' Wasynczuk said.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 percent admission tax that Connecticut is relying on to
help pay off construction bonds is said to apply to ``all licenses
and tickets, including the full value of club and suite tickets,''
but it does not explicitly state that the 10 percent tax also
applies to the yearly rental costs of $100,000 for luxury boxes and
$5,000 for premium seats.
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk said the 10 percent tax does cover the luxury rents,
but this could not be independently confirmed Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Among many other benefits being offered by Connecticut to the
Patriots:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The state will pick up the cost of stadium renovations,
paying up to $20 million the 10th year of stadium operations, $55
million the 20th, and $110 million in the 30th year. All sums
increase with the Consumer Price Index, which could leave the state
liable for more than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Kraft will be charged no rent for land on which he will
build a football-themed ``dining and interactive entertainment
facility'' next to the stadium, and will get all its profits.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)``The state will not unreasonably withhold its consent''
if Kraft wants to sell ``personal seat licenses,'' a newly popular
method of NFL stadium financing, in which people pay a fee to
retain the right to buy a season ticket for a given seat.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The stadium developer hired by Kraft will have to pay
construction workers prevailing wages or sign a project labor
agreement reserving jobs for union members, but ``will not be
required ... to comply with applicable state contracting or bidding
requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The team, as a byproduct of revenues, is paying I believe an
unprecedented amount towards the financing of the project,''
Waynczuk said. ``All the other projects are basically taxing
non-users of the stadium to make the stadium succeed.''

<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. _ Music retailer K-tel International has been
getting plenty of press lately, signing a lucrative distribution
deal with Microsoft one week, and threatened with delisting from
Nasdaq the next.
</P>
<P>
   In the ongoing corporate saga, the record distributor is usually
identified as being based in Minnesota. Minneapolis,
specifically &UR;  &LR; _ a town that while no New York or Motown has a
respectable music history of it own, considering it spawned Bob
Dylan, Prince, The Replacements and others.
</P>
<P>
   But for the record, if you'll pardon the pun, K-tel's HQ is in
that other rock 'n' roll capital: Calabasas, Calif, a Los Angeles
suburb 28 miles from downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of. It gets confusing, even for company
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calabasas is where the (chief financial officer) is, the
Internet business, and the former third-party buying operations,
which are now eliminated,'' said Delek Mir, a K-tel spokeswoman
from the public relations firm Coffin Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's where the former president was, but he's no longer
with the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, distribution of K-tel's sometimes offbeat records,
through the K-tel International USA subsidiary, is in Minnesota,
Mir said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion, K-tel's current president, Larry
Kieves, is based in New York, though he spends most of his time
traveling between the Midwest and West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Though Calabasas, in fairness, has never made a claim to musical
notoriety, it is gaining a reputation for its hospitality to
businesses. For example, Countrywide Credit Industries Inc., the
nation's largest independent mortgage lender, moved from Pasadena
to Calabasas earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Why any of this matters is that K-tel appears headed for either
wild success or serious trouble. On Nov. 10, the company announced
Microsoft would include K-tel's music and video service on its
Microsoft Network, news that sent the music retailer's shares
zooming more than 100 percent in two days.
</P>
<P>
   But Nov. 17 the Calabasas firm said it failed to meet Nasdaq's
minimal tangible asset requirement and faced imminent delisting.
Several class-action suits have subsequently been filed by K-tel
shareholders, and the company said it will appeal the delisting.

UCLA STREAKS OVERSHADOW USUAL THEMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The streak is at stake, but exactly which one has
complicated a rivalry usually left well enough as ``the city
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   It's become a November tradition in the '90s to discuss USC-UCLA
and the streak. The topic did not change this week. The streak
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of dwelling on UCLA's seven-year domination of USC, the
numbers nine and 19 have obliterated the usual theme of who owns
Los Angeles. The Bruins are trying to conquer the nation.
</P>
<P>
   They want to stretch their season winning streak to 10 straight
games, and overall winning streak to 20 games today when they host
the Trojans at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   While it might seem impossible to exaggerate what a victory over
USC means to UCLA, it really is more important than ever, or at
least in the past 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the game was this big for UCLA was 1967, when the
Bruins were ranked No.1 in the nation. Fourth-ranked USC, behind a
dramatic 64-yard run by O.J. Simpson, dashed the Bruins' title
hopes with a 21-20 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to 1998. Third-ranked UCLA (9-0, 6-0) has just two
obstacles left to a likely spot in the national championship game,
and the Trojans are viewed as a spoiler more than a rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge for us. The Rose Bowl doesn't rest on it, but the
national championship does,'' UCLA offensive lineman Andy Meyers
said. ``We don't want to lose to USC or Miami, and USC is the next
step.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town, USC (7-3, 5-2) has temporarily been released from
dwelling on its luckless seven-year drought in the rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seven-game losing streak doesn't mean anything to me,''
USC wide receiver Mike Bastianelli said. ``The most important thing
is to ruin their season. It's huge. It's a chance to take them out
of where they want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   All the pressure on the Bruins?. Nothing to lose for the
Trojans?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but it's not quite that simple.
</P>
<P>
   This is USC coach Paul Hackett's first chance to lead a Trojans
team against an arch-rival after five games as an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't hired to perpetuate a losing skein that helped Larry
Smith and John Robinson lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A music buff, Hackett was asked if he could think of a song as a
pregame anthem for himself and the Trojans. He originally came up
with, ``It's now or never.'' But his wife Elizabeth quickly nixed
that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Better to save that title when his contract comes up for
renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our feeling at USC is that seven is far too many, particularly
with a rivalry that's been so close,'' Hackett said. ``The games
have been within one touchdown many times. We feel like it's time
to end the jinx.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is in an unusual position, and not just because of its
lofty national status. The Bruins traditionally end their season
against USC, but today is their penultimate contest, with a
rescheduled game in Miami to be played Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually have an advantage with it being our last game of
the year. That's one of the main factors that's helped us,'' UCLA
offensive lineman Kris Ferris said. ``It helps us focus a little
more because we can lay it all on the line, and you know if you get
injured you'll be ready for the bowl game.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the more successful performers in the series _ UCLA
quarterback Cade McNown and USC wide receiver R. Jay Soward _
remain vital parts of today's matchup.
</P>
<P>
   McNown, bidding for the Heisman Trophy, is 3-0 against USC and
will once again heavily influence the outcome. The only question is
if it will be with his arm or legs.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett's strategy on neutralizing McNown seems to be to keep
him off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we can't do is focus only on No.18,'' Hackett said. ``I
think it scares you to death when you blitz this guy. What he does
is he moves in the pocket and has an uncanny knack to escape and
still keeps focus down the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing we can do offensively is if we can
win the time of possession. If we go three-and-out, three-and-out,
you're putting a lot of pressure on a very good defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins may not have to worry about Soward.
</P>
<P>
   His badly sprained ankle showed only small signs of improvement
this week. Soward did less running Friday afternoon than he had
Wednesday or Thursday because the ankle was sore. Teammates have
been pessimistic about his chances of playing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Friday that Soward will suit up and see how he
feels before the game, before a decision is made. That was a slight
retreat from earlier statements that Soward would definitely play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have won big games without him,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   But never against a bigger opponent. Senior Larry Parker will
start at wide receiver in place of Soward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to perform. The performers will stand up,'' Hackett
said. ``Who's that going to be?''

`JUST WINNING SHOULD BE ENOUGH'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An undefeated football season is a gem, to be
turned over in the light and admired. Like diamonds, no two are
exactly alike.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to say No. 1 Tennessee's 24-carat record is any better
than UCLA's, Kansas State's or Tulane's? They're all precious. The
pity is that people can't simply admire their brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   They have to look for flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from under a magnifying lens, the purity of a UCLA season
that has included last-second wins over Stanford and Oregon State
becomes suspect. Ditto the cut of the Kansas State and Tulane
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting ridiculous, this nitpicking we do under the guise
of naming a national champion. Pretty soon we'll have whittled
success down to a definition as narrow as Kansas State coach Bill
Snyder's personality, and what joy will there be in that?
</P>
<P>
   Like tail-gating parties, finding weaknesses in winning is a
time-honored tradition. Bob Toledo, the head coach at UCLA, was an
assistant at USC for three seasons in the late 1970s, during which
time the Trojans went 31-6. They lost one game in 1976 and again in
1978 but that wasn't good enough for some boosters.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years later, Toledo remembers as though it were
yesterday his introduction to grating expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just beaten Notre Dame but they had scored on the last
play,'' Toledo said. ``I went to (a university athletic donor
function) and a man came up to me and said, `What's the matter with
you?' He was mad because we didn't cover the point spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days, when gamblers were the only ones grumbling.
The Bowl Championship Series formula concocted this year to produce
a national title game has whipped up enough analysis and antagonism
to leave interested outsiders frothing through June.
</P>
<P>
   You know this isn't Pleasantville when somebody will sit with
the telephone receiver to his ear for 106 minutes just so he can
inform a sports-talk radio audience that Kansas State really
stinks.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz that used to surround a successful season is giving way
to buzzards. Some people don't even have the decency to wait for a
loss to start picking a program apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten worse than ever,'' Toledo said. ``Because of all
this poll stuff, it's gotten to the point where people don't
appreciate winning anymore. It's hard enough to win. Just winning
should be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, just graduating players should be sufficient. But
that's another column.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins shouldn't have to apologize for an unbeaten streak
that has reached 19 games. If running the table was so easy, more
teams would do it. Since 1930 there have been only four USC or UCLA
football teams that have managed to go unbeaten and untied: the
1932, 1962 and 1972 Trojans and the 1954 Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo knows firsthand how elusive perfection is, having flirted
with it as an assistant at Texas A&AMP;M in 1992. On the strength of a
slew of close wins, the Aggies took a 12-0 record into their
postseason showdown against Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl. The
Irish handed the Aggies a 28-3 defeat that in a strange, sad way,
relieved A&AMP;M of its misery.
</P>
<P>
   As Toledo explained it, ``We weren't winning big enough. We
weren't winning pretty enough. We were 12-0 and we had to listen to
people tell us how bad we were. I remember one of the coaches on
the staff making the comment that he'd rather be 8-4.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo doesn't want anyone involved with this year's UCLA
program talking like that. So he makes it a point to keep reminding
the Bruins they're in the midst of an extraordinary experience,
lest they turn on the sports-talk radio shows or read the
newspapers and begin to believe otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't listen to fans tell us how bad we are when we've won
19 in a row,'' Toledo said. ``That's not right. There's something
wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also something very disturbing about the mindset of
people who would have you believe it's better to win by 30 than by
17. It's a sad day in higher education when the lesson being
absorbed is that you should run up the score before giving third
stringers and other seldom-used players some priceless game
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, to this point the Bruins have been able to filter
out the pharisaism and focus on what's really important. They don't
need a win over USC Saturday to feel worthy, not when they've
already beaten Washington in Seattle for the first time since 1990,
secured a Rose Bowl berth for the first time since 1993 and matched
the 1954 team's victory total.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA players aren't automatons, marching joylessly toward
college football's summit. They're not too jaded to appreciate
their gem of a season. Too bad the same can't be said of the rest
of us.

 &HT;    Illegal immigrat-smuggling ring busted
 &HT;    By Gary Kane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Calling it the most sophisticated immigrant-smuggling
operation in the nation's history, immigration officials announced
Friday the dismantling of three foreign cartels that funneled
thousands of Indian nationals into the United States through South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The smugglers provided the undocumented aliens to employers who
``placed orders'' for the cheap laborers, investigators said.
Immigration officials said they intend to seek sanctions against
businesses that employed the aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the cartels reaped nearly $220 million in
smuggling fees during the past three years, immigration officials
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for those who trafficked in flesh to pay their pound
of flesh,'' vowed U.S. Attorney Paul Coggins, whose Dallas office
lodged three indictments against the cartels' top operators.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one of the 31 people named in the indictment have been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said the governments of a half-dozen
countries cooperated with U.S. investigators to smash the smuggling
rings. The operations offered ``an example of the increasingly
international scope'' of illegal-alien trafficking, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The primary smuggling itinerary involved flights from India to
Russia and then on to Cuba. Smugglers moved their human cargo from
Cuba by boat to the Bahamas, where the illegal aliens boarded
planes or boats to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Miami served as a transit point, from which smugglers
transported aliens to businesses located primarily along the
Eastern Seaboard. Very few of the Indians settled in Florida,
investigators said. Authorities declined to name the businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that at least 12,000 people were smuggled into the
United States during the past three years,'' said Doris Meissner,
commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   People paid as much as $25,000 each to be smuggled into the
country, officials said. The fees often were paid by the aliens'
families or employers. Sometimes, arriving aliens were locked in
``stash houses'' until fees were paid. Investigators located one
such house in Miami and others in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The kingpins of two cartels have been arrested. Nitin Shettie,
30, an Indian who went by the name Nick Diaz, was apprehended
during a Nov. 14 raid at his home in Nassau, Bahamas. Authorities
found 31 aliens inside the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very surprised when he said us,'' said Border Patrol
Special Agent Steven Quinones, who participated in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Another cartel leader, Navtej Pall Singh Sandu, 40, of London,
was arrested Wednesday in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The leader of the
third cartel, Niranjan Maan Singh, 58, is still being sought and
believed to be in India.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation dubbed Operation Seek and Keep marked the
first time agents used the wire-tapping authority granted to them
under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility
Act of 1996. During the investigation, agents intercepted more than
35,000 telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The case will also mark the first time that money-laundering
charges will be used in the prosecution of alien smugglers.
Prosecutors explained that money-laundering convictions will yield
prison sentences than alien smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the smugglers, which sometimes competed with
each other, had been in business for at least a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is no evidence that smuggled aliens suffered abuse
at the hands of the cartels, their journeys were ``hard, gruelling
trips, fraught with danger,'' Coggins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these illegal aliens were in transit for months and
months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the businesses hiring the aliens are located on
the East Coast, employers were found in 38 states, investigators
said. Typically, the Indians were employed in minimum-wage jobs, an
agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno described the businesses as ``unscrupulous employers... who
wanted cheap labor and fearful workers who could easily be
manipulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Coggins said his office is following about 1,000 leads on
businesses that placed orders with the smuggling operations for
illegal workers. To date, law enformcement officers have visited 26
work sites, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smuggling fees were shipped to India through Dallas, the
Bahamas, Canada, Dubai, Ecuador or the United Arab Emirates, INS
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The governments of the Bahamas, Canada, the Dominican Republic,
Ecuador, India and Panama cooperated in the investigation, which
also involved the FBI, U.S. Customs Service, Internal Revenue
Service, State Department and U.S. Postal Inspection Service.
</P>
<P>
   The governments of Russia and Cuba were not involved in the
investigation.

 &HT;    Gov. Bush heads out on 4-city tour with tickets set at $5,000
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The 1999 governor's inauguration cannot
promise potato guns a la Lawton Chiles, but it will be unusual _ a
three-day tour de Jeb spread among Miami, Orlando, Tampa and
Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Private donors giving up to $5,000 apiece will pay for the
events, whose total cost Gov.-elect Jeb Bush declined to estimate.
Any money left over will go to charities including the Red Cross
and Salvation Army. Donation records will be made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be doing things a little bit differently,''
Bush said Friday, comparing it to a Rolling Stones tour. ``We're
trying to get some good music.''
</P>
<P>
   One performer not likely to be on the marquee: Jimmy Buffett,
who campaigned for Bush's opponent, Buddy MacKay. Bush said he was
trying to get the Oak Ridge Boys, who made a pre-election tour with
him through the Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   The theme will be ``Dare to Dream.'' Someone asked if the
ascendence of Bush and his brother George W. as Texas governor
signaled a GOP-Camelot, a Kennedyesque dynasty. ``Dynasty
schmeinesty,'' Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
   A concert in Miami Jan. 3 will be followed the next day by a
daytime Orlando event for children and a ball in Tampa in the
evening. The party moves to Tallahassee Jan. 5 for a prayer
breakfast, the swearing-in ceremony, a parade and an open house at
the governor's mansion. All events will be free and open to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he did not anticipate firing a gun that sprayed
potatoes, as did his coonskin-caped predecessor Chiles at his own
inaugural four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Why break the tradition?
</P>
<P>
   ``I might violate the three-day waiting period,'' Bush said,
referring to a gun-control provision.

IN NEW JERSEY, LIBERAL BISHOP IS MOVE TOWARD CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Coming from the Rev. John Croneberger to his
congregants at the Church of the Atonement in Tenafly one Sunday
morning, the question seemed deceptively simple: What did they
think was the most important book in his life? ``They bit,'' he
said, a wry smile inching across his face. ``They said the Bible.''
But the sermon was about ``the use and abuse of time,'' and to
illustrate the point he held up not the Good Book but his date
book.
</P>
<P>
   For Croneberger, who will be consecrated on Saturday as the next
bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Newark, both his date book and
his sense of humor will be even more indispensable as he prepares
to succeed John Spong, the bishop in Newark since 1979 and one of
the most controversial figures in the modern Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   In another place, Croneberger, 59, might have been considered a
radical choice because of his history as a liberal crusader. In the
early 1970s, he was arrested for celebrating a ``Eucharist for
peace'' outside the Pentagon to protest the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, he led the defense of Walter Righter, a bishop
who was accused of heresy for ordaining a noncelibate gay man as a
deacon in Croneberger's church. Righter was absolved by an
ecclesiastical court in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But in the shadow of Spong, a maverick who has questioned some
of the church's most fundamental tenets and has written books
suggesting that Mary was a sexually violated teen-ager and that St.
Paul was a self-loathing and repressed gay man, the election of
Croneberger in June was actually a step toward moderation,
reflecting what some academics and church leaders see as a
nationwide trend among the 2.4 million American Episcopalians in
seeking common ground.
</P>
<P>
   Spong is known as someone who is as comfortable on ``Oprah
Winfrey'' or ``Larry King Live'' as he is in church. He is widely
regarded as a leading spokesman of a branch of the Episcopal Church
known as the ``Broad Church movement'' or ``Anglican modernism,''
which seeks to incorporate insights of science and modern thought
into the church.
</P>
<P>
   A champion of fully integrating blacks, women and homosexuals
into the church, Spong has written 14 books, has often crisscrossed
the country to promote them, and has lectured frequently at
universities around the world. He has also attacked the Roman
Catholic position against artificial birth control as ``an act of
immorality'' and the Vatican's treatment of women as ``so
insulting, so retrograde,'' that women should abandon the church
``for their own humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Croneberger is seen as adhering more reverentially to the
church's fundamentals: Scripture, creed, sacraments and the
episcopate, or the role of bishops. ``In a way, his election is
reflective of a longing in the Episcopal Church, of moving back to
the middle from the extremes of left and right,'' said William
Franklin, the dean of the Berkeley Divinity School at Yale
University.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin said that Croneberger makes his views known in a more
measured way. ``The way he positions himself and in the nature of
his arguments is back toward centrist Anglicanism _ which I think
is the tendency of the Episcopal church at the moment _ without
rejecting good aspects of questions that Bishop Spong raised,''
Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   And though he is perhaps more discreet, Croneberger does not in
any way represent a retreat from liberalism. His views on issues of
social justice and his own record as a fearless champion of causes
he believes in reaffirm the core liberal values, embodied by Spong,
that are now the hallmark of the Newark diocese. The differences
come in Croneberger's understated manner and more pastoral outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the clergy of the diocese are looking for a pastor,
are looking for a shepherd who will be present, who will be
available,'' Croneberger said in an interview shortly after he was
elected, conveying a message that he had repeated throughout the
selection process. ``I will be less of a national and international
figure.''
</P>
<P>
   The diocese appears to be counting on that. ``The prophet clears
the forest, and that requires a bit of burning,'' said Louie Crew,
a Rutgers University English professor who is active in the diocese
and served on the nominating committee. ``But when the forest is
clear, it doesn't make sense to have the burning. You plant in the
grassy area that's been made available to you.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, Croneberger will be consecrated as bishop
coadjutor during a service that will be led by Arthur Williams,
suffragan bishop of the Diocese of Ohio, who is vice president of
the national House of Bishops. Croneberger will become the diocesan
bishop in February 2000 when Spong retires to join the faculty of
the Harvard Divinity School.

   The Newark diocese is one of the largest in the United States,
with 124 congregations and about 40,000 worshipers. By electing
someone from within the diocese, church and lay leaders sent a
clear message that they had grown tired of the public glare.
Croneberger had been rector of the Church of the Atonement for 18
years and was known throughout the Newark diocese for helping to
create a sort of peer counseling group for his fellow priests.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Croneberger, the diocese did not take the
opportunity to elect the first openly gay bishop. One of the
candidates on the final ballot was the Rev. Gene Robinson, an
assistant to Bishop Douglas Theuner of the Diocese of New
Hampshire. Robinson, who was once married and has two daughters,
now lives with a man.
</P>
<P>
   Croneberger grew up in Schuylkill Haven, a town in the coal
region of Pennsylvania. His father, who worked as an insurance
agent, was a licensed lay reader. He would take his son Jack with
him to churches throughout the coal region, where he led morning
prayer services. Jack Croneberger headed straight for the
priesthood, and today still wears his father's silver cross.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., he
attended Virginia Seminary and was ordained at the age of 24. He
returned to Pennsylvania, where he was assigned to a church near
Scranton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, he met his wife, Marilyn, who was then a young widow
with three daughters. She was a member of a neighboring
congregation, and a mutual acquaintance took her to Croneberger's
church to meet him. They married, he adopted her daughters and they
had a son and another daughter.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, Croneberger supported equal rights for all
parishioners but did not support ordination of gay priests. Then
his son announced that he was gay. ``It wasn't until I was faced
with my own family situation,'' he said, ``that I went back to look
at that issue again.''
</P>
<P>
   Croneberger now supports the ordination of gay priests. He and
his wife have been active for several years in a group of parents
with gay children. Both their son and their youngest daughter, who
is a lesbian, are in committed relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting it all together, I came to a better place,''
Croneberger said. ``I can claim to be a person of faith. The Bible
has some misunderstandings about homosexuality.''

 BURE DEAL DISCUSSED AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<P>
   DALLAS _ The New York Islanders have what the Canucks want. And
on Friday, Brian Burke, the Vancouver general manager, came all the
way to Texas trying to get it.
</P>
<P>
   One day after scouting the Devils in New Jersey, Burke arrived
at the Islanders' hotel here and is believed to have met with Mike
Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general manager, to discuss a a
trade of the unsigned Islander Zigmund Palffy to Vancouver for
Pavel Bure, the disgruntled star who has refused to join the
Canucks. It would not have been the first time Burke and Milbury
discussed such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, who watched the Islanders lose their third straight game,
4-2, to the Stars at Reunion Arena on Friday night, said his first
preference is to swap Bure for an elite player. Palffy, a
three-time 40-goal scorer, is in that category. Speculation was
that Burke was looking for a second Islander in addition to Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get a good deal, we'll pull the trigger,'' said Burke,
who would not detail any discussions he has had with the Islanders
for Bure. ``If we don't, he's going to sit all year. There is no
time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   More than five teams are interested in acquiring Bure, Burke
said. He scouted the Flyers on Tuesday, the Capitals on Wednesday
and the Devils on Thursday. But since the Islanders are the only
team with an top-echelon player to offer, it would seem they are
the front-runners to get the flashy Bure, who has scored 60 goals
twice.
</P>
<P>
   A player of Bure's or Palffy's caliber might have helped the
slumping Islanders, who were outclassed by the talented Stars on
Friday night. Early in the third period, the Islanders cut the
Stars' lead to 3-2 on a goal by Mariusz Czerkawski, who scored his
fifth goal in four games, but they could get no closer. Wade
Flaherty, who started in goal for the Islanders, made 22 saves. Ed
Belfour made 15 stops for the defensive-minded Stars.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   KENNY JONSSON, the Islanders' top defenseman, did not dress,
because of the mild concussion he sustained against the Avalanche
last Tuesday. He is questionable for Saturday night's game in
Nashville, Tenn. ... Left wing JOE SACCO missed his fourth game
with a sore wrist. He may return to the lineup on Saturday.

THESE AREN'T THE TROJANS WE KNOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Something was missing from the buildup to today's
Trojans-Bruins football game. Namely, the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans as we've come to know and love them, or hate them,
or love to hate them. The arrogant, swaggering, wanna-step-outside?
Trojans. The Trojans with the horse, the statue and that infernal
fight song.
</P>
<P>
   Those Trojans, who played their annual roles to the macho
extreme, grandly puffing on cigars while the Bruins complained that
the smoke was aggravating their asthma.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been the same without those Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, if you root passionately not for one school or the
other but for the rivalry itself, you're cheering for USC to upset
UCLA this afternoon at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Bruins can do without the old, tough-talking Trojans,
but the rivalry can't.
</P>
<P>
   This occurred to me a few days ago, at Paul Hackett's on-campus
lunch with the press, when the rookie USC coach made the startling
admission that the Trojans ought to _ on paper _ lose to their
cross-town rivals for the eighth straight season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cases, this is a clear-cut mismatch,'' Hackett said.
``What makes this game different is that it's USC-UCLA and it's got
that emotion. In a game like this we might get lucky. I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the John Wayne Trojans became the Trojans of Marion
Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky? Since when do the Trojans just hope to get lucky? Is that
how they won eight national titles and four Heisman Trophies?
</P>
<P>
   Any more talk like this, and they'll have to replace
``Conquest'' with ``Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said the Trojans are getting good but the Bruins are
already there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've built for five years to get to where they are. They
are absolutely at the top of their game. The nation recognizes
that. The city recognizes that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said that whereas USC has been playing well against
strong passing teams, UCLA will be better balanced than those
opponents and therefore tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said it was ``exciting'' to watch videotape of Cade
McNown (``multidimensional'') and tailback DeShaun Foster (``as
impressive as any freshman runner in the country'') and the Bruins'
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said the Bruins' defense is ``one of the most
sophisticated in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   He sounded like Lou Holtz, habitually building up the next
opponent. Or Terry Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Hackett was laying it on thick, he also was
telling the truth. UCLA (9-0 and ranked third in The Associated
Press poll) obviously will beat USC (7-3 and unranked) if each team
plays its game. But was there more to what Hackett was saying?
</P>
<P>
   Was he delivering a message to the USC alumni, trying to lower
the expectations of those who judge the team from year to year
based on the UCLA game? Was he also delivering a message to USC
players, casting them in the underdog role for motivational
purposes?
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was, he began quoting UCLA superlatives from a stack
of stat sheets. In other words, just the facts, UCLA is better.
</P>
<P>
   He also admitted: ``There are so many ways to motivate
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Since when do the Trojans rely on psychological tricks?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they really have been humbled by seven consecutive losses
to the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   In which case, there's only one remedy, and that's a Trojans win
that, given what's at stake for the Bruins, would instantly go down
as one of the great twists in the 70-year-old series.
</P>
<P>
   It would restore the Trojans to their big, bad former glory. It
would restore the noble purpose to the Bruins' annual quest _ to
stuff a sock in their boastful rivals.
</P>
<P>
   This might strike some of you as silly, discussing who
!ital!should!off! win instead of who will. But it happens a lot
these days.
</P>
<P>
   At each of the three biggest sports events I covered this year,
much of the talk beforehand was about how it ought to turn out. And
in each case, it turned out ``right.'' Long-suffering John Elway
won his Super Bowl; Real Quiet was nosed out of a Triple Crown and
joined the list of history's lovable losers; the Yankees swept the
World Series to answer questions about their place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we care? Maybe it's because sports, under TV's influence,
seems to be as much a performance as a competition these days; a
``good ending'' is part of the show. Maybe it's because, as sports
tradition erodes, we're more concerned about protecting the history
that remains. Maybe it's because we're saturated with ``who's going
to win'' analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, who should win USC-UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Trojan diehards will root their way. They'd get no satisfaction
from watching the Bruins bring a national championship to Los
Angeles. They're hoping that hurricane returns to Miami just in
time for the Bruins' game there in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins diehards will root their way. They'd get no satisfaction
from the drama of a Trojans victory. They're hoping Tommy Trojan
suffers a terminal case of rust.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who root for the rivalry. We'll cheer for
USC to upset UCLA this afternoon at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In a comeback. Back from wherever the Trojans have been.

JETS PLAN TO DISRUPT THE OILERS' DISRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ A powerful and confident New York Jets attack
rehearsed the two-minute drill Friday for the all-or-nothing
Tennessee Oilers defense. If it works for the Jets when the teams
meet Sunday in Nashville, Tenn., they will decode the strategy that
has helped the Oilers win three straight games and five of their
last six.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just put more guys up there than you can block,'' Jets
coach Bill Parcells said. ``It's the old disruption game. Who can
disrupt who the most? If you can make plays, then you have a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   That disruption game worked remarkably well against Pittsburgh
twice in the last three weeks. The Oilers (6-4) held the Steelers'
Jerome Bettis to a total of 55 yards in generating two victories.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is the Jets' Curtis Martin's turn to try to move on the
ground against the staunch Tennessee defense. Jeff Fisher, the
coach of the Oilers, learned under the legendary defensive guru
Buddy Ryan at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets (6-4), though, have become a confident offensive force,
having been held to fewer than 20 points only twice this season. If
Martin can find cutback lanes, which the Oilers have been
successfully sealing, then he has only open road ahead since the
defensive backfield is understaffed.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the defenses the Jets have faced, the Oilers stack
eight or nine players in the ``box'' _ the imaginary area between
the tackles, extending back to the linebackers. In that scheme
their middle linebacker, Joe Bowden, is their leading tackler, and
he can also put pressure on the quarterback. There is, however,
only one player with as many as two sacks on the defense, tackle
Josh Evans, who is also one of the team's top tacklers.
</P>
<P>
   Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde faced the Oilers twice a year
for five seasons, first with Cleveland and then with Baltimore. He
started seven games against Houston and threw for 14 touchdowns,
with eight interceptions. His teams were 4-3 over the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get your opportunities against them, but you have to
be careful in what you do,'' Testaverde said. ``They can create big
plays for themselves with their blitzes. They wouldn't do it if
they didn't feel comfortable in their own ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Jumbo Elliott, the Jets' left tackle, said: ``Those multiple
fronts require you to be on your toes and do your homework. You can
do some things, though, if you pick it up the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   For Keyshawn Johnson, the box, or whatever it's called, is
irrelevant. ``I've got to get open,'' the receiver said. ``Not
because they've got nine men on Curtis; I'll get open because I'm
good enough to get open.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' offense has been flexing its muscles since Testaverde
took over from Glenn Foley. The only game under Testaverde it
failed to produce more than 20 points on its own came in last
Sunday's 1-point loss to the Colts, when Aaron Glenn galloped to
his record 104-yard return of an attempted field goal.
</P>
<P>
   That game, however, was marked by uncharacteristic drops by
Johnson and Wayne Chrebet, as well as by tight end Fred Baxter, who
also failed to keep his feet in bounds on a sure touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approach we have to take to the game,'' Parcells said,
``is `Can you make them play the way you want, or will they make
you play the way they want to play?' You play the way they want to
play, you don't have much of a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt University, where the game will be played, was one of
seven college coaching stops for BILL PARCELLS, who was defensive
coordinator there in 1973-74. ``It was a school that had not won,
but we got to a bowl game,'' he said. About a dozen of his former
players will visit him Saturday night, Parcells said. ... TERRY
DAY's comeback attempt has not worked out following his off-season
knee surgery from a basketball injury. The second-year defensive
lineman was given a three-week trial. Asked what he had shown,
Parcells replied, ``Not much.'' He added, speaking about Day's
reaction to suiting up again: ``I've had some players like this.
They're so used to limping, they limp.'' The Jets will continue to
pay Day, step up his rehabilitation and hope he can make it next
year. ... The Jets will wear a football logo with the name ``Weeb''
on the helmet for the rest of the season. It honors Weeb Ewbank,
the architect of the Super Bowl III championship team, who died on
Tuesday. ... Parcells described Thursday's practice as better than
Wednesday's. He was, overall, very muted in his daily news
conferences. The playoff race is on.
