JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua)-- The African National

<P>
Speaking to more than 3000 people at the opening ceremony,

people who had been oppressed and despised.
</P>

He said: ''A people denied, a history suppressed, an
experience spurned have at last occupied their space. From now
onwards, many things can never be the same again.''

Without all that had been recorded in this archives, South
Africa ''could not be what it is today and would never achieve
the glory in future that is its due'', said the South African
deputy president.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki was standing in for president Nelson Mandela, who was
reportedly attending to business arising from friday's meeting
with traditional leaders in Kwazulu/Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the first section of the archives opened
to the public is the records of the Solomon Mahlangu Freedom
College set up by the ANC in Tanzania in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The archives will show to people all the records from the
ANC's inception in 1912 to the achievement of democracy in South
Africa, including the organization's hard times in exile.

cabinet ministers and former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Speed Up Energy Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is speeding up its efforts
to triple its energy output over the next 15 years in a bid to
cope with looming energy shortages.
</P>
<P>
By including one or two 1,066-megawatt nuclear power plants to
the existing potential and building 185 conventional plants,
Turkey plans to increase its total output from the current 93
billion kilowatt hours to 333 billion kilowatt hours by the year
of 2010, the Anatolia news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the annual rise in the country's energy
consumption had gone up to 10 percent from the average 8 percent,
causing potential shortages which make officials worry.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's first nuclear power plant is projected to be built
near the Mediterranean port city of Mersin. United States,
Canadian, German, British and Argentine firms have submitted
projects with up-to-date technology for the power plant.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia said the preliminary studies would be concluded in
the coming months and international bids would be invited
shortly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the site of the second planned nuclear power plant
is yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted official sources as saying that 185
conventional power plants, including lignite-burning, natural
gas-burning and hydroelectric power stations would be completed by
2010.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Official Criticizes Arab League on Water Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 17 (xinhua) -- Mehmet Golhan, deputy chairman of
Turkey's governing True Path Party, criticized the Arab League
for its "unfair" attitude toward Turkey on the disputed Euphrates
waters.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Arab League's call to freeze the Southeast
Anatolia Project (GAP) before starting talks with the two
downstream Arab countries, Iraq and syria, Golhan said at a press
conference today that not only Turkey but also the whole world was
proud of this huge project.
</P>
<P>
"Did our Islamic brothers mistake themselves for the
International Court of Justice in the Hague?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
He continued that the "unfair" attitude of Arab League was
aimed at putting Turkey as the side which was against dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to cooperate with our neighbors," said Golhan,
former defense minister.
</P>
<P>
He explained that his country had proposed tripartite regional
talks with Iraq and Syria, but the proposal was categorically
rejected by these two countries.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Iraq have claimed that by building several dams
inside Turkey on the Euphrates, only less and polluted water is
allowed to the downstream countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries insist on taking the dispute to
international platform.

LAGOS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States' observers
monitoring the local government elections in Nigeria said today

<HEADLINE> Swazi King Excludes Opposition From Reviewing Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's King Mswati III
today denied reports that he had invited opposition leaders to
join a special committee to review the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"It's a rumor. The speculation is baseless," the king was
quoted by the South African Press Association (SAPA) as telling a
press conference in Mbabane, capital of Swaziland, on his return
from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"All the Swazi citizens, except the banned opposition groups,
will be invited to submit views on a new constitution," he added.
</P>
<P>
The SAPA report said the speculation might come from Deputy
Prime Minister Sishayi Nxumalo's recent statement.
</P>
<P>
Nxumalo had said that all Swazis, including members of the banned
political organisations, are entitled to make submissions.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is the only Southern African country where political
parties are banned. Mswati's father, late King Sobhuza II,
outlawed all political activities in 1973.
</P>
<P>
However, after Saturday's talks with South African President
Nelson Mandela, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Botswana
President Ketumile Masire in Pretoria, Mswati said Swaziland's
existing constitution would be reviewed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of Bosnian Serb
parliament Momcilo Krajisnik held talks with the international
community's High Representative for Bosnia Carl Bildt in Pale
today to discuss the further implementation of the civilian part
of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the Serb speaker said he discussed with
Bildt about the release of persons, the need of protecting the
Serbs remaining in Sarajevo and their property and the problem of
taking care of Sarajevo serb refugees.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Serbs have left five Sarajevo suburbs
which are being transferred to Muslim-Croat federation rule under
the peace agreement, many of them have become refugees without
home and food.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said he had stressed equal treatment to both
Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat federation, the two entities
in Bosnia, and that Serb representatives should take part in all
future talks.
</P>
<P>
Bildt, meanwhile, told reporters after the talks that he had
briefed Krajisnik on the agenda of the upcoming meetings to be
held on Monday in Geneva and on Saturday in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva meeting is to group presidents of Serbia Slobodan
Milosevic, Croatia Franjo Tudjman and Bosnian acting president
Ejup Ganic under the chairmanship of U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, foreign ministers of the Contact Group -- U.S.,
Russian, France, Britain and Germany -- are to meet with their
counterparts from Yugoslavia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Bildt also said that he had talked about the northeastern
Bosnian town of Brcko with the Republika Srpska Representatives,
emphasizing that it was a complicated issue which should be
resolved as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Under Dayton peace accord, the status of Brcko is to be

<HEADLINE> S.Leone's Rebels Agree To Month-Long Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's military
government has reached a month-long ceasefire agreement with the
rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), state radio said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"The RUF leader, Foday Sankoh, is now prepared to hold a
summit meeting with Head of State Brigadier General Julius Maada
Bio," said the radio report.
</P>
<P>
"No date has yet been set for the meeting, but Cote D'ivoire's
Foreign Minister Amara Essy has promised that his government
intend to broker the peace talks," it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the results of the second round of the presidential
election, held last Friday, is yet to be announced by the Central
Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
Observers say they wonder what the ceasefire and the summit
talks would mean.
</P>
<P>
Pending publication of the election results, the military
administration is expected to hand over power to a civilian
government within the next 21 days.
</P>
<P>
And the rebels, who had vowed that they refuse to hold any
peace talks with a civilian government, gave no reason for their
ceasefire decision.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 when Sankoh's RUF rebels started their rebellion
against the government, over 30,000 lives have been claimed by
the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The war also produced over 30,000 refugees and displaced half
of the West African state's population of 4.2 million.

<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to give 500,000 pounds
(750,000 US dollars) to help repair water supplies and sewage
systems in the cities of Najaf and Kufa in southern Iraq, it was
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The grant, from the Overseas Development Administration, is
expected to be announced by Baroness Chalker, the aid minister,
this week in a speech to the Commonwealth Engineers Council
calling for attention to critical water shortages facing the
world.
</P>
<P>
Britain takes the move following evidence that disease is
increasing in the two cities, where 470,000 people rely on
untreated river water.
</P>
<P>
Since the Gulf war Iraq's infrastructure, badly damaged by
bombing raids, remains unrepaired, especially in those regions
where opposition to the government is suspected.
</P>
<P>
The Najaf-Kufa water plant is said to be working at only 35 per
cent capacity and public health is deteriorating, with an increase
in water-borne disease.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Overseas Development Administration said
that the the grant was designed to ensure that the aid was
spent on humanitarian purposes, and could not be diverted by the
Iraqi government.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- At least one Bangladeshi was killed
and 40 others were injured here today as the ninth day of the
opposition-called strike-like non-cooperation movement passed with
sporadic incidents of bomb explosion and clashes between rival
political activists.
</P>
<P>
The dead was an unidentified man of about 20 years old, who was
killed when three hand-made bombs exploded inside a running
minibus which then overturned, police confirmed, adding that about
20 passengers on the minibus were injured and admitted to
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
In a similar incident, eight people were injured when a bomb
was hurled onto another minibus as it came near an opposition
rally, who were dispersed by the police using tear gas and batons,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
At Mohakhali area, rival political activists were locked in an
hour-long clash in the morning and two auto-rickshaws were set
ablaze.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition parties led by the Awami (People's)
League have launched the indefinite non-cooperation movement since
March 9 in a bid to press the demand for cancellation of the
ruling party-held February 15 elections, resignation of the
Khaleda Zia cabinet and holding of fresh polls under a neutral
caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Despite an announcement of the inauguration of the sixth
parliament elected through the February 15 polls, the opposition
has vowed to intensify the "people's movement" to realize their
demands.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Continue Closure, Delay Hebron Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said here today that only if he knew the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) would continue to operate effectively
against Islamic extremists, he would consider lifting the
closure.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed the closure on the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
on February 25 when Hamas activists carried out suicide bombing
attacks in Jerusalem and Ashkelon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the weekly cabinet meeting, Peres also said that
if leading extremists were not captured by the PNA, Israel will
not pull out from most part of Hebron next week as stipulated in
the Israel-PLO interim agreement.
</P>
<P>
Although he was fiercely criticized by left-wing Meretz
ministers Yossi Sarid and Shulamit Aloni at the meeting, Peres
attacked not only the Islamic extremists, but also the PNA and
the general Palestinian population.
</P>
<P>
He said that the PNA has brought upon itself the Israeli
measures with such behavior with Yasser Arafat calling for a
Jihad (holy war) for Jerusalem and paying a condolence visit to
the family of Hamas bomb master Yihye Ayyash, who many
Palestinians believe was assassinated by Israeli secret agents.
</P>
<P>
Peres also said that he considers deportation of family
members of Islamic extremist terrorists if they support
anti-Israeli violent activities.
</P>
<P>
If such a proposal is made, it will first be brought to the
inner security cabinet, he said.
</P>
<P>
A cabinet statement issued today also said that Israeli
demolishing of homes of suicide bombers will continue.
</P>
<P>
Israel today further eased the closure on the Gaza Strip,
allowing a number of Israeli trucks carrying food and various
supplies to enter the Gaza Strip. Some 500 Palestinian workers were
also allowed today to work inside Israel in areas near the Erez
checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Israeli security forces and the
Palestinian police continue their search for Islamic Jihad
activists and sympathizers. The Palestinian police arrested 15
Islamic Jihad members this morning in two Gaza
neighborhoods.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Proposes to Exchange Prisoners with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The secretary general of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or God of Party, has reiterated a
proposal to exchange the prisoners jailed by Israel with two
bodies of Israeli soldiers still in Hezbollah's hand.
</P>
<P>
The "Voice of Lebanon" radio reported this afternoon that
Hassan Nasrallah r-stated the proposal in an interview with the
Arab-language magazine, Al-Wasat, which will be published Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was not the first time for the pro-Iranian militant
party to suggest the exchange of the detainees in Israeli
prisons with the two Israeli soldiers' bodies which Hezbollah
seized in 1980s, but the suggestion has repeatedly refused by
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
According to official Israeli information, two Israeli
soldiers, Yossi Fink and Rahamin Alsheikh, died after their
capture by Hezbollah guerrillas in an ambush in south Lebanon
on February 17, 1986.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah said that contacts have been carried out through the
Red Cross International Committee between Hezbollah and the
Israeli client militia, the South Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
He denied that Hezbollah operates at orders from Iran,
stressing that the party is an Islamic movement existing on
the Lebanese land.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah "is part of the Lebanese people," he said, "and
is working for their cause."
</P>
<P>
"We respect very much the Islamic republic in Iran, but
our decision is the decision of ourselves," the Hezbollah
leader underlined.
</P>
<P>
"We look at Iran as a religious place out of the
framework of Iran's system and its institutions," Nasrallah
added.

<HEADLINE> Liu Huaqing Called on PLA to Support China's Development Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- General Liu Huaqing today urged
the People's Liberation Army to further increase its military
capabilities in an effort to safeguard the achievements of China's
trans-century development goals.
</P>
<P>
Liu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), called on
both PLA officers and men to carry out the guidelines of the
Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC),
which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
Attending a meeting held by a delegation of PLA deputies to the
session, Liu said all the PLA deputies had performed their duties
well and fulfilled all topics on the session's agenda.
</P>
<P>
"With their political enthusiasm and serious and responsible
attitude, the deputies carried forward democracy, spoke their mind
and set forth many constructive suggestions to show the good image
of our army, which is signified by its attention to the party
spirit, unity and discipline," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the deputies were keen in observing, analyzing and
coping with problems while deliberating reports at the session.
They affirmed the country's achievements and faced up to problems
as masters of their country in exploring ways of enlivening the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
While reporting on various contradictions involving army
building, the deputies showed their understanding for the
country's difficulties in support of the nation's overall economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The plenary meeting has sketched a magnificent blueprint for
the socialist modernization drive to the end of this century and
in early next century, Liu said, adding that the plenum is of
great significance to promotion of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and the invigoration and development of the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Liu praised the outline and the report by Premier Li Peng as
"embodying the determination and strategy" of running the country
set by the third-generation collective leadership with Jiang Zemin
at the core.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the talk by Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the
CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military
Commission, concerning army building given on March 11 is of great
importance for the people's army to better perform its duties and
promote its revolutionization and modernization and turn itself a
regular army. "We must study Jiang's speech conscientiously, and
implement its guidelines earnestly.
</P>
<P>
On relaying the guidelines of the NPC session, he added, the
PLA men and officers should concentrate on several leading issues
when studying the report by Premier Li Peng, the principal
document of the outgoing NPC session:
</P>
<P>
-- acquiring a full understanding of the remarkable
achievements that have been scored in China's national economy and
social development;
</P>
<P>
-- taking an overall and dialectical view in analyzing and
appraising both domestic and international situation and the
country's achievements and problems;
</P>
<P>
-- bearing in mind the goals, guiding principles and main tasks
for the national economic and social development in the Ninth
Five-Year Plan and the coming 15 years. He also pledged the firm
support by the PLA to reforms and an active part the army will
take in the country's economic construction; and
</P>
<P>
-- increasing a sense of responsibilityes and urgency and
strengthening army building, so as to provide a reliable guarantee
for the security of the country's reform, opening-up and
modernization program.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's extremist groups today
threatened to harm the German interest if the arrest warrant for
Iranian information minister is not retreated, a press report
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ansar-e Hizbollah, a riotous and frightening group in the
country, declared that it will stage demonstrations in front of
the German embassy in Tehran Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the group said that they consider impudence of
one of courts in Germany against one of officials of the Islamic
system.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of the arrest warrant is violation of the
national sovereignty, independence of the Islamic nation and
violation of national security of Iran, he said.

<P>
The extremist group held frequent demonstrations in Tehran
University, mosques and other public places in the past months,
thus becoming once again the talk of the town and the attention
of domestic and foreign circles.
</P>
<P>
Besides demonstrations, today's evening paper, Kayhan,
threatened in its editorial that Iran would mobilize the Islamic
world against Germany and take German's provision of chemical
weapons to Iraq during the war with Iran to the international
court.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here said that the issue will undoubtedly
affect the good relations enjoyed between the two countries. But
they ruled out that the issue would ever trigger a full-scale war
of words between Tehran and Bonn, because of extensive
multi-billion dollar commercial links.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry deplored the arrest warrant issued by
the German Federal Prosecutor's office against Iranian information
minister charged with ordering the killing of four members of
Iran's Kurdish opposition in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported this morning that
the case against Iran's Information Minister Ali Fallahian was
not the least corroborated by evidence.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman of Iran's Foreign Ministry, was
quoted as saying "there was absolutely no evidence on file
pending in the said court that adduced to the Iranian officials
having been involved in it."
</P>
<P>
"The issue of Iran's involvement in the subject of that file
had been brought up by international elements and as the result
of insinuations by various hostile groups that sought to strain
relations between Iran and Germany," he noted.
</P>
<P>
After four members of Iran's Kurdish opposition were found
murdered in a Berlin restaurant in 1992, the relations between
Iran and Germany had gone through periodic crises.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told Xinhua that there was a tacit
agreement between Iran and Germany that Bonn would no longer talk
of Iranian involvement in the killing of four Kurds in exchange
for the release of a German national accused of spying against
Iran.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, 1994, the German national, Helmut Szimkus, who was
sentenced to death by an Iranian court on charges of spying for
Iraq, was released by Iranian authorities after appeals by German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Offers Loans to Rural People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Nepal is working to create job
opportunities for rural people by providing credit facilities to
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) engaged in employment
generation work.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 employment generation programs are being implemented by
such NGOs throughout the country, the official news agency RSS
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Finance Ministry, such NGOs had been granted
permission to carry out financial business by Nepal Rastra Bank,

500,000 rupees (less than 10,000 US dollars) through the
government -established Rural Self-reliance Fund, RSS said.
</P>
<P>
Under such programs, these private financial institutions could

It was said that poor families in rural areas were main users
of the loans under these employment generation programs.

services, the RSS report said.

<HEADLINE> Mountain of Fresh Food Destroyed in EU Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union ordered the
destruction of 2.5 million tons of fresh fruit and vegetables last
year to keep prices for farmers artificially high, the Sunday
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an unpublished report, the newspaper said that the EU
paid farmers 500 million pounds (750 million US dollars) at
taxpayers costs for the food dug into trenches.
</P>
<P>
The destruction of the `surplus' produce is part of the EU's
farm subsidy scheme, the common agricultural policy, under which
food prices are protected.
</P>
<P>
The food was destroyed despite a pledge from the European
Commission three years ago that it would curb the costs and waste.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, the agriculture secretary of the
Labour Party, Llin Golding, said: "These figures prove that the
present fruit and vegetable regime is a scandal marked by waste
and fraud and at a high cost of the British taxpayer and the
consumer."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Consumers in Europe Group was also
quoted as saying that the public found it incomprehensible
that their money was being used to throw away good food.
</P>
<P>
"It is ludicrous that low-income families are unable to
afford to buy fresh fruit and vegetables because the prices
are kept so high while cheaper, less perfect produce is
being kept off the market," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Invest Two Billion Pounds in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Giant South Korean groups will
announce 2.2 billion pounds (roughly 3.3 billion US dollars) of
investments in Britain in the next few weeks, according to reports
here today.
</P>
<P>
It will be the largest influx of forein capital into
Britain since the Japanese started building car factories
here in the 1980s, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Lucky Goldstar (LG), one of the four huge South Korean
conglomerates, is scouting the country for a site for a
1.5-billion-pound plant to make semiconductors and consumer
electronics. It will be the largest single foreign investment in
UK, outstripping even the Nissan car factory in northeast England.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo, meanwhile, is planning to team up with America's
Texas Instruments to build a 700-million-pound microchip
plant in Northern Ireland, where it already makes video
recorders. The new factory will be on a much larger scale.
</P>
<P>
The two investments are expected to create as many as
10,000 jobs in the long run, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The latest investments follow the decision by Samsung in 1994
to invest 450 million pounds in a new electronics plant at
Billingham, Cleveland. The factory was opened earlier this year
and is expected to create at least 3,000 new jobs over a five-year
period.
</P>
<P>
Samsung is also planning to build a car factory in Europe,
possibly in collaboration with Nissan. Although the site for the
factory has not been decided, UK investment specialists are
confident that it will be in Britain.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, as part of a seven-billion-pound overseas
expansion drive, Hyundai, the South Korean industrial combine, is
already planning a British microship plant costing 850 million
pounds.
</P>
<P>
UK investment specialists are confident that South korea and
other Asian economic tigers will now provide new investment on
scale that flowed in from Japan in the last decade, according to
the report.

<HEADLINE> APEC Finance Ministers End Meeting, Emphasizing Sound  Macro-economic Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KYOTO, Japan, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Finance Ministers from the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum ended their two-day
meeting here today with reaffirming that sound macro-economic policies
remain the key to securing sustained, dynamic growth in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The APEC finance ministers met today in Kyoto, Japan to discuss
broad economic challenges facing the region, including
macro-economic and financial stability," said a joint statement by
the ministers at the end of today's discussions.
</P>
<P>
"Where there is potential overheating, policy-makers need to
respond appropriately by a mix of restrained macro-economic
policies," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The 18 APEC ministers, along with International Monetary Fund
Chief Michel Camdessus, exchanged views on four topics at the
session -- current macro-economic issues, financial and capital
markets, mobilizing resources for infrastructure development, and
the effects of exchange rate movement on trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the ministers made some findings and agreed
on several initiatives in critical areas, the 27-point statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The findings "will broadly guide" their voluntary efforts in
pursuing key policy objectives of stable capital flows, domestic
financial and capital market development, and mobilizing private
resources for infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers welcomed the stabilization of currency
markets which began last summer following a large fluctuation in
the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the yen that did not
reflect economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
While saying capital flows into Asian markets contribute to the
development of the regional economy, they admitted that there are
"clearly" macroeconomic and financial risks, especially if flows
reflect distorted incentives or unsustainable imbalances.
</P>
<P>
To avoid such risks, the finance ministers stressed the
importance of adopting policies contributing to stable capital
flows and fostering domestic financial and capital market
development.
</P>
<P>
Dynamic economic development will continue in the region in
the medium term and generate huge demand for infrastructure
development, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The APEC economies need to mobilize private resources and
achieve coordination of public and private resources for
infrastructure development, it said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, prudent macro-economic management and in many
cases, regulatory and institutional changes are also necessary, it
added.
</P>
<P>
On the effects of exchange rate movement on regional trade and
investment, the finance ministers stressed in the statement that
"the key role for policymakers is to put in place sound
macroeconomic policies" in addressing real currency misalignment.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers agreed to hold their fourth meeting in
the Philippines next year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Rules out Imposing Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Begum
Khaleda Zia today ruled out imposing emergency, hoping that the
dispute between the government and the opposition would be over
after the passage of a non-party caretaker government in the first
session of the newly-elected sixth parliament beginning March 19.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made this remark this afternoon when she
exchanged views with a group of journalists.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the government would impose emergency,
Khaleda replied in the negative, saying that "at the moment, we
are not thinking of imposing emergency."
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) held the sixth
parliamentary elections on February 15 despite all opposition
parties' boycott.
</P>
<P>
Since then the opposition has launched strikes and indefinite
non-cooperation movement to press their demand for cancellation of
the February 15 polls, resignation of the BNP government and
holding of a fresh sixth parliamentary election under a neutral
caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
But the government side has kept its position that the next
general elections must be held after the passage of the caretaker
government bill at the newly-elected sixth parliament.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reiterated that the bill would be passed in
the first session of the sixth parliament beginning Tuesday and
after the passage, a referendum on it would take place as required
by the constitution, paving the way for holding the seventh
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Asked what would be the position if the opposition is not
satisfied even after the passage of the bill, Khaleda pointed out
that it was the opposition who had demanded provision of a
non-party caretaker government in the constitution for conducting
future elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Abishevich Nazarbayev today welcomed his Russian counterpart Boris
Yeltsin's denunciation of the Russian State Duma's decision to
restore the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).
</P>
<P>
According to a statement obtained by Xinhua today, Nazarbayev
said that the Russia's Duma's decision to restore the Soviet Union
is aimed at destroying the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) by creating an uneasy atmosphere among its member states.
</P>
<P>
He said Kazakhstan will never give up its own sovereignty and
independence.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh president said the CIS has to take the road of
integration, in which any attempts to hinder it will be useless.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Kazakhstan and Russia, which are working for
integration in the fields of social economy and humanism, plan to
sign an agreement late March to bring the integration to a new
stage.
</P>
<P>
The integration will be carried out based on equality, mutual
respect of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity,
said the president.
</P>
<P>
Russia's State Duma (lower house) ratified a resolution last
Friday which declares as illegal the December 1991 Russian vote
that made formal the breakup of the USSR into 15 independent
states.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Yeltsin Saturday denounced the resolution,
calling it a betrayal of Russia and a threat to peace.

FUZHOU, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's coastal province

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily, the leading
newspaper in China, carries an editorial tomorrow to hail the
successful conclusion of the current annual sessions of China's
top legislature and advisory body.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth Session of the National People's Congress (NPC) and
the Fourth Session of the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) ended in
Beijing on March 17 and March 13 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The editorial notes that the two sessions have made historical
contributions to China's reform, opening-up and modernization
drive.
</P>
<P>
During their examinations of and discussions on the Outline of
China's Ninth Five-Year (1996-2000) for National Economic and
Social Development and Long-Range Goals for the Year 2010 and
Premier Li Peng's report on the Outline, both NPC deputies and
CPPCC members spoke highly of the outline and the report.
</P>
<P>
They cited the report and outline as being "realistic" and
"inspiring", and as a "magnificent program" for the Chinese nation
to stride over the century, which is of significance to advancing
the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the
editorial notes.
</P>
<P>
The outline is China's first medium- and long-term development
plan formulated under the conditions of developing a socialist
market economy, and it is the outcome of democratic and scientific
policy-making and therefore represents the will and wisdom of the
people of all nationalities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of this outline is conducive to undertaking
matters of major importance by pooling efforts from various
sectors and symbolizes the general purpose of the Communist Party
and government to serve the people wholeheartedly and superiority
of the socialist system, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial defines the next 15 years as an important period
in the history of China's modernization drive, which forms a
linkage that inherits the past and forges ahead into the future.
</P>
<P>
According to the development plan for the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2010) and the blueprint for the goals for the year
2010 that have just been approved by the NPC session, China will
have achieved its second-phase goals for its modernization drive
by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The goals include quadrupling the 1980 per-capita GDP by the
year 2000, and subsequently doubling the 2000 GDP by the year
2010, thus establishing a relatively-developed socialist market
economic system, promoting socialist cultural and ideological
progress, improving the democratic legal system, and achieving
all-round social progress.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Committees Active in Southwest China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The committees of the Chinese
people's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at various
levels in southwest China's Yunnan Province are rendering a great
help in developing local economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
According an official of the the Yunnan Provincial CPPCC
Committee, the top provincial advisory body, over the past few
years the CPPCC committees at all levels have sponsored various
training courses in areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups, in
an effort to help them eliminate poverty.
</P>
<P>
The official said that 22 projects to aid the poor have been
launched with the help of local CPPCC committees members, mostly
specialists and scholars, in 17 prefectures or cities, thus
helping a considerable number of rural residents rise above the
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Members of CPPCC committee of the Yiliang County have sponsored
technical training courses on planting gastrodia elata, a valuable
 traditional Chinese herb. As a result, local farmers harvested
nearly 10,000 kg of the expensive herb last year.
</P>
<P>
Their colleagues in Yanjin County helped farmers become
prosperous by raising 600,000 nutritious black-boned chickens last
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CPPCC committees all over Yunnan have conducted
surveys and have put forward suggestions in the form of reports to
the provincial government on economic growth, science and
technology, affairs on minority ethnic groups, health, social
order and education, and many of the suggestions have been
accepted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the Provincial Committee of the CPPCC
has commended 280 model teachers in the remote mountainous areas
for their efforts to advance educational progress.
</P>
<P>
Last year it also organized a number of events to educate
people in patriotism, including the celebration activities on the
occasion of the 50th anniversary of the victory in the War of
Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui Causes Turmoil in Taiwan, Article Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- An article written by Tai Hai
today condemned Lee Teng-hui for creating turmoil in Taiwan by his
attempt at creating "Taiwan independence".
</P>
<P>
The article notes that more and more people in Taiwan are
criticizing Lee Teng-hui, saying that Lee's attempt to promote
"Taiwan independence" has directly affected the island's economic
growth and people's daily life.
</P>
<P>
Ever since Lee's visit to the United States last year, which
caused tension in the relations across the Taiwan Straits,
Taiwan's foreign exchange reserve has dropped to 89.6 billion US
dollars from 100.4 billion US dollars, and it is expected to
further decrease to 85 billion US dollars by the end of this
month. It is reported that over 18 billion US dollars worth of
funds have flown out of Taiwan since last July.
</P>
<P>
Being pessimistic about the island's economic prospects and in
anticipation of a serious depreciation of the Taiwan dollar,
recently people in Taiwan have been selling the local currency in
large quantities and rushing to purchase the US dollar and gold.
The transaction volume on the Taiwan foreign exchange market
exceeded 500 million US dollars on March 6, with many banks
running out of their foreign currency reserves. The number of gold
buyers also registered a three to four-fold increase.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan stock index saw a sharp drop of 129 points since
March 8, as investors worried about the worsening of relations
across the Straits. Despited a small rise by the end of last week
as the Taiwan authorities poured money to rescue the market, no one
is certain that the authorities' effort would save the market.
</P>
<P>
Due to Lee's reckless attempt to create "Taiwan independence,"
the economic environment of the island and its trade conditions
have deteriorated rapidly. Now 20 percent of the listed companies
are running in the red and cases of financial crisis and
bankruptcy occur one after another. Private consumption has
dropped to the lowest for the past 14 years, and a depression
takes place in the real estate business.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Taiwan's economy suffers most in the
worsening of relations across the Taiwan Straits and an
improvement of the economy mainly depends on easing the tension
across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
With a growing feeling of uncertainty, more and more people are
leaving Taiwan, with international flights of many airlines
oversubscribed.
</P>
<P>
Some people in Taiwan hold that Lee Teng-hui's visit to the
United States led to the change in the relations across the
Straits, which ignited and worsened the slowdown of Taiwan's
economy. They said the road to "Taiwan independence" is a "blind
alley" and will finally cause the ruin of Taiwan.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today announced
the approval of a 21.5 million US dollar credit for a Community
Infrastructure and National Housing Authority Strengthening
Project to benefit about 420,000 people living in low-income
communities throughout Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province
(NWFP).
</P>
<P>
According to a World Bank press release, the credit will be
provided by the International Development Association (IDA), the
World Bank's concessionary lending affiliate.
</P>
<P>
The government of Switzerland, which has been actively involved
in designing the project, will also contribute 3.45 million US
dollars through the Swiss Development Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Polluted ponds and solid waste accumulating in streets and
vacant lots are familiar sights in many communities throughout
NWFP. About half of all households have to rely on wells, rivers
or springs for drinking water. Unsurfaced roads and footpaths that
become impassable during rainy season are also common.
</P>
<P>
Through this project, the government will upgrade basic
infrastructure in about 55 urban and rural communities, said the
press release.

DHAKA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Movement of ships was normal at
Bangladesh's largest port of Chittagong today, which had been out

opposition enforced blockade.
</P>
<P>
According to an official release today, four ships entered the

caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
The operations of the ports have been disrupted severely for

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong -- 3rd Largest Market for Chinese Publications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has become the
world's third largest market for Chinese publications next to the
Chinese mainland and Taiwan Province, according to the Hong Kong
Publishing Federation (HKPF).
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 kinds of new Chinese books are published in Hong
Kong a year and more than 10,000 kinds of Chinese books are on
sale on Hong Kong's book market each year.
</P>
<P>
An HKPF official said Saturday that the development of the
publishing industry in Hong Kong was attributable to the
territory's economic development since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the approaching of 1997 when China will
resume its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, demand for
Chinese readings is rising.
</P>
<P>
He said that the prospects for Hong Kong's publishing industry
of Chinese books are bright. To promote the industry, HKPF is
now organizing the "'96 Book Fair" which has attracted more than
40 publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
The official said that about 8,000 kinds of books with over
100,000 copies are now on display at the fair, which started on
March 15 and runs through March 20.
</P>
<P>
Founded two years ago, HKPF has set up a committee to increase
contacts with the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region for a study of the publication of school
textbooks in Hong Kong after 1997.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Lifts Curfew on Southern City of Mallawi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has lifted a two-year-old
curfew on the southern city of Mallawi as the security situation
there has considerably improved, the Middle East News Agency
(MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Interior Minister Hassan Mohamed el-Alfy was quoted as
saying at a rally in the Upper Egyptian province of Minya that the
security situation in Mallawi, considered one of the strongholds
of Moslem extremists, has become stable.
</P>
<P>
The curfew had been imposed on Mallawi, Minya, for more than
two years because of recurrent terrorist acts in the city, which
is some 260 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist attacks, mostly on policemen and Christians, are
believed to have been carried out by suspected Islamic
fundamentalist militants, who have launched a violent campaign
since 1992 in an attempt to topple the secular government and
install strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
The security forces have cracked down on Moslem militants
fiercely and largely contained their terrorist acts, which have
only occurred sporadically in villages in the south.
</P>
<P>
Alfy said that measures will be taken immediately to resolve
all infrastructure and traffic problems in the city.

contribution and the remaining is raised from foreign aid
agencies and the government," the coordinator added.

<HEADLINE> China Pledges Continued Trade System Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KYOTO, Japan, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Finance Minister
Liu Zhongli said here today that China will continue to reform its
foreign trade system in line with the nation's opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the pledge at a two-day finance ministers meeting of
the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum now
under way in Kyoto, central Japan.
</P>
<P>
Liu told his APEC counterparts that China has abolished import
restrictions on 176 items following the announcement made by
President Jiang Zemin at last year's APEC economic leaders summit
to reduce import tariffs by 35.5 percent on average from April 1
this year.
</P>
<P>
"This represents another major initiative of our opening-up
policy," he said. "The substantial reduction in tariffs
accompanied by the abolishment of partial reduction and exemption
policies makes China's tariff system more transparent and more
compatible with the international practice."
</P>
<P>
The APEC finance chiefs are in a full-day session to review
macro-economic developments and market situations in the world's
fastest growing region, with stability in currencies among the 18
Pacific economies as the main focus of the discussions.
</P>
<P>
APEC recognizes economies and not sovereign states. The 18
members are Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hongkong, Indonesia,
Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the
Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Liu told the meeting that China adopted restrictive fiscal and
monetary policies last year in a bid to control inflation as its
major macro-economic objectives. "As a result, macro-economic
objectives have basically been achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to such achievements as continued steady increase of
budget revenues, improved financial order and a decrease in
consumer prices in China.
</P>
<P>
But the finance minister also mentioned his country's economic
problems including a "relatively high level of price increase,
weak agricultural sector...difficulties experienced by some
state-owned enterprises" and low efficiency of the industrial
sector.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese enterprises should further undergo
market-oriented reform and restructuring in order to improve
economic efficiency and strengthen their competitiveness in the
marketplace.

<HEADLINE> Somali Militiamen Storm into Port Merca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Somali Congress of
Somali National AllianceU (USC/SNA) has moved more than 13 armed
wagons and over 150 heavily armed men into Merca, a port 100 km
south of Mogadishu to vie with General Aidid's forces.
</P>
<P>
USC/SNA led by Osman Hassan Ali Atto characterized the move on
Saturday as a new measure to secure the safety of the port, an
economically important town which was formerly controlled by
militiamen of General Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Merca said tension in the town was high after
Osman Atto moved his troops into the port, but no shoot-out was
heard or road blocks erected by either side so far.
</P>
<P>
Mr Abdurahman Sheikh Ahmed (Foodadde), Deputy Chairman of
USC/SNA, said today discussions are continuing between supporters
of General Aidid and USC/SNA officials in Merca on the situation
there.
</P>
<P>
However, General Aidid's top lieutenants denied to speak about
the presence of the large number of militiamen opposing them in
the economically strategic town.
</P>
<P>
Mr Foodadde, speaking to reporters in his office in south
Mogadishu, said their militiamen have no intention of fighting or
capturing the port and he strongly denied widespread rumors that
his organization is planning to smuggle military hardware into
the country through Merca.
</P>
<P>
Mr Foodadde has also denied that his organization is trying to
stop the taxation program imposed by General Aidid in an effort
of weakening the slim economical status of General Aidid's
government.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out that his organization will share the tax
revenue collected from the business community with General Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Merca has been the major economical source for General Aidid's
government ever since the main seaport of Mogadishu was closed by
Osman Atto and Ali Mahdi Mohamed in October last year.
</P>
<P>
Huge banana exports have been continuing at Merca port where
General Aidid collects a large sum of hard currency.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A German technology company is
seeking Manila's support for its plan to set up an institute that
will train Filipinos to manufacture precision tools.
</P>
<P>
Erich Reichardt, chairman of the German-Asian Technology
Company, said today, "This is the technology behind the production
of quality parts and there is no manpower capable of making them
in the Philppines."
</P>
<P>
He said that molds and dies are used to produce more than 1,000
car parts, lathes, clinks, boring and cylindrical grinding tools,
and food processing machines.
</P>
<P>
Partly because of the virtual absence of such technology in the
country, German companies producing consumer electronic items and
precision and engineering products are discouraged from locating
here, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said his company is willing to put up 600 million pesos (24
million US dollars) for the project once the government provides a
site.
</P>
<P>
Construction is estimated to take at least three years to
complete.
</P>
<P>
Similar training institutes were set up in India, Indonesia,
Malaysia and Singapore in recent years to help locals acquire
skills in the manufacture of molds and dies.
</P>
<P>
Except for Vietnam, the Philippines is the only ASEAN country
without a facility to fully meet local demand for molds and dies.
</P>
<P>
Some 95 percent of molds and dies used in the country are
imported.

<HEADLINE> Rabin Makes Peace, But His Name Not Mean Peace in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 17 (Xinhua)-- Yitzhak Rabin, the late Israeli
prime minister who made historical peace accords between the
decades-old foes of Israelis and Palestinians, Israel and Jordan,
won honor and respect of the international community when he was
assassinated by a Jewish extremist on November 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The name of Yitzhak Rabin, however, does not always bring about
peace, although peace with Israel has been inked.
</P>
<P>
A seemingly trivial matter can well demonstrate this point: A
Jordanian farmer's naming of his 50-day-old son as Yitzhak Rabin
to show his respect for the Late Israeli prime minister and his
contribution to the Middle East peace process, did cause his
family a lot of troubles in the society, in which the majority is
still apprehensive of normalization of ties with the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Rajai Saeed, the farmer who worked in the governorate of
Madaba, a small city about 30 kilometers south of Amman, lost his
job after naming his son after the late Israeli
leader. Nevertheless, he insists that he will not change the name
regardless of any amounting pressure.
</P>
<P>
"I expect trouble when I named my son Yitzhak Rabin," Saeed
said.
</P>
<P>
"I will insist," said the father, who was kicked out of the
farm in Madaba after the naming and consequently lost his job.
</P>
<P>
"Rabin was our enemy, but we were his enemies, too," he
added. "He extended his hand to us for peace and broke the barrier
that separated us from the Israelis. He is a man that I respect."
</P>
<P>
The first of the troubles came immediately after his child was
born in Madaba, where, he said, the local civil registration
department refused to register his son under the name of Yitzhak
Rabin.
</P>
<P>
He said that the department officials told him it was illegal
to give a Jordanian child a Jewish name.
</P>
<P>
The department officials rejected the allegations, saying that
nothing in the law prevents citizens from choosing any name for
their children.
</P>
<P>
Director of the department, Zeid Bakhit, said: "If Mr. Saeed
insists on the name, we will register the child and all he has to
do is to come to us again."
</P>
<P>
"I was also beaten for it,'' said Saeed. His wife Fatemeh said
she had to defend her husband when a man they failed to identify
started beating him out of anger for naming their son Yitzhak
Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Although his claims can not be independently confirmed, it was
crystally-clear that Jordanians are not receptive of Saeed's
decision.
</P>
<P>
An editor of a local newspaper that covered the story said he
received lots of phone calls from readers who expressed anger and
disgust at Saeed's decision.
</P>
<P>
Some Jordanians who support the peace process are worried about
the sort of life the child will have as he grows up in the
society, where most still regard Yitzhak Rabin as an enemy and a
soldier who conquered Jerusalem, rather than a peace maker.

<HEADLINE> Firing of Moldovan Defense Chief to Be Judged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Moldovan president and
parliament Saturday agreed to withhold a presidential decree to
dismiss the current defense minister and to let the Constitutional
Court rule on the case, according to reports from Chisinau,
capital of the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was announced by Parliament Speaker Pytr
Luchinsky after a six-hour closed-door emergency session
of the parliament on Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Luchinsky said the Constitutional Court will decide in days
whether President Mircea Snegur's Friday order to fire Defense
Minister Pavel Creanga is legal.
</P>
<P>
The speaker also said that the situation in the Moldovan army
is stable and under control.
</P>
<P>
Saturday evening's session was also attended by Prime Minister
Andrei Sangheli.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the parliament decision will help
prevent an aggravation of the conflict between the president and
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
President Snegur fired Creanga a day after accusing him of
misusing army property.
</P>
<P>
Creanga refused to step down and branded Snegur's order as
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
At an emergency meeting Saturday morning, Deputy Speaker
Dumitru Motban said the presidential order violated the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
According to Moldovan law, the president has no right to
directly remove government members, who may be dismissed only at
the prime minister's request or through a vote in the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Mandelas to Start Their Divorce Case Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua )-- President Nelson Mandela
and his estranged wife, Winnie, will start their divorce case
tomorrow in the Rand supreme court, the South African Press
Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Legal sources denied rumors that a last-minute out-of-court
settlement had been reached this week and said both parties would
have to testify in court.
</P>
<P>
Human rights advocate Wim Trengove, who is considered to be
one of the country's leading legal minds, will represent the
president.
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela will be represented by advocate Ismail Semenya,
about whom little is known.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers in the past few days quoted divorce lawyers
as saying that they expected money to be the central issue in the
battle.
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela is known to be in a large amount of debt. Last
year she was ordered to pay about 20,000 u.s. dollars plus costs
to an air charters company for a Jet she chartered to Angola,
allegedly to buy diamonds.
</P>
<P>
She has also spent thousands of Rands on court battles,
including an attempt to sue Hustler magazine for defamation,
fighting her dismissal from the cabinet and appealing against her
conviction in the air charters case.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, her luxury home in Soweto was almost
repossessed after she failed to pay more than 136,000 U.S.
Dollars in bond arrears in time.
</P>
<P>
There is report that Winnie will ask the court for a
redistribution order, whereby she could claim certain assets from
her husband on the basis that her support of him over the years
contributed to his success.
</P>
<P>
The divorce case may answer the question: how much is the
president worth?
</P>
<P>
Mr. Mandela has two homes: the one he lives in Houghton,
Johannesburg and a holiday residence at Qunu, his birthplace in
the Transkei.
</P>
<P>
However, both houses officially belong to the ANC (the African
National Congress).
</P>
<P>
Part of Mr. Mandela's 151,200 US Dollar annual salary and
proceeds from his book, "Long Walk to Freedom", have been
channelled into his children's fund.
</P>
<P>
The president is also known to live frugally.
</P>
<P>
The proceedings bring to an end the couple's 38-year marriage
which was known more for their 31 years of separation.
</P>
<P>
President Mandelaled, who is now 78, married Winnie Madikizela
Mandela in 1958, but historians estimate that the couple spent no
more than two years together before Mr. Mandela was jailed for 27
years in 1964.
</P>
<P>
After his release in 1990 the couple spent less than two years
together.
</P>
<P>
Mandela separated from his wife in April 1992, after Winnie
was linked to a romantic relations story with Dali Mpofu, former
head of the ANC's welfare section.
</P>
<P>
Winnie came under bitter attacks from the United Democratic
Movement for her involvement in the notorious Mandela Football
Club, which ran a campaign of terror in the black township of
Soweto.
</P>
<P>
She was sacked by her husband last year as Deputy Minister of
Arts, Culture, Science and Technology due to her serious
political differences with ANC and the Government of National
Unity.
</P>
<P>
But Winnie is still President of the ANC's Women's League,
member of the nation's parliament from the ANC, and member of
ANC's national executive committee, the party's top policy-making
body.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Gun Fighting in Bangladesh's Port City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed and
200 others injured Saturday in Bangladesh's port city of
Chittagong and a western district of Jhenidah in fierce gun
fighting between opposition activists and supporters of the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today, in Chittagong, an
18-year-old pedestrian died at hospital after sustaining bullet
wounds. One hundred others were injured in a series of gun
fighting.
</P>
<P>
The trouble started at around 3 p.m. Saturday when a public
meeting organized by the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
was disrupted by a nearly 4-hour gun battle featuring hundreds of
bomb blasts that rocked a 5-mile area around the meeting venue.
</P>
<P>
In Jhenidah, at least 100 people were injured when the rival
groups were locked in a fierce gun fight at the Shailakupa Natun
Bazaar Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of BNP workers took position at the bazaar from early
hours Saturday in a bid to take control of the town. As soon as
the opposition workers came to the spot at noon, chase and
counter-chase began and later a gun fight ensued at around 1 p.m.
and lasted till 5 p.m. when the BNP activists retreated, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties began launching a non-cooperation
movement on March 9 to press their demand for cancellation of the

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Macao Branch Congratulates Renewal of Macao Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
today that the renewal of Vasco Rocha Vieira as governor of Macao
will be helpful to the peaceful transition of Macao and the smooth
handover of power in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Zong Guangyao, vice-director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao
Branch, said today that he congratulates Vieira on the renewal.
</P>
<P>
"General Vieira has been working in Macao for many years and is
very familiar with Macao affairs," he said, adding that "his
renewal is conducive to the continuation of policies of the Macao
government, the handling of a series of transitional issues and
the peaceful transition of Macao as well as the smooth handover of
power in 1999."
</P>
<P>
He praised Vieira as an old friend of the Chinese people,
saying his renewal will further help enhance Sino-Portugal
friendly relations, especially in the question of Macao.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Zong said that the handling of transitional
issues, including the localization of law and civil servant
system, the officialization of the Chinese language, should be
quickened as time is limited, although some progress has been
scored.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that General Vieira has the same idea on the
transitional issues, and will make greater efforts in the coming
years to quicken the handling of those issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that more effective measures could be
taken to boost Macao economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Russian Diplomat: US Tries to Stop Russia-Iran Military Cooperation (Part II) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite Americans' call for canceling Russia's nuclear
cooperation with Iran, the two countries have quietly launched
construction of a 1,000-megawatt nuclear power plant in northern
Persian Gulf in February.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source told Xinhua that there are over 600
Russian engineers in the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant and some
facilities for the project will be delivered soon.
</P>
<P>
The source said on condition of anonymity that the Iranian
authorities have extended 150 million U.S. dollars to Russia for
the 1 billion dollar nuclear project, which was left unfinished
by a German company.
</P>
<P>
Russian diplomats said that based on the contract between the
two countries, the first phase of the power plant would be put
into operation by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Russia will help Iran complete the Bushehr
nuclear power plant in southern Iran by supplying equipment and
facilities as well as raw materials such as fuel for operation.
</P>
<P>
Russia is to supply fuel worth 30 million dollars to the
power plant and get back the fuel wastes from 2001 to 2011.
</P>
<P>
The Persian paper quoted Anatoli Zilinsky, manager of a Russian
company overseeing the construction of the nuclear power plant in
Bushehr, as saying that his company was determined to promptly
meet all of its commitments.
</P>
<P>
"Our prediction is that we would fulfill all of our
commitments on a timely basis," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that according to the contract it would take 55
months for his company to finish construction of the power
plant.
</P>
<P>
Zilinsky said that his company had an excellent safety
record, with current contracts to build nuclear power plants
in Finland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that it was difficult and even costly
to finish a power plant started by others, saying that his
company had proposed to the Iranian officials that they should
start the construction of a new power plant in Bushehr.
</P>
<P>
"Reportedly the Iranian authorities will decide on this
contract after Bushehr power plant is finished," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador also told Abrar that Russia and Iran
would continue cooperation in nuclear energy even after the power
plant in Bushehr is finished.
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning of the cooperation between Iran and
Russia for peaceful use of atomic energy, it was agreed that
the cooperation would not end with finishing of Bushehr power
plant," Tretyakov said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility that after the finishing of Bushehr
power plant, Russia would help Iran in establishing a new power
plant," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that a protocol has been signed between Tehran
and Moscow for the construction of a second atomic power
plant.

<HEADLINE> Russian Diplomat: US Tries to Stop Russia-Iran Military Cooperation (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The military and technical
cooperation between Russia and Iran has met strong opposition
from the United States, a local newspaper today quoted a senior
Russian diplomat as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the Persian daily Abrar, Sergei Tretyakov, Russian
Ambassador to Iran, made the statement shortly after Russian
President Boris Yeltsin met last Wednesday with U.S. President Bill
Clinton in the anti-terrorism summit held in Egypt's Red Sea
resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
Tretyakov claimed that Russia plans to continue military and
technical cooperation with Iran despite Washington's strong
opposition.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is an independent country. It decides who are its
friends," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States of America has a problem with Iran, that
is America's problem. It is not related to Russia," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Israel have accused Iran of building the
nuclear power plant as part of its secret program to build an
atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has categorically denied all charges, saying that its
facilities are open to inspectors from International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA).
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that cash-strapped Russia would not easily
give up multi-billion dollar military deals with Iran under the
pressure of U.S. President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources told Xinhua that Russia and Iran signed
a 4 billion dollar military purchase agreement during Iranian
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's visit to Moscow five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The whole military purchase package by Iran from Russia
includes three submarines, Mig-29 aircraft, missiles, tanks and
armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Russia had delivered two Kilo submarines to the Iranian Navy -
the first was delivered in 1992 and the second in 1993, which
reportedly cost Tehran 250 million U.S. dollars a piece. They are
now based in southern Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Military experts say the Kilo-class submarine, which is not
designed to carry sea launched nuclear missiles, will be of
limited use in the Persian Gulf's shallow waters.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Navy Commander Ali Shamkhani disclosed that Iran will
have the third Russian-made submarine in the near future and the
negotiation is going on between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Global Economy to Grow 3.5 % in 96: IMF Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KYOTO, Japan, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) chief today depicted a brighter picture for the world
economy by predicting a 3.5 percent growth rate for 1996, A
Japanese Finance Ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
IMF managing director Michel Camdessus made the forecast in a
economic report given at the start of the just ended finance
ministers meeting of the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, the official said in a briefing with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus told the APEC ministers that he has observed four
positive signs in the global economic development -- a slowed hike
in inflation rate, the recent stabilization of long-term interest
rates, active stock markets and stable exchange rates that reflect
economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the APEC economic situation, Camdessus warned of a
potential overheating and stressed the importance of pursuing
prudent macroeconomic policies by each APEC member to ensure
sustainability of the dynamic development in the world's fastest
growing region, the official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KYOTO, Japan, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Finance Ministers from the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum ended their two-day
meeting here today with a joint statement calling for sound
macroeconomic policies to secure sustained, dynamic growth in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Finance Minister Wataru Kubo, who chaired the Kyoto
meeting, declared the adoption of the statement at a joint press
conference attended by all the APEC finance chiefs at the end of
the session.
</P>
<P>
Kubo told reporters that the finance ministers agreed on the
importance of pursuing balanced macroeconomic policies in a bid to
avoid overheating that has been observed in some APEC members.
</P>
<P>
The ministers from the 18 APEC economies exchanged views on
four topics at today's discussions -- current macroeconomic
issues, financial and capital markets, resources mobilizing for
infrastructure development, and the effects of exchange rate
movement on trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
As a result, they made some findings and agreed on several
initiatives in critical areas, the joint statement said.
</P>
<P>
The findings are intended to broadly guide each APEC member's
voluntary efforts to strengthen its economic and financial
conditions, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
During the morning session, Michel Camdessus, Managing Director
of the International Monetary Fund, cautioned the Asia-Pacific
economies against a potential overheating in the world's fastest
growing region and suggested APEC members cope with the issue by a
mix of restrained macroeconomic policies, including tightened
monetary policy, a Japanese Finance Ministry official said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
For future tasks, Camdessus said each APEC member should make
efforts to secure policy transparency, take prudent macroeconomic
measures and continue economic restructuring, and coordinate
policies against sudden capital movement, according to the
official.

<HEADLINE> Two Full Lunar Eclipses Expected in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A renowned Yemeni astronomer
predicted that two total lunar eclipses will take place in Yemen
in April and September this year.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Ibrahim Al-Sagheiry, the astronomer, said that it will
be a full moon at 3:11 a.m. Yemen's local time (0610 GMT) on April
4, and from that time the eclipse will start, local newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The astronomer said that the earth then will come right between
the sun and the moon, bringing about a complete lunar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
"It will be possible for this lunar eclipse to be clearly seen
all over Yemen, particularly in western Yemen," he added.
</P>
<P>
"As for the second complete lunar eclipse," Al-Sagheiry said,
"it will take place on September 27 starting from 5:45 a.m. Yemen
local time, (0845 GMT), and will be hard to observe in some parts
of eastern Yemen," Al-Sagheiry said.
</P>
<P>
He also expected two partial solar eclipses to take place in
June and October in Yemen.

in 10 days this month, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the latest war game was staged on Thursday and
Friday over the Teok Jeok and An Myon islands on South Korea's

<P>
The previous two took place on March 5-6 and March 11-12
respectively, the KCNA quoted well-informed military sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It said dozens of U.S. fighters flown over from elsewhere and
880 fighters and reconnaissance planes either of South Korea or of
the U.S. force stationed there participated in the mock warfare on
Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
The airforce exercises were accompanied by firing practices of
dozens of heavy tanks in the Pa Ju region near the central "front
line," the KCNA report said.
</P>
<P>
Artillery troops stationed in the region fired more than 250
shells into the "front line" areas, and hundreds of South Korean
armymen moved into combat positions in the region and fired more
than 2,300 rounds of machine-gun and carbine ammunition.
</P>

other to ensure a smooth transfer of power and a smooth transition
in Hong Kong, Premier Li Peng said here today at a press

In response to a Hong Kong reporter's question, Li said both

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China will remarkably increase
the transmission capacity of telecommunications trunks this year,
so as to lay a solid foundation for the upcoming construction of
the information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
This year will see 12 cable trunks, including nine optical and
three microwave cables, adopt SDH transmission technology, raising
their speed to the world advanced level, according to the

Li Peng Reiterates China's Sovereignty over Taiwan
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
reiterated at a press conference here today that the Taiwan
question is purely China's internal affair, in which any foreign
forces are not allowed to interfere in any form.
</P>
<P>
"If somebody attempts to show off force at the Taiwan Straits,
his efforts are not only futile, but can merely complicate
matters," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government have
not changed their basic principle of "peaceful reunification, one
country, two systems", the premier said, adding that the
eight-point proposal put forward by Chinese President Jiang Zemin
one year ago makes overall and profound explanations on the
principle.
</P>
<P>
He said, the recent military exercises of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) in the East China Sea and South China Sea
are regular drills, which aim to raise the PLA's military quality
and combat effectiveness under conditions of modern warfare; the
PLA is duty-bound, determined and entirely able to safeguard
national sovereignty and territorial integrity; military exercises
in high seas conform with international conventions and many
other countries have done the same.
</P>
<P>
"The present tense and chaotic situation in Taiwan is, for its
fundamental reason, a serious consequence resulting from the
activities of some leaders of the Taiwan authorities who go in for
"Taiwan independence" overtly and frequently in the island and in
the international arena," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We wholeheartedly hope that people in Taiwan can live in a
peaceful and stable environment," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is not difficult to achieve this. The
key to achieving this is that leaders of Taiwan authorities, no
matter in what form they are chosen, must not in the future engage
in pursuing "two Chinas", "one China, one Taiwan" and "Taiwan
independence", not only verbally, but more importantly, in action.

<HEADLINE> Five African Leaders Meet in Tunis on Refugee Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Five African presidents have met
in Tunis since Saturday to discuss the security and refugee
issues in Burundi and Rwanda, a report from the capital of
Tunisia said today.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Burundi, Rwanda and neighboring Tanzania,
Uganda and Zaire sat down together with former US President Jimmy
Carter, trying to hammer out at a March 16-18 meeting security
measures that will persuade 1.9 million Hutu refugees, most of
them from Rwanda, to go home in peace.
</P>
<P>
"They come together in a very informal and small context and
talk very candidly and very pragmatically about what needs to be
done... and who needs to do what," the Carter Center's Director
of Program, Marion Creekmore, told a press conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda's refugees fled after hardline Hutus killed up to one
million minority Tutsis and allied Hutus in 1994. in Burundi
about 100,000 people have died in violence since Tutsi soldiers
murdered the Hutu president in October 1993.
</P>
<P>
Neither the U.N. nor the Organization of African Unity were
invited to take part. And leaders of the Rwandan Hutu refugees
and Burundi's Hutu rebel army have also been left out.
</P>
<P>
The Carter Center believes progress has been made in the four
months since the summit held in Cairo last November.
</P>
<P>
They include far greater communication between the divided
presidents, the arrest of some "intimidators" in camps who deter
refugees from going home and moves by Rwanda to guarantee
security for repatriated Hutu.
</P>
<P>
But many of the "solemn pledges" made in Cairo have not been
implemented. Cross-border incursions by armed Hutu exiles, mainly
from Zaire, continue. Rwanda is detaining 67,000 Hutus, many on
flimsy suspicions. Burundi's Tutsi army has forcibly ejected
Rwandan Hutu refugees from their camps.
</P>
<P>
Vice-president Paul Kagame, Rwanda's military strongman, said
he did not have high hopes for the summit. He wanted Zaire to
extract Hutu hardliners from camps, including forceful stand by
the international community.
</P>
<P>
"The freedom with which mass murderers move in Zaire remains a
big problem for us. This tells much about Zaire's intentions,"
Kagame said.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T to Add Investment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The global telecommunications
leader, AT&AMP;T, will further increase investment in China in the
next decade, while its production scale and technical transfer
maintain an expanding trend here, according to a senior
representative of the company in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
C.F. Liao, vice-president of AT&AMP;T (China) Co., said that the
country's unique advantage in attracting foreign investors lies in
two aspects, which are the great market potential behind the 1.2
billion population, and "a steady and positive growth in
modernization through the 1990s," according to the Science and
Technology Daily.
</P>
<P>
Expressing the company's close attention to China's Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and long-term development targets for
2010, he said that AT&AMP;T will deepen its involvement in China's
telecommunications projects, and share more latest technical
achievements with Chinese partners, because "any far-sighted
business people can not ignore the huge Chinese market."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country's telecommunications business
generated a 500-percent-plus increase over the past five years,
with its telephone density reaching 4.6 percent. The ratio is
expected to draw near nine or 10 percent by 2000, and hit as high
as 16 percent in the first decade of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Under such an exciting presupposition, China will double its
2000 telecommunications business by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said that he is confident in the fulfilment of
China's aim to realize another 100 percent growth in gross
national product between 2000 and 2010.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
streamline trust regulations in a bid to govern banks, which are
involved in the trust business, Central Bank Governor Gabriel
Singson said today.
</P>
<P>
The Monetary Board, the bank's policy-making body, has already
approved changes in capitalization requirement and the reduction
of the test periods for banks and investment houses wishing to
branch into the trust business.
</P>
<P>
Essentially, banks shall follow the higher capitalization
requirements for different categories of banks to qualify for a
trust license.
</P>
<P>
These would be 2.5 billion pesos (100 million US dollars) for
universal banks, 1.25 billion pesos (50 million dollars) or over
for commercial banks, and sliding capitalization (210 million
pesos minimum) required for foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
The minimum capital required for the issuance of a trust
license to thrift banks and investment houses remain at 250
million pesos (10 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has yet to peg the capitalization requirement
for a purely trust corporation, pending comparison with other
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Singson noted that there is no existing trust company in the
country as yet.

"China has always been an important force in maintaining
regional and world peace," Li said, noting that China will
continue pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
"We will, as always, correctly handle the relationship between
reform, development and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said he is confident that China can maintain its development
momentum.
</P>
<P>
"This is because China has found a correct development path
under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that, with the Communist Party of China having a
central committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, China will be able
to maintain a long-term political stability.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to development in the past 46 years, especially in the
years since the country started implementing a policy of reform
and opening up in the late 1970s, China has established a fairly
solid material and technical foundation and built up a fairly
powerful national strength, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The outline of long-term development to the year 2010 adopted
at the just-concluded session of the NPC will help rally the 1.2
billion Chinese people, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important reason why we can maintain a sustained,
rapid and healthy development," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Tariff Cuts for Crude Products to Reduce Manila's  Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
lose about 3.6 billion pesos (144 million US dollars) due to
tariff cuts for imported crude and imported finished products.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Finance (DOF), under the
existing system of 10 percent tariff for crude oil and 20 percent
tariff for refined oil products, net revenue collections amount to
5.44 billion pesos (217 million dollars) every year.
</P>
<P>
Adopting a tariff system of 3 percent for crude and 7 percent
for refined oil products would result in net collections of only
1.832 billion pesos (73.28 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Tariff is the tax imposed by the government on goods coming
into the country from another country as a form of protection for
the domestic industry.
</P>
<P>
Congressmen voted last week in the Bicameral Conference
Committee for a 3-percent tariff on crude and 3-percent tariff on
refined petroleum.
</P>
<P>
The three oil companies Shell, Caltex, and Petron had lobbied
against a zero tariff spread and asked for maintaining the current
10 percent differential.
</P>
<P>
But congress leaders believe that a big tariff differential
would discourage new players in the oil industry, thus defeating
the objective of the oil deregulation program.

YANTAI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The important port city in east
China's Shandong Province has seen a 6.7 times increase in export
volume during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995).
</P>
<P>
The city approved 4.12 billion US dollars-worth of contracts
using foreign funds in the five years, with 2.1 billion US dollars
actually utilized, according to a source from the city foreign
trade committee.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,600 out of more than 3,400 foreign-funded enterprises
have gone into operation, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, import and export value accounted for 25 percent of
the city's gross domestic product (GDP) of 57.5 billion yuan, an
obvious signal for the leading status of the city's foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
The city has given a total of 69 enterprises the power of
import and export, making its export volume jump to 1.41 billion
US dollars last year from 210 million US dollars in 1991.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- An integrated, unified and
sophisticated telecommunications network will take shape in
the landlocked Yunnan Province by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
This telecommunications modernization will bring about an
energetic take-off in the province's underdeveloped economy, the
journal China Telecomworld said.
</P>
<P>
A five-year development plan set by the province's posts and
telecommunications administration recently proposed that digital,
broad-band, intelligent and multi-media functions will be added to
the telecommunications network province-wide.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the province will cast its focus on the
expanding and upgrading of long-distance optical cable trunks,
building of loop networks to intensify the telecommunications ties
among different areas, and applying SDH (synchronous digital
hierarchy) to all the optical trunks.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the province will extend its telecommunications
network to the remote areas by using digital, microwave and
satellite technologies, and set up a telephone network covering 17
major cities and townships.
</P>
<P>
The development of intelligent network, ISDN (integrated
service digital network), GSM (global system for mobile
communications), DDN (digital and data network) and conference
television system is expected to accelerate in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the province will also give more priority
to the construction of transmission network based on SDH
technology, as well as the broad-band ISDN using ATM technology.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects German Allegations on Killing 4 Kurds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry has
deplored a arrest warrant issued by the German Federal
Prosecutor's office against Iran's information minister, who was
charged with ordering the killing of four members of Iran's
Kurdish opposition in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported this morning that
the case against Iran's Information Minister Ali Fallahian was
not the least corroborated by evidence.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman of Iran's Foreign Ministry, was
quoted as saying that "there was absolutely no evidence on file
pending in the said court that adduced to the Iranian officials
having been involved in its subject-matter."
</P>
<P>
"The issue of Iran's involvement in the subject of that
file had been brought up by international elements and as the
result of insinuations by various hostile groups that sought to
strain relations between Iran and Germany," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said an impartial but scrupulous query into the case
pending in the German court would obviously lead to the
dismissing of all charges against the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Horst Beshma, German ambassador to Iran who was reached on
telephone by Xinhua here today, declined to comment on the
issuance of the arrest warrant against the Iranian minister,
saying "You should take the issue to the Prosecutor."
</P>
<P>
Iranian ambassador to Germany, Seyed Hossein Mousavian, was
reported by local press to have gone to the German Foreign
Ministry to express Tehran's concern over the issue.
</P>
<P>
After four members of Iran's Kurdish opposition were found
murdered in a Berlin restaurant in 1992, the relations between
Iran and Germany has gone through periodic crises.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the issue will undoubtedly affect
bilateral relations. However, they ruled out that the issue would
ever trigger a full-scale war of words between Tehran and Bonn,
because of extensive multi-billion dollar commercial links.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told Xinhua that there was a tacit
agreement between Iran and Germany that Bonn would no longer
talk of Iranian involvement in the killing of four Kurds in
exchange for the release of a German national accused of
spying against Iran.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, 1994, German national Helmut Szimkus, who was
sentenced to death by an Iranian court on charges of spying for
Iraq, was released by Iranian authorities after appeals by German
Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
Today's Persian daily Jomhuri Islami suggested that Iran should
not leave the "insult" by German officials unanswered, saying
that it was about time that Tehran reconsidered its extensive
economic ties with Bonn.
</P>
<P>
"It is high time that the decision-making centers in the
country reconsidered the extensive economic relations between Iran
and Germany. They should not allow the Germans to take advantage
of our goodwill," said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
"What reasons are there for us to have 2.4 billion dollar
importation annually from Germany and to secure most of our
consumption goods from that country?" it asked.
</P>
<P>
It alleged that the German government and legal system "had
become a pawn in the hands of the Zionists" for raising
the allegations against Fallahiyan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislature Closes Annual Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Fourth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, passed
the Outline of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) for national
economic and social development and long-term goals for the year
2010 at its closing plenary meeting here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Also passed at today's plenary meeting was Premier Li Peng's
report on the Outline, which had been revised in accordance with
NPC deputies' proposals concerning agriculture, reform of
state-owned enterprises, joint regional development, and
improvement of democracy and the legal system.
</P>
<P>
Adopted at the session were also a report on the implementation
of the state budget for 1995 and a resolution on the state
budget for 1996.

</P>
<P>
The meeting adopted a resolution granting the people's
congresses and their standing committees, and the governments of
the two special economic zones of Shantou and Zhuhai the authority
to enact local laws and regulations for implementation within
their respective jurisdictions. The NPC has thus granted
legislative power to all the five special economic zones in China.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Targets Set for Tree Planting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- More than half of southern
China's Guangdong province is expected to be covered in a blanket
of trees by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The province has launched a five-year "greening" campaign,
aiming at increasing the amount of public grasslands and forests
between now and the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
People all over China are taking a leaf out of the example set
by retired leader Deng Xiaoping. He launched a voluntary tree
planting campaign 15 years ago, with support from the National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
To mark the anniversary millions of trees are being planted
across the country on an unprecedented scale.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's proposals consolidate a scheme launched two years
ago, says the Guangzhou-based "Yangcheng Wanbao"
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, urban grassland rate in the province will
exceed 30 percent and urban per capita share of grassland will
amount to 40 sq m from the current 28 sq m.
</P>
<P>
Following a ten-year program of greening Guangdong, launched by
the provincial committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the
provincial government, the province started a new campaign aiming
to consolidate its achievements in afforestation, and plant more
trees in 1994.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, Guangdong expects its forest
coverage rate to reach 54 percent. Timber wood reserves will stand
at 320 million cubic meters, and the annual output of timber
reach four million to five million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Total output value of the province's forestry is expected to
reach 15.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In another development, China's leading industrial and
commercial center Shanghai has established a responsibility
system, under which leaders at all levels are asked to complete
tree planting tasks within their service terms.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai-based "Liberation Daily" reported that the city's
agricultural department has signed afforestation agreements of
responsibility with six suburban counties recently.
</P>
<P>
According to these agreements, Shanghai's suburban areas will
establish about 306 hectares of new forest land, plant 22.1
million trees and develop about 53,000 hectares of
tree-criss-cross farmland. Forest coverage rate will exceed 9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Twelve Chinese provinces and autonomous regions, including
Hebei, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Sichuan and
Guizhou, have planted 709,000 hectares of trees since the
beginning of the year.

<HEADLINE> Top Law-Maker Stresses Rule of Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- "Rule of law and development of a
socialist legal system," as defined in China's long-term
development plan adopted today, will be a guiding principle for
the country's modernization drive in years to come, top law-maker
Qiao Shi said here today.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the Eighth National People's Congress
Standing Committee, made the remark at the closing session of the
NPC here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the rule-of-law principle is absolutely consistent with
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, represents the common will of all Chinese people,
and is an objective requirement by China's social development.
</P>
<P>
Rule of law is a fundamental guarantee for the country's
long-term stability and development, he said.
</P>
<P>
And rule of law is a precondition for strengthening the Party's
leadership, Qiao said. He asked all organizations and members of
the Communist Party of China, especially officials, to abide by
and protect the Constitution and other laws, and set examples for
the whole society in observing laws.
</P>
<P>
"As we implement our trans-century plan, we must further beef
up efforts in legislation and law-enforcement, to build up a
complete legal framework for the establishment of a socialist
market economic structure, and a change in economic growth mode
for higher economic efficiency," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that adopted laws must be earnestly observed and
enforced, and any practice overriding the authority of law must be
strongly opposed.
</P>
<P>
He asked people's congresses at all levels and their standing
committees to strengthen supervision over law-enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Qiao spoke highly of the conference, saying that, thanks to
earnest and active involvement by the people's deputies,
resolutions and laws adopted at the session today fully represent
the basic interests and common will of all Chinese people.

<P>
These stipulations mean restrictions for existing powers of
law-enforcement agencies. The two laws are expected to create some
difficulties for law-enforcement agencies used to old practices.
</P>
<P>
These agencies and governmental departments, however, are ready
to implement the laws. Relevant agencies and departments have
participated in the formulation and revision of the two laws from
beginning to end. And most NPC deputies from judicial departments
have shown strong support for the laws.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Guo Benli, a policeman in Beijing, said revision of the
16-year-old Criminal Procedural Law marks China's social progress.
</P>
<P>
He conceded, "Detention of suspects for investigation is
abolished at a time when crimes are on the rise, and we have
difficulties in manpower and equipment. We will be under hard
pressure to combat crimes."
</P>
<P>
"However, as the law represents the will of people, it must be
observed with no reservation, as promised by our leaders in the
Public Security Ministry," he said, noting that the law also
offers other effective means to combat crimes.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Shunchu, president of the Hunan Higher People's Court and
an NPC deputy, said the amended Criminal Procedural Law accords
with modern legal concept.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have such a law 16 years ago, because the time was
not ripe. Today, our judicial bodies are regulating ourselves with
laws on judges, prosecutors and the police; and I believe we have
the ability to enforce the new law to the letter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials attending the NPC session said Law
on Administrative Punishment can be used to promote the rule of
law in government operations. Many have promised to examine their
local regulations to pave the way for the new law's enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts said increased law-awareness of the public and
past judicial experience have laid a solid foundation for the
implementation of the two laws.
</P>
<P>
China will also enact a series of other laws to further protect
the rights and interests of its citizens, sources from the NPC
Standing Committee said.
</P>
<P>
A law on administrative case reexamination that aims to
prevent misconducts by government officials will be
enacted in two years, according to China's legislation plan.
</P>
<P>
And other laws on administrative permits, administrative fees,
and administrative compulsory measures are being considered.

<HEADLINE> How Chinese Laws Are Enacted (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost all new laws are proposed by NPC deputies. At each of
its annual sessions, NPC deputies will put forth hundreds of
motions and bills, most of which concern enactment of laws. The
NPC Standing Committee and the State Council, the Chinese cabinet,
can also propose the enactment of laws they deem necessary.
</P>
<P>
This year is no exception. Deputies have put forth 603 motions,
of which 124 have been decided as formal bills with more than
80 percent of them concerning the enactment of laws.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Chinese laws are drafted by ministries,
commissions and bureaus directly under the State Council. Special
committees and other relevant bodies of the NPC Standing Committee
and some mass organizations are also entrusted to draft laws.
</P>
<P>
With close to 300 laws in effect nationwide and numerous local
laws and regulations, China has established a fairly complete
socialist legal system consisting of criminal, civil,
administrative and procedural laws with the Constitution as the
core.
</P>
<P>
Except the Constitution and the Marriage Law, all laws
currently in effect have been enacted in the past 20 years, a
period when China has undergone tremendous changes in almost every
aspect of its society.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- With two laws closely relating to
the rights and interests of citizens adopted here today, China has
made another major step forward in improving its democratic legal
system.
</P>
<P>
Chinese citizens now have a new legal basis to safeguard their
rights enshrined in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The closing session of the National People's Congress (NPC)
adopted Amendments to the Criminal Procedural Law and Law on
Administrative Punishment, which will become effective at the
start of next year and October 1 this year respectively.
</P>
<P>
The two laws contain detailed stipulations on the scope of
criminal and administrative punishments meted out by
law-enforcement agencies, procedures and supervision of
law-enforcement.
</P>
<P>
They have been taken as a major reform and improvement of
China's legal system, and have won acclaim from the media and the
public.
</P>
<P>
"The two new laws have one thing in common, that is, they both
ensure that the innocent shall be free from punishment, whereas
law-breakers shall be effectively dealt with," said Chen
Guangzhong, president of China University of Political Science and
Law and a prestigious law professor.
</P>
<P>
"Adoption of the two laws is an indication that the state has
further improved its ability to protect the rights and interests
of its citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gu Angran, director of the Legislative Affairs Work Committee
under the NPC Standing Committee, said: "Adoption of the two laws
with detailed law-enforcement procedures showed how much progress
China has made in protecting the rights of its people."
</P>
<P>
"A complete legal framework for law-enforcement procedures
represents a country's ability to protect the rights and interests
of its citizens by law as well as respect for the rule of law,"
said Gu, who is also a renowned legal expert.
</P>
<P>
The two laws contain many stipulations that aim to protect the
rights and interests of the people. They are also of realistic
significance for doing away with existing malpractices in judicial
and governmental departments.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the amended Criminal Procedural Law has abolished
unsupervised detention of suspects for investigation by the
police, and conviction with prosecution exemptions by prosecutors.
According to the amended law, defendants are allowed to have
access to lawyers at a much earlier date. The law has established
the principle that no one shall be deemed guilty until convicted
by a court of law.
</P>
<P>
Law on Administrative Punishment has also defined detailed
procedures in meting out penalties.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- With an overwhelming majority,
Chinese law-makers today passed amendments to the Criminal
Procedural law, which will take effect on January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
It demonstrates that China's legislative process has entered a
mature stage.
</P>
<P>
Before 1983, it usually took a few days to enact a law, from
submission of a motion to the NPC to its final adoption. This
often results in flaws in a law.
</P>
<P>
Take the Criminal Procedural Law as an example.
</P>
<P>
When it was enacted 16 years ago, it had only 164 articles,
some of which "did not conform to legal principles", in the
opinion of some law specialists.
</P>
<P>
The amended law has 225 articles and contains significant
revisions of and additions to the original law concerning work
processes involving public security, prosecuting and trial
departments.
</P>
<P>
With continuous improvement, a standardized and legalized
legislative procedure has been established in China.
</P>
<P>
At present, the enactment of a law takes at least six steps:
proposition, bill drafting, submission of the bill for
examination, examination and adoption of the bill, signing of the
law by the state president for enforcement, and promulgation.
</P>
<P>
After a bill is submitted to the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislative body, it
goes through at least two rounds of examinations before being
adopted. The process takes at least four months since the Standing
Committee of the NPC convenes a session every two months.
</P>
<P>
The present procedure is enshrined in procedural rules for the
NPC Standing Committee adopted in November, 1987.
</P>
<P>
According to the 16th stipulation of the rules, the NPC
Standing Committee must examine draft laws twice -- at two
sessions -- before their adoption.

<HEADLINE> Israel Eases Closure on Gaza, West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army today slightly
eased the closure imposed on the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
following a series of suicide bombing attacks in Israel earlier
this month, which left more than 60 dead and over 150 wounded.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio, Palestinian workers from the Gaza
Strip this morning are allowed into the Erez industrial zone,
while more workers are still barred from entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
At the Karni check point, where the suicide bomber of Tel Aviv
blast had reportedly slipped through, trucks carrying food from
Israel are permitted to cross into the Gaza Strip under tight
security checks.
</P>
<P>
Due to the increased checks, the number of trucks allowed to be
processed is expected to be much lower than the 400 which used the
crossing point daily before it was shut down last Monday.
</P>
<P>
A decision will be made only in the coming days on whether to
permit the transfer of goods by Palestinians from the Gaza Strip
into Israel, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank, the Israeli army has lifted the curfew in the
Fawar refugee camp near Hebron, but immediately imposed a closure
on the region, where, according to Israeli security sources, the
two suicide bombers involved in the bombing attacks in Jerusalem
and Ashkelon on February 25 came from.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Internal Security Minister Moshe Shahal told
Israel Radio that the steps to ease the closure on the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip "will not be made as long as the security
situation is not clear."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) estimates losses from
the closure, which has barred more than 40,000 Palestinian
workers from entering Israel, in Gaza and the West Bank at
2 to 3 million U.S. dollars a day from salaries alone, and
about the same in loss of trade.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Radio reported today that the joint liaison
committee of donor states will meet twice in Gaza this week to put
together a 40-million-U.S.-dollars employment-generating program
so that Palestinians can weather what is expected to be a long
closure.
</P>
<P>
U.N. envoy to the PNA Terje Larsen said in Gaza Saturday at a
meeting with Gaza trade union representatives that the issue of
the closure will be addressed at the meetings of the donor states.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he would call on Israel directly and through
the U.N. to find a way maintaining security without imposing a
full closure on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

<P>
These stipulations mean restrictions for existing powers of
law-enforcement agencies. The two laws are expected to create some
difficulties for law-enforcement agencies used to old practices.
</P>
<P>
These agencies and governmental departments, however, are ready
to implement the laws. Relevant agencies and departments have
participated in the formulation and revision of the two laws from
beginning to end. And most NPC deputies from judicial departments
have shown strong support for the laws.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Guo Benli, a policeman in Beijing, said revision of the
16-year-old Criminal Procedural Law marks China's social progress.
</P>
<P>
He conceded, "Detention of suspects for investigation is
abolished at a time when crimes are on the rise, and we have
difficulties in manpower and equipment. We will be under hard
pressure to combat crimes."
</P>
<P>
"However, as the law represents the will of people, it must be
observed with no reservation, as promised by our leaders in the
Public Security Ministry," he said, noting that the law also
offers other effective means to combat crimes.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Shunchu, president of the Hunan Higher People's Court and
an NPC deputy, said the amended Criminal Procedural Law accords
with modern legal concept.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have such a law 16 years ago, because the time was
not ripe. Today, our judicial bodies are regulating ourselves with
laws on judges, prosecutors and the police; and I believe we have
the ability to enforce the new law to the letter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials attending the NPC session said Law
on Administrative Punishment can be used to promote the rule of
law in government operations. Many have promised to examine their
local regulations to pave the way for the new law's enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts said increased law-awareness of the public and
past judicial experience have laid a solid foundation for the
implementation of the two laws.
</P>
<P>
China will also enact a series of other laws to further protect
the rights and interests of its citizens, sources from the NPC
Standing Committee said.
</P>
<P>
A law on administrative case reexamination that aims to
prevent misconducts by government officials will be
enacted in two years, according to China's legislation plan.
</P>
<P>
And other laws on administrative permits, administrative fees,
and administrative compulsory measures are being considered.

<P>
Almost all new laws are proposed by NPC deputies. At each of
its annual sessions, NPC deputies will put forth hundreds of
motions and bills, most of which concern enactment of laws. The
NPC Standing Committee and the State Council, the Chinese cabinet,
can also propose the enactment of laws they deem necessary.
</P>
<P>
This year is no exception. Deputies have put forth 603 motions,
of which 124 have been decided as formal bills with more than
80 percent of them concerning the enactment of laws.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Chinese laws are drafted by ministries,
commissions and bureaus directly under the State Council. Special
committees and other relevant bodies of the NPC Standing Committee
and some mass organizations are also entrusted to draft laws.
</P>
<P>
With close to 300 laws in effect nationwide and numerous local
laws and regulations, China has established a fairly complete
socialist legal system consisting of criminal, civil,
administrative and procedural laws with the Constitution as the
core.
</P>
<P>
Except the Constitution and the Marriage Law, all laws
currently in effect have been enacted in the past 20 years, a
period when China has undergone tremendous changes in almost every
aspect of its society.
</P>
<P>
Before the end of 1982, there was only one legislative body in

HARARE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- About 500,000 Zimbabweans out of
4.9 million registered voters cast their votes by Saturday
afternoon, getting off at a slow start as the two-day second
presidential elections began.
</P>
<P>
Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede said last night the majority
of the voters were mainly in rural constituencies where there
were queues for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
The urban constituencies began slowly as people were either
still at work or were not sure that the elections were indeed
going ahead following the last minute withdrawal of United
Parties candidate Abel Muzorewa.
</P>
<P>
His withdrawal was, however, declared invalid as it was well
after the stipulated 21 days.
</P>
<P>
About 46,000 people had been turned away either because they
had not registered or their names could not be located on the
voters' roll, he said.
</P>
<P>
Election Directorate Chairman Mariyawanda Nzuwah, said the
directorate was generally satisfied that polling had gone well
and hoped that all registered voters would exercise their right
to vote today.
</P>
<P>
But, the chairman, who visited some polling stations by
helicopter Saturday, also said he was concerned by the voter
apathy in urban centers.

KAMPALA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A landmine of Lord's Resistance
Army (lra) rebels hit a pick-up at Pabbo trading center near
Gulu, over 300 km north of Kampala on Saturday, killing one
passenger instantly and seriously injuring six others.

<P>
This incident follows the attempts to overrun Lacor Hospital
last Wednesday when the rebels shelled but missed the target.
They however planted a landmine at the gate of the hospital which
killed two patients and injured another.
</P>

experience, education, wills, property, and inheritance to
financial matters, real estate, shareholding enterprises, and
public order.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that since 1992, the city's notary offices have
handled 48,000 financial documents, and more than 80,000 in real
estate, leases, mortgages, and land rights, and many for joint
stock firms.
</P>
<P>
There was also an increase in the number of foreign clients. In
1995, there were more than 20,000 for them, accounting for 20
percent of the total number of notarized documents.
</P>
<P>
A total of 890 documents for Taiwan clients have been handled
and more than 700 for inheritances since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin now has 20 notary agencies, with 280 notaries. It was
the first city to have the right to formulate its own laws for the
service and is exploring ways to perfect its present system, to
make better use of the services.

<HEADLINE> More Ethnic Minority Officials in Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region has promoted the training of cadres from
national minorities and has benefitted from the program.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two percent of the region's cadres from ethnic minorities
have gotten degrees at the polytechnic-school level and 30 percent
have diplomas of institutions of higher learning, both much higher
the 1980s' 14 and 7 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
An administrative institute, mainly for training middle and
upper-level public servants, was recently established in Yinchuan,
the region's capital.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has a population of over five million, more than 1.6
million of which are Hui (Moslem) people. The low level of culture
and relatively small number of ethnic minority cadres have become
an obstacle to fully implementing regional autonomy policies.
</P>
<P>
So, Ningxia has set up one-third of its polytechnic schools and
schools of higher learning to ethnic minority areas, to get more
students from minority groups, and has set up classes especially
for them, exempting those who have financial difficulties from
paying tuition and other fees.
</P>
<P>
Each year, the region has earmarked 1.5 million yuan to be used
as subsidies for poor students, and over the past two years,
collected more than 50 million yuan in donations for local
education.
</P>
<P>
It is also trying other ways to train cadres from minority
groups. In the past five years, more than 1,000 were sent to state
ministries and departments, in Beijing, and Zhejiang, Shandong,
Fujian, and Jiangsu provinces for work experience.
</P>
<P>
The region also sends high-ranking cadres to lower departments
and low-ranking officials to higher departments, to improve their
working ability.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Trade System Reform: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KYOTO, Japan, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Finance Minister Liu
Zhongli said here today that China will continue to reform its
foreign trade system in line with the country's opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the pledge at a two-day finance ministers meeting of
the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum now
under way in Kyoto, central Japan.
</P>
<P>
Liu told his APEC counterparts that China has abolished import
restrictions on 176 items since last year's APEC economic leaders'
summit, during which Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced an
average reduction of 35.5 percent in import tariffs from April 1.
</P>
<P>
"This represents another major initiative of our opening-up
policy," he said. "The substantial reduction in tariffs
accompanied by the abolishment of partial reduction and exemption
policies makes China's tariff system more transparent and more
compatible with the international practice."
</P>
<P>
APEC finance chiefs are in a full-day session to review
macro-economic developments and market situations in the world's
fastest growing region, with stability in currencies among the 18
Pacific economies as the focus of their discussions.
</P>
<P>
The APEC members include Canada, Chile, China, South Korea,
Japan, the United States and such Southeast Asian nations as
Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Liu told the meeting that China adopted tight fiscal and
monetary policies last year to control inflation and
"macro-economic objectives have basically been achieved."
</P>
<P>
He pointed to such achievements as continued steady increase of
budget revenues, improved financial order and a decrease in
consumer prices in China.
</P>
<P>
But the finance minister also mentioned China's economic
problems including a "relatively high level of price increase,
weak agricultural sector ... difficulties experienced by some
state-owned enterprises" and low efficiency of the industrial
sector.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese enterprises should further undergo
market-oriented reform and restructuring in order to improve
economic efficiency and strengthen their competitiveness in the
marketplace.

The Awami (People's) League (AL), Jatiya (National) Party and
Jamaat-e-Islami in separate statements Saturday night called upon
the people to observe day as a "black day" and resist the sitting

<P>
President Abdur Rahman Biswas Saturday said that he will summon
on March 19 the first session of the sixth parliament elected on
February 15 elections, which was boycotted by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The opposition blamed the president for sealing the prospects
of peaceful resolution to the existing political crisis and trying
to give legitimacy to a "farcical" election and an "illegal"
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of playing the role of the president of the republic,
he (Biswas) has acted as a mere protector of BNP's partisan
interest," AL chief Sheikh Hasina alleged in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The opposition will continue their non-cooperation campaign
until the resignation of the BNP government and the annulment of
the February 15 elections, she added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Proposes Program for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The mortality rate of Vietnamese
children is expected to drop in the following four years from 1996
to 2000, said a national program made by the Vietnamese government.
</P>
<P>
According to the program for children under-16, which account
for 43 percent of the whole population, the mortality rate of
those under one will be reduced from 3.8 percent to 3.0 percent by
the year 2000 while that of the children under five from 6.8
percent to 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other major targets of the program includes the reduction of
malnutrition rate among the under-5 and the expansion of clean
water supply for the households.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the implementation of the program, the government
has launched an immunization program helping all under-fives fight
against six major child killers.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale campaigns advocating breast-feeding and combating
vitamin A and iodine deficiency have been launched regularly.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the schooling age children (under 15) are

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Pays Official Visit to Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa arrived here this morning to begin his two-day
official visit to Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted at the Yangon International Airport by Chairman
of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) and Prime
Minister Senior General Than Shwe and other Myanmar government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Banharn's visit followed the 12th meeting of the Myanmar-Thai
Regional Border Committee held last month in the southeastern
Myanmar city of Mawlamyine, at which progress was reportedly made
in resolving some border issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Banharn's visit, Myanmar Saturday reopened two of the
three border checkpoints with Thailand as a friendly gesture,
which had been closed by Myanmar last year.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Banharn, the first Thai prime minister to
visit Myanmar since 1980, is expected to witness the formal
signing of a border trade agreement with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Banharn would concentrate on his
talks with Myanmar leaders on matters of trade and economic
cooperation between the two countries as well as investment in
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, the fourth largest foreign investor in Myanmar after
the United Kingdom, Singapore and France, had an investment amount
of 443.87 million US dollars in 30 projects in Myanmar at the end
of 1995.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), Thailand also plays a leading role with its "constructive
engagement" policy in supporting Myanmar's endeavors of joining
the ASEAN by inviting Myanmar leader Senior General Than Shwe to
last year's 5th ASEAN summit and Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn
Gyaw to the 27th ASEAN ministerial meeting in 1994 in Bangkok as
guests of the host country.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Area to Have More Comprehensive Economic Functions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- As part of China's largest
economic center of Shanghai, Pudong is expected to become a modern
urban area with comprehensive economic functions.
</P>
<P>
In addition to developed industrial businesses, the area will
boost financial, foreign trade, high-tech and agricultural
sectors, said Zhao Qizheng, Shanghai vice-mayor and director of
the area's management committee, now at the on-going session of
the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, Zhao said, the area has built
highways, power plants, tap water and gas works,
telecommunications and other infrastructure facilities, with more
than 9.1 billion US dollars of investment drawn from overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
The area's economic functions will be further increased in the
coming five years, he added.
</P>
<P>
He compared the area to a football court, which should be
frequented by world-class teams with world-class referees and
cheered on by swarms of fans for the matches that follow
international conventions. Only such a court can give scope to its
rule, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a sound market-oriented mechanism and economic
operation order in accordance with international practices will be
set up in his area over the next five years, in which the
government is held responsible mainly for protecting the interests
of both investors and clients and the market operation order
instead of interference in entrerprise's internal management.
</P>
<P>
In its future endeavor to attract more overseas businesspeople
and their investment, Pudong will chiefly concentrate on scale
projects with high-tech contents and relatively big market shares
in a bid to form an industrial setup with leading enterprises as
the mainstay, supplemented by smaller and medium-sized ones.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhao, the total volume of the area's National
Domestic Product (GDP) is projected at 140 billion yuan (about
16.8 billion US dollars) by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
To expand its ties with overseas, Shanghai is going to build a
second airport that is expected to go into use in the year 2000.
In addition, the construction of an information express highway
for its banking and information businesses will also be built,
Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
In the financial sector, he noted, the number of
overseas-funded banks in Pudong will rise from the present 39 to
200 in the year 2010 with a combined possible employment of
150,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided to authorize overseas-funded
banks to try out trading in Renminbi currency, and the timetable
for its detailed implementation is yet to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
The Pudong area has also begun to experiment with trade access
by Sino-foreign joint-venturing trade firms, and 11 foreign trade
companies from elsewhere in China have acquired trade access to
the area, Zhao said. And negotiations on matters concerning
cooperation with foreign firms in this regard are under way.

<HEADLINE> Improving Fishing Industry By Improving Seabed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Changdao, an island county in east
China's Shandong Province, has successfully stimulated its fishing
industry by "afforestation" work on the bottom of the sea.
</P>
<P>
Aquatic production is the main source of Changdao's income,
with the scallop production alone earning the county 585 million
yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
However, in the past years, as the cultivation area grew, the
ecological structure around the island was thrown out of balance,
and the sea bottom grew more barren, resulting in a sharp decline
in the number of aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities drew up an "afforestation" plan and started
plant sea plants on the sea bottom around 18 uninhabited islands
in 1993. Lush "forests" and "grass" have taken root, markedly
improving water quality and providing a good environment for
marine life.
</P>
<P>
At present, the species around the island are regaining a
balance and the industry, which had seen little progress for
several years, reported a record harvest last year.

Holmes now bettered his record to 28-1 while Taylor dropped to
26-4.
</P>
<P>
Taylor won the title by stopping Julian Jackson in the sixth

<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The world number one
women's doubles pair Ge Fei and Gu Jun of China collected another
trophy when they beat Danish rivals 15-7, 15-3 at the All-England
Championship doubles final here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two Chinese, who were in high fighting spirits, leapt to a
7-0 lead without any resistance and then snatched the first set
15-7.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Helene Kirkegaard and Rikke Olsen, who
ranked fourth in the world, fought back to turn the tide by
unleasing powerful smashes.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese, rallying strongly, gave their rivals no
chance of recovering from the disadvantageous position and finally
won the second set 11-3.
</P>
<P>
In the following women's singles final, China's world champion
Ye Zhaoying, one of the top favorites to win the Atlanta Olympic
title, was beaten 1-11, 1-11 by South Korean ace Bang Soo Hyun.
</P>
<P>
Ye, currently world number one, was so eager to take the
All-England title that she failed to display any of her excellent
skills beause of too much pressure upon herself.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South Korean player Bang Soo Hyun, who beat
Indonesia's ace Susi Susanti on Friday, said that she was more
confident of defeating her Chinese rival after the easy victory in
the first set.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the main weak points of Ye, Bang said:"The Chinese
players are used to playing very fast and straight forward games,
but if you slowed down the pace and returned the rallies with good
angles, they would become confused."
</P>
<P>
However, she added that Ye and Susanti remain the best players
in the world and they are the top favorites for the coming Olympic
badminton gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Defending Champion Poul-Erik Hoyer Larson of Denmark and Rexy
Mainakey and Ricky Subadja of Indonesia retained their titles in
the men's singles and doubles events.
</P>
<P>
The mixed doubles crown was snatched by South Korean players
Park Joo-Bong and Ra Kyung-Min.

MEXICO CITY, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Over 60 percent of all the

This country has numerous protected natural areas where there
exist mammals, birds, fish, and plants in risk of extinction.
</P>
<P>
Javier de la Maza, coordinator of the National System of

location in the transition zone of the two biggest geographical
regions: the Nearctic and the tropical forests of the south.
</P>
<P>
This biological wealth is shared with 10 other nations,
including Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, and so on, said
the expert.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Two Big Auto Part Suppliers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China will set up two big holding
companies with major auto makers and components suppliers as their
stockholders this year to manufacture anti-lock braking systems
and air bags in scale.
</P>
<P>
As a new step of the country's booming automobile industry to
improve safety levels of vehicles, the two companies each will
hook up with a foreign auto maker or component manufacturer, and
grow into a joint venture to involve in international competition,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Xie Penghong, a deputy chief of the Ministry of Machinery
Industry, said that the two holding companies will strive to reach
agreements with their foreign partners, if possible, within this
year.
</P>
<P>
Investment in such a joint venture will be more than two
billion yuan (240 million US dollars), said Zhang Xiaoyu, director
of the ministry's automotive department.
</P>
<P>
China assembled some 330,000 passenger cars and another 1.14
million trucks and buses last year, but very few of them were
equipped with modern anti-lock braking systems and air bags. The
upgrading of safety levels is a urgency for China's automobile
makers this time.
</P>
<P>
Only those foreign companies that promise transfer of advanced
technology and help the joint ventures enter the international
market will be chosen as candidates to be partners, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
The production scale of the expected joint ventures will be
profitable, he said. The air bag plant, for example, will
manufacture 500,000 sets of air bags annually.
</P>
<P>
The two ventures should export their products in large quantity
in the very beginning, as the ministry wishs to see, he said.
</P>
<P>
Aiming at establishing an economy of scales in the automotive
part sector, which is now featured by scattering, disorder and
poor-efficiency production, the two big holding companies are
expected to take the lion's share of the market in the country to
intimidate attempts to launch similar projects.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said that they are confident of the success
of the expected ventures as construction of a similar venture, to
manufacture electronic fuel injection systems for auto engines, is
already under way.
</P>
<P>
The 312 million US dollars venture, between a group of eight
Chinese enterprises and German Robert Bosch GmbH, is expected to
go into production in Shanghai within one to two years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Select New Cuban Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government published an
advertisement today in the Cuban official daily "Granma,"
announcing a lottery for Cubans who want to emigrate legally to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Cubans at the ages of 18-55 who want to live in the
U.S. territory should go to the U.S. Office of Interests in Havana
to file their applications before April 30, said the advertisement.
</P>
<P>
Eligible participants must meet the requirements: having a high
school degree, three years of working experience and having a
relative in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The visas to be issued by the United States government to
Cubans are part of the 20,000 visas granted every year in
accordance with the migration agreement signed by Washington and
Havana in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The advertisement said that those selected will have to pass a
medical examination, police records and "Public Charges,"
according to the U.S. legislation.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the next selection of Cuban emigrants
demonstrated that the migration agreement between Cuba and the
United States is still in force, despite the tension of relations
between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton approved the Helms-Burton law
Tuesday to harden the trade embargo against Cuba as a reprisal for

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf, playing her first
tournament after four-month layoff, came from behind in two
tiebreakers to beat Conchita Martinez in the final for the Evert
Cup in Indian Wells.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who had foot surgery last December, edged her Spaniard
opponent 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
Co top-ranked together with Monica Seles, Graf trailed Martinez
4-2 in the first-set tiebreaker before winning five of the next
six points.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Graf fell behind 5-2 in the tiebreaker. But
she then served an ace, one of only five for her in the match.
</P>
<P>
Graf went on to win when Martinez double-faulted on the 10th
point, hit into the net on the 12th, then hit her return wide on
Graf's final serve.
</P>
<P>
Graf made 53 unforced errors against 42 by Martinez. However,
Graf was power enough to be able to make the turnover after she
fell behind in the tiebreakers.
</P>
<P>
Seles had entered the tournament, but withdrew due to an injury
suffered just a week before the tournament started.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Russian-U.S. "Chicken War" Enters Second Stage  (by Zhang Tiegang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A Russian-U.S. "chicken import
war," which started a month ago, entered its second stage
Saturday, as Washington has not met Moscow's key demands.
</P>
<P>
Russia will continue to hold to its principal position over the
import of U.S. poultry, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander
Zaveryukha said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"A final decision on the renewal of U.S. poultry supply to
the Russian market is fully contingent upon the U.S. side,"
Russian chief Veterinary Inspector Vyacheslav Avilov said on the
same day.
</P>
<P>
Although the United States has declared "additional
governmental measures" to meet some of Russia's main demands and
promised to initiate tighter quality control over poultry exports
to Russia, a key issue remains to be resolved, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. side has not so far decided on the inspection by
U.S. poultry companies of chicken legs to discover whether the
poultry is salmonella-ridden," Avilov said. Russia declared
earlier it will halt imports of U.S. chicken starting on March 16
unless a last-minute agreement between the two sides can be
hammered.
</P>
<P>
Moscow stopped issuing licenses to U.S. poultry importers on
February 16, citing the failure of the U.S. side to meet stringent
new Russian sanitary guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Russian Agriculture Ministry officials threatened at the same
time to ban chicken imports from the United States altogether
starting on March 16 unless the United States could meet the
requirements.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, both the government and U.S. poultry farmers
reacted angrily to Russia's position, saying that it was a thin
disguise for an increasingly protectionist trade policy.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and U.S.
Vice President Albert Gore agreed over the telephone that the ban
would not be carried out if the U.S. side would guarantee stricter
control over the quality of the exported fowl.
</P>
<P>
Following their agreement, some measures were taken by the
U.S. side. However, Moscow has still insisted that its key demand
has not been met.
</P>
<P>
Avilov told reporters that the talks will continue in any case,
and if a full agreement is reached, Russia will issue import
licenses to those producers who met Russian quality requirements.
</P>
<P>
Russia is a major market for U.S. poultry and U.S. chicken
exports are estimated to supply more than half the Russian market.
</P>
<P>
U.S. chicken costs significantly less than domestically
produced fowl, and with cheap imports flooding the market, Russia
raised import tariffs on poultry last month.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is eager to run for a
second term of office in the forthcoming presidential elections,
is trying to use the issue of protecting local producers as one of
his "main cards" in the election campaign.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (Xinhua) -- Alex Zanardi grabbed the
pole Saturday for the Rio 400 Auto Race, the first IndyCar race
ever held in South America.
</P>
<P>
Zanardi, driving for Target Chip Ganassi Racing, had a fast lap
of 40.162 seconds in a Reynard-Honda around the three-kilometer
modified oval at Nelson Piquet Raceway.
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Vasser, who won the season opener in Homestead, Florida,
two weeks ago, had to settle for the second in another
Reynard-Honda, while local favorite Andre Ribeiro was third in a
Lola-Honda.
</P>
<P>
The big news came in the afternoon as the Canadian rookie Greg
Moore took a surprising fourth in his Reynard-Mercedes in only his
second qualifying for an Indy-car race.
</P>
<P>
Drivers had to struggle to adjust to the unusual track, which
was a cross between an oval and a Formula One-type track, with
sharp curves and long straightaways, as well was the hot summer
weather in Brazil that reached a horrible 60 degrees Celsius on
the asphalt.

Italy's Fabio Fontanelli, who had taken the overall lead by
winning Friday's third leg, trailed by 3:05 Saturday and fell to
sixth overall, 54 seconds behind Pianegonda.

<HEADLINE> Urban Metro Construction Riding on Slow Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China's subway-construction craze
has been blocked by a fund shortage, today's "China Daily" quoted
Wang Yuexian with the State Planning Commission (SPC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
A circular from the State Council released at the end of last
year accounced a pause in approval of new metro projects and a
halt in metro construction in Nanjing, Qingdao and Tianjin and in
Shenyang's light rail.
</P>
<P>
Only Beijing's 13-km Fuxingmen-Bawangfen line, Shanghai's 27-km
No 2 Line and Guangzhou's 18.5-km No 1 Line are permitted to
continue.
</P>
<P>
Funds needed for metro construction are beyond the means of the
central and local government and operating expenses are too high,
the circular said.
</P>
<P>
Wang explained that 40 percent of the needed funds come from
foreign government loans for the purchase of equipment. The other
60 percent, mainly for basic construction, have proven difficult
to collect, said Wang with SPC's fixed assets investment bureau.
</P>
<P>
Planned investment channels include government investment in
urban construction, securities issues and development of real
estate along metro routes.
</P>
<P>
Wang cited the case of Beijing Metro Co., noting that Beijing's
east-west Fuxingmen to Bawangfen line, which is under
construction, was originally planned to begin operation next
year. Insufficient funding will delay the opening by ten
years. The company's plan to collect funds through real estate
development for the construction of a north-south line has proven
difficult.
</P>
<P>
Operating metro lines in China now include 40 km in Beijing, 16
km in Shanghai and 7.4 km in Tianjin. Like most of the world's
subway systems, the lines operate at a loss. But their important
role in urban public transit attracted other cities to apply for
metros of their own.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that since 1980, more than 20 cities have applied to
build or expand metro lines, and it had been estimated that by the
end of the century, one-third of the 35 cities with population of
one million or more will have their own metros.
</P>
<P>
But these are too expensive: per-km construction costs of the
ongoing projects vary between 440 million yuan to 760 million yuan
(53 million to 91.5 million US dollars). Conservative estimates
place total investment in the planned projects of 20 cities at 200
billion to 300 billion yuan (24 billion to 36 billion US
dollars).

<P>
TAIYUAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi, an inland province in
north China, has boosted its animal husbandry output and made it
a pillar sector of its rural economy.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 the province had 5.61 million pigs, 2.51
million head of cattle and 62.7 million head of poultry in stock,
up 54.5 percent, 40.3 percent, and 64.1 percent, respectively,
over the 1990 figures.
</P>
<P>
It also had 9.15 million sheep, up 28.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The output of meat, eggs and milk last year reached 610,000
tons, 361,000 tons and 293,000 tons, up 91.4 percent, 34.9 percent
and 63.4 percent, respectively, over the 1990 figures.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official in charge of agriculture attributed the
good results to the establishment of market-oriented livestock
breeding centers, introduction of scientific methods and
encouragement of farmers to raise more domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
At present, Luliang Prefecture in the province has nearly
28,000 households, 248 villages and 31 townships specializing in
animal husbandry.

<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, England, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Poul-Erik Hoyer of
Denmark retained his men's singles title here on Saturday at the
All-England Open Championships.
</P>
<P>
The elegant left-handed Dane played the best match of his life
to overwhelm Malaysia's Rashid Sidek, Commonwealth champion, 15-6,
15-6.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer set out to deny Rashid chances to attack by mixing up the
pace, often slowing the contest down in between rallies. He also
set out to avoid cross-court lifts or flicks so that Rashid would
have few chances to project his dangerous overhead slices and
smashes.
</P>
<P>
"My psychological control of the final was much better this
year," Hoyer admitted. "Winning last time has done so much for my
confidence"
</P>
<P>
There was hardly any phase of the match when it seemed Rashid
might really get into it. He came back from 1-9 to 6-12 in the
first game, but only served once more, and recovered from 0-7 to
6-8 in the second -- but the champion's response was even more
emphatic.
</P>
<P>
The women's singles provided the first South Korean winner of
the title for ten years and one of the most one-sided finals ever.
</P>
<P>
Bang Soo-Hyun, the third-seeded Asian Games champion beat Ye
Zhaoying, the top-seeded world champion from China 11-1, 11-1 in
only 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Bang, who had beaten the Olympic champion Susi Susanti in the
semi-finals, got off to a great start, winning six points in her
first run of serves, and as Ye got further and further behind her
confidence and her play collapsed.
</P>
<P>
She served only five times in the first game, gaining her first
point only after Bang had nine, and in the second game she went
0-10 down having served only four times.
</P>
<P>
South Korea ended with two titles because later Park Joo-Bong,
widely regarded as the greatest doubles player ever and making his
second comeback at the age of 30 to try to win a mixed doubles
gold in the Olympics, took the mixed title in partnership with Ra
Kyung-Min.
</P>
<P>
They won 15-10, 15-10 against English pair Simon Archer and
Julie Bradbury and, after only four months together, already look
good enough to deny the Indonesians and the Chinese in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
China continued its great tradition in women's doubles when Ge
Fei and Gu Jun won their first All-England with a 15-7, 15-3 win
over the Danes Helene Kirkegaard and Rikke Olsen, and Indonesia,
which had had hopes of four titles, gained only one.
</P>
<P>
This was the men's doubles in which Ricky Subagja and Rexy
Mainaky retained their title with an emphatic 15-6,15-5 success
against Cheah Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock, the second seeded
Malaysians.

<HEADLINE> China's Food Industry Developing Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- After comprehensive development
during the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991--1995), the food industry
in China is playing an increasingly important role in the nation's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, the industry's total output value
reached 430 billion yuan (about 52 billion US dollars), and sales
amounted to 500 billion yuan, increases of 88.2 percent and 134.8
percent respectively, over 1990.
</P>
<P>
Taxes for the industry in 1995 hit 97.5 billion yuan, 2.4 times
the 1990 figure, and export value last year stood at seven billion
US dollars, representing a 97.3 percent rise over 1990.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the industry has met the rising demand
for better quality rice, flour, edible oils, meat, fowl, eggs,
milk, fish, sugar, cigarettes, soft drinks, canned food, and
seasonings.
</P>
<P>
Many fast foods as well as nutritious and healthier foods have
appeared in the markets.
</P>
<P>
In the total food industrial output value, the proportion of
food and soft drink production increased, that of food processing
was steady, while that of tobacco production fell.
</P>
<P>
Production for refined edible oil, flour, natural soft drinks,
low-alcohol beverages, and food low in fat, sugar, salt, and
calories was on the rise, while that for tobacco and liquor fell.
</P>
<P>
Small enterprises still dominated food production, but
enterprise groups were increasing their share.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the 1980s, most beer breweries had annual
production capacity of about 30,000 tons, but those with a
capacity of 50,000 to 100,000 tons are now in the majority, while
a small number have a capacity of over 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, more than 600 enterprises specializing
in cigarette, alcoholic beverages, soft drinks, canned food, meat,
candies, and biscuits have been listed as large enterprises,
accounting for 12 percent of China's total.
</P>
<P>
Among China's 500 best industrial enterprises, 71 are in food
production, or 14.2 percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Funds Hampers U.N. Mission in Guatemala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Lack of funds could make it
impossible to extend the U.N. Observers Mission for Guatemala
(Minigua), according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein was quoted as saying
today that the extension of the mandate, which ends on March 31,
depends on the economic contributions of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
The mission oversees the compliance of an agreement on human
rights signed by the Guatemalan government and the guerrillas in
that country, where the last armed conflict in Central America
still continues.
</P>
<P>
U.N. General Secretary Boutros Boutros Ghali has asked the
U.N. General Assembly to extend the Minigua mandate until December
31.
</P>
<P>
But if the resources -- some 20 million dollars -- are not
authorized, the mission, formed by some 300 observers, will not be
able to continue its task, minister Stein said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minigua spokesman Carlos Urrutia said that there is
a possibility of extending the mandate, because the funds may be
found.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. financial crisis is caused by a delay in the
contributions from many countries.

NANNING, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A network of railways, highways,
airports, and sea ports is expected to contribute to economic
growth of southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The 220-km-long Nanning-Baise section of the Nanning-Kunming
Railway has begun service, and the Qinzhou-Beihai rail line, more
than 100 km in length, is also operational.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,336-km railways had been opened to traffic in the
region by 1994, a 33.7 percent increase over 1983, local officials
say.
</P>
<P>
After the Nanning to Beihai and Wuzhou highways opened, the
regional government started work on highways linking Liuzhou with
Guilin, Nanning with Baise, Qinzhou with Fangcheng, and Baise with
Panxian in neighboring Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the Beihai, Liuzhou, and Wuzhou airports have
been built, and Guilin's Liangjiang International Airport is
scheduled for operation this year.
</P>
<P>
Expansion work on Fangcheng and Beihai ports has been
completed, and that on Qinzhou Port is being speeded up. The
number of 10,000-dwt and above berths in the three ports is now

<HEADLINE> Wuhan to Invest Heavily in Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, the capital of central
China's Hubei Province, intends to inject 40 billion yuan (about
4.8 billion US dollars) into infrastructure in the next five years
in order to improve its investment environment.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the city will complete the construction
on significant infrastructure projects, said Zhang Zhengqi, an
official in charge of the city's planning and policy making.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the city's economic growth averaged
15.9 percent, and it worked out a plan to maintain this speed of
development in the coming years, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
In energy, the city will attach importance to the the third
phase of the Yangluo Power Station by installing two 600,000 kw
generating units. A power station for the Wuhan Steel Plant will
also be built.
</P>
<P>
In transportation, the city will build part of the
Beijing-Zhuhai, Shanghai-Chengdu highways, the Baishazhou Yangtze
River Bridge, and several bridges spanning the Hanjiang River.
</P>
<P>
In telecommunications, it will expand the number of telephone
switchboards by 1.5 million telephone lines so that 40 percent of
urban households have access to telephones.
</P>
<P>
During the five-year period, the city also has plans for
pollution-control projects on Donghu and Moshui lakes, for turning
the Yangtze River banks into market places, and to build
residences with a floor space of 18 million sq m.
</P>
<P>
The city is ambitious in wanting to introduce six billion US
dollars in foreign investment by 2000, with preferential policies
still to be given to infrastructure, basic industries, and hi-tech
industry, the official said.

women's final on Saturday.

She was in excellent touch on Saturday, adding the scalp of
China's Ye to that of Susi Susanti, her semifinal victim.
</P>

But Ye, the world number one, hardly helped her cause in an
embarrassing 20 minutes, making a succession of unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
It was a big disappointment for an enthusiastic 5,000-strong
crowd on a showpiece day.
</P>
<P>
The fans had already seen three somewhat one-sided finals, in
sharp contrast to some entertaining fare on the first three days.

Ye, known as the cat for her stealth-like on-court qualities,
pouncing swift and hard, declined to comment after her defeat.

<P>
BELGRADE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. spokesman in Sarajevo
Alexander Ivanko today sharply condemned the Muslim-Croat
Federation for tolerating looting and intimidation of Serbs in a
Serb Sarajevo suburb.
</P>
<P>
Ivanko said more than 100 complaints had been filed with
international police monitors and U.N. workers in Ilidza since the
Serb suburb was turned over to the federation's control on March
12.
</P>
<P>
"The Serbs who... decided to stay are now planning to leave the
area, feeling betrayed by the international community and
threatened by the (Muslim-Croat) federation government," the
Tanjug news agency quoted Ivanko as saying.
</P>
<P>
Serbs have so far handed over four Sarajevo municipalities to
the Muslim-Croat federation in keeping with the Dayton peace
accord, and are to hand over the last one Grbavica on March 19.
</P>
<P>
The five municipalities have been held by Serbs since the
outbreak of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Driven by fear, almost all Serbs have moved from the five
municipalities to other Serb-held areas in Republika Srpska, the
Serb entity in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Duma Speaker Defends Duma' Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Gennady Selenyov, chairman of the
State Duma (lower house of the Russian parliament), today issued a
statement in which he defended the lower chamber's Friday
resolutions denouncing the Belovezhsk accords that dissolved the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The Duma approved by a majority vote Friday two resolutions
denouncing the 1991 agreements on dismissing the Soviet union but
on forming the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The
agreements were signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and then
leaders of Ukraine and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
In a statement circulated here today, Yeltsin stressed that the
Duma resolutions are "legally unfounded" and aim to "create a
political and legal deadlock in Russia." "As the guarantor of the
constitution, I will not stand any attempts to undermine the
basics of the Russian statehood and destabilize the situation in
the country," he warned.
</P>
<P>
However, Seleznyov said in his statement that "the Duma's
resolutions give no reason to speculate that somebody intends to
restore the former state (Soviet Union) by force."
</P>
<P>
"Clever people understand that the will of the people rather
than that of governors and parliamentarians is needed for a
'divorce' or a 'union,'" the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Deputies who voted for adopting these resolutions
declared after about five years passed that the great Soviet Union
was destroyed despite the peoples' will and with gross violations
of the Soviet Constitution."
</P>
<P>
"They told the whole world on behalf of their voters what the
three leaders of former Soviet republics had stolen from their
country," Seleznyov emphasized.
</P>
<P>
By these resolutions, he said, Duma deputies gave the
president, Yeltsin, the opportunity to start the process of his
political rehabilitation, as one of those who signed the
unconstitutional Belovezhsk documents, in the eyes of not only
Russians but also Soviet peoples.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Duma resolutions, Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin described them as "more than abstract" and "a
part of the left opposition's election tactics." The left
opposition stands behind the communist-dominated lower house, he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Local Government Elections Begin In Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- As the first in the series of
elections under the three-year transition-to-civil-rule program
of the current Nigerian military government, local government
elections on non-party basis began today with Nigerians electing
ward delegate all over Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
This correspondent visited a polling station in Eti-Osa local
government area this afternoon. Nigerians above 18 years- old
were seen on queues cast votes in good order with several
policemen watching nearby.
</P>
<P>
An electoral official said that the turn-outs were much nore
than expected.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Nigerian police force planned to deploy
50,000 men to monitor electioneering nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, some independent Americans and U.S.journalists were
reported to have come to Nigeria to monitor the election.
</P>
<P>
A total of 207,810 delegates will emerge today after voting in
the nation's 6,927 wards.
</P>
<P>
Each ward in all the 593 local governments is to elect 30
delegates, who would constitute the electoral college for the
election of councillors and chairmen for all the local
governments in the next laps of the three-phase election before
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports from the News Agency of Nigeria, the
ward delegate election today kicked off with an impressive turn-
out of voters naion-wide. Reports from dfferent parts of the
country showed that the election took place under peaceful
atmosphere but with minor hitches "here and there".
</P>
<P>
In many wards, the news agency said, election of delegates
could not be held today due to delayed accreditation by polling
officers and in some cases by unruly behaviour on the part of the
large crowds of voters at the polling centre.
</P>
<P>
Under the transition program, another election into the local
government councils on party basis will be held sometime in the
fourth quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
This will be preceded by the creation of new states and local
governments and the process of political party registrations.

<HEADLINE> US Financier Gives Russia $100 Mln for Internet Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- American financier George
Soros has decided to spend some 100 million U.S. dollars to help
link Russian provincial universities to the Internet by 2001,
according to a Washington Post report today.
</P>
<P>
The five-year plan to establish and equip Internet centers at
the 27 Russian universities outside Moscow and St. Petersburg is
Soro's most ambitious program since 1993, when he gave 115 million
U.S. dollars to support former Soviet scientists.
</P>
<P>
Soros, 65, who is in Moscow for a three-day visit, met to clinch
the deal Friday with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
Chernomyrdin reportedly pledged to participate in the project by
providing the fiber-optic lines or satellite capacity necessary to
link the new centers with the world's computer networks.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government's cost is estimated at several million
U.S. dollars a year to maintain the network.
</P>
<P>
Russian students, scholars and professionals outside Moscow and
St. Petersburg in many cases have had little or no experience with
the Internet, both because of the cost of computing equipment and
because of the poor quality of telephone lines, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Alex Goldfarb, an adviser to Soros on Russian, told reporters
that the so-called Soros project aims to improve that situation.

<HEADLINE> Karadzic: Sarajevo to Turn Into European Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb President Radovan
Karadzic said today that the international community was wrong to
give the largest part of Sarajevo to Muslims, since there would be
no longer room in the city for Christians, either Serbs or Croats.
</P>
<P>
"Sarajevo will become a European Tehran, from which
anti-European terrorism will be launched," the Tanjug news agency
quoted Karadzic as saying in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement, five Serb-held Sarajevo suburbs will
be handed over to Muslim-Croat control to make the capital a
united and "multi-ethnic" city. But almost all Serbs have left the
five affected sectors in fear of possible reprisals and
discrimination, dealing a heavy blow to the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The Serb leader said the Dayton peace had not been undermined
by the exodus of Serbs from Sarajevo but by the unsettled
relations between Muslims and Croats in their federation.
</P>
<P>
"Republika Srpska urges the international community to help
Muslims and Croats organize their federation, since the Serb
entity in Bosnia-Herzegovina will not participate in a possible
war between the two partners," Karadzic said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the tensions between the Muslims and Croats were
so high recently that even the renewal of armed conflict was not
ruled out.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia will meet in Geneva
Monday to discuss the alarming situation in Bosnia, including
the crisis in the Muslim-Croat federation and the mass exodus of
Serbs from Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The Serb leader said all three peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina
obviously wanted to preserve their own identity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serbs have been struggling to separate from the
Muslim-led government and join the Serbs in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic proposed that the Serbs be organized on the model of
Scandinavia or the two entities in Bosnia -- the Serb republic and
the Muslim-Croat federation -- separate peacefully as the Czech
and Slovak republics did several years ago.

<HEADLINE> Powell Reiterates No Intention to Run for White House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Retired U.S. General Colin
Powell has reiterated that he will not be involved in running for
the White House, according to a published report today.
</P>
<P>
Powell, hero of he U.S. Gulf War in 1991, made the statement in
an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times amid wide speculations
that he could be induced to join U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole's campaign as a vice presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old Senate GOP leader, who has captured more than
two-thirds of the party delegates to win the Republican
presidential nomination, has repeatedly hinted that he will select
Powell as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
"I'm speaking to you for myself. My position is that I will not
run for any elective office," Powell said.
</P>
<P>
The former head of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff said last
November that he would not be a candidate, making it clear he did
not want to subject his family to the personal attacks that often
became part of the race for the White House.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Lebanon Sign Agreements to Enhance Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Lebanon signed here today
two agreements aimed at boosting relations in the economic field
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreements, one for encouraging investments and the other
for preventing dual taxation, were signed at a meeting of the
Higher Egyptian-Lebanese Committee, co-chaired by Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Al-Hariri and his Egyptian counterpart Kamal
el-Ganzouri.
</P>

Hariri, currently on a visit to Egypt, said the agreements
would strengthen bilateral economic cooperation and increase the
volume of trade exchange between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, who met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak today,
also called on Arab states to overcome their differences to
promote inter-Arab economic cooperation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Poll Ends With Low Voter Turnout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Only a quarter of Zimbabwe's 4.9
million registered voters have casted their ballots in the
country's presidential elections which ended today, according to
the official counting.
</P>
<P>
An official report said that of the registered voters,
1,208,480 voted at 2,829 polling stations and 220 mobile units
throughout the southern African state.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe is the sole candidate for the election
since his opposition challengers, Ndabaningi Sithole of ZANU
(Ndonga) and United Parties leader Abel Muzorewa, have pulled out
of the race last week.
</P>
<P>
However, their withdrawal from the poll was not acknowledged
by the government which denounced it as "invalid" as it was done
less than the law-stipulated 21 days before the polling.
</P>
<P>
Mariyawanda Nzuwah, chairman of the Election Directorate, told
a news conference today that the low turnout in the poll was
partly owing to the possibility that many voters had concluded
there would be no polling since there was only one candidate.
</P>
<P>
Registrar-General Tobaiwa Mudede said that the counting of
ballots would begin on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
He also dispelled earlier reports which said the winner would
have to gain at least 50 percent of the votes.
