<HEADLINE> Indonesia Announces First Stage of Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Wednesday announced the first stage of its economic and financial
reform and restructuring in a bid to overcome the current monetary
crisis.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing held here Wednesday evening, Minister of
Trade and Industry Tunky Ariwibowo said the first stage of
economic reform was approved by the first meeting of the Economic
and Financial Resilience Council headed by President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The president asked his ministers to complete as quickly as
possible revision to the proposed government budget for 1998/99
fiscal year, said Tunky.
</P>
<P>
According to the council's meeting, the revision of the budget
should be based on the assumptions of zero percent growth, 20
percent inflation and an exchange rate stabilizing at 5,000 rupiah
per U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The council also decided to incorporate the Reforestation Fund
and the Investment Fund into the government budget and to
safeguard budget allocations for poverty alleviation, health and
basic education.
</P>
<P>
The government will immediately cancel all special tax and
customs privileges previously granted to the National Car Program
as well as all budgetary and extra-budgetary funding of the
country's aircraft project, said Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhamad
who also attended the news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Governor of Bank Indonesia Sudradjad Djiwandono said
at the news briefing that he will soon announce transparent and
equitable rules for solving liquidity and solvency problems of
private banks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has decided to lift the restrictions on the
branching of joint-venture banks and sub-branching of foreign
banks, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
The government will immediately grant Bank Indonesia autonomy
to implement an effective monetary policy, he added.
</P>
<P>
On foreign trade, the meeting decided to eliminate all import
restrictions on all new and used ships.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Minister Tunky said that from February 1,
the government will cut tariffs on all food items to a maximum of
5 percent in order to ensure the lowest cost food supplies to the
population.
</P>
<P>
"This will include all food products for human consumption and
will reduce tariffs on more than 500 items," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs on all non-food agricultural items such as wool and
flax will also be reduced by 5 percent in order to reduce
production costs and increase efficiency in domestic industry, he
said.
</P>
<P>
To eliminate monopoly, all farmers and traders are allowed to
freely buy and sell cloves to and from all agents at a freely
determined market price, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
From February 1, all agents are free to import, buy and sell
all types of sugar and flour except rice which has been controlled
by the government.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto has also opened widely the field of
wholesale and retail trade through his decrees. From March 31,
1998, foreign investment firms will be able to engage in all
general wholesale or retail activities, Tunky said.
</P>
<P>
From February 1, he said, the government will remove any
restrictive marketing arrangements for cement, paper and plywood
while eliminating trade regulations in wood and rattan.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economic and financial reform program has got firm
support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which agreed to
provide 23 billion U.S. dollars to the country.
</P>
<P>
Tunky said President Soeharto is working on the next stage of
program implementation.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Labor Department Predicts Massive Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Labor and
Employment Wednesday predicted that massive layoffs could occur
this year in the Philippines due to economic difficulties brought
about by the regional currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The department said it has received notices of termination from
131 business firms nationwide to lay off 7,481 workers in the
first two weeks of January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The notices of termination were filed with 11 of 15 labor
department regional offices throughout the country. The notices
said the layoff and retrenchment of workers were due to economic
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The department's labor and employment statistics showed that
those to be laid off were 3,067 permanent employees and 4,018
temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
The National Capital Region had the most number of layoffs,
with 66 establishments filing notices of termination, affecting
4,702 workers, 1,719 of them permanent and 2,587 temporary, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The department has warned firm owners and other employers
earlier not to use economic crisis as the reason to lay off
workers.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Meets With Iraqi Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Wednesday met with visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf briefed Khatami on the current situation in Iraq and
the negotiations between Iraq and the U.N. over arms inspection,
the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister arrived here Friday night for a
three-day official visit. But the visit was extended hours before
al-Sahhaf decided to leave.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believed that one of the objectives of
al-Sahhaf's visit to Iran was to seek Iran's help in lifting the
U.N. sanctions imposed on Baghdad for its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq believes that Iran, the present chairman of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), can play an
important role in encouraging the Islamic countries to put more
pressures on the U.N. to lift the embargo and to defend Iraq'
rights, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
They said that Iran and Iraq have also shown their willingness
to improve their cool relations in order to challenge their common
enemy the United States.
</P>
<P>
During al-Sahhaf's visit, Iran and Iraq reached an agreement to
form two committees to solve remaining disputes between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two committees will discuss the issues of prisoners of war
(POW) left over by the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, commercial
cooperation between Iran and Iraq on the basis of the
U.N. Security Council resolutions and travel of Iranian and Iraqi
citizens to either country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was considered as a constructive step taken by
the two governments to improve their relations, since the issue of
POWs was believed to be the major hurdle for their rapprochement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Drops in November to Lowest in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. deficit in goods
and services trade narrowed to 8.04 billion U.S. dollars in
November, 1997, the lowest in eight months, the Commerce
Department reported here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the U.S. trade deficit was down 11.6
percent from a revised October figure of 9.09 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For November, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan plunged by 28
percent to 4.2 billion dollars, also the smallest gap since June.
The deficit with China fell by 20 percent to 4.13 billion dollars,
the best showing since May, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the monthly drop, for the first 11 months of 1997,
the U.S deficit with Japan is running 17 percent ahead of the
previous year and with China is up an even bigger 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 1.05 billion dollars narrowing in the overall deficit in
November reflected a 2.3 percent decline in imports of goods and
services, which fell to 87.23 billion dollars, the lowest level in
June.
</P>
<P>
The decline was largely attributed to a 968 million dollar
decrease in crude oil imports which fell to 4.04 billion dollars,
the lowest level in 20 months. Crude oil imports by volume had
surged to an all-time high in October. The smaller November figure
reflected a big drop in volume and a smaller decline in price,
averaging 17.13 dollars per barrel as against 17.65 dollars in
October.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. exports fell by 1.3 percent to 79.20
billion dollars with declining demand for computers, computer
chips and airplanes. But exports of U.S. autos and auto parts were
up 4.8 percent to an all-time high of 11.79 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. deficit with Mexico fell by a sharp 40 percent to 884
million dollars, the smallest since January 1995 when Mexico was
forced to devalue its currency.
</P>
<P>
The deficit for the first 11 months of 1997 is running at an
annual rate of 111.4 billion dollars, slightly higher than last
year's 111 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But economists are forecasting the trade deficit for 1998 could
widen significantly in 1998 in view of the financial crisis in
some part of Asia.

<HEADLINE> Wholesale Trade Down Slightly in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian wholesalers sold 24.8
billion dollars (16.1 billion USD) worth of goods and service in
November 1997, down 0.8 percent from October, Statistics Canada
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Led by farm machinery, household goods, and apparel and dry
goods, nine of the 11 trade groups showed lower sales, the
statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, wholesale sales of computers and electronic
equipment, and motor vehicles and parts were up slightly.
</P>
<P>
The agency noted that in general, Canada's wholesale sales have
been increasing since January 1996, after a slowdown in demand for
most of 1995.
</P>
<P>
So far, the year of 1997 has been an excellent year for
Canadian wholesalers. Sales for the first 11 months of 1997 were
12.5 percent higher than in the same period in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Fake Notes Circulating in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- There are some forged 10,000 Kwacha
notes (about seven U.S. Dollars each note) currently circulating in
Zambia, warned Bank of Zambia here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Acting Head of Public Relations of the Central Bank, Dave Kalumba,
told the public in statement to look out for the notes with serial
number g/b 7302181 which are on the forged notes, reported The
Post.
</P>
<P>
"The notes are visibly made out of ordinary paper and have no
silver line," Kalumba was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"To distinguish the genuine notes from the forged ones, members of
the public should look out for the water mark which is missing on the
fake 10,000 Kwacha."
</P>
<P>
He said there is a similarity between the newly forged note with an
earlier one which was in circulation last year.
</P>
<P>
"Both appear to have been photocopied using colur copiers," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba said the Central Bank is carrying out a full analysis and
necessary investigations to trace the source of the fake notes.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate President Likely to Be Ousted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The president of the Philippine
Senate, Ernesto Maceda, is in danger of being ousted as a majority
in the Senate have allegedly signed a resolution calling for his
ouster, local television reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At least 14 members of the 24-seat Senate have reportedly
signed the resolution unseating Maceda, raising hopes that former
Senate president Neptali Gonzales could once again assume the
post, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate session was suspended just minutes after it was
opened Wednesday afternoon. It was not clear why the session was
suspended.
</P>
<P>
Maceda was reportedly rushed to a clinic due to high blood
pressure shortly after being informed that he was being ousted
from his post.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the Senate will resume its session and decide
the fate of Maceda Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Senator Freddie Webb, who admitted having signed the
resolution, told reporters that the plan to oust Maceda is already
"a done deal."
</P>
<P>
Webb said it was his party leader, Senator Edgardo Angara, who
initiated the move to oust Maceda. Angara was the president of the
united opposition -- the Struggle of Patriotic Filipino Masses.
</P>
<P>
Webb said the primary reason cited in the resolution is the
question of Maceda's impartiality in presiding over the joint
session of Congress which shall canvass the votes for the
presidential and vice-presidential candidates in the May
elections.
</P>
<P>
Maceda is the brother-in-law of the speaker of the House of
Representative, Jose de Venecia, who is the presidential candidate
of the ruling Lakas-NUCD (National Union of Christian Democrats)
party.
</P>
<P>
Maceda resigned as chairman of the united opposition early this
month after he lost to Angara the opposition's vice presidential
candidacy in the May 1998 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports indicated that Maceda could join forces with de
Venecia in seeking the mayoral post of Manila or a congressional
seat in the House of Representatives, but the Senate president has
yet to confirm his political plans.
</P>
<P>
Although Maceda appeared to have agreed to step down, he warned
that his ouster would not help in the passage of legislation.

<HEADLINE> Nile Basin Conference Ends in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nile Basin States Conference
ended here Wednesday, calling for a comprehensive strategy to
rationalize the use of Nile resources, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The conference was co-organized by the World Bank in
cooperation with the United Nations Development Program and the
Canadian International Development Agency.
</P>
<P>
Experts and technicians from 10 Nile Basin states, namely,
Egypt, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Eritrea, Burundi, Kenya,
Zaire and Ethiopia, participated in the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The participants discussed ways of minimizing the Nile water
waste and reaching an all-round Nile basin agreement on developing
the Nile resources.
</P>
<P>
At the closing session on Wednesday, they issued a number of
recommendations, calling for "moving from the stage of planning to
that of action" in the protection and utilization of Nile.
</P>
<P>
They also proposed holding regular meetings with a view to
exchanging consultations on ways of maximize the use of the Nile
water resources.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations also urged the eradication of poverty in
the Nile Basin countries and development of the Nile area through
"equitable utilization" of the river.
</P>
<P>
But the recommendations did not touch upon the oft-debated
issue of the distribution of the Nile water among the basin
countries. The only agreement on the Nile dates back to
1959.

<HEADLINE> CBI Calls on Business Get Ready for EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) - UK companies need to get prepared
for EMU even though Britain will not be joining in the first wave,
said Adair Turner, Director-General of the Confederation of
British Industry (CBI) today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the eve of a CBI conference on the practical
implications of EMU, Turner said: "The count-down has started -
companies have only 344 days to go before EMU begins, and 1440
days before the new euro notes and coins come into use."
</P>
<P>
Turner said: "Companies need to work out the implications that
EMU and a single currency will have on the way they do business."
</P>
<P>
From 1 January 1999 business environment in the EU will be
changed, Turner said, so it is vital that companies grasp the
strategic opportunities this offers and protect themselves against
any risks.
</P>
<P>
On the legal front Turner said that it was reassuring that laws
had been passed to ensure continuity of contracts after 1 January
1999.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless companies will need to make sure that existing
contracts which run beyond 1998 do not contain any clauses which
might bring them to an end, he added.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to the time when the UK may itself join EMU,
Turner said that companies would then need to make changes to
their company accounts, payments, payrolls, sales and marketing to
take account of the euro, all of which may involve making
significant modifications to the relevant IT program.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Cause Damage in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 500 families
have been left homeless in the northern Mozambican province of
Cabo Delgado, due to heavy rains which have been falling since
the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
Waters from the rain are about one metre deep in the town of
Mocimboada, Radio Mozambique said today.
</P>
<P>
Many houses have been destroyed, others submerged and crops
flooded, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Other districts, such as Palma and Nangade, have been cut off
from the rest of the country, making it difficult to provide the
necessary aid to the 3000 residents of the areas.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican government officials said important roads, such as
one linking the district of Mueda to Pemba, the provincial
capital, are also at risk of being blocked by floods.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Mueda District administrator, Ambrosio
Vicente, as saying there will be no hope of a good harvest if the
rain continues in northern Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Nestle's Sales in 1997 Reach 46 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nestle Group's consolidated
sales in 1997 reached 69.9 billion Swiss francs (about 46 billion
US dollars), an increase of nearly 16 percent over the preceding
year.
</P>
<P>
Nestle assumed that the 1997 net profit growth rate will be
similar to the growth rate of sales. According to a press release
issued today by the Nestle S.A. at its headquarters in Vevey.
</P>
<P>
Real internal growth accelerated from 2.7 percent in 1996 to
3.2 percent for the full year 1997. It was particularly strong in
the Middle East, eastern Europe, many Asian markets and North
America.
</P>
<P>
As the Swiss franc devalued against the US dollar, exchange
rates had a positive impact of 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Full results for 1997 and the dividend proposal will be
released following the meeting of the Board of Directors of Nestle
SA on March 26, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Siemens, 3Com Cooperate to Integrate Telephone with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Siemens AG announced
Wednesday that it is working together with the U.S. 3Com
Corporation to launch in spring this year a new technology to
integrate telephone with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Siemens said that the new technology, which incorporates 3Com's
remote data access technology with the EWSD digital switching
system of Siemens, would allow telephone network operators to
offer their customers efficient Internet access via existing
telephone switching systems without needing to set up additional
new Internet infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, combined with the new technology, Siemens is also
developing new Internet services which would make it possible for
customers who are surfing the Internet to identify incoming
telephone calls or to display their telephone account on their PC
screens.
</P>
<P>
Siemens said that it expected about 300 million German marks
(about 160 million U.S. dollars) in extra sales from this product
innovation by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Central Bank Foresees Healthy Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Nigeria has
expressed confidence of a higher gross domestic product (GDP)
this year without exerting undue pressure on the general price
level.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria recorded a GDP growth of 3.77 percent, which fell
below the set target of 5.5 percent. This year the government
also wants the economy to grow at the rate of 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the bank, Paul Ogwuma, said: "This is
possible in view of the idle manufacturing capacity that exists,
the generous fiscal incentives contained in the 1998 budget as
well as the robust level of our external reserves," the official
daily New Nigerian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The development of the manufacturing industry has been very
low in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In his report on the 1998 budget early this month, Nigerian
Head of State Sani Abacha confirmed that the growth rate
of the sector fell from 1.02 percent in 1996 to 0.72 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
The industry only managed to make slight improvement in its
capacity utilization rate last year, from the year-earlier 32.5
percent to 33 percent, Abacha said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to boost an overall economic recovery, the government
has provided a series of incentives, including increase in
budgeted input and abolition of excise duty imposed on domestic
industries.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange reserves now stand at 7.7
billion U.S. Dollars, compared with 4.1 billion at the end of
1996, with its foreign debt stock cut down by one billion Dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
All this would be favorable elements for the targeted economic
growth this year, according to the apex bank governor.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, measures for the management of liquidity on a
sustainable basis had been designed and would be implemented as
appropriate, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts noted that the rapid increasing money input,
due to the this month's release of the budgeted capital vote for
both the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter this
year, might lead to a new round of inflation if not well managed.

<HEADLINE> Call for N.Irish Prison Chief to Quit Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Minister for
Prison Adam Ingram rejected on Wednesday calls for the dismissal
of the Maze jail's governor Martin Mogg.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the House of Commons, Ingram denied the MP's claims
that security was deliberately lax and said since May security has
been increased, and Mogg should stay in his post.
</P>
<P>
Mogg has admitted being "naive" in believing inmates'
assurances they were not planning attacks on each other ahead of
loyalist Billy Wright's murder.
</P>
<P>
Wright's murder by prisoners from the extreme republican Irish
National Liberation Army on December 27 touched off a wave of
sectarian revenge killings which has endangered a ceasefire called
by the major guerrilla groups in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
After two serious security lapses at the Maze over Christmas --
the escape of Irish Republican Army prisoner Liam Averill and the
murder of Loyalist Volunteer Force leader Wright, parliament
member Jeffrey Donaldson, of the main pro-British Ulster Unionist
Party, told the House of Commons on Tuesday that Mogg's position
was now untenable and he must resign quickly.
</P>
<P>
But Ingram admitted that the two incidents "have cast
considerable doubt on the effectiveness of the security
arrangements that were in operation at the prison at the time" and
had damaged public confidence.

<HEADLINE> Task Force Sets up in Zimbabwe to Review Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government today
set up a committee of four cabinet ministers to review the recent
steep price increase of basic food commodities.
</P>
<P>
The government also declared all areas that have been affected
by on-going food riots disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which was set up after a cabinet meeting,
serves as a task force and comprises Lands and Agriculture
Minister Kumbirai Kangai, Planning Commissioner Richard Hove,
Minister Without Portifolio Eddison Zvobgo, and Minister of
Industry and Commerce Nathan Shamuyarira with the minister of
industry and commerce as its chairman.
</P>
<P>
Information, Posts and Telecommunications Minister Chen
Chimutengwende told a press briefing that the committee was
tasked with coming up with recommendations on what mechanisms to
put in place to monitor and prevent profiteering which resulted
in the recent price increases.
</P>
<P>
The committee would present its recommendations to the cabinet
next week.
</P>
<P>
''To this end the government is determined to resolve the
situation fully and as a matter of urgency to ensure that after
correcting the situation, nobody in future will be able to put up
prices of basic commodities to unjustifiable and unaffordable
levels,'' he said, stressing that the move did not mean that the
government was re-introducing price controls.
</P>
<P>
He said people and business people who had their property
damaged or looted in the riots would be assisted by the
government in repairing the properties.
</P>
<P>
The minister appealed to people in the affected areas to go
back to work and desist from being ''hoodwinked by hooligans,
arsonists and other forces who have their own political
motives.''
</P>
<P>
The minister said he was aware that an organisation called
International Socialist Organisation was coordinating the riots
but branded it as a group of ''youths'' who were being funded by
some elements bent on discrediting the government.
</P>
<P>
''White farmers and industrialists are certainly behind
this,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the issue of re-introducing a state of
emergency had not been discussed during the cabinet meeting
''since situation had improved''.
</P>
<P>
" But if the situation gets out of hand, we cannot rule the
state of emergency out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past three days, thousands of residents in the capital
of Harare, Chitungwiza and Mutare staged demonstrations in
protest against recent prices increases. They looted shops and
destroyed property, causing billions of dollars losses.

LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Britain's former Formula One
champion Nigel Mansell was banned from driving for six months
Thursday after he was clocked by police at more than 90mph (about
145kmh) in his new turbo-charged Bentley.
</P>
<P>
Mansell, 44, was stopped by police as he drove from London to
his country retreat in Devon, west of England, just weeks after
buying the 233,000 pounds (about 380,000 U.S. dollars) Bentley
Continental T car with a top speed of 170mph.
</P>
<P>
Magistrates were told how officers recorded his average speed
over 1.2 miles at more than 92mph on a road with a speed limit of
70mph.
</P>
<P>
Mansell, who is also a special constable with the Devon and
Cornwall police force, was handed the ban after the court heard he
already had nine penalty points on his driving licence for
previous speeding offences.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Clashes Not to Affect Manila-Rebel Talks: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary
Fortunato Abat said Thursday that the recent clashes between the
military and Muslim rebels in southern Mindanao will not affect
their next round of peace talks in February.
</P>
<P>
Abat told reporters that the technical committees from the
government and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
would resume talks as scheduled on February 4 in Marawi City,
capital of Lanao de Sur Province in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Abat said the recent clashes between the two sides in Buldon
Town, Maguindanao Province, will be included in the agenda of the
forthcoming peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The skirmishes occurred last week and early this week near a
major MILF stronghold not from Buldon Town, killing at least eight
MILF guerrillas and one government soldier.
</P>
<P>
Abat also said he would agree to a withdrawal at the same time
of the forces of both sides from the clash area in Buldon.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has demanded that the government troops withdraw from
some areas near Camp Abubakar, the MILF's biggest camp, in Buldon.
</P>
<P>
Abat said he agreed to the MILF's demand that the government
troops should move out from a five-kilometer radius around Camp
Abubakar. But he said the MILF rebels should also pull out of the
area.
</P>
<P>
Boasting a membership of some 12,000, the MILF is presently the
strongest anti-government force in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The MILF objects to the peace treaty signed in 1996 by Manila
and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and wants a separate
peace agreement with the government.

</P>
<P>
Several agreements were signed on common customs tariffs,
standardization of excise policies, key principles of cooperation

<HEADLINE> HK to Invest Heavily in Transportation Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government will spend 135 billion HK
dollars (17.3 billion U.S. dollars) in the next five years
building up a strategic transportation network in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A total of 110 billion HK dollars (14.1 billion U.S. dollars)
will be invested in three priority rail projects and another 25
billion HK dollars (3.2 billion U.S. dollars) on roads, Secretary
for Transport Nicholas Ng said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The three rail projects, namely the West Rail, the Mass Transit
 Railway's (MTR) Tseung Kwan O Extension and the Kowloon-Canton
Railway Corporation's Ma On Shan Link and Hung Hom to Tsim Sha
Tsui Extension, are under various stages of active planning and
will be completed between 2002 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media briefing, Ng said the government is
planning to do more in the future to work out a blueprint for the
transport infrastructure in Hong Kong for the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
"For this purpose, we are undertaking the Third Comprehensive
Transport Study to assess the overall transport needs. We are also
 embarking on the Second Railway Development Study to map out a
network for a rail system for Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
The studies are expected to be completed before the end of
1999.
</P>
<P>
A higher priority has to be given to rail transport in the long
run because of the constraint on road construction imposed by Hong
Kong's scarce land resources, Ng pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Our policy will be to develop rail transport to the extent
that is economically viable to reduce reliance on road transport,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Seen to Remain Stable Amid Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bankers Association of the
Philippines (BAP) said Thursday that the country's currency, the
peso, will remain stable despite the pressure it gets from the
continuous fall of the Indonesian rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials admitted that the continuous plunge of the
rupiah against the U.S. dollar is a reaction to reports that there
could be political instability in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
BAP President Deogracias Vistan said there is a tendency that
the peso is not likely to plummet as expected but will hover at
around 41 to a dollar.
</P>
<P>
The peso had been strengthening against the dollar lately until
Wednesday when it dropped slightly from 40.8 to 41.9 pesos to a
dollar.
</P>
<P>
But the Philippine currency fell 2.1 percent to close at 42.79
pesos to the dollar Thursday in the Philippine official exchange
market, the Philippine Dealing System.
</P>
<P>
The peso has so far lost nearly 60 percent in its value against
the dollar since its de facto devaluation in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Vistan explained that the situation is becoming a tug-of-war of
the currencies around the region which pulls the value of the peso
to its current level.
</P>
<P>
As to the interest rates, Vistan said the Central Bank of the
Philippines has already approved the recommendation of the BAP to
open its 30-day lending window to allow banks to secure loans at a
discounted rate.
</P>
<P>
Vistan expects that this move would help a lot in strengthening
the banks' liquidity in face of the currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
He said it is likely that the high interest rates will go down
to an acceptable level in the coming days as reflected by the good
economic fundamentals which are being properly managed by the
government.

<HEADLINE> HK to Pump Public Investment Into Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) plans to invest 235
billion HK dollars (30 billion U.S. dollars) in infrastructure
development over the next four to five years, Chief Executive Tung
 Chee Hwa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plan is aimed at boosting local economy, but the public
expenditure would have to be arranged in accordance with a
conservative fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
Tung believed that the enlarged public expenditure would help
boost economic activities, create employment and improve the
investment environment in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed: "We'll always do it within a fundamental
principle and that is a conservative fiscal management policy
which has been so successful for so long. We'll maintain the
approach at all times."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence in Hong Kong's economic future,
saying: "As soon as the financial turmoil round us ebbs, I think
the recovery should not be far away."

<HEADLINE> HK Government Not to Cut Land Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government will
 not cut back the land sales program because of the current
economic turmoil, Robert Pope, director of lands of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an annual meet-the-media session, Pope said that
since Hong Kong returned to China on July 1, the Land Department
of the SAR has been working very hard to make land available to
meet HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa's pledge of making 85,000
flats available each year.
</P>
<P>
Pope said the transition of the work of his department was
smooth as the SAR government continued most of the previous
policies on land administration after July 1.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the department executed land transactions that will
produce 45,600 flats in three to five years while the land
transactions in 1996 can produce 28,300 units, Pope said.
</P>
<P>
Pope told reporters that his department will publish its new
five-year land disposal forecast in March, which will offer a
specific land sale program for the first two financial years and
will indicate general land disposal under broad user categories
for the following three years.
</P>
<P>
As for the government's decision to withdraw the Tamar basin
site from the land auction program and to use it for the future
government headquarters, Pope said the decision has nothing to do
with the downturn of the property market.
</P>
<P>
It was a coincidence, Pope said. The government had considered
that issue for a few months and thought Tamar was an ideal site
for the future government headquarters, he added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Says Has No Intention to Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday that the question of him stepping
down does not arise because the government works as a team in
tackling the country's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
"I don't hear anything about stepping down at all," Mahathir
said in response to a question by a foreign reporter as to whether
he intended to step down owing to the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the government did not function on the basis of
individuality. "We are a team here. We don't function just based
on any particular individual," he said after chairing the
inaugural meeting of the National Economic Action Council (NEAC)
here.
</P>
<P>
He cited the NEAC as an example where they worked hand-in-hand
in solving problems faced by the country.
</P>
<P>
The NEAC, whose formation was announced by Mahathir on November
20, 1997, became functional Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir has been in office as Malaysia's fourth prime minister
for 17 years.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Hails Regional Cooperation at Launch of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Opening a giant project
transporting water from Lesotho mountains to South Africa, South
African President Nelson Mandela today hailed the economic
cooperation between the two countries and in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Lesotho King Letsie III today jointly opened the
huge Katse Dam at Muela in northern Lesotho, which is the heart
of the 10-billion-Rand Lesotho Highland Water Project to
alleviate the water shortage in northern South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Our joint presence here today confirms that those who shared
the trenches of struggle are today working together as free
nations to realize the possibilities of freedom," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma, Botswanan President Ketumile
Masire and South African Water Affairs Minister Kadar Asmal also
attended the ceremony of the scheme, which South African
officials say has "great economic significance" for neighboring
southern African nations in the Orange River Basin.
</P>
<P>
Under a treaty signed by South Africa's previous government
and Lesotho in 1986, the project is to pump 258 million cubic
meters a year into South Africa's north and north-east regions
for 30 years. It will save Gauteng, South Africa's industrial
heartland, from frequent drought strikes.
</P>
<P>
The success of the scheme, Mandela said, "testifies to the
powerful spirit of cooperation that is growing as Africa lifts
itself through its own efforts, with the strong support of the
international community".
</P>
<P>
He said the project will help change the lives of millions of
poor people in South Africa and Lesotho who have not had access
to clean running water.
</P>
<P>
Villages on the Lesotho highlands will also benefit from the
roads, communication services and power supply installed during
the 11 years of construction of the project, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides millions of Rand of water fees from South African
consumers, Lesotho also gets a 72-megawatt hydro-electric plant
under the project treaty, which is enough to supply all its
power needs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the international significance in completing the
project, Mandela said that it contributes to a development environmen
t
conducive to further regional cooperation in southern Africa. Endite

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Caused Cracks on Great Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Many cracks have appeared on
the Great Wall because of the 6.2-magnitude earthquake that hit
Zhangjiakou in northwest China's Hebei Province on Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
"Cracks appeared on the part of the wall in Shangyi, Zhangbei
and Wanquan counties which were seriously affected by the
earthquake," He Yong, director of city Administration of Cultural
Relics, said today. "Yet there is no further damage to the wall,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
There are 2,000 kilometers of Great Wall in Zhangjiakou, which
were mainly built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
According to He, more than 20 ancient buildings, pagodas and
grottos are located in the quake-hit areas, mostly dating back to
the Ming Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
"All the historical sites suffered from the earthquake," He
said, "You can see cracks on them, but no further damages."
</P>
<P>
The earthquake claimed 49 lives and injured more than 10,000,
leaving 44,000 people homeless.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- French glass manufacturing
giant Saint Gobain plans to invest more than 263.85 million U.S.
dollars in India over the next three to five years to take
advantage of the growing demand for glass, ceramics and abrasives.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to India in the long-term and we will bring
in all our business divisions in Tamil Nadu of southern India in
the next few years," said Jacques Achenbroich, president of Saint
Gobain's flat glass division, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Achenbroich was speaking at the ground-breaking ceremony of a
118.73 million dollar glass project at Sriperumbudur near Chennai,
capital of Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
The project would go on stream in December 1999 and commercial
production would start in early 2000. St. Gobain has tied up raw
material supply with several Tamil Nadu government agencies and
all the inputs would be sourced from within the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to invest another 118.73 million dollars in
the second phase of the Sriperumbudur project, in about five years
from now, he added.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Receives Bashir's Special </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today received a special message from Sudanese President Omar
Bashir delivered by Sudanese Federal Minister Ali Alhaji,
according to a Kenya News Agency report today.
</P>
<P>
No details about the message are available, but observers here
said that this is obviourly related to the incoming peace talks to be
held in April between the concerned sides of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Osman Mohammad Taha reportedly
said in Rome on Tuesday that peace efforts to end his country's
civil war were gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that he was optimistic that talks to be
held in April in Kenya's capital of Nairobi with rebel leaders
could make significant progress.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that if the April talks have been well prepared that
definitely can help bring the civil war to an end," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Last October the seven African countries making up the
Inter-governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) brokered the
first peace talks in seven years between Khartoum government and
John Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).
</P>
<P>
Last April, the Sudanese government signed a peace agreement
with several rebel factions to end the civil war started in 1983
which claimed more than 1.3 million lives.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA did not sign the agreement, but took part in the
October talks which produced no ceasefire but reached an
agreement to meet again in April.
</P>
<P>
From February, Kenya who is in the current IGAD chair will
engage in shuttle diplomacy among the IGAD member countries to
prepare for the April talks.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana
has said: "It is encouraging that for the first time we have
managed to get both parties to agree that they have something to
discuss."
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that he had already told both sides they
needed "a relaxation of positions and effort to move closer
together between now and April."

<HEADLINE> Canada's Inflation Down in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Canada's annual inflation rate
continued to fall in December to 0.7 percent, Statistics Canada
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This was the lowest 12-month change in the Consumer Price
Index since January 1995 when a 0.6 percent increase was posted,"
the government agency said.
</P>
<P>
The drop in rate from 0.9 percent to 0.7 percent rate was
mainly attributed to the price declines of gasoline, air travel
and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
For the year of 1997, the average inflation rate was 1.6
percent, the same as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Canada's inflation rate has remained low and steady since 1992,
ranging from 0.2 percent in 1994 to 2.1 percent in 1995. These
increases were the smallest since the early 1960s.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Inflation Drops in First Half of 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's inflation
registered a fall during the first six months of the current
fiscal year starting July 1, according to a report released by the
State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The trends in the country's economy in 1997-98 indicate a mixed
performance, the SBP said in the report on Pakistan's Economy
submitted to parliament.
</P>
<P>
The report said all available indicators of inflation show a
considerable slowdown in prices in the first half of the fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Price Indicator (CPI) slipped down to 6.3 percent
during July-December 1997 compared to 8.2 percent recorded a year
earlier, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said if the past pattern of distribution of
inflation between the first half and second half of the year is
maintained, the yearly inflation target of 9.0 percent may be
achieved as compared with 11.8 percent in 1996-97 and the average
of 11.3 percent in the last 5 years.
</P>
<P>
Several factors have contributed to the moderation in
inflation, the most important being a slowdown in the rate of
credit expansion due to both lower government borrowing and
moderation in expansion of credit to the private sector, it said.
</P>
<P>
The SBP report also points out a decline in the Wholesale Price
Indicator (WPI) and Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI) during the
first half of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The WPI was recorded at 5.1 percent during July-December 1997
as compared to 9.3 percent during the corresponding period of
1996, whereas the SPI stood at 6.2 percent as against 8.8 percent
during the first three months of 1996-97, it said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank report also said the trade deficit narrowed to
1.08 billion dollars during July-December 1997, compared with 1.72
billion dollars in the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The deficit on current account of the balance of payments, for
which data are available only for July-November 1997, also
narrowed remarkably, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Muslim Unity to "Liberate" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the International
Qods (Jerusalem) Day, Iran Thursday called on all Muslim and Arab
states to unite their efforts to "liberate" Jerusalem and all
other occupied lands from the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
All Muslim and Arab nations should do their utmost, through
unity and Islamic solidarity, for liberation of Jerusalem and all
the occupied territories and restoration of the Palestinian
rights, a statement issued by the Iranian Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It called on all Muslim and Arab states "not to lose a moment
in trying to control, contain and isolate the Qods occupying
regime (Israel)," the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Such efforts will help promote peace, stability and security in
the Middle East and further help to restore the Palestinians'
rights, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
During the current week, Iranian people were urged to hold
nationwide rallies on Friday to mark the International Qods Day to
show Iran's "relentless combat" against Israel and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Strong-worded statements from various state and private
institutions were printed on mass-circulated newspapers, calling
for massive turnout on Friday to support and defend the
Palestinian people in their struggles against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mass media and government officials slammed the United States
for its "unreasonable and broad-based political, international,
economic, military and propaganda support" for Israel's "state
terrorism and expansionist policies."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry stated that the country's
principled policy seeks the full restoration of Palestinian
rights, liberation of all occupied territories including
Jerusalem and self-determination for the Palestinian nation.
</P>
<P>
Top Iranian leaders, including the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Mohammad Khatami, have made
their call for active turnout of the people. They have also ruled
out possible rapprochement between Iran and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the Iranian nation would not miss the
opportunity to "express their anger at the U.S." for its crimes
against the Iranian people in the past, as Iranian leaders
mentioned recently, and its support for the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini announced the last Friday of the Islamic holy month of
Ramadan as the International Qods Day in order to draw the
attention of the world Muslims to this issue.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been insisting on its opposition to the "unjust
so-called peace process" and believing that no peace and stability
would be observed in the Middle East if Jerusalem and the other
occupied lands remain at the Israeli hands.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate President Forced to Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- President of the Philippine
Senate Ernesto Maceda said Thursday that he has agreed to step
down as called for by a majority of his fellow colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Maceda, who became Senate president in October 1996, is
scheduled to hand over his post to former Senate head Neptali
Gonzales next Monday when the Senate resumes its session.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a closed-door Senate meeting,
Maceda said he accepted the decision of the majority of the Senate
"without rancor or regrets."
</P>
<P>
Maceda also "congratulated" Vice President Joseph Estrada and
Senator Edgardo Angara, both leaders of the United Opposition, on
"masterminding and successfully achieving" his ouster.
</P>
<P>
But his congratulations were quickly dismissed by Estrada who
bluntly denied his involvement in the Senate coup.
</P>
<P>
Maceda also said his blood pressure had already returned to
normal and he was in "very good health."
</P>
<P>
Maceda was rushed to a clinic Wednesday afternoon because his
blood pressure shot up shortly after being informed that he was
being ousted from his post.
</P>
<P>
Maceda's agreement to stand down came one day after he was
informed by some senators that at least 16 members of the 24-seat
Senate, most of them from the United Opposition, had signed a
resolution calling for his step-down.
</P>
<P>
But the resolution has not yet been publicized by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the senators questioned in the resolution
Maceda's impartiality in presiding over the joint session of the
Philippine Congress, which shall canvass votes for the
presidential and vice-presidential candidates in the May
elections.
</P>
<P>
Maceda is the brother-in-law of the speaker of the House of
Representative, Jose de Venecia, who is the presidential candidate
of the ruling Lakas-NUCD (National Union of Christian Democrats)
party.
</P>
<P>
But what was really behind Maceda's ouster was his breakaway
from the United Opposition and his political rivalry with Angara,
political observers said.
</P>
<P>
Maceda resigned as chairman of the United Opposition early this
month after he lost to Angara the opposition's vice presidential
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports indicated that Maceda could join forces with de
Venecia in seeking the mayoral post of Manila or a seat in the
House of Representatives, but the Senate president has yet to
confirm his political plans.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, who was forced to turn over the Senate presidency to
Maceda in October 1996 in a similar Senate coup, will take over as
the head of the Senate Monday for a third time.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Gets ADB Loan for Agriculture Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Thursday approved a 50 million U.S. dollar concessional loan to
help Nepal with its agriculture sector reforms.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used for Nepal's Second Agriculture Program
which includes a medium-term strategy focusing on better
allocation of resources and the deregulation of the fertilizer
market, the ADB said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Sustainable agricultural growth is a prerequisite to economic
development and poverty reduction in Nepal, said the Manila-based
bank, adding that agriculture accounts for 42 percent of Nepal's
gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Nepal's agriculture sector, however, is constrained by public
interventions, including subsidies, which have long stifled
private initiatives and generated market distortions, the ADB
said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB-funded program will help deregulate the agriculture
sector and promote private sector participation in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The loan will come from the bank's concessional Asian
Development Fund, which is interest-free.

<HEADLINE> HK to Issue Transitional Licenses to Estate Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Estate Agents
Authority (EAA) will issue traditional licenses to estate agents
at the end of 1998, Marvin Cheung Kin-tung, chairman of the EAA
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A two-year transitional period will be allowed during which the
estate agents trade will be required to upgrade itself in order
to convert its transitional licenses into full ones before 2001,
Cheung told reporters at a press briefing Thursday afternoon after
the second meeting of the EAA.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at promoting professionalism in the trade,
enhancing protection for consumers and encouraging fair and honest
property transactions, Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
"The two-year transitional period will allow the trade
reasonable and sufficient time to meet the full licensing
requirements," he explained.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the tentative date for the issue of
transitional licenses by the end of 1998, the EAA will set
licensing requirements for the issue of transitional licenses and
full licenses, Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
The EAA will prescribe procedures in connection with
application for licenses and draw up rules and practicing
guidelines to regulate the conduct and practice of the trade, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The EAA will also discuss with educational/vocational training
institutions to facilitate the provision of training courses for
the trade and consider the need for an examination/assessment
system.
</P>
<P>
To examine these matters, the EAA has established four standing
committees, namely the Practice Committee, the Licensing
Committee, the Training Committee and the Disciplinary Committee,
Cheung said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Electronic Commerce Promoted in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Manufacturers'
Association of Hong Kong (CMA) and Tradelink Thursday signed an
agreement to promote the use of electronic commerce in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the CMA will hold a series of marketing
activities and seminars to encourage the use of Tradelink's
electronic commerce services by the association's 3,800 member
companies, almost all of which are manufacturers or import/export
traders.
</P>
<P>
Tradelink, a private company in which the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government is a major shareholder,
provides two current ranges of electronic commerce services for
Hong Kong's trading community -- SilkNet for garment and textile
traders and ValuNet for general importers and exporters.
</P>
<P>
The services allow exporters and manufacturers to apply to the
government for textile export licenses and lodge their trade
declarations electronically, bringing savings in time and cost,
and enhancements in efficiency and productivity.
</P>
<P>
CMA President Herbert Liang, addressing the signing ceremony,
said the use of electronic commerce can help Hong Kong exporters
and manufacturers minimize human errors and increase efficiency in
a streamlined operation, and maintain their competitiveness in
world markets through effective monitoring of labor cost.
</P>
<P>
Tradelink Chief Executive Officer Justin Yue said the
partnership with the CMA, one of Hong Kong's largest trade
associations, will play an important role in spreading the message
about electronic commerce and its benefits.
</P>
<P>
"If Hong Kong is to stay competitive in world markets, it's
essential that electronic commerce becomes widely adopted within
the next three years," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Hongkong Telecom Gets New Antenna for Wider Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Hongkong Telecom has recently
installed a new antenna to match the operation of a satellite
called APSTAR-2R as a key step to allow broadcasters a much wider
coverage across the globe.
</P>
<P>
The satellite antenna, named HK 18, will enable broadcasters to
explore and reach new markets in Asia, Europe, Africa and
Australia. Operating hand-in-hand with the APSTAR-2R equipped with
28 C-Band transponders, the new nine-meter C-Band antenna can
ensure high-capacity and superb-quality data and video
transmission.
</P>
<P>
HK 18 will be monitored all day and all year round as all the
other antennae placed at Hongkong Telecom's Stanley Earth
Stations, Asia's largest and most extensive commercial teleport.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Telecom's manager for broadcast and fixed satellite
services K. W. Chan said Thursday: "As one of the world's leading
satellite service providers, Hongkong Telecom is committed to
employing the latest technologies to meet customers' growing
demand for quality, coverage and reliable services. The
commissioning of HK 18 is proof of this continuing commitment."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is strategically located for access to key local,
regional and international satellite systems. Hongkong Telecom has
been taking advantage of Hong Kong's geographic position to
provide satellite services to broadcasters for nearly three
decades.
</P>
<P>
APSTAR-2R is one of the APSTAR series of satellites launched by
Asia Pacific Telecommunications Satellite Co. Ltd. (APT), a
leading satellite company in the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Has No Liquidity Problems: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad denied Thursday that his country is facing
liquidity problems this year.
</P>
<P>
"We have enough liquidity. Liquidity is at 490 billion ringgit
(about 109 billion U.S. dollars) currently and there shouldn't be
a problem in getting loans," Mahathir told reporters after
chairing the first meeting of the National Economic Action Council
(NEAC) here.
</P>
<P>
On claims that the country is facing liquidity problems,
Mahathir said there is a misunderstanding that companies found it
difficult getting loans.
</P>
<P>
In fact those finding it difficult to get loans are companies
involved in the non-productive areas, he said, adding that the
government has directed banks to focus on lending to productive
sectors like manufacturing and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Thursday's meeting identified several areas with
focus on ensuring liquidity in the banking system.
</P>
<P>
Several suggestions were made Thursday on how to overcome
liquidity problems if they arose, he said, adding, "But none had
been finalized, I cannot disclose it."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said there is no need to bail out companies despite
the current economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would not be protecting anybody. "If
they have legitimate reasons, we will have to look at them ...
There is no question of a bail-out," he added.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the NEAC was announced by Mahathir on November
20 last year to chart strategies to tackle economic problems
facing the country following the collapse of local currency and
stock markets in the wake of a regional financial crisis that
began in Thailand last July.

<HEADLINE> HK Keeps World's Third Biggest Foreign Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The foreign reserves of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) stood at 92.8
billion HK dollars at the end of 1997, keeping third place in the
world after Japan and China's inland, the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of December 1997, the official foreign currency
assets vested in the Exchange Fund were 75.3 billion US dollars,
while those held in the Land Fund were 17.5 billion US dollars,
the HKMA said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign reserves reached 96.5 billion US dollars at the end
of November 1997. An HKMA spokesman attributed the drop in
December to falling Hong Kong dollar interest rates in the month.
</P>
<P>
Short-term capital was attracted to the Hong Kong dollar by
jacked-up interest rates in November, pushing the foreign currency
assets to a record high.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's foreign reserves are about 10 times the currency in
circulation, one of the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Japan was the world's largest foreign reserves holder with
220.8 billion US dollars at the end of 1997, while China's inland
areas ranked second with 139.9 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rupiah Hits new low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah crashed
to an all-time low of 15,000 to the U.S. dollar Thursday morning
on strong dollar demand and growing political concerns, currency
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The spot rupiah fell into uncharted territory to more than
15,000 per dollar during the lunch break before recovering to
11,900/12,350 at the close against an opening of 12,000/13,000.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the rupiah closed at 11,300/11,600 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers the government's move to formalize the second
round of a reform program arranged by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) in exchange for a 23 billion dollar bailout package
failed to impress the market.
</P>
<P>
They said the rupiah sagged further on reports that Indonesian
corporations were resorting to rupiah payments for their U.S.
dollar debts.
</P>
<P>
More and more private companies and banks have settled their
offshore obligations with rupiah, prompting offshore parties to
cover short dollar positions, the dealers said.
</P>
<P>
"This situation has forced local banks to buy dollars at any
level today as they are afraid foreign players, with excess
rupiah, will kick the currency down further," a local bank dealer
said.
</P>
<P>
According to a government estimate, the offshore debt of the
Indonesian private sector was 65 billion U.S. dollars as of
September last year. Most of the loans were short-term debts with
a maturity of between one and two years.
</P>
<P>
But the main negative factor seemed to be the announcement by
House Speaker Harmoko Tuesday that the candidate for the next vice
president must have a vision on science and technology, and deep
knowledge of industry and its usage.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto confirmed Tuesday that he would seek a
seventh five-year term in March.
</P>
<P>
Another factor for the fall of rupiah was the weakness of
regional currencies including Malaysian Ringgit, Singapore dollar,
Thai baht, the Philippine peso and South Korean won.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the stock prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange also
fell by 4.8 percent or 22.474 points to close at 443.529 points.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Worse than expected quarterly
results, continuing Asian fears and a slump in National Australia
Bank (NAB) shares pushed the Australian share market lower
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Reynolds &AMP; Co. broker Grant Williamson said that while the
day-to-day trend was getting harder to pick, the local bourse
started its slide Wednesday with ANZ bank's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The ANZ (meeting) got people thinking about their exposure to
Asia ... that's pushed stocks down a bit," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said Wednesday that the Asian crisis would inevitably
see an increase in the level of assets recognized as impaired
throughout the region. ANZ estimated that its total provisioning
charge this financial year would climb from pre-tax 240 million
U.S. dollars to pre-tax 320 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Williamson said the market was also lower because investors
were easing off with the Australia Day long weekend coming up.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries Index closed down 23.4 points to 2599.4
while the All Industrials Index dropped by 44.8 points to 4479.
</P>
<P>
In the banking sector, National Australia Bank shares shed 38
cents to close at 20.75 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank said Thursday that its first-quarter net profit fell
10 percent to 334 million U.S. dollars from 372 million dollars,
hit by an increase in provisioning for doubtful debts.
</P>
<P>
One broker said the NAB results were worse than expected.
</P>
<P>
ANZ shares dropped 17 cents to 9.8 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other banking stocks were also weaker, with Westpac 12.2 cents
down at 10.17 Australian dollars and Commonwealth Bank closing
steady at 18.5 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The All Resources Index dropped 5.8 points to 1096.6.
</P>
<P>
Shares of Australia's three major iron ore producing companies
-- BHP, Rio Tinto and North Ltd. -- were higher mid-morning
following news that they had achieved a price rise in the sales
agreements with Japanese steel mills.
</P>
<P>
But only Rio and North managed to hang onto their earlier
gains, closing up 35.2 and 7 cents at 18.95 and 4.07 Australian
dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
BHP ended 7 cents down at 13.65 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 234.00 million shares worth 496.2 million
U.S. dollars with falls outnumbering rises by 609 to 437.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Former world No.1 Andre Agassi
won a fourth-set battle of wills in Melbourne Wednesday against
Spaniard Albert Costa to maintain his return to form at the
Australian Open tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Agassi displayed some excellent court coverage and
groundstrokes and eventually disposed of the 16th seed 6-4, 6-4,
2-6, 7-5 in two hours and 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who spent much of last year on the sidelines to slip
out of the top 100 for the first time since turning professional
in 1986, looked to be home when he broke serve to go 4-2 up in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
But the emotional Spaniard, frequently yelling to himself and
waving his arms after any poor shot, refused to give up and soon
broke back and held serve to level the set at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
Games then went to serve until Agassi broke again to win.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Costa's compatriot Arantxa Sanchez Vicario
gave Russian Elena Makarova a 6-0, 6-0 tennis lesson.

<HEADLINE> East China City Becomes Large Collectors Market By Chen Yao, Liu Meijun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- On weekends, more and more
collectors of fine arts and antiques flock to collection markets
in Hangzhou -- a historic cultural city in east China.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province and famous for its
picturesque West Lake, has grown into possibly the third largest
market after Shanghai and Nanjing for such collectibles as stamps,
antiques, paintings, phone cards, china, coins, paper money and
old-style furniture.
</P>
<P>
So far, five permanent distribution markets for collectibles
have been established in the city with more than 1,200 shops and
stands.
</P>
<P>
The largest of the five is a newly opened stamp market, which
occupies more than 4,000 square meters. Its daily trade volume
reaches into several million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In Wulin Square in the city's central business district, a
monthly folk collection trade fair attracts 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey, stamps have the largest market
share in collectibles followed by phone cards, coins, paper money
and antiques.
</P>
<P>
In the Wulin Stamp Market in Hangzhou, one trader said: "I can
sell 100,000 yuan (12,000 U.S. dollars) in one day."
</P>
<P>
Chinese have a long tradition of collecting paintings and
antiques during times of peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"I have been involved in selling antiques for three years,"
said Li Jianhua, a trader who graduated from the department of
Chinese Language and Literature at Hangzhou University. "In this
business, it is really true that `knowledge is money'."
</P>
<P>
To improve their knowledge, the city's collectors have formed
specialized associations such as the Hangzhou Stamp Association
and the Hangzhou Coin Association.
</P>
<P>
Lu Longchang, a collector, has even started a publication named
"Spring and Sea" about coin-collecting, which reports market
information.
</P>
<P>
To regulate the distribution, Hangzhou has increased its
administrative controls over collection markets. According to a
local legislator, the city is drafting new rules to standardize
the markets' operations.

</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told the Russian-Belarussian Union's Supreme Council
opening session here that trade turnover between the two neighbors
increased 40 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
He highly assessed agreements on joint projects, saying direct

<HEADLINE> Australian Open Courts Inhumane: Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Open tennis
courts again came in for criticism from players Wednesday with one
of the tour's most respected players describing them as "inhumane".
</P>
<P>
Todd Martin, a finalist in Melbourne in 1994, said the courts
were too hard on players' feet, especially on a hot day, the
Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
With the centre court temperature reaching 40 degrees Wednesday,
the Rebound Ace surface took its toll on players, it added.
</P>
<P>
Martin said his feet were bleeding after the match.
</P>
<P>
"These courts ... it's inhumane what they do to our feet," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Last year players complained bitterly about the courts as air
temperatures soared and the court surface temperature rose to more
than 60 degrees.
</P>
<P>
The Rebound Ace surface consists of a thin rubberised compound
spread over a concrete base.
</P>
<P>
It is similar to other hardcourt surfaces such as that used at
the US Open.
</P>
<P>
But on a hot day the rubber coating can become slightly tacky
and players moving at high speed and then stopping sharply risk
injury when their shoes stick.

<HEADLINE> Image of National Airline to Be Restored: Pak PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
said on Thursday that his government is initiating steps to
restore the image of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), which
is facing an acute financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
During a briefing at the PIA headquarters in Karachi,
Pakistan's biggest city, Sharif said a committee has been set up
to work out a new aviation policy so as to make the PIA an
excellent airline as it was in the 1960s, according to the
Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The committee will present the draft of the policy to the prime
minister for approval in four weeks, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
He said the PIA's image would be restored and it would be
steered out of the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The PIA, the state-owned national flag carrier, which was
graded as one of the top 10 airlines in the world in the
1960s-70s, is now ranked as 41st among 240 carriers of the world
as its profitability has registered a decline during the past
years.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Calls for Advancement of Anti-corruption Campaign (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leading officials should be strict with their spouses and
children, preventing them from abusing official power and
influence, correcting their wrongdoings in time and not shielding
their law-breaking activities, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to proceeding with reform, opening-up and economic
growth, Jiang said, leading officials within the range of their
administrations should play key roles in improving the Party's
work style, building clean government and combating corruption.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that better Party and government work and
anti-corruption efforts require law-enforcement contingents which
are politically trustworthy and competent.
</P>
<P>
Current law-enforcement contingents are good who, in the fight
against corruption, are able to conscientiously carry out the
policies and assignments of the CPC central committee and
safeguard the interest of the nation and the people, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He urged law-enforcement personnel to have a strong political
awareness, fairness and honesty, a high sense of discipline,
professional competence and a fine work style.
</P>
<P>
Jiang explained that strong political awareness means being in
agreement with the Party Central Committee, and adhering to the
Party's basic theory and line, and its principles and policies.
Fairness and honesty requires law-enforcement people to put
priority on the interests of the nation and the people, handle
things justly and not be swayed by personal considerations.
</P>
<P>
As to the sense of discipline, law-enforcement people must
abide by laws and regulations in an exemplary way and resist
temptation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they should improve their professional knowledge
to increase efficiency, and they should keep close contacts with
the masses and serve the people heart and soul, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Decline Sharply on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined sharply
on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index fell by 3.2 percent, or 41.91 points, to close at 1269.49 on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said prices fell on worries over a persistent plunge in
the Indonesian rupiah, which had taken a toll on other regional
currencies. Trading was dull as people were sidelined by the
falling regional currencies, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, they noted that there was some buying interest
absorbing the fall while property stocks were hardest hit over
concerns that higher interest rates would dent affordability.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank further to 210.65 million units,
valued at 375.1 million Singapore dollars (about 213.13 million
U.S. dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 268 to 77 while
264 other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Technologies Engineering was the most actively
traded counter as it registered a turnover of 15.01 million units.
It was followed by Singapore Telecom which had 11.73 million
shares traded. TAC 200 was next with 8.91 million shares changed
hands.
</P>
<P>
Local computer sound card maker Creative 50 led the gainers of
the day as it rose by 60 cents to finish at 33.4 Singapore
dollars. KepFELS and the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) increased
by 30 cents each to end at 4.7 and 16.3 Singapore dollars
respectively. Gentings was up by 10 cents to close at 4.22
dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) Foreign
and Yeo HSS shared the top spot on the losers' list as each of
them declined by 60 cents to end at 11.3 and 5 Singapore dollars
respectively. City Developments fell by 55 cents to close at 5.65
Singapore dollars while the Singapore Airlines (SIA) Foreign
dropped by 50 cents to finish at 11 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Minister Cautions S.Korea Against Defense Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen said here Thursday that any cut in South
Korea's defense budget could raise tensions on the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"I believe any reduction (of the defense budget) at this time
would send the wrong signal and enhance and escalate tension on
the Korean Peninsula," Cohen told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said his country hopes South Korea will recognize this and
maintain the same level of commitment.
</P>
<P>
The original defense budget of 14.6 trillion won (about 8.9
billion U.S. dollars) for this year will be reduced by 1.35
trillion won (about 810 million dollars), almost 10 percent. This
is because of the financial crisis caused by the bankruptcy of
conglomerates and bad loans by financial institutions since late
1997.
</P>
<P>
However, owing to the won's sharp devaluation against the
U.S. dollar, the budget cut is expected to amount to the
equivalent of over three trillion won (about 1.8 billion
dollars). The South Korean won depreciated more than 50 percent in
the past few months.
</P>
<P>
South Korea originally planed to buy C-17 transport airplanes,
early warning aircraft, coastal radar systems and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
Over the country's request to reduce payments for supporting
the 37,000 U.S. troops here, Cohen said experts from both
countries will discuss the matter in light of the South Korean
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has no intention of taking advantage or
profit off South Korea's economic crisis," said Cohen, who
finished the last leg of his seven-nation Asian tour Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Cohen has met President Kim
Young-sam, President-elect Kim Dae-jung and Defense Minister Kim
Dong-jin.

<P>
FREETOWN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Over 400 civilians were
killed by Kamajor militiamen last weekend in Siera Leone's
eastern Town of Tongo Field, State Radio reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure was made at a meeting of paramount chiefs ands
tribal heads in Bo, the country's second largest city in the
south, said the radio.
</P>

The meeting described the Kamajor massacre as "unprecedented"
and called on the authorities "to prevent a recurrence".

"The kamajors should remember that Sierra Leoneans are one
people and in the interest of peace, the various tribes sbould
always operate under a peaceful atmosphere and avoid trivalism,"
the radio said.
</P>
<P>
There has not been any independent confirmation of the 400

"We were not expecting such massive upsurge of people and we
are finding it difficult to cope in providing adequate food and
medicines for them," a Red Cross official said in Freetown.

Relief officials said they would have to embark on "cross
border operations" from neighbouring Guinea to augment their
humanitarian stock.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Banks Lose 2.2 Billion U.S. Dollars in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen of South Korea's 26
commercial banks registered combined net losses of 3.9 trillion
won (about 2.2 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, in sharp contrast to
the previous year's net profit of 939 billion won.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Bank Supervision attributed the huge losses to
vast non-performing loans of financial institutions and the
bearish Seoul stock market in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The failure of a slew of big conglomerates, including Hanbo,
Kia, Jinro and Halla groups, forced commercial banks to jack up
reserve for loan losses sharply to 3.34 trillion won last year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the depressed stock market forced the banks to
put aside no less than 2.22 trillion won as reserves to cover
book-value losses of their stock holdings.
</P>
<P>
Of the 18 banks, six are big Seoul-based ones, whose combined
losses amounted to 3.33 trillion won in 1997, accounting for 85
percent of total losses in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Korea First Bank was the biggest loser, suffering a net loss of
1.61 trillion won, followed by Seoul Bank with 916.6 billion won,
Cho Hung Bank with 289.6 billion won, Hanil Bank with 280.9
billion won, Commercial Bank of Korea with 163.9 billion won, and
Korea Exchange Bank with 68.4 billion won.
</P>
<P>
However, the Housing &AMP; Commercial Bank raked in the largest net
profit of 108.3 billion won in 1997, up 17.4 percent from the 92.2
billion won recorded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Kookmin Bank got a net profit of 104.4 billion won in 1997 net
profit, followed by Shinhan Bank with 53.3 billion won, Hana Bank
with 43.5 billion won, Pusan Bank with 19.8 billion won, Daegu
Bank with 15.2 billion won, Boram Bank with 10.2 billion won, and
Kyongnam Bank with 2.9 billion won.

<HEADLINE> Japan Banned From Tuna Fishing in Australian Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Japanese fishing vessels will
be banned from fishing for endangered southern bluefin tuna in
Australian waters after three days of talks on fishing quotas
collapsed, the Australian government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Resources Minister Warwick Parer said in a statement that Japan
had refused to accept quotas set at a responsible level in the
talks between Australia, Japan and New Zealand, the three members
of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna.
</P>
<P>
Japan had also announced it could introduce an experimental
fishing program, which would push its catch above last year's
limit, Parer said.
</P>
<P>
"Japan's position is completely unacceptable to Australia.
Accordingly, we will not allow Japanese fishing vessels to operate
in our exclusive economic zone until the commission has set
responsible quotas."
</P>
<P>
A 16-hour marathon meeting by CCSBT representatives ended here
Thursday without setting a quota for fishing in 1998. However,
Parer said he still hoped the disagreement could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the total allowable catch of southern bluefin tuna
was 11,750 tons, with 5,265 tons allocated to Australia, 6,065
tons to Japan and 420 tons to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
In the just-concluded meeting, Japan asked to increase the
total allowable catch by 3,000 tons a year from the current 11,750
tons while Australia wanted to maintain the status quo and New
Zealand called for reducing the catch by 3,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The southern bluefin tuna was declared an endangered species by
the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Snow Hits East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A heavy snowfall rarely seen
over the past decade hit the northern part of east China's
Zhejiang province this morning, when the area has just experienced
a rare warm winter.
</P>
<P>
The snow gave no sign of abating at sunset. According to the
provincial meteorological station, it is the heaviest snowfall in
Zhejiang this year.
</P>
<P>
By three p.m. today, the accumulation of snowfall reached ten
centimeters at Lin'an, and more than eight centimeters in downtown
Hangzhou and Deqing.
</P>
<P>
Around the scenic West Lake in Hangzhou, workers have put coal
cinder on the road, and used high-pressure water pipes to remove
snow from trees to prevent them from breaking more trees.
</P>
<P>
Some of the highways connecting Hangzhou and the northeast part
of the province has been closed because of the snow.
</P>
<P>
The active flows of warm and wet currents over Zhejiang have
caused the heavy snow, meteorological specialists here explained.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang, like other provinces in east China, was experiencing
a rare warm winter with the average temperature at six to seven
degrees Celsius until two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Under the influence of a strong cold front, said the
specialists, the average temperature then dropped below zero
degree Celsius, and the lowest were recorded at minus six to minus
seven degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts expect the snowfall to cause losses to
farmers, since crops here are not prepared for the freezing
temperature following the snow.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Calls for Advancement of Anti-Corruption Campaign (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today
called on leading officials at various levels to raise their
competence at work and guard against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Second Plenary Session of the Central
Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) for Discipline
Inspection, Jiang said these efforts are being made to unify the
Party's concern with the people's aspirations in their advancement
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
explained that the top task for the Party and the country at
present is to hold high the banner of the Deng Xiaoping Theory,
further emancipate minds, seek truth from facts, seize the
opportunity, focus on economic construction and strive to make
breakthroughs in economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Li
Lanqing and other Chinese leaders attended the session presided
over by Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the improvement of the Party's work
style, building a clean government and waging the anti-corruption
struggle are important parts of the Deng Xiaoping Theory, and an
inevitable requirement posed by the building of socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Since the 14th National Party Congress, a number of major
corruption cases have been ferreted out and the campaign to
practice the economy and curb extravagance has been launched. The
Party and government departments have scored great successes in
this regard, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the anti-corruption struggle is a long and
arduous task which requires effective measures.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that to solve the new problems in the country's
opening-up and modernization drive, the most important thing is to
keep close contacts between the Party and the people, and to rely
on the people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he believes that as long those close contacts are
maintained, even the biggest and most complicated problems can be
solved.

Jiang said the Party will continue to work hard to build an
honest and clean government in the new year, and at the same time
carry out tasks concerned with the reform, opening-up and
stability.
</P>
<P>
In combating corruption, he emphasized adherence to unified
leadership of the Party committees at each level, joint effort of
the Party and the government, as well as the participation and
support of the people.
</P>
<P>
These are important steps to effectively stop and punish
corruption, and should continue to be implemented, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the work to foster clean and
self-disciplined officials must be firmly grasped, that each
stipulation on combating waste and extravagant spending must be
carried out to the letter, and that some major and vital cases
concerned with severe violations of the law and discipline must be
looked into thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also called on related departments to reduce the burden
on farmers and enterprises and to check funds exceeding the
financial budget, while at the same time firmly rectifying
unhealthy tendencies of some departments and lines of business as
well as protecting against officials infringing on people's rights
and interests.
</P>
<P>
Jiang required officials at each level to act as models in the
anti-corruption campaign, and to carry forward the fine tradition
of working hard and living frugally.
</P>
<P>
At present, officials should care more about the laid-off
workers, needy employees of the state-owned enterprises and people
in impoverished areas, he said.

<HEADLINE> Cape Verde Strives to Develop Telecommunications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- After being privatized in 1996,
Cape Verde Telecom has invested more than 14 million U.S. Dollars
annually in the development of national telecommunications
systems, the Angolan News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Eugenio Inocencio, General Manager of Cape Verde Telecom, said
at a news briefing on the opening of his country's cellular
telephone network today that rapid progress has been made in
developing the telecommunications sector in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1996, the first year of the privatization
process, the number of telephones in the country surpassed 5,000.
And the figure reached 9,000 and Internet was also introduced
into Cape Verde in 1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
Inocencio attributed the progress to privatization and foreign
investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to put high investment into the
telecommunications industry for the improvement of communication
conditions which are vital for attracting foreign investors, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Cape Verde is composed of over 10 islands in the Atlantic
Ocean, with a population of 61,000. Tecommunications development
will facilitate contacts among its islanders and promote
its economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Increase Assistance to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government plans
to provide more assistance to Indonesia in its coming fiscal year,
a senior official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the current 1997/98 fiscal year (ending on March 31), Japan
gave Indonesia 20 billion yen as part of the 5.3 billion U.S.
dollar soft loans provided by the Consultative Group for
Indonesia, Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said after a meeting
between visiting special envoy Masahiko Komura of the Japanese
prime minister and President Soeharto here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Komura, who is also vice foreign minister, arrived here
Wednesday at the head of a senior officials delegation.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese envoy also handed over a letter from Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to President Soeharto during the
meeting, said Moerdiono.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese prime minister hoped that Indonesia would strictly
implement the economic and financial reform program it has signed
recently with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a bid to
overcome the monetary crisis, Moerdiono added.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also expressed his belief that under the leadership
of President Soeharto and with the implementation of the program,
Indonesia's economy could recover and this would also be conducive
to economic and monetary recovery in the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto told the Japanese guest that Indonesia will fully
implement the Indonesia-IMF agreement.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the most important thing at the movement is how
to restore public and international confidence in the rupiah, the
country's currency, which has plunged by more than 200 percent
against the U.S. dollar since July last year.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also hoped the Japanese government would help
Indonesia increase its non-oil and gas exports.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Reduce Dependence on Foreign Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's reliance on
foreign military equipment will be reduced by using suitable
locally-manufactured equipment, Malaysian Defense Minister Syed
Hamid Albar said.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said at a naval base Wednesday night that the armed
forces have depended heavily on foreign equipment and the time has
come for Malaysia to use the locally produced, the national news
agency Bernama reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the present economic situation, focus should be made on the
support industries to produce components for the armed forces like
spare parts, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to Syed Hamid, Malaysia has the basics in producing
military equipment like the Styer rifle, which could be enhanced
to produce powerful equipment with greater capabilities.
</P>
<P>
He said all maintenance work for naval ships and military
aircraft was being carried out in the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Using Technology To Maintain Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Pan Guoqing, the director of
the Public Security Bureau in the city of Suzhou, in eastern
China's Jiangsu Province, no longer needs to bother shuffling
through a stack of files on his desk every morning, instead he
just turns on his computer and begins tracking a case.
</P>
<P>
Pan says the local police now have guidelines for maintaining
order in society by combining manpower with new
technology. Setting up the '110 police emergency line' using the
new technology will be a major way to improve the effectiveness of
the police in dealing with crimes, he explained.
</P>
<P>
When an emergency call comes in to the public security bureau,
it only takes a few key words to allow the operator get a fix on
the place where the crime has been committed on a computer screen,
meaning the police can be at the site in five to ten minutes.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the city's police got 25,000 emergency calls, 1,000 of
them involving criminal activity, 5,000 involving social disorder,
5,000 involving traffic problems, and 4,000 of them various calls
for help.
</P>
<P>
Pan says that police stations in busy areas frequently send
information in to headquarters, and 4,200 commercial outlets in
the banking and tax sectors, and large department stores and
jewelery stores are hooked up to the computer's alarm
system. Police officers can therefore be ordered to respond
immediately whenever an emergency occurs.
</P>
<P>
He says the city now has some 739 residential areas provided
with advanced security equipment. A recent survey showed that 98
percent of the residents of Suzhou are satisfied with the order,
and the 2,000-year-old city is still regarded as a kind of
"paradise" because of its good natural conditions and a high
living standard.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of China
(EximBank) is expected to grant intensified its support for the
nation's machinery and electronics products manufacturers to
achieve a steady growth in their export, according to a decision
of the bank.
</P>
<P>
High-tech and profitable products such as vessels, sets of
machinery, telecommunications and electronics goods will continue
to get the priority support from the policy bank, said Tong
Zhiguang, the board chairman of the EximBank.
</P>
<P>
Joint-stock enterprises and overseas-funded but
China-controlled ventures will also begin to receive the bank's
financing this year, according to Tong Zhiguang.
</P>
<P>
The bank is also considering further lowering the interest rate
of the policy loans, in a bid to reduce the production cost of the
Chinese enterprises and thereby enhance its competitiveness in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Set up as a policy bank to finance the export of capital goods
mainly comprising machinery and electronics products, the bank has
approved a total of more than 40 billion yuan and 224 million US
dollars in export credit since 1994, helping achieving an export
profit of 11 billion US dollars, said Tong.
</P>
<P>
It also provided guarantee for 4.4 billion US dollars' worth of
electronics and machinery products, and sets of equipment during
the period.
</P>
<P>
The bank is expected to increase policy loans to Chinese
enterprises setting up branches and contracting projects overseas,
to bolster the export of machinery and electronics products,
according to the board chairman of the EximBank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank will also expand the export credit
insurance sector to help the Chinese businesses hedge risks and
win more international biddings.

<TEXT>
<P>
FRANKFURT, January 22 (Xinhua) -- German chemical producers
will not reduce their investment in southeast Asia despite the
current financial turmoil in the region, the German Association of
Chemical Industry said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, Germany's large chemical producers could
even move to attach much more importance to investment in
southeast Asia in the coming years, said the association president
Hans-Dietrich Winkhaus.
</P>
<P>
Despite the current crisis, southeast Asian economies would
still grow faster than other regions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Winkhaus, German chemical industry had a good year
in 1997, with total sales growing by 7.5 percent to 188.3 billion
marks (102.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The boom was mainly driven by exports, which rose 12.4 percent
to 116 billion marks (63 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, German chemical sales in home market totalled
67.1 billion marks (36.5 billion dollars) last year, representing

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Urged to Do Better in Foreign Exchange Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese banks in this
financial center of China were urged today to improve their
ability in dealing in foreign exchange business.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Mao Yingliang, president of the Shanghai
branch of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, at an
annual municipal meeting on financial work.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that a leading central bank official here
has ever made such a call and this indicates that a new situation
of intense competition in business in both the local currency and
foreign exchange will occur as Shanghai opens its financial sector
wider and the overall financial business size keeps expanding
rapidly, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Mao said that both financial service and management improved in
Shanghai in 1997 while commercial banks reported good economic
returns.
</P>
<P>
However, as the financial sector opens wider, Chinese financial
institutions must improve their foreign exchange business in
settlements, letters of credit and deposits and loans.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts must be made to improve the competitiveness of Chinese
financial institutions in foreign exchange business," Mao said.
</P>
<P>
The local branches of the Bank of China (BOC), China
Construction Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China,
Agricultural Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have been
engaged in foreign-exchange business for years.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai branch of BOC, China's largest foreign exchange
bank, reported hard currency savings of 2.6 billion US dollars at
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai branches of the Everbright Bank of China, Huaxia
Bank, Fujian Industrial Bank, China Merchants Bank, and Guangdong
Development Bank have also been approved to deal in business in
foreign exchange. This year they will take measures to increase
their foreign-exchange deposits in proportion to their total value
of deposits.

would be taken to expedite the recovery rate.

<HEADLINE> Wreckages of 2,000 Ancient Sunk Ships Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists say they have
detected wreckages of 2,000 sunk ships dating from the Tang
(618-907) to the Qing (1644-1911) Dynasty in the coastal areas of
southern China.
</P>
<P>
Underwater archaeologists from the Beijing-based National
Museum of Chinese History have obtained pottery, coins and bronze
cannons from the wreckages which were found in eastern Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
"The wreckages indicate that there are at least 2,000 sunk
ships lying on the ancient seabed," an archaeologist said.
</P>
<P>
"And one of the sunk ships belonged to the fleet led by Admiral
Zheng Chenggong from the late Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Admiral Zheng led a rebellion against the newly-established
Manchurian empire in eastern Guangdong in 1646, according to
historical sources.
</P>
<P>
Many of the ancient ship wreckages were found buried in
present-day land area such as that at the mouth of the Pearl
River, which used to be water areas.
</P>
<P>
"The findings will shed new light on the ancient maritime trade
route through the South China Sea, " said Zhang Wei, director of
underwater archaeology in the National Museum of Chinese History.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, Chinese underwater archaeologists will make
South China Sea as their major research area in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
China's underwater archaeology study was started in the late
1980s. By now the Chinese archaeologists have carried out a number
of underwater archaeology projects including salvaging wreckages
from a sunk ship dating back to the Liao Dynasty (916-1125) in in
northern China's Bohai Sea, archaeological investigation around
the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea and assisting Japanese
researchers in underwater archaeology study.

</P>
<P>
A two-year transitional period will be allowed during which the
estate agents trade will be required to upgrade itself in order to
convert its transitional licenses into full ones before 2001,
Cheung told reporters at a press briefing Thursday afternoon after
the second meeting of the EAA.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at promoting professionalism in the trade,
enhancing protection for consumers and encouraging fair and honest
property transactions, Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
"The two-year transitional period will allow the trade
reasonable and sufficient time to meet the full licensing
requirements," he explained.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the tentative date for the issue of
transitional licenses by the end of 1998, the EAA will set
licensing requirements for the issue of transitional licenses and
full licenses, Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
The EAA will prescribe procedures in connection with
application for licenses and draw up rules and practicing
guidelines to regulate the conduct and practice of the trade, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The EAA will also discuss with educational/vocational training
institutions to facilitate the provision of training courses for
the trade and consider the need for an examination/assessment
system.
</P>
<P>
To examine these matters, the EAA has established four standing
committees, namely the Practice Committee, the Licensing
Committee, the Training Committee and the Disciplinary Committee,
Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
These committees will submit their recommendations to the EAA
in due course, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will listen to the views of the trade and the public.
Consultation and publicity will be arranged around mid-1998 on our
proposed licensing requirements and traditional arrangements,"
Cheung said.

<HEADLINE> HK's CPI Drops Slightly in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Composite
Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a year-on-year increase of 5.2
percent in December last year, compared with 5.4 percent the
previous month, the Census and Statistics Department said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Composite CPI is compiled on the basis of the combined
expenditure patter of households covered by three sub-indices.
</P>
<P>
The CPI (A) rose by 4.8 percent last December on a year-on-year
basis, as against 5.1 percent in November, the department said in
its latest figures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the year-on-year increase rates of the CPI (B) and
Hang Seng CPI stood at 5.2 percent and 5.8 percent respectively,
compared with 5.4 and 5.9 percent recorded in November.
</P>
<P>
The department attributed the lower rates of increase in the
CPI (A) and CPI (B) mainly to lower rises in housing rentals.
</P>
<P>
As for the Hang Seng CPI, the slower increase was mainly due to
lower prices of outerclothing, the department said.

<HEADLINE> 40,000 Ugandans Lose Limbs in War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Over 40,000 Ugandans have lost
their arms and legs due to mines in the war in the north, United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICIEF) has said.
</P>
<P>
In an 11-year guerilla war in northern districts Kitgum and
Gulu, at least 600 young girls and 1,060 young boys are in need
of care to treat their mental and physical wounds.
</P>
<P>
There are large a number of orphans and traumatized children
in the north, but no exact number of mine victims was given.
</P>
<P>
World Food Program report attributed the decrease of
casualties reports in the north to both the possible mines
cleared by the rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and
successful consolidation of the defense in Uganda-Sudan border by
Uganda army. Uganda army stopped to use mines earlier.
</P>
<P>
Some 285,000 of 705,000 tribe residents in the region, or 40
percent of the population in the two districts, are forced to
live on food relief provided by World Food Program (WFP) in
protected camps in the region due to the attacks and harassment
from IRA rebels, WFP added.
</P>
<P>
Deficiency of vitamin A, B and iron caused widespread corneal
ulceration and childhood blindness in the protected camps, WFP
added. There has been an average of 13,000 mal-nourishment cases
among children and 6,000 vulnerable adults (pregnant/lactating
mothers, disabled and the elderly) a month since January 1997,
indications from various sources said.
</P>
<P>
About 26.4 percent of population in protected camps are
children aged at 5.14, The Monitor said today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all children are out of school since July 1996 when the
war in the region escalated, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
LRA has launched an 11-year guerilla war in northern district
of Kkitgum and Gulu against the present government led by
President Yoweri Museveni. But the number of the rebels reduced
from its usual 2,000 to hundreds recently.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has 45 districts. There were three rebel groups in the
country. The government has crushed down one of them -- the west
Nile Bank Front, the ranks of the third one -- the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF), also has shrunk from 1,500 a year ago to
hundreds now.

BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- About four tons of cellared
liquor, with a history of more than 150 years, were recently
discovered in Jinzhou city in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts said it has the longest cellaring time in the world.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion has been verified by China National Food
Industry Association and Liaoning Archaeological Research
Institute.
</P>

The liquor was found on the construction site of the Lingchuan
Brewery in the city in June 1996, and was held in four huge wooden
containers. Inscriptions on the cover of the containers in both
Chinese and Manchu characters said they were sealed in the 25th
year of the Daoguang Emperor's reign of the Qing Dynasty, or
A.D. 1845. The containers also carried the mark of Tongshengjin,
an imperial workshop to produce liquor of tribute.
</P>
<P>
After one and a half century's storage, the liquor is of light
yellow and pure and mellow. The liquor, tested by a related
department, is up to the state hygiene standard.

<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The US's information giants,
Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Microsoft, signed a cooperation agreement
this week in Beijing to develop computer systems for four million
small and medium-sized enterprises in China.
</P>
<P>
Ricky Lee, vice president of China Hewlett-Packard Ltd., said
that small and medium-sized enterprises account for 80 percent of
the country's total, but that the use of computer technology is
limited because of technological backwardness and limited
financial muscle.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the two companies will develop a
"Small Enterprise Strategy" to increase computerization. The first
step will have HP increasing cooperation with local software
developers to provide software solutions for small and
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The software program has gotten the support of dozens of
domestic software firms and will see to it that Chinese have more
information exchanges with the global software industry.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qi, director of the Ministry of Electronics Industry's
Computer and Information Technology Promotion Department, said
that 3.4 million personal computers were sold in China last year,
up 38.3 percent from the previous year, providing a good
foundation for the local software industry.
</P>
<P>
She said that small and medium-sized enterprises make up
four-fifths of the country's 5.2 million enterprises and are
expected to contribute the most to the Chinese software industry
this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ox Painter Hopes to Draw Spanish Ox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- It is perhaps the right time
for a Chinese well versed in drawing ox to have the idea of going
to Spain to draw a foreign ox.
</P>
<P>
1997-98 was the year of ox according to Chinese lunar calendar
and a great year for professional artist Ding Luo, 60, a farmer's
son who have drawn 100,000 oxen.
</P>
<P>
But he had not seen a foreign ox until he was 50.
</P>
<P>
"I first saw a foreign ox on TV ten years ago. It was the bull
fighting in Spain. I was stunned to find that the foreign ox is a
strange animal and it is different from its Chinese relatives," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On Ding's mind for years, a Chinese ox is honest, hard working
and always quiet and timid. However, the Spanish bull he saw on
TV, is untamed and always fight to win.
</P>
<P>
What the artist referred to is perhaps a "cultural ox", people
guess. All they know is that at that moment, Ding did not come
across the idea of drawing a Spanish ox.
</P>
<P>
But last year made him think in a different way. The reclusive
Ding was invited to step out his house in Beijing's suburbs and
draw oxen for different people, who all think the ox is an
auspicious animal, and thus the artist got the chance to visit
many parts of China.
</P>
<P>
What a great change had the folk artist seen! In Shenzhen, he
was moved by the enthusiastic celebrations for the return of Hong
Kong, and in Shanghai, he was astonished with the skyscrapers in
the economic development areas.
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, I realized the world has grown larger in the past
years, and smaller as well, and shouldn't I go to the outside
world to have a look in rest of my life?" the farmer's son
proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Board of the Directors of the Chinese
Contemporary Painting and Calligraphy, Ding's works were published
on the elite "People's Daily", and were on display abroad. But he
did not go to foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Ding is a master of traditional Chinese painting, and he
thought that the technique could be only used to depict
traditional Chinese landscape and rural life. No foreign things
are accepted.
</P>
<P>
"But now I think that it is not a bad idea to let Westerners
have a look of our Chinese ox, and bring the image of the Western
ox back to my country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his first destination will surely be Spain, as
the bull fighting on TV has impressed him most.
</P>
<P>
It's the 5,000-year-old agricultural civilization that has
cultivated China, and ox was an important element for such a
culture. The ox, who always unselfishly contribute to the people,
was praised by intellectuals as a moral example.
</P>
<P>
Ding said that the ox's vantages are gradually disappearing as
modern economy and science develop so fast, and changes should
thus be made in painting styles as well.
</P>
<P>
"Thus I have been trying to depict the ox's another aspect: the
spirit of bold exploration, which is an unusual theme for
traditional Chinese painting," he said.
</P>
<P>
The result is that some of his animals no longer keep silent,
but rush ahead like horses, shouting loudly.
</P>
<P>
The rebelling artist is now making preparations for his Spanish
journey by studying the habits of Western oxen as well as climate
and culture in that distant country.
</P>
<P>
"To draw oxen abroad? It is difficult," said Zhou Ben, a
newspaper editor and a friend of Ding. "He even does not know how
expensive the travel will be."
</P>
<P>
"But I was still moved by his novel idea," he added.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Taking Measures to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The government and the
tourist circles of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) are taking measures to attract more visitors and maintain
Hong Kong as a dynamic and powerful tourist magnet.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon held by the Hong Kong General Chamber of
 Commerce, Executive Director of the Hong Kong Tourist Association
 (HKTA) Amy Chan said Hong Kong's tourism industry is facing a
difficult year, after a decade of spectacular growth, due to a
regional economic downturn sweeping East Asia over the last few
months.
</P>
<P>
She highlighted some of the measures and initiatives currently
being undertaken in Hong Kong as the following:
</P>
<P>
-- The SAR is considering a series of actions including
shortening the visa application process for Taiwan citizens and
processing direct visa applications from Russia, Eastern Europe
and the Middle East;
</P>
<P>
-- The HKTA has received a pledge of a 100 million HK dollar
(12.85 million U.S. dollars) loan from the SAR government to
support its "Spotlight Hong Kong" program, which will help
consolidate Hong Kong's position as Asia's "leading events
capital."
</P>
<P>
-- The HKTA has recommended to the SAR government tax-cutting
measures to help the industry, including reduction in the Airport
Departure Tax or Hotel and Accommodation Tax, and it has also
asked the SAR government to alleviate the financial burden on the
hotel and catering industry by waiving the Trade Effluent
Surcharge.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, along with East Asia, is facing a difficult year,
but it is still Asia's number one tourist destination, Chan
said. Even in last year's downturn, Hong Kong received about 10.4
million visitors -- at least 25 percent more than anywhere else in
 the region.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that our vision for Hong Kong as the region's
premier visitor destination is the right one and achievable," Chan
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Getting Rid of Poverty in Eastern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The final two million poor
people in China's Jiangsu province have been brought out of
poverty as the province met its state-set poverty-eradication
goals three years ago.
</P>
<P>
China began the ambitious program in 1994 to help 80 million
poor people get out of poverty by the end of the century. China
now has 58 million poor people.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income in ten of Jiangsu's poorest counties is now
2,516 yuan, well above the provincial poverty line of 800
yuan. The poverty line for the country as a whole is 500
yuan. But, Jiangsu developed an economic gap between its northern
and southern parts. So, in 1994, it began calling for cooperative
efforts to help the poor northern part get out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, southern counties have helped their
poorer counterparts with 300 profitable projects, and the province
completed several projects to help improve living and working
conditions in the region, building roads for every township,
bringing electricity to nearly all villages, transforming
low-yield farmland, and in water conservation.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have paid off. In 1997, the poor region's GDP was
29.1 billion yuan, up 15.7 percent from the previous year, and
grain output was 18.75 billion kilograms, accounting for 51
percent of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
The province will continue its preferential policies for the
region for the next three years, the provincial government says.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Say Serious Ice Jams Unlikely in Lower Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- As of yesterday, ice covered a
323-km stretch of the Yellow River, China's second longest river,
but experts say it's unlikely that serious ice jams will affect
the lower reaches this spring.
</P>
<P>
A coldfront has affected Shandong Province in eastern China
since January 15, bringing with it a long cold spell. The five
million cu.m. of ice on this section of the Yellow River is five
to 12 cm thick.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, although the amount of ice and water
levels are the highest they've been for the past three years, the
amount of discharge is still lower than normal, and catastrophic
floods do not seem likely when it thaws.
</P>
<P>
The Shandong section of the Yellow River has had several
disastrous ice jams and bank breaches in history because of the
great drop in elevation from the upper reaches on the Loess
Plateau, to the lower.

<HEADLINE> One Japanese Man's Half-Century China Odyssey  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- For Ryutaro Hasegawa, the
senior advisor of the Japan Association for the Promotion of
International Trade (JAPIT), the 53-year post-World-War-II period
has been a "China-centered journey".
</P>
<P>
The 90-year-old man became interested in China when he first
visited the country at the age of 12, and has visited it 77 times
since then.
</P>
<P>
One day, when he was riding a train across the vast expanse of
endless fields at dusk, he saw the setting sun turn a picturesque
crimson color, and it was then that he fell in love with the great
country.
</P>
<P>
After graduating from college, he decided that he wanted to do
something in China, and this dream eventually drove him to be a
pioneer in Sino-Japanese economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In 1957, Hasegawa came to do business in China as an employee
of one of Mitsubishi's companies and he attended the import and
export fair in Guangzhou, which became a window for China's
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
In trying to solve China's nitrogenous fertilizer shortage
problem in the 1950s, Hasegawa went from place to place in search
of 700,000 tons of fertilizer and shipped it to China.
</P>
<P>
The JAPIT was founded in 1954, and Hasegawa helped its
oil-import branch to get oil from China's Daqing Oilfield, which
was opened in the early 1960s. Since the 1950s, his company has
gotten aluminum and manganese from China's Bohai Bay, and he has
shipped textile and chemical equipment to China.
</P>
<P>
Many difficulties in Sino-Japanese economic and trade relations
in the 1950s because the diplomatic relations between China and
Japan had yet to be normalized. Goods then were trans-shipped
through Hong Kong, Thailand, or other places. Hasegawa said,
however, that he neither regretted nor felt proud of what he did.

<HEADLINE> China's Ancient Town Well Preserved in Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Pingyao, an ancient town in
northwest China's Shanxi Province, which has been listed as one of
World Cultural Heritage sites last year, will be developed into a
tourism, commercial and film town with distinctive features, said
a local official.
</P>
<P>
Cao Changzhi, vice-director of the provincial construction
committee, said that related governments have worked out a series
of plans to rationally develop the town on the basis of
comprehensive conservation.
</P>
<P>
Cao said the plans will be carried out within three years, and
will focus on the renovation of the ancient Mingqing Street,
hundred years old stores and government offices, ancient temples
and city walls, as well as dwelling houses of local style.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local governments will invest more than 210
million yuan (about 25.3 million US dollars) to move large
enterprises out of the ancient town area, purchase about 30
typical local-style houses from local residents, and build some
cultural relics museums in the first decade of next century,
according to Cao.
</P>
<P>
Cao emphasized that the tourism development of the town should
be coordinated with the protection of the cultural relics, and the
uniqueness of the town should be kept intact.
</P>
<P>
The town is home to more than 40,000 population, over one
hundred enterprises, as well as nearly 4,000 traditional
residences and ancient shops, most of which are still in use. And
the town is facing growing population pressure and backward
infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> S. African Arms Producers Complain Budget Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Armscor, South Africa's
arms manufacturer, has warned there was a real danger that most
armament manufacturing companies in the country would not survive
the current reductions in the defense budget.
</P>
<P>
Local daily the Citizen quoted unidentified sources as
reporting today that no arms producer has received major arms
contracts from the South African National Defense Forces (SANDF)
this year, and there was little hope of new contracts being
awarded unless the defense budget was increased.
</P>
<P>
Some arms companies have tried to switch from weapons
manufacturing to commercial products. However, this strategy was
not successful in all cases and thousands of workers have been
paid off, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, South African arms giant Denel company said
its head office personnel would be cut by between 40 and 50
percent before the end of February, and that its board members
would be reduced by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Denel Managing Director Seshi Chonco said that the board would
be reduced to seven members from the current 14, and that about
half of its 190 employees would be retrenched.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the drastic reduction in the defense budget and the
resulting reduction in military order for new weapons.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified Armscore source said the capital budget for
the SANDF had been reduced to such an extent in the past five
years that the SANDF could barely afford to maintain weapons
systems and had no money left to buy new weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said although South Africa had been on the edge of
technology in areas such as artillery and aircraft avionics, no
research and development had been done for the past year.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, in a very short time the SANDF will be forced to
buy all new weapons systems abroad because without research and
development South African armaments companies will not be able to
supply the SANDF with technically competitive weapons," the
sources added.

<HEADLINE> Sea Gulls Returning to Chaohu Lake in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- "The birds are so lovely," said
Zhang Youshan, an elder fisherman, looking at thousands of sea
gulls at Chaohu Lake, one of the country's five largest freshwater
lakes.
</P>
<P>
"This contributes to the efforts made by local government last
December to persuade fishermen living around the lake in east
China's Anhui Province to move their densely set fishing nets away
from the water," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The 87-square-km lake in Anhui Province used to be rich in
fish resources, which attracted flocks of sea gulls wintering here
before the 1980s. The birds seldom flew to the lake in recent
winters because they couldn't find food because of over-fishing.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and other fishermen have removed more than 10,000 fishing
nets from the lake, which has again become an attractive wintering
place for sea gulls.

He recalled having visited in the early 1960s the Daqing
Oilfield in northeast China where living conditions were so poor
that he could hardly believe his eyes -- the shoddy equipment and
cotton clothing patched with rags. He did feel that the Chinese
were extraordinary people and that the country would recover in
the future.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing years, he saw China's economy greatly improve in
about 20 years and then make a giant leap in a decade, and finally
reach a new level in just five years' time, he explained.
</P>
<P>
In his old age, he still works hard for economic and trade
ties, and joins the JAPIT delegation's China visit every year. His
Sasebo Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. is working in cooperation with
the China Ocean Shipping Corporation in the shipbuilding industry.
</P>

preparatory work.
</P>
<P>
Hasegawa said that both the Japanese and Chinese economies have
undergone great changes in the past several decades but that the
two have grown close than ever before, and that the two countries
should treat each other openly, capitalize each other's
advantages, and join hands to create a still better future.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Investments Flow to South Korea in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investments in South
Korea hit 5.93 billion U.S. dollars in the first 11 months in
1997, up about 155 percent from the same period of 1996, the
Ministry of Finance and Economy said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments in the form of purchases of equities, which
was officially allowed by the government last February, totaled
601 million dollars during the same period, accounting for just 10
percent of the total foreign investment volume, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign investments in the country fell to 91 million
dollars last November, 62.1 percent down from the same month of
1996, due to the financial crisis caused by the collapse of large
conglomerates and bad loans of financial institutions late 1997,
said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The sharp reductions in foreign investments, compared with 361
million dollars for October, reflected plunging overseas
investors' confidence in the country's financial market after the
International Monetary Fund agreed to provide the nation with the
rescue loans of 57 billion dollars tied with stiff conditions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea's overseas investments tumbled 49.8
percent to 248 million dollars last November from the same month
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months in 1997, the nation's investments
overseas was 5.09 billion dollars, down 1.5 percent from the same
time of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the drop of overseas investments by
South Korean firms to the economic slowdown triggered by the
bankruptcy of large conglomerates and then a liquidity crunch.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Laid-off Workers Working in Neighborhood Committees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,800 laid-off
workers in Beijing have found their new positions in neighborhood
committees, said Zhang Guixing, an official from Beijing Civil
Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood Committees, used to be made up by housewives and
the elders, play an unique role in maintaining public order in
China. However, the elders and women can not cope with some
accidents such as catching thieves.
</P>
<P>
With the number of the laid-off workers increasing in recent
years, many of them have found jobs in the neighhood committees.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing has about 5,430 neighborhood committees, employing
more than 22,000 people, with the laid-off workers being the new
blood," said Zhang, adding that, "The new members are younger and
better educated."
</P>
<P>
Niu Jinying, a member of a neighborhood committee in Xisi in
downtown Beijing, said that she lost her job in 1993, and then
found the new job in the neighborhood committee.
</P>
<P>
"The committee has become my new home. I do some cleaning in
the residential quarters in the daytime, and then call on the
families with difficulties. If any family is at quarrels, I'll go
to mediate," said Niu.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-one-year-old Li Wenhui of a neighborhood committee in
western Beijing said that, "We old men can feel relieved after
younger men joined our committee."
</P>
<P>
Wang Shuzhen, 42, said, "After I became the chief of a
neighborhood committee I have changed a lot. Working with the
elders, I feel I'm still very young and full of vigor."
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics of the Municipal Labor Bureau, more
than 137,000 laid-off workers in Beijing were re-employed in
1997.

<HEADLINE> 1997 Natural Disasters Kill 3,200 People in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A civil affairs official said
here today that natural disasters in 1997 killed 3,200 people in
China and caused direct economic losses estimated at 197.5 billion
yuan (about 24 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to Li Bengong, director of the disaster relief
department under the Ministry of Civil Affairs, some 478 million
Chinese were afflicted last year by natural disasters, which
damaged 2.87 million houses and affected the harvests of over 50
million hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the major disasters hit China in 1997 include
earthquakes, droughts, hailstorms, floods, typhoon, plant
diseases, insect pests and blizzards, with quakes and droughts
doing greatest harms.
</P>
<P>
Between late January and mid April last year, Jiashi County in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was hit by
seven tremors beyond 6 on the Richter scale. And summer
droughts, reportedly the most serious in China since the 1970s,
ruined autumn harvests in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that thanks to the efforts by the central and
local governments, all people afflicted by natural disasters now
have sufficient food and clothing and proper place to live, and no
major epidemics have broken out in the disaster-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that top Chinese leaders, including President Jiang
Zemin, Premier Li Peng and vice-premier Zhu Rongji, often phoned
the civil affairs ministry to learn about the disasters or went
personally to the disaster-afflicted areas to visit local people.
</P>
<P>
"All ministries and departments under the State Council have
also made every effort to help the disaster-hit areas," he added.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the ministries of civil affairs and finance jointly
allocated 2.2 billion yuan in disaster relief funds. Including
the money from local budgets and various social donations, China
in 1997 spent over 4.4 billion yuan on disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
Initial statistics showed that last year over 40 million
disaster-afflicted people received relief food, nearly 20 million
received quilts and clothes, over one million had their
disaster-caused diseases cured free of charge, and 5.11 million
were moved to safe places or resettled.
</P>
<P>
"Before the start of winter, our ministry and local governments
at all levels already helped rebuild over two million houses in
the disaster-stricken areas," Li added.
</P>
<P>
He also highly commended the role of the People's Liberation
Army (PLA), armed police force, public security personnel and
militiamen in China's disaster relief efforts last year.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics from all over the country showed that in
1997, the PLA and armed police forces sent 950,000 soldiers and
officers, more than 4,400 planes and vessels and over 50,000
vehicles to participate in some 10,000 disaster relief actions,
helping rescue or move over 490,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Banks in Zambia Swindled Out of 790,000 Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Commercial banks in Zambia were
swindled out of 1.1 billion Kwacha (about 790,000 U.S. Dollars)
in 1997, Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Chief Security Commandant of Bank
of Zambia, Nober Mumba, as saying here Wednesday that the 1.1
billion Kwacha represented a fraction of what was stolen from the
banking sector because several commercial banks did not report
cases of fraud to the Central Bank fearing they would shatter
their reputation.
</P>
<P>
He told the Zambia police conference on crime that the
organized crime is threatening economic recovery and should be
tackled seriously by all interest groups.
</P>
<P>
Money channelled to Zambia's neighboring countries through
fraud could not be retrieved because of lack of treaties to deal
with such cases, according to the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion Inspector General of Police Francis
Ndhlovu said between January and July last year 37 vehicles
stolen from the neighboring countries were recovered in Zambia
while 15 vehicles stolen from Zambia were found in the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 and 1997 a total of 4,600 counterfeit video and audio
tapes were confiscated in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of policemen will be increased to 27,000 by
the year 2000 from current 12,000.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa told the meeting that
violent crime is a danger to democracy while organized crime
does a lot of damage to the economy.
</P>
<P>
The minister said crime impedes economic growth and
discourages investors and it should be tackled vigorously.

<HEADLINE> Technology of Rapid Propagation of Bamboo Developed in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A new technology of rapid
propagation of bamboo has helped increase the growing areas of
bamboo in southwestern China's Yunnan Province to 16,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The province is referred as the hometown of bamboo, which is
widely used in local people's daily life. And in recent years, the
demand for bamboo has increased sharply because of the wide use of
it in industrial production. Statistics showed that more than
3,000 bamboo products falling into seven categories have been
developed in China.
</P>
<P>
However, traditional method of planting bamboo can not meet the
rapidly increasing demand. By the current method, the surviving
rate of bamboo can only reach 20 to 50 percent, and it takes five
to six years to build a forest of bamboo.
</P>
<P>
A paper plant in Shuangjiang County in the province consumes
40,000 tons of bamboo annually, and the bamboo in the county can
only sustain the production of the plant for no more than three
years.
</P>
<P>
The Bamboo Research Institute of Yunnan Teacher's College has
developed the new technology of rapid propagation of bamboo.
</P>
<P>
They treated a branch of bamboo with a special liquid, and then
plant the branch. After five monthes, the branch will grow to 2.5
meters high. By this method, 30 to 50 young plants can grow out of
an adult bamboo.
</P>
<P>
The surviving rate of the new method can reach 90 percent, and
the time of building a bamboo forest will be reduced within two
years. Researches have showed that the new technology can be
applied to more than a dozen species of bamboo.
</P>
<P>
The research institute has trained more than 16,000 local
farmers to spread the new method to over 20 counties.
</P>
<P>
An expert of the institute said that they will continue their
research to improve the planting method.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- At a reception today of
overseas Chinese affairs departments to celebrate the lunar new
year, Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said that overseas Chinese have
been a strong force in supporting China's development and have
contributed a lot to friendly relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
They have also contributed to China's prosperity, Qian said,
and reviewed China's achievements during the past year, praising
overseas Chinese who have returned for their dedication to the
reforms and national development.
</P>
<P>
He said it is a common desire of all Chinese, both at home and
abroad, to achieve China's reunification. There need to be
economic and cultural exchanges across the Taiwan Straits under
the "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems" policy,
he said, so that there will be a smooth transition for Macao in
December of 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that China's overseas Chinese affairs
departments will continue their efforts to increase ties with Hong
Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots, and with overseas Chinese,
and work for new reform and opening-up developments this year.
</P>
<P>
Guo Dongpo, director of the State Council's Office of Overseas
Chinese Affairs, said that the sole purpose of overseas Chinese
affairs Departments is to serve overseas Chinese and that is their
responsibility as well. In the new year, they will do more
practical work for overseas Chinese and try to protect their
rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The reception was organized by the Overseas Chinese Affairs
Committee of the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference's Liaison Subcommittee for
Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao Compatriots and Overseas Chinese, the
State Council's Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs, the China Zhi
Gong Party, and the All-China Federation of Returning Overseas
Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Water to Flow to S. Africa Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A huge dam and tunnel
project will send water from Lesotho mountains to South Africa's
parched north today after 11 years of construction at a cost of
10 billion Rand (2.03 billion U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela and Lesotho King Letsie
III will preside over a colorful dedication ceremony in northern
mountains of the small kingdom surrounded by South Africa, the
Citizen paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho Highlands Water Project will reverse the southerly
flow of water out of Lesotho's mountains, sending it 400
kilometers north to Gauteng, South Africa's industrial heartland,
and other regions.
</P>
<P>
Work on the project started in 1986 after the signing of a
treaty between South Africa's previous government and Lesotho,
which was aimed to solve water shortage in northern South Africa
while generating big revenues for Lesotho, one of the world's 10
poorest nations listed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
By selling its principal natural resource, Lesotho gets
millions of Rand in fees from South African water consumers and a
72-megawatt hydro-electric plant, enough to supply all its power
needs.
</P>
<P>
The scheme enables South Africa's north and northeast regions
to receive additional water for about 30 years, which is expected
to quench the growing thirst in major industrial neighborhood and
bring about an economic boom in some less developed areas,
including eastern Free State towns.
</P>
<P>
Capturing water from snow in the mountains 2,000 meters above
the sea, the project combines one of Africa's tallest dams, at
184 meters, with an 80 kilometers tunnel under the Maluti
Mountains. More than 200 kilometers of roads and a bridge over
the Malibamatso River were built to transport construction
material to the dam site.
</P>
<P>
South African Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal has hailed
the project as a role model in regional cooperation, providing
"an integrated unified approach" to develop the two countries
whose "economic destinies are inextricably linked".

HOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- With his takeover as head
of state in 1999 just around the corner, deputy president Thabo
Mbeki is set to move to the center stage and assume most of the
functions currently performed by president Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
President spokesman Parks Mankahlana said yesterday with the
hand-over reins to Mbeki so close, Mandela's schedule would be
rearranged to make the transition "smooth and comfortable".
</P>
<P>
"The president will definitely tone down his schedule to give
Mbeki responsibility," Mankahlana was quoted as saying by local
press today.
</P>
<P>
In several instances last year Mandela said he regarded
himself as the de jure president and Mbeki the de factor head of
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, Mankahlana could not confirm whether Mandela would
spend much of his spare time at his favority retreat in Qunu, his
home village in Eastern Cape province.
</P>
<P>
Recently at the African National Congress (ANC) national
conference, the 79 year old president stepped down as leader of
the ruling party, handing over to Mbeki, a move seen by many as
preparing for Mbeki's eventual takeover as the country's next

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is determined to bring
internal resources and strength into full play, in the context of
the current financial and monetary crisis in Southeast Asia,
Vietnam's Communist Party chief Le Kha Phieu said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to local officials during his recent tour of southern
provinces earlier this week, Phieu said that the Vietnamese people
should raise self-determination and self-reliance, and focus on
boosting production and economic development with priority given
to high-efficiency industries so as to make Vietnamese-made
products more competitive in the market, Vietnam News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam should concentrate on export-oriented production and
avoid unplanned investment and waste of time, state assets and
funds, Phieu said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to practice thrift, saying that
"thrifty behavior in production and consumption must become a
national policy, responsibility and habit of all public agencies,
branches of activities, individual party cadres and members of
the entire people."
</P>
<P>
While meeting with foreign investors in Ho Chi Minh City, the
Vietnamese top leader said that Vietnam will continue to structure
and complete a legal environment that will enhance conditions for
foreign investors and business people in the country.

MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Thursday renewed his assurance of a peaceful transfer of power
this year and urged foreign investors not to be distracted by the
May 11 elections.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered to both local and foreign investors,
Ramos said the peaceful turnover of power is "a normal and regular
happening" in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He said whoever succeeds him after June 30 is believed to be
able to sustain the continuity of the basic policies governing the
economy.
</P>
<P>
That was because "there is a degree of policy consensus among
the parties and the candidates on the economy," Ramos said, adding
that all the presidential hopefuls "subscribe to a free market
economy" and acknowledge the country's need for competitiveness in
the world.
</P>
<P>
He urged foreign investors not to be "distracted by the
sometimes inflated rhetoric, political noises and circus
atmosphere" that attend the Philippine electoral contests.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said honest and orderly elections and a peaceful
transfer of power would help the Philippines overcome the current
currency crisis.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Workers in Guangzhou, capital
of south China's Guangdong province, steadily improved their
living standard in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Experts owes such improvement to the growth of workers' actual
income and the expansion of social security system in Guangzhou,
which is working hard to ensure workers' basic living conditions.
</P>

Latest statistics show that the workers' total salary volume
from January to November in 1997 reached 20.5 billion yuan (about
2.5 billion U.S.dollars), or 1,144 yuan per capita, up by 11.8
percent and 14.4 percent respectively over the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, workers, particularly the 350,000 retired ones,
benefit much from a diversity of insurances of old age, industrial

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's state bank seeks idle dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A strong demand for foreign
currency has prompted Vietnam's State Bank to request enterprises
to sell idle U.S. dollars in their hands for the Vietnamese dong,
the "Vietnam News" reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily quoted State Bank officials as
saying that the foreign currency market in Vietnam is "unbalanced"
with some enterprises hoarding dollars while others suffer from a
shortage.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is being compounded by the poor management at many
banks which tend to leave capital idle rather than rechannelling
it back into the economy," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, many commercial banks are failing to meet the
demand for foreign currency from import-export enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Lack of foreign currency has forced many import-export
enterprises to borrow from foreign banks at a higher interest rate.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to free up the flow of foreign exchange, the
acting governor of the State Bank has told state-sector banks to
cooperate with commercial banks in encouraging all enterprises to
sell their idle dollars.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank said that the enterprises, which have sold their
dollars, will be allowed to "spot" buy and sell foreign currencies at
commercial banks.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Increase Confidence in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Economic reforms in
Tanzania has built up foreign businessmen's confidence in the
country, making it one of the top 10 Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) destination in Africa.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Bank of Tanzania told the Express paper
that before liberalization of the economy few investors cared
about Tanzania. Records show that not a penny was invested in
1990 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
The official, who is from the Department of Economic Reform
and Policy Research of the bank, noted the country experienced a
sharp decline in the FDI following a debt crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, as the country began to make achievements in economic
reforms in recent years, the country has seen an upsurge of
investment. A report of the bank shows that between 1991 and
1996, private foreign capital to Tanzania totalled 425 million US
Dollars, twice the total amount of the years before 1995, the
weekly newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The present inflow of FDI at present is 16 times the figure in
1992. It was at pains to attract the 12 million US Dollars then,
but in 1996 the country absorbed as much as 193 million US
dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"More is expected to come following betterment of the
country's investment regime and take-off of the Dar es Salaam
Stock Exchange," the paper quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
With more influx of foreign investment, Tanzania is expected
to have more channels to the international market, opportunities of
technology transfer and business management know-how which the
east African country has yearned for.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Tanzania ranks in the seventh position in FDI
receipts to the availabilitys of untapped resources: minerals,
wildlife and arable land, all in the name of a stable political
climate.
</P>
<P>
The superb FDI record, however, has failed to please United
Nations Conference on Trade and Investment. It says although the
investment performance of Tanzania and other African countries is
improving, there is nothing to boast of.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out it is true foreign investors' interest in
Africa has grown in recent years, but the continent's share of
global investment remains low.
</P>
<P>
Inflows in 1996 amounted to 5.28 billion US Dollars. In global
terms, it was a mere 1.5 percent of the total. It was
nevertheless almost double the annual average of the late 1980s,
but below the 1994 zenith of 5.8 billion US Dollars. The share of
the developing world FDI fell to four percent from 11.2 percent
in the second half of the 1980s.

BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese airlines ordered seven
Boeing passenger aircraft in January this year, according to

</P>
<P>
Air China signed a contract for five Boeing 737-800 passenger
aircraft on Wednesday, with Shandong Airlines ordering two 737-300
planes through the China Aviation Supply Corporation.
</P>

The purchases were part of the framework agreement Chinese
President Jiang Zemin signed during his October 1997 visit to the
United States. The agreement calls for China to purchase Boeing
passenger planes.
</P>
<P>
The most recent order represents the first time Chinese
airlines have purchased 737-800 aircraft, the newest model in the
Boeing 737 series. The new twin engine features eight first class
and 159 business class seats. The aircraft will be delivered

WARSAW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- As many as 5,323 people were
killed in 66,769 traffic accidents in Poland in 1997, 16.1 percent
up from the previous year, Poland's newspaper Rzeczypospolita
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Another 85,136 people were wounded in these accidents which
went up by 15.3 percent from 1996, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The paper said one of the reasons for the increasing traffic
accidents was the gap between the poor road condition and the ever
more vehicles. An average of 500,000 vehicles are annually
registered in Poland.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper held speeding as the main reason for the
situation. It said some 40 percent of the dead lost their lives in
the speed-related accidents.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Lower Economic Growth Target in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Affected by the Asian
economic crisis and terror attacks last year, Israel's economy is
expected to grow no more than 3 percent in 1998, local The
Jerusalem Post newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a report by the Finance Ministry's Economic
Research and State Revenue Administration as saying that, Israel
needs to revise it original economic forecasts issued last July
before the terror attacks in Jerusalem and the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mainly affected by the July 30 bombing of Mahane Yehuda Market
and the September 4 bombing of Ben Yahuda pedestrian mall in
Jerusalem that killed about 30 people, the tourism industry
suffered badly as the number of tourists coming to Israel declined
by 3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry predicted in its July forecast a 3-3.5
percent growth in the gross domestic product in 1998. But Tsipi
Galyam, head of the Economic Research and State Revenue
Administration, said the Asian crisis alone could reduce Israeli
economic growth by 0.2 to 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Galyam added that the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund have lowered the growth forecast of most of the
world's economies by 0.2 to 0.7 percent, so the Israeli economy
was hardly likely to emerge unscathed from this crisis. He noted
that even there would be no direct effect on Israel, the
anticipated lower growth in other countries would indirectly
affect Israeli economy.
</P>
<P>
Israeli economy has slowed down since the hardline Likud
government, which came to power in mid-1996, adopted austerity
policies aimed to reduce the huge budgetary deficit and curb high
inflation. The economic growth, averaged above 6 percent annually
before 1996, dropped to 4.2 percent in 1996 and 2.1 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Finance Ministry is drafting a comprehensive
package of macro-economic measures aimed at further reducing
inflation, cutting unemployment, and increasing growth. While the
inflation rate was cut to about 7 percent in 1997, the
unemployment rate rose to over 8 percent, causing widespread
labor unrest and social tensions.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's proposed measures will require the cooperation
of several economic bodies, including the Bank of Israel, which
will be asked to include an interest rate cut. The ministry is
prepared to maintain the inflation target in the new year the same
as 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the coming days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
will hold consultations with Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman and
Governor of Bank of Israel Jacob Frenkel to discuss the economic
measures, including how to deal with the spiraling unemployment
and economic crisis in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Urged to Get Rid of Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Anti-Corruption
Authority (KACA) is committed to ridding the country of
corruption; thus it urges political parties and the media to help
in the fight against corruption.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local newspaper of Kenya times
published here today, KACA Chairman John Mwau said that his
outfit would work zealously to help repair Kenya's dented image
as a habitat for corruption.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his determination to get rid of corruption,
saying that the "mop-up operation" would not be slowed down by
the so-called "untouchables".
</P>
<P>
Mwau said that the law would apply to all irrespective of
status and challenged political parties and politicians with
evidence which can prove cases of corruption to provide it to the
authority.
</P>
<P>
He also challenged the media to help in the fight against
corruption, saying that "pen judgements and wholesome
condemnations against the authority would not suffice, we need
evidence to enable us to pursue the culprits and prosecute."
</P>
<P>
The KACA chairman noted that the corrupt practices were
currently strangling the growth of the country's economy, adding
that "this is a cancer which we must all fight."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the press would play a major role by
highlighting corrupt practices positively instead of judging the
authority with their pen.
</P>
<P>
Mwau stressed that it was President Daniel arap Moi's concern
that ills like corruption were eradicated in the country so that
Kenya becomes a better state to live in.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) Peter
Nyakiamo issued a statement Tuesday, saying that KRA
Commissioner-General Yusuf Nzibo had been replaced by John
Msafari.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae
had also reinstated Samuel Chebii as the Commissioner of Customs
and Excise.
</P>
<P>
Chebii was known to have been very firm on tax evasion and his
transfer last year was precipitated by his refusal to endorse
documents to regularize sugar imported under dubious
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund halted a Key aid package for
Kenya and cited Chebii's removal as among the main factors in
discontinuing aid.

<HEADLINE> China's Tertiary Industry to Do More for Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The tertiary industry will
contribute more to China's economic development over the next
decade, according to today's Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
Added-value output in distribution, service, and culture is
expected to account for a third of the country's GDP by 2000, the
State Planning Commission predicts. And that figure will increase
to 40 percent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
From 1997 to 2000, the tertiary industry will have a 9 percent
growth rate, the commission says, and the industry's market share
will increase 400 billion yuan each year. It will add 40 million
more employees between 1997 and 2000, it says.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to developing parts of the tertiary
industry with great market potential and capacity to employ
people, like tourism, housing construction, and community
services.

YINCHUAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region plans to increase the proportion of its private
sector contributions to GDP by five percent annually over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
"Regional economic growth relies to a great extent on the
healthy progress of the private sector," according to Ma Qizhi,
acting chairman of the regional government.
</P>

The region's state sector accounts for 70 percent of the
local economy, some 20 percentage points higher than the
national average. However, the majority of related
enterprises are operating at a loss.
</P>
<P>
"We will treat the private sector as the state-owned
economy, and breathe new vitality into the hard-pressed state-run
sector by allowing the former to merge with the latter," according
to Mao Rubai, a senior official of the regional government.
</P>

Related departments are formulating additional favorable

<HEADLINE> China's Cement Industry Predicts Moderate Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to produce
530 million tons of cement this year, up about four percent from
last year, according to official projections.
</P>
<P>
The country is expected to have a better macro-economic
environment, with economic growth expected to be above eight
percent.
</P>
<P>
China intends to push the average living space to about nine
sq.m. for each urban resident by the year 2000, which means 240
million sq.m. of residential housing will be built annually over
the next three years, giving a boost to the cement industry.
</P>
<P>
Other factors to contribute to the industry's growth include
increased spending on water conservation, continuing large state
construction projects like the Three Gorges Dam, and highway,
railway, and urban infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Continued reforms in the industry will have a positive impact
on the cement market. China now has over 8,000 cement producers,
only 500 of which have a production capacity of more than 200,000
tons and many of the older and smaller factories are expected to
be restructured this year.

<P>
HAIKOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved an average
annual increase of 20 percent for its marine economy for the past
few years, according to a recent ocean development conference.
</P>
<P>
China has been moving to improve its marine industry structure,
which is dominated by fishery and marine plantations. And, as
offshore oil has come to account for an ever greater part of the
world's marine economy, China, which is said to have 18 percent of
the world's offshore oil resources, is only producing two percent
of the world's annual offshore oil output.
</P>
<P>
China also lags behind in extracting magnesium, potassium, and
bromine from sea water, as well as in sea water desalination,
pharmaceuticals from the sea, and oceanographic electronics. So it
is attempting to have more rapid development in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The country has 18,000 km of coastline, and ocean industries
will be significant to the development of energy, the chemical
industry, foodstuff, and medicine, experts say.

<HEADLINE> APEC Urged to Respond to Members' Economic Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia International
Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz on Thursday urged the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to respond to the
economic problems of its members due to the currency turmoil in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
APEC needs to face the challenge of ensuring that its programs
remain relevant and useful in helping members overcome their
economic problems, Rafidah said at a ceremony where she announced
that the third APEC International Trade Fair '98 would be held in
Malaysia on November 13-16.
</P>
<P>
While APEC's work programs for 1998 would continue to focus on
the implementation of various strategies and action plans, they
must also take into account the higher expectations of such
programs to assist member economies in achieving sustainable
growth and equitable development, she said.
</P>
<P>
A number of APEC members such as Malaysia and Indonesia have
been facing economic problems since last July following
speculative attacks on their currencies.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah stressed there was a need to further raise the profile
of the development aspects of APEC cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, as the host for the next informal meeting of APEC
leaders this year, would emphasize on capacity building to enable
members, especially developing economies, to benefit more fully
from liberalization within APEC, she said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would work closely with other APEC economies on
developing initiatives in human resource development and
technology and on broadening the outreach to a wider segment of
business, she said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will continue to work towards the implementation of
the APEC Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) framework and its
attendant programs to help these firms progress by addressing the
challenges of skills, knowledge and access to technologies, she
added.
</P>
<P>
The APEC region has about 40 million small and medium-scale
firms, which account for 90 percent of total companies and provide
nearly 80 percent of jobs in the region.
</P>
<P>
APEC economies account for 46 percent of global trade in 1996,
with exports totaling 2.3 trillion U.S. dollars and imports 2.5
trillion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has set up a special
fund to help revamp prisons through agriculture and industrial
schemes, home affairs minister Peter Machungwa said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted him as saying that the fund is
one of the solutions to the problem of inadequate resources to
run prisons.
</P>
<P>
When he opened a crime seminar he said the special fund will
get money from the already existing "government innovative fund".
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that after this exercise the prisons services
would generate enough resources for sustaining prison operations
and imparting vocational skills to prisoners for use after
discharge," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told the delegates that it is now an accepted fact that
imprisonment is not an effective means of preventing crime and
non-custodial sentences should be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
"Inherent imprisonment is problem relating to prisoners'
re-socialization, formation of prison sub-cultures and prisoners'
stigmatization. These problems militate against successful
prison-based rehabilitation schems," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the world is beset by violence, social conflicts and
other forms of serious crime and "what is required, as a
foundation of new policy framework, is a new way of looking at
crime. This should involve shifting from an exclusive emphasis of
crime control to crime prevention."
</P>
<P>
The seminar is attended by heads of police from Zimbabwe,
Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and
Botswana.

Philippines as it prepares itself to tackle the serious effects of
El Nino," He said.

<P>
Since last March, most part of the Philippines has been
affected by the El Nino phenomenon and suffering from severe water
shortages. In the capital Manila, water supply has been cut by 60
percent for the past three months and the situation is unlikely to
be improved before the rainy season starts in July.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Nurses, Laboratory Staff Call off Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan nurses and laboratory
staff in the civil service have called off their two-month-old
strike to facilitate on-going negotiations between them and the
government,
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Wednesday, National all-Cadre
Nurses Union of Kenya, National Steering Committee and
Association of Medical Laboratory and Scientific Officers asked
their members countrywide to resume work immediately.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the striking employees said that the
newly-appointed Health Minister Jackson Kalweo initiated dialogue
last Friday and had shown total commitment to seek a solution to
their grievances.
</P>
<P>
They decided to suspend the strike to facilitate the dialogue
between an 11-man committee comprising nurses and laboratory
technicians, and top officials of the Health Ministry, the
statement noted.
</P>
<P>
Health Ministry officials welcomed the move and assured that
there would be no victimization and nurses' grievances would be
addressed before the end of April this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 nurses started their strike on November 28
last year to demand salary increments of between 200 and 500
percent, and laboratory technicians joined a few days later.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kenyan government did not meet their demands and
earlier this month sacked the striking health workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 22 (xinhua) -- El Nino may not affect whole
Zambia apart from the extremes of southern, western and north
western provinces, a local meteorologist said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Post today quoted meteorologist Richard Mugara as saying
that so far Zambia has received normal rainfall apart from the
areas mentioned above.
</P>
<P>
He told the national Program to Prevent Malnutrition (PPM)
meeting that "effects of El Nino on Zambia result in dryer than
normal condition."
</P>
<P>
In a paper presented to the meeting he said if El Nino reaches
its maximum intensity this month then it will take four weeks to
start experiencing dry spells and that will be end of February,
meaning that those who planted their seeds early may service the
drought whilest those who planted late will be badly affected.
</P>
<P>
But if El Nino reaches its maximum intensity in February then
Zambia will start experiencing dry spells in March meaning that
crops will not be affected as that is actually the end of the
rain season, Mugara said.

TOKYO -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus in 1997 jumped up by

78.5 billion U.S. dollars), marking the first yearly increase
since 1992, the Finance Ministry said Thursday.

The ministry attributed the increase to robust exports of
automobiles and the depreciation of the yen against the
U.S. dollar. Japan's exports went up by 13.9 percent to 50,948.2
billion yen (about 400 billion dollars), while imports increased

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Combat Bhang Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has vowed to
demolish all bhang plants grown by several tribes in the southern
highland regions in order to eradicate drug consumption.
</P>
<P>
An official with the National Anti-Drugs Commission, George
Timbuka, told a press conference Wednesday that although drug
consumption in Tanzania has not reached alarming levels, the
commission is taking precautionary measures to prevent the
country from "jumping on the music wagon of drug trafficking."
</P>
<P>
The commission has realized that many people, especially in
the southern highlands, were consuming bhang as ingredients in
their food from time to time unaware of their side-effects to
health, Timbuka said.
</P>
<P>
"These people must be told that it is dangerous to eat such
kind of leaves and be educated on the legal implications of using
them," the official was quoted by Daily News as saying.
</P>
<P>
A research done in the bhang growing areas has revealed that
people there were more hostile than those in areas with the
plant, a member of the commission Professor Gad Paul Kilonzo told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a research conducted during 1995 and 1996 in Njombe
found that students in primary schools in bhang growing areas
were not performing as well as those in the areas without
producing the drug, Professor Kilonzo said.
</P>
<P>
The commission was formed under the Act of Drug and Prevention
of Illicit Trafficking of Drugs, which conforms to the 1988 UN
Convention against illicit trafficking and psychotropic
substances.

<HEADLINE> Hunan Electronics Sector Turns Losses into Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The electronics sector in
central-south China's Hunan Province earned profits of three
million yuan (361.440 US dollars) in 1997, thereby ending losses
recorded since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The industry witnessed substantial growth in output value for
1996, but nonetheless recorded heavy losses of over 100 million
yuan (12 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The sector generated a gross 1997 output value of 3.4
billion yuan, a year-on-year rise of 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials attributed the progress to successful
efforts to restructure enterprises in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Some 75 percent of Hunan's electronics enterprises have an
annual output values of less than 10 million yuan each, a level
which severely restricts competitiveness. The province established
a large electronics conglomerate -- Hunan Electronic Information
Industrial Group-- in 1996 as part of an effort to overcome the
problem.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the LG-Shuguang Color Television Tube Co., a joint
venture set up with investments from the Republic of Korea (ROK),
completed first phase construction in May 1997 and substantially
increased the mass production capacity.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The banking sector in

<HEADLINE> Austria Ready to Join European Monetary Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Rudolf Edlinger, Austrian
Minister of Finance, announced Wednesday that his country has met
the requirements set in the Maastricht Treaty for joining the
Monetary Union of Europe, both in terms of budget deficit and debt.
</P>
<P>
According to Edlinger, the Austrian budget deficit in 1997
accounted for 2.7 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), 0.3
percent lower than the required 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's public debt accounted for 66.5 percent of the GDP
in 1997, compared with the previous 69.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Edlinger said the decline in debt met the requirement of
joining the monetary union, although the percentage rate was still
higher than the required 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian budget deficit in 1997 was 67.2 billion schillings
(84 million U.S. dollars), 800 million schillings less than the
planned budget deficit. The public debt decreased 38.3 billion
schillings (48 million dollars) to 1.47 trillion schillings (1.8
billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit decrease was a result of the Austrian
government's drive to cut expenses in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Edlinger said that in the coming two years, the Austrian
government will subsidize the budget by privatization.
</P>
<P>
Austria acquired 17.8 billion schillings (22 million dollars)
in 1997 by selling national property.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Up 48.5 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
in 1997 jumped up 48.5 percent from the previous year to 10,008.3
billion yen, marking the first yearly increase since 1992, the
Finance Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the increase to robust exports of
automobiles and the depreciation of the yen against the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports went up 13.9 percent to 50,948.2 billion yen,
while imports increased 7.8 percent to 40,939.9 billion yen in
1997, the ministry said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States in the year surged 41.7 percent to 5,024.5 billion yen, the
ministry said. Japan's trade surplus in December jumped 40.9
percent from a year earlier to 1,238.2 billion yen, marking the
ninth straight month of year-on-year increase.
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus with the European Union and Asia in the
reporting year also turned upward. The surplus with the EU rose
67.3 percent to 2,482 billion yen, the first expansion in five
years and that with Asian countries went up 14.4 percent to 6,359
billion yen for the first rise in two years.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said that Japan's trade surplus will
continue to rise in the short term but that it is not expected to
sharply expand from the medium to long term.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Acts to Relieve Shortage of Fertilizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
formulated new policies aimed at relieving the acute shortage of
fertilizers throughout the country by involving the private sector
in importing fertilizers, national newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the policies, private sector companies and firms are not
required to seek licenses for importing urea and other chemical
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange needed will be made available through
simplified procedures, the imported fertilizers can be forwarded
to any part of the country without hindrance and the importers
themselves can set the retail prices, the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
These measures are expected to make prices in the chemical
fertilizer market competitive and make quality fertilizers
available to farmers on time and at reasonable prices, the
newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
The Himalayan kingdom, which defends heavily on agriculture, is
facing a severe shortage of fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Agricultural Inputs Corporation had monopolized
the fertilizer market in the country, leading to rampant smuggling
of fertilizers across the open border with India.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka Cancels Tender for Traffic Signal Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Transport and
Highways Minister A.H.M. Fowzie has canceled an international
tender for the supply and construction of computerized traffic
signal systems in the country, ministry officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the move on the ground that local expertise
was capable of implementing the project at one fourth of the cost
estimated by the World Bank (WB).
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, which is funding the project, said the cost
could be 21 million Rupees (338,710 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The officials said the transportation engineering division of
the Moratuwa University, the Road Development Authority and the
Colombo Municipal Council have started designing the project.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the one that was put into use in the central
mountain city of Kandy Tuesday, the ministry plans to install 30
more such systems in the country by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry hopes to establish a computerized link throughout
the country to monitor and regulate traffic flows.
</P>
<P>
Traffic jams have become increasingly a headache in many
cities, especially in the capital Colombo. Police sources have
said that half of the travel time on road is wasted due to traffic
congestion.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romanno
Prodi arrived in Skopje, capital of Macedonia, Wednesday for a
one-day visit to boost bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, who is the first Italian prime minister to visit
Macedonia since it proclaimed its independence from Yugoslavia in
1991, met Macedonia President Kiro Gligorov, parliament speaker
Tito Petkovski and Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Gligorov, Prodi appreciated Macedonia's role
in maintaining peace and stability in the Balkan region. He said
Italy stands for positive cooperation with the Balkan states and
that Macedonia can serve as a bridge of cooperation between Italy
and Oriental countries.
</P>
<P>
Gligorov said his country is applying for membership of the
European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Italy
has given its support and help in this aspect, and Macedonia
expects Italy to continue providing such help in its application
process, he added.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the two countries signed a protocol on debt
payment rescheduling. Italy would cut Macedonia's arrears of 11.38
million U.S. dollars to 9 million dollars and provide a
preferential loan to the former Yugoslav member.
</P>
<P>
Italy is the sixth largest trading partner of Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Police Unrest in Albania Cools Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A police unrest in Shkodra, a
large town in northern Albania, cooled down Wednesday afternoon,
Albanian news media reported.
</P>
<P>
The armed rebel policemen, who captured the Shkodra government
building for more than a day, withdrew at 4:50 p.m. local time and
the tension tended to calm.
</P>
<P>
Key organs of the town and major state highways were under
control of the local police and the commandos coming from Tirana.
</P>
<P>
Many schools in Shkodra were still closed due to security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
The governor, Gezim Podgorica, who was held hostage by the
rebels for 24 hours in the government building, told the press
that he decided to step down because he was actually unable to
carry out his duties.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Shkodra, a strong base of the largest
opposition party, the Democratic Party, remained strained in
recent days when the Interior Ministry dismissed and replaced the
town's police chief and dispatched a group of commandos.
</P>
<P>
The riot broke out when the new police chief started an
investigation into a number of smuggling and robbery cases in
which some local policemen were involved.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party accused the government of making
vindictive attacks on the opposition and called for the withdrawal
of the new police chief and his commandos to avoid more clashes.
</P>
<P>
In return, the ruling Socialist Party charged the local
Democratic Party leader of provoking the riot and asked law
enforcement agencies to check into all anti-government
activities.

<HEADLINE> California Court Backs Parents' Right to Discipline Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 21 (Xinhua) -- An American couple in
Oakland, California, were told Tuesday that they had the right to
ship their son to a rehabilitation school in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
Jim Van Blarigan and his wife were satisfied with the ruling of
a Superior Court judge, saying that it was in their son's best
interest. Other parents left the Alameda County courtroom with
relief because they also sent their children overseas to
behavior-modification programs.
</P>
<P>
The Oakland case has got national attention because it involved
the rights of minors as well as parents, an issue that have been
debated in the United States for decades.
</P>
<P>
Each year thousands of American teenagers are spirited away to
programs to be disciplined. For many heavy hearted parents who are
at their wits' end on how to deal with their defiant or
drug-addicted children, the programs, including adolescent
psychiatric hospitals, behavior-modification schools, residential
treatment centers, wilderness camps and boot camps, offer the last
hope.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, the teenagers are taken away from home by
moonlighting cops, bounty hunters or probation officers, who are
permitted by parents to use any means necessary. Those escorts
usually charge 2,500 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Child advocates oppose escort services, referring to them as
"kidnappers" and to the teen's involuntary removal as "abduction."
</P>
<P>
In the Oakland case, the 16-year-old high school student was
taken away from bed at midnight by two men hired by his
parents. He was driven 700 miles (about 1,000 kilometers) in a
locked car to a private adolescent hospital for an evalution and
then taken to Jamaica. His parents said that he has a discipline
problem.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts say that the ruling of the case would affect
other families, especially in California, who are seeking similar
treatment for their troubled or troublesome children. It is
believed that thousands of California teen have been sent out of
state over the years. Most are white, and middle to upper
class. Some private centers cost 100,000 for a two-year residential
program usually in Utah or Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
Once parents send their "out of control" kids away, they
usually tell only relatives and close friends because they feel
ashamed and embarrassed. But they have no other way out -- those
programs are their last resort.

<HEADLINE> Most Book Publishers in Indonesia Facing Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Of the 480 book publishers in
Indonesia, only 200 are still productive due to increasing prices
of paper, especially newsprint, following the dramatic fall of the
rupiah (national currency), local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A discussion on books held here Wednesday concluded that only
200 book publishers can still maintain their production
activities. However, unless prices of paper begin to decline
immediately, it is estimated that only 100 book publishers will
still be active by March this year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Book Publishers Association Chairman Rozali Usman
said at the discussion that many book publishers have decided to
halt production because of high prices of paper.
</P>
<P>
The price of paper has risen from 2,000 rupiah per kilogram to
6,000 rupiah per kilogram in the local market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the price of newsprint has increased from 1,254
rupiah per kilogram in January 1997 to the present 3,252.3 rupiah
per kilogram, an increase of 235.56 percent in one year.
</P>
<P>
Aside from paper, prices of other materials like ink and film,
which mostly still have to be imported, have also increased as a
result of the rupiah's depreciation against the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
In this situation, many newspapers in the country have been
forced to reduce the number of their pages or raise their prices.

<HEADLINE> Bank Loans Opened to Non-State Enterprises in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Non-State enterprises in China
now can get policy-oriented loans, which are no longer the only
privilege of State-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Export and Import Bank of China (Eximbank), one of the
three policy-oriented banks, has decided to gradually expand its
financial services to collectively-owned firms and joint-stock
companies as well as some foreign-funded enterprises from this
year, today's China Daily quoted bank chairman Tong Zhiguang as
saying.
</P>
<P>
These non-State companies will mainly be manufacturers and
exporters of machinery and electronic products, which corresponds
to the Eximbank's target in underpinning China's exports of
high-tech and high value-added capital goods.
</P>
<P>
"There is no more restriction on the non-State companies
getting financial support," said Gu Mingchao, vice-president of
Eximbank. But "the large and medium-sized State-owned firms will
remain as major clients."
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to those profitable machinery and
electronic firms with products having market potential, such as
ships, telecommunications and electronic products.
</P>
<P>
Machinery and electronic products are currently the largest
export category of China with their export volume reaching 59.3
billion yuan (7.14 billion U.S. dollars) last year, representing
32 percent of China's total exports.
</P>
<P>
But exports of high-tech items are a slight proportion of the
overall machinery and electronic exports, indicating a big
potential for growth.
</P>
<P>
The Eximbank now mainly offers export credit, insurance and
guarantees to facilitate Chinese machinery and electronic
exports.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Hit by Country-wide Power Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A nation-wide power failure hit
Sri Lanka Wednesday afternoon, a second such incident in less than
two months, local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Electricity supply was shut down at around 1:00 PM and was
restored only one and a half hours later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) attributed the power failure
to a technical problem in its power control system. The problem
had not been identified until Wednesday evening, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
A senior CEB official was quoted as saying that virtually the
whole country was out of power, except a few places.
</P>
<P>
Heavy traffic built up in Colombo city and its suburbs as all
the traffic lights failed to function.
</P>
<P>
This was the second similar incident in less than two months.
</P>
<P>
On December 5, 1997, an island-wide electricity failure plunged
Sri Lanka into a total darkness for at least 70 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent to the electricity failure, telecommunications were
down for almost three hours, making it impossible for customers of
local telecommunications services to establish international
direct dial (IDD) connection with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The CEB said the large-scale blackout was due to a technical
defect at a power station in Norton Bridge in the central mountain
area of the country.

<HEADLINE> Ad Campaign Launched to Urge Ban on "Soft Money" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A 1 million-dollar ad
campaign was launched on Wednesday urging the U.S. Congress to ban
so-called "soft-money" political contributions.
</P>
<P>
"Soft money" -- donations to political parties to be used for
generic party-building activities such as get-out-the-vote drives
and not for candidates -- is a central issue of the campaign
reform.
</P>
<P>
Campaign for America, founded by Wall Street financier Jerome
Kohlberg, began running a 30-second ad on cable television
stations in nine states that were chosen because their Republican
senators might be persuaded to support legislation that would ban
soft money, said Douglas Berman, the group's president.
</P>
<P>
The ad is running in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas,
Michigan, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York and Ohio, The
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of a bipartisan campaign bill named for Senators
John McCain, a Republican, and Russell Feingold, a Democrat,
couldn't muster sufficient votes to get it through the Senate last
fall. The measure would have banned soft money from presidential
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders in both the House of Representatives and
Senate promised debate and votes in the spring.
</P>
<P>
The TV spot and others to be produced will run through
February. The group also took out ads in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
The TV spot shows a man and women sitting at a kitchen table
going over bills when a voice comes on saying "corporate polluters
and tobacco companies... get big tax breaks in exchange for huge
political contributions."
</P>
<P>
Critics say donors give soft money to influence lawmakers'
decisions about policies and regulations that affect their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
"These ads give a sense that there is a connection between very
large corporate gifts and policy outcomes," said Berman.

China is expected to import 3.7 million tons of soybean this
year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Customs indicate imports of soybeans jumped
138 percent to 2.03 million tons in the first 11 months of 1997,
compared with the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of imports in 1997 is expected to have reached
three million tons, accounting for 18 percent of domestic soybean
consumption.
</P>
<P>
China, a soybean exporter three years ago, is estimated to have
consumed 16.5 million tons of soybean last year while total
domestic output was 13.34 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Farmers prefer to plant corn rather than soybean as the profit
margin on corn is bigger. The area under soybean had shrunk
from 122.1 million hectares in 1995 to 112.1 million hectares last
year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the total output of soybean this year will
maintain the same level as last year.
</P>
<P>
The soybean price on the international market is expected to
fall from the current 275 US dollars per ton.

<HEADLINE> Land Use Ban Instrumental to Inspection, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China's one-year freeze on the
use of arable land for non-agricultural purposes, introduced last
April, was instrumental to concluding a nationwide inspection of
farmland so used since 1991, an official was quoted as saying by
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Based on the result of the inspection, the government has
moved toward improving land management by drafting an overall
utilization plan and revising its existing Land Mangement Law,
Zou Yuchuan, director of the State Land Administration said.
</P>
<P>
The effort has also produced a new figure on China's cultivated
land, which will be publicized this year when the statistics are
verified by a detailed survey of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Although the new farmland figure may be a little higher than
the existing official figure of about 100 million hectares, the
situation that China has to feed 22 percent of the world's
population with less than 10 percent of the world's arable land
remains critical, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He noted the one-year freeze on the use of arable land, which
was officially decreed by the State Council, will continue
this year. The extended freeze will also cover the
suspension of power of counties in land-use approval, and the
prevention of more land from being occupied by urban expansion
projects.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, about 2.02 million hectares had been
occupied by a variety of non-agricultural projects since 1991, and
half of these were cultivated farmland.
</P>
<P>
The inspection, the largest since the mid-1980s, has helped the
government know the exact amount of non-agricultural land-use,
land-use potential and how to regulate the land market.
</P>
<P>
During the check, 116,000 hectares were found to have been left
idle or used ineffciently. Nearly 54 percent of the figure was
cultivated land.

<HEADLINE> Offshore Fishing Ban to Be Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China is considering extending
the absolute ban on offshore fishing from two months to three
months this year in a bid to preserve marine resources.
</P>
<P>
The moratorium area will also be expanded, an official from the
Ministry of Agriculture was quoted as saying by today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has submitted the report to the State Council and
is waiting for approval.
</P>
<P>
The ban would begin on June 16 and end on September 15,
compared with July 1 to August 31, the restricted period in the
past three years.
</P>
<P>
And the moratorium area will be expanded southward from 27
degrees to 26 degrees north latitude. The northern boundary would
continue to be 35 degrees north latitude.
</P>
<P>
This will be the fourth year of the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
From September 1 to October 31, fishing is allowed only beyond
30 nautical miles offshore in those areas. During that period,
when the fish were still not mature enough, the ban limited the
proportion of immature fish caught to no more than 25 percent of
each catch.
</P>
<P>
Fishery output in these areas has increased annually in the
past three years as a result of the moratorium. Major fish species
in China's sea areas, such as the hairtail, have grown larger and
bigger thanks to the ban.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cassava output to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Cassava production in Thailand
for the 1997-98 crop is expected to be dropped by 19 percent from
the previous year, to 14.33 million tons, according to the Thai
Tapioca Development Institute.
</P>
<P>
Chalaw Fuangaromya, president of the institute, attributed the
drop to drought in Northeastern Thailand which hit the main
cassava-planting areas, local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some planters have turned away from cassava to
grow crops that fetch better prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
The smaller output of the new crop, which will be release to
the market in September, is expected to result in prices of
cassava roots rising to between 1.20 and 1.40 baht a kilogram,
compared with 0.80 baht last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Seek 2.7 Billion Dollars from IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is ready to
start exploratory talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
for 2.7 billion U.S. dollars to shore up its foreign exchange
reserve.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper the Business Daily reported on Thursday that
the facility may take effect after the country exits form the
IMF's 35 years of economic supervision.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at the second quarter. It's a standby facility.
We can draw against it if the currency situation continued to be
difficult," Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The currency turmoil in Asia had reduced the Philippines' gross
international reserve to about 9 billion dollars at the end of
last year from a peak of 12 billion dollars prior to the
devaluation of the peso last July.
</P>
<P>
"It is a starting point of discussion with the IMF. Whether it
is going to be that or not, we will see at the end of the
negotiations," de Ocampo added.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is finishing a three-year IMF program by the
end of the month, the last of a series of IMF-prescribed programs
over the past 35 years aimed at weaning the country away from
dependence on foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the IMF, the Philippine government is also
negotiating for between 500 million and 600 million U.S. dollars
in loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

<HEADLINE> Santiago Subway Carries More Passengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A total of 200 million
passengers rode on the Santiago subways in 1997, 11.9 percent more
than in 1996, an official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Fernandez, chairman of the Board of Metro, S.A., a
company that operates subways in the city, said the Santiago
subway gained a net profit of 1.2 billion pesos (around 2.6
million U.S. dollars) last year, a 20 percent decrease in revenues
compared to the preceding fiscal period.
</P>
<P>
The reduction was attributed to an additional 3.3 billion pesos
(about 7 million dollars) used in the construction of a new subway
line.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chile's subway system, together with those of Hong
Kong and Singapore, is one of only three in the world whose costs
are covered by the operation.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a total of 197 million dollars will be invested in
technological innovations, maintenance to subway trains and
construction of the extension line.

<HEADLINE> Lee Kuan Yew Urges Thai Political Continuity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew has urged political continuity in Thailand so as to boost
international confidence in the country's ability to recover from
the economic slump.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a National Defense College seminar on Wednesday in
Bangkok, Lee also called on the United States and Japan to help
tackle the crisis in East Asia before it harms world trade and
regional security, the Bangkok Post reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand needs to assure foreign companies and investors that
the next election would bring a competent government, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
If they perceive that the next government has the same weakness
as past administrations, confidence will remain weak, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that in the past five years, Thailand has changed
government several times and none stayed long enough in office to
deal with the growing current account deficits and increasing US
dollar debt which was going into property developments.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States should include Thailand and Indonesia
in its bid to help ensure stability in Southeast Asia, adding the
economic slump in the region would hurt American exporters and
slow US economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"The cost to the United States of not doing anything in Asia
will be high. The United States must, in its own economic
interest, extend its help beyond South Korea to include Thailand
and Indonesia," he urged.
</P>
<P>
Concerning Japan, Lee said a strong Japanese economy was crucial
because it would encourage Japanese consumers to spend more money
buying Asian products.
</P>
<P>
"Japan must quickly get its economic back into health. A strong
Japanese economy will help our recovery by boosting our exports, "
lee said.
</P>
<P>
Lee expressed confidence that Asian countries in economic
difficulties will recover within two or three years if there is no
external problem.

<HEADLINE> More Farmers in China to Be Self-Reliant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Foundation for
Underdeveloped Regions of China (FURC) is to sponsor projects for
more destitute farmers to become self-reliant.
</P>
<P>
The FURC is a non-governmental organization established in 1989 to
help China's poor regions.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, FURC's projects aim to help
the poor gain a means of living by improving their farming
environment.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuzhao, FURC's vice-president, said that now the
foundation is working on three programs to help poverty-stricken
farmers become better off.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the mountainous area of southwest China's
Guizhou Province, people are blasting away rock to create arable
land of 667 hectares.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 people there will gain precious arable land and
become self-sufficient in grain by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, more scientific and technological training
is to be conducted this year so that farmers can make better use
of the resources available, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 people have attended the training courses
sponsored by the FURC since 1994.
</P>
<P>
One of FURC's subjects is to help farmers to grow edible
fungi. Now training courses on raising fungi are being offered
in Beijing to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, the FURC has invested 400 million yuan (48.2 million
U.S. dollars) in poverty relief projects.
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 people across the country have benefited from
FURC's programs, and 30,000 of them acquired a means of farming and
become self-reliant.

<P>
Per-capita income of the farmers in western Hunan, one of
China's impoverished areas, has increased to 980 yuan (118
U.S. dollars) a year from 300 yuan (36 U.S. dollars) 14 years
ago. People living below the poverty line have been reduced from

</P>
<P>
Peng started his poverty relief program in 1984 under the
direction of leaders of the Jishou Autonomous Prefecture of Hunan,
where his army was stationed.
</P>
<P>
He led his men in building houses, water conservation and
irrigation facilities, and schools for the poor, while introducing
advanced agricultural techniques to increase grain output.
</P>
<P>
Peng and his men have built houses for 70,000 local poor
people, and rebuilt 502 schools for 53,000 children, and 310,000

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis Hits Argentine Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's exports of
cereals and grains this year will be hit by the financial crisis
in Asian countries which are the markets for a large portion of
its agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
A study released Wednesday by a prestigious consulting firm
said this year's income from cereal and oil grain exports will
drop by more than two billion dollars compared to the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
This will account for a 25 percent decrease in the total annual
exports of agricultural products of Argentina, which in recent
years averaged around 7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Up to January 16, 1998, corn exporters have only closed sales
for 700,000 tons, while by the same date last year, they had
already signed contracts for over 2.5 million tons, which means
that income of over 1.1 billion dollars has been lost.
</P>
<P>
Up to the same date this year, wheat exporters have only been
able to sell 3.5 million tons, compared to 7.5 million tons by the
same date of last year, a decreased income of 750 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
With respect to oil grains, such as soy and sunflower seeds
which were targeted mainly to Asian countries, income losses
exceed 225 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries are the leading purchasers of Argentina's
agricultural products and the single product that will be hardest
hit is corn, since Argentina's annual corn exports are 4 million
tons, accounting for 10 percent of the imported products in that
region.
</P>
<P>
Analysts consider that other factors that have had a strong
impact on Argentine agricultural exports are the drop in the
prices of these products on international markets and the decrease
in oil prices, because the major oil exporters can no longer
afford to import the same quantities of agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, neighboring Brazil -- a major purchaser of
Argentina's cereals and oil grains -- is undergoing strenuous
economic adjustments and problems, which will clearly affect its
purchasing power and, therefore, the amounts it buys from
Argentina.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Approves Proposals to Reduce Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines has approved two proposals submitted by the Bankers
Association to bring down interest rates, local press reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Central Bank has agreed to re-open its
30-day lending window and monetize the banks' government
securities holdings in a bid to cut the interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The lending window will allow the banks to avail of cheap funds
from the Central Bank and earn an interest rate spread high than
when they borrow overnight from each other.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the monetization of the government securities
holdings at market rates would allow the banks to easily liquefy
their assets, thus helping reduce the interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank also approved the request of oil companies and
exporters to be included in the currency risk protection program
of the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
With the approval, oil companies are now allowed to hedge their
dollar loans against forward contracts with the Central Bank. The
agreement assures the oil companies and exporters of a dollar
source and is expected to significantly reduce their speculative
activities in the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the government efforts to stabilize the exchange
rate of the peso, the banks' interest rates soared to 25-30
percent from the pre-devaluation level of 14-15 percent.

<P>
SHANGHAI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Profits of overseas-funded
financial institutions in this economic center of China jumped 28
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed here Tuesday by Mao Yingliang,

the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Mao, who declined to reveal the exact amount of profits made by
overseas-funded financial institutions, said that the profits of
Chinese commercial banks in Shanghai surged 29.9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Currently Shanghai has 51 licensed overseas-funded financial
institutions and 162 representative offices. Eight overseas-funded
banks have been selected to deal in business in the Chinese currency
on a trial basis in the city's Pudong New Area, a rising financial
and trade district separated from downtown Shanghai by the
Huangpujiang River.
</P>
<P>
Mao said that this year Shanghai will continue to follow a
moderately tight monetary policy and beef up its pace in
establishing a modern financial system so as to lay a solid
foundation for Shanghai to be an international financial center in
the next century.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybean, Crude Futures Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Corn and soybean futures
prices plunged on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBT)on Wednesday
amid concerns of increasing planting acreage and crude futures on
the New York Mercantile Exchange also sank for fears of falling
demand for oil in Asia.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. forecasting firm predicted that corn acreage may rise to
81.749 million acres this Spring from 80.2 million in 1997 while
land under soybean may soar to a record 71.635 million acres from
70.9 million last year.
</P>
<P>
Good weather in corn and soybean growing countries in South
America also helped the market sentiment. Argentina is said to
boost its soybean production to 15.6 million tons instead of U.S.
prediction of 14.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
CBT corn for March delivery lost 2 cents to 2.76 U.S. dollars a
bushel, March soybeans retreated 5 cents to 6.69 dollars a bushel.
</P>
<P>
NYME Crude futures fell to the lowest point since April 21,
1994, as Asia, affected by financial crisis, is predicted by the
International Energy Agency to cut oil demand by as much as
230,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
March light sweet crude oil fell 26 cents or 1.6 percent to
16.30 dollars a barrel while the complex closed 20 cents lower at
16.36 dollars a barrel.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Standard &AMP; Poor's today
affirmed its rating on Boeing and related entities while revising
its outlook for the company to negative from stable.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's corporate credit was affirmed as AA+ among other
affirmations as S&AMP;P recognizes its prominent position within the
commercial aircraft manufacturing industry and favorable long-term
growth prospects for that business, S&AMP;P said in a press release on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It also pointed to the fact that Boeing has a leading position
in defense and space and a very strong financial profile
characterized by impressive cash flow generation, relatively low
debt usage and sizable cash balances.
</P>
<P>
The outlook revision reflects "serious economic and financial
problems in the Asia-Pacific market", S&AMP;P said.
</P>
<P>
The problems are expected to lead to deferral or cancellations
of airplane orders by some airlines, it added.
</P>
<P>
Most at risk are widebody aircraft, including B747s which
typically have higher profit margins.
</P>
<P>
There is also a likelihood of a decline in future orders,
because of a slowdown in air traffic growth in the region, S&AMP;P
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says He Would Not Rule Out Military Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- U. S. President Bill Clinton
said on Wednesday that "something is going to give" in order to
resolve the standoff with Iraq over weapons inspections
</P>
<P>
He told PBS television in an interview that Iraq's refusal to
allow U.N. weapons inspectors to check its "presidential sites"
was "a very serious thing," and he would not rule out to take
military actions to force Iraq to fully and unconditionally abide
by the UN resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious thing with me, this is a very serious
thing," Clinton told PBS.
</P>
<P>
"I can't rule out any options, but I can tell you I am very
concerned about this," he said. "Sooner or later something is
going to give. I am just very much hoping that we can reason with
him (Iraqi President Saddam Hussein) before that happens. We've
got to have those sites open."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he preferred to apply diplomatic pressure
through the United Nations to make Iraq comply with U.N.
resolutions on weapons inspections, "but if they (Iraqis) really
believe there are no circumstances in which we would act alone
they are sadly mistaken. that is not a threat."
</P>
<P>
Earlier at a State Department briefing, spokesman James Rubin
told reporters that Iraq's proposal to freeze weapons
inspections on its "presidential sites" was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"It appears Iraq has ignored the message of the U.N. Security
Council and instead tried to impose new and unacceptable
conditions on the U.N. operations," Rubin said at a regular
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said in Baghdad
on Wednesday that Iraq had asked him to freeze attempts to
inspect "presidential sites" until a series of technical
evaluation talks on disarmament. Iraq proposed a meeting in
April to discuss further access.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Butler went to Baghdad "with a clear message from
the Security Council that Iraq must cooperate fully and
unconditionally with the U.N.".
</P>
<P>
Rubin reiterated U.S. preparedness to take military action to
force Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions on dismantling
weapons of mass destruction, but said diplomatic channels were
still being pursued.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Butler plans to brief the Security Council on
Friday. It's premature to speculate on what actions might be
taken until after he has had a chance to report fully on his
visit. But again, we are not ruling out any options," Rubin
said.

<P>
NEW YORK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street fell
sharply today as the world computer giant IBM issued an unusual
warning that its first-quarter profits would fall short, dragged
down by slack consumer demand in Asia and the strong dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 78 points to 7,794, a
partial recovery from a 135-point slide that briefly wiped out all
of Tuesday's 119-point rally.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market measures also surrendered a chunk of Tuesday's
gains, which put several indexes in back positive territory for
1998 for the first time since January 2.
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, although IBM tumbled the equivalent of a more
than 30 Dow points, the technology sector suffered only a marginal
loss.
</P>
<P>
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell only a little
bit more than a tenth of a percent.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by an 11-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,130 up, 1,787 down and 527
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 625.12 million shares vs. 638.92 million in
the previous session.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Representative Meets Bankers in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior South Korean
financial representative met here today with William McDonough,
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for talks on
refinancing of the short-term debt of the Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
"It's very much informative and constructive," said Yong Hwan
Kim, co-chairman of South Korea's joint Presidential Economic
Committee, who flew in New York Sunday heading a financial
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The main issues in the talks were the form of any South Korean
debt refinancing, what prices would be acceptable to Seoul and
international bankers, and whether Seoul should issue new debt,
sources close to the South Korean delegation said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came before the South Korean representative's
meeting with leading international bankers at Citibank's New York
headquarters this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Yong is expected to outline his reaction to options drawn up
during debt refinancing talks in New York two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, global lenders agreed to roll over South Korea's
maturing obligations for 90 days, easing concerns the Asian nation
might default on some 40 billion U.S. dollars in debt coming due
by March 31.
</P>
<P>
Global lenders involved in the talks are to include most of
those who met with South Korean officials two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Citibank, the banks include Chase Manhattan, the
No. 1 bank of the nation, J.P. Morgan, Banca Commerciale Italiana,
Bank of America and Bank Tokyo-Mitsubishi.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Down on Impact of Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all ended lower today, depressed by worries over the impact the
Asian financial crisis may have on US and European corporate
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares battled back from
session lows despite sharp losses in New York during the afternoon
and ended slightly lower, down 5.9 points at 5,272.3.
</P>
<P>
Stocks were underpinned by improved interest rate sentiment
thanks to a fall in retail sales during December.
</P>
<P>
A buoyant futures market also protected the FTSE 100 index from
Wall Street's negative influence.
</P>
<P>
Germany's DAX-30 index ended down 25.07 points at 4,282.84.
Investors were using the weakness in Asia as an excuse to take
profits, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris closed 10.23 points lower at
2,998.11.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the dollar's weakness against the French
franc weighed on sentiment. But they were optimistic, saying that
today's drop was a natural consolidation after six consecutive
days of gains instead of a trend.

<HEADLINE> US Rejects Iraq's Proposal for Inspections Freeze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
rejected a proposal by Iraq to freeze weapons inspections on its
"presidential sites," saying it was "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"It appears Iraq has ignored the message of the U.N. Security
Council and instead tried to impose new and unacceptable
conditions on the U.N. operations," State Department spokesman
James Rubin said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said in Baghdad
today that Iraq had asked him to freeze attempts to inspect
"presidential sites" until a series of technical evaluation talks
on disarmament. Iraq proposed a meeting in April to discuss
further access.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Butler went to Baghdad "with a clear message from
the Security Council that Iraq must cooperate fully and
unconditionally with the U.N."
</P>
<P>
Rubin reiterated U.S. preparedness to take military action to
force Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions on dismantling weapons
of mass destruction, but said diplomatic channels were still being
pursued.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Butler plans to brief the Security Council on
Friday. It's premature to speculate on what actions might be taken
until after he has had a chance to report fully on his visit. But
again, we are not ruling out any options," Rubin said.

WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Forty-four police officers,
sheriff's deputies and prison guards from the Cleveland area in
the United States were arrested by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation on Wednesday on charges of taking payoffs to protect
cocaine dealers.
</P>
<P>
The dealers were actually undercover FBI agents taking part in
a sting, according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The law officers were charged with conspiracy to distribute
cocaine, which carries up to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
The officers were paid as much as 3,700 dollars to provide
security for the "drug dealers" while they took part in deals,
said Van Harp, agent in charge of the FBI's Cleveland office.
</P>
<P>
Undercover agents staged 16 drug deals from November 1996 to
this month, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
Eight other people were arrested on drug charges as part of the
sting.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Should Allow UN Inspectors in: Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Wednesday said that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein should
allow the United Nations arms inspectors in and should not be
allowed to dictate terms of the inspection.
</P>
<P>
Blair made the remarks during today's question time in the
House of Commons and this was his first public comment on the
Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The inspection must be carried out in the way the inspector
wants so that he (Saddam) is prevented from developing these
weapons of mass destruction and the world is made safer," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added that the present impasse was due to
the fact that Iraq might still be developing weapons of mass
destruction, which has to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
US Defense Secretary William Cohen was earlier reported as
saying that the U.S. wanted a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi
crisis, but it was determined to prevent Baghdad from threatening
its neighbors with biological, chemical and nuclear weapons.

<HEADLINE> (Updated) Rubin Urges Help to Stabilize Immediate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- In face of the widespread
Asian financial crisis, "our first job is clear: to help stabilize
the immediate crisis," U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at Georgetown University, Rubin also warned the
fallout "could be much greater" if the financial problems spread
to other emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has enormously important economic and
national security interests at stake in promoting restoration of
financial stability in Asia," he said. "When we act to resolve the
Asian crisis, we act to protect and benefit the American people,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The countries in Asia are our customers, our competitors and
our security partners. Financial instability, economic distress,
and depreciating currencies all have direct effects on the pace of
our exports, the competitiveness of our companies, the growth of
our economy and, ultimately, the well-being of American workers,"
the secretary noted.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also outlined four key elements of the program the
Clinton administration has supported from the beginning of the
Asian crisis: supporting reform programs in individual nations;
providing temporary financial assistance when needed;
encouraging strong action by Japan and other major economic
powers to promote global growth; and fostering policies in other
developing and emerging economies to reduce the risk of
contagion.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official also praised China's role in Asia."China
also plays a critical role in Asia's economic stability," he
said. "I want to welcome the statements by Chinese officials
made in recent weeks reconfirming their commitment to exchange
rate stability and to dealing effectively with the economic
challenges that they face."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Protests British Visa Restrictions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkey lodged a protest at
Britain Wednesday for its visa requirement on the Turkish Cypriots
who used to enjoy a visa-free entry into Britain.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman
Necati Utkan said that Ankara supports the Turkish Cypriot
authorities' position on this issue.
</P>
<P>
"They (the Turkish Cypriots) have asserted their reaction and we
fully support their stance," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
Britain announced last week to end the visa-free entry of the
holders of the travel documents of Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash said Tuesday that
Britain's move is to isolate the Turkish Cypriots, which he
described as "unjust and unfair."
</P>
<P>
But Britain rejected Denktash's criticism Wednesday, saying the
move is for immigrant concerns instead of political motive.
</P>
<P>
Almost 1,000 political asylum claims have been received from
Turkish Cypriots over the past two years, according to a senior
British representative in Nicosia, capital of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island after a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is only recognized by
Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Bosnia Sign Agreements to Enhance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 21 (xinhua) -- Turkey and Bosnia-Herzegovina
signed on Wednesday two agreements in an effort to strengthen
bilateral cooperation, semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed following talks between Turkish
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and visiting Bosian Co-Prime Ministers
Haris Silajdzic and Boro Bosic.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Bosnia will adopt necessary measures to increase
mutual protection and promotion of investments as well as
cooperation in transportation under the agreements.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Yilmaz and the Bosian leaders discussed the
procedure of Turkey's pledge to grant 80 million U.S. dollars of
economic aid to the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The sum of money, 20 million in donations and 60 million in
loans, will be used to help the country reconstruct its badly
destroyed infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two sides also exchanged views over
the obstacles thwarting the full implementation of the Dayton
peace accord signed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 Turkish soldiers are participating in the
peace-Keening mission of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian delegation, which arrived here on Tuesday
evening, had held talks with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel,
Deputy Parliament Speaker Hasan Korkmazcan and Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with the Bosian
officials, Cem said that the two sides had agreed to work
out regular working plans to further their understanding and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Bosnia-Herzegovina is a country with which we share a
common history. Turkey will do its best to give economic
support to the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Bosian officials will leave on Thursday for Istanbul,
the largest city of Turkey, where they are expected to meet
leading Turkish businessmen.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Washington for Mideast Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian
Authority Yasir Arafat arrived in Washington today for talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton on the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader is expected to meet Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright this evening and then hold talks with Clinton
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said in Paris on his way to Washington that he pinned
his hope on the president for the progress of the peace process,
which has almost collapsed since last March because of Israel's
decision to build Jewish housing units in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We have great confidence in President Clinton and hope he
will get the peace process back on the rails and moving again,"
he said after his talks with French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Clinton held two rounds of talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday in an effort to revitalize the moribund
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The United States believes that further withdrawal of the
Israeli troops from a significantly sizable part of the West
Bank is important for Israel and the Palestinians to push the
peace process forward. And Clinton offered some fresh ideas for
further redeployment to Netanyahu during their talks.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu put the security on the first place and said the
Palestinians must comply with their commitment to Israel's
security before Israel could consider any ceding of its occupied
land.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said after the two meetings between Clinton
and Netanyahu that gaps between the two leaders remain and could
not be solved over night.

<HEADLINE> Rubin: United States Needs to Help Address Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Although the impact of the
Asian financial crisis on the United States is "relatively
moderate" so far, the United States needed to help pay for
international rescue deals, the Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the Georgetown University, Rubin also noted the
fallout "could be much greater" if the financial problems spread
to other emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to stand back and gamble that the crisis will
resolve itself,... We must do everything sensible to help address
this crisis because the alternative of doing nothing will lead
to far deeper and far longer financial instability and economic
duress," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said, "Roughly 40 percent of our exports have
been going to emerging markets around the globe."
</P>
<P>
Some of the largest U.S. exporters rely on Asia and most of
the U.S. regions have felt the impact of the Asian crisis. But
Rubin said international rescue efforts undertaken by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) appear to be containing the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Rubin added that It is "absolutely critical" that Japan shores
up its financial system and generates solid growth in order to help
Asia recover. "A strong Japan would be a source of strength for
the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is seeking for Congress approval of
additional some 18 billion U.S. dollars to help IMF's rescue
programs, but meeting very strong opposition from some
Congressmen.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that cutting funding to the IMF would hurt U.S.
businesses and workers.
</P>
<P>
In a interview with USA Today earlier this week, the Secretary
warned a failure by Congress to approve the request for additional
funding for the IMF would be a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also called for an international meeting later this
Spring of the Group 7 leading industrial nations and others to
find new ways to cope with the kind of crises that have affected
Asia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair dismissed allegations made in the House of Commons that
Treasury Minister Geoffrey Robinson was facing an Inland Revenue
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"This is just a crude attempt to smear," he told MPs at
Question Time.
</P>
<P>
Neither the Inland Revenue nor any other regulatory body could
comment on a specific investigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tory MPs had called for Robinson to quit or be sacked over his
interest in a 20 million U.S. dollar offshore trust.
</P>
<P>
However, Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Sir Gordon
Downey said on Tuesday that there was no case for saying Robinson
had breached rules on registration of interests over the
Guernsey-registered Orion Trust. The Committee on Standards and
Privileges backed his ruling.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a government spokesman said on Wednesday the prime
minister retains full confidence in Robinson following Tuesday's
parliamentary report on his conduct.
</P>
<P>
"The Downey report (into the matter) made clear he did not
breach any rules of the House," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Rwandans Rise Against Hutu Extremists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 people took it to
the streets of the north-western town of Gisenyi in Rwanda today
to protest the on-going bloodshed blamed on Hutu extremists,
reported the Rwanda News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn the continuing genocide," "collaborators of
terrorists should be arrested and exemplarily punished," some of
the posters held by protesters read.
</P>
<P>
The protesters had come from all over the country to bury the
victims of Monday's attack on a bus of Rwandan Brewery by Hutu
militia that left 35 dead, and 35 others wounded, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Life in Gisenyi was brought to a standstill today with
schools, public offices and businesses shut down.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some residents from the neighboring town
of Goma of the Democratic Republic of Congo joined in the protest
in solidarity with families which lost members in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The protesters were preceded by a train of 15 coffins carrying
25 bodies of the victims which were calcinated when the bus was
set afire by the criminals.
</P>
<P>
The victims were buried this afternoon in a cemetery in
Gisenyi Town.
</P>
<P>
This morning, one man who had had his back badly burnt
succumbed to the burns which affected his lungs, bringing the
casualty figure to 36, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
But one human rights association based in Kigali, however,
indicated that the number of victims had risen to 52 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports indicated today that more bodies continued
to be found in bushes near the site of Monday's ambush, but
failed to give the number.
</P>
<P>
Monday's attack on the Rwandan Brewery bus is one of the many
incidents in which armed Hutu extremists have ambushed vehicles,
killing indiscriminately their passengers before setting them
ablaze.

<HEADLINE> Army Chief: Israel Not to Withdraw From S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel will not pull back its
troops unilaterally from south Lebanon unless the security of
northern Israel is guaranteed, said Israel's top army officer
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops will not leave south Lebanon before any
arrangement is made for the security of the border areas between
Israel and Lebanon, Amnon Shahak, chief of staff of the Israeli
Defense Forces said at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government recently hinted at holding negotiations
with Israel on the security arrangement for the border areas, but
no action has been taken so far, Shahak said.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the Israeli army regards it as a positive move and will
support any such negotiations, he added.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the situation in the security zone in south
Lebanon is not satisfactory due to the resistance of Lebanese
guerrilla forces.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 1,100-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 to allegedly protect its northern areas from
cross-border attacks by Lebanon's guerrilla groups. Lebanese
resistance forces have been fighting ever since to drive out the
Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Referring the regional security situation, Shahak accused Iran,
Iraq and some other countries in the region of adopting hostile
policies toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iran's plan to acquire missile technology poses "a direct
threat" to Israel's security, he said, adding that Israel will
continue to develop the advanced missile system to dwarf the
threat.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the worries of other countries in the region about
the military cooperation between Israel and Turkey, Shahak said
the cooperation is not directed against any third party.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, the Israeli top military
officer said the stalled peace process has led to security
problems in the region.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the Palestinian side for not doing enough in fighting
terrorism, but he welcomed the security cooperation between Israel
and the Palestinian National authority.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Rakes 500,000 Dollars from Mine Licenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia raked 500,000 Dollars
from issuing mine licenses in 1997, Mine and Minerals Development
Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told a news briefing that the government raked 700 million
Kwacha (about 500,000 U.S. Dollars) from issuing 211 small scale
mine licenses and 112 large scale mine licenses last year.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the licenses are for gemstones exploration.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the explorers spend 45 million Dollars in
explorations as compared to 20 million Dollars in 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the amount of money invested in the mining sector
is an indication that the sector is very attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) continues to invest
heavily in the operations and therefore its output increased to
326,000 tons in 1997 compared with 310,000 tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will address the problems that are
hindering the exploration to the full of the gemstone industry by
the small scale miners.
</P>
<P>
The problems includes lack of finance, technology, equipment
and knowledge on marketing strategies, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry will send in the next few weeks some
officials to meet the miners and tackle the issues which were
raised by the miners during the minister's tour of mines.

<HEADLINE> East African Leaders to Meet on Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA (Tanzania), January 21 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda are scheduled to open a summit here on April
28 in a bid to integrate the East African Cooperation (EAC) into
a single market and a political confederation.
</P>
<P>
As part of preparation, a three-day meeting of the EAC High
Level Tripartite Committee started today with a special focus on
how to remove the impediments to the promotion of inter-state
trade, EAC Secretary-General Francis Muthaura told Xinhua in an
exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
"A draft (of an upgraded EAC Treaty) should be ready in the
next one or two months" and be discussed at the coming summit, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The EAC is planning to realize " zero tariff" within itself by
2000 while listing a single currency the first target afterwards,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the three EAC states have narrowed taxation
differences and share the same tariff preference policies
available in COMESA.
</P>
<P>
The three east African countries "are also developing a joint
investment and export promotion strategy" so as to harmonize
their policies to attract more foreign investments, he said,
adding the strategy is expected to be high on the agenda of the
coming summit.
</P>
<P>
Among priorities of further economic integrity are also the
setting-up of a digital transmission network, a database system
and a joint stock exchange, as well as closer cooperation in the
fields of tourism, energy, science research and infrastructure
improvement, according to Muthaura.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EAC is planning a long-term road construction
program under which as long as 12,805 kilometers of road, at a
cost of some 4.67 billion U.S Dollars, will be built within the
region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for more Chinese investment in the region as
China has been playing a more and more active role in the
regional economy over recent years. The region's imports from
China are increasing sharply, he said.

<HEADLINE> British Diplomat on Visa Issue for Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain's decision requiring
Turkish Cypriots to secure entry visas for Britain in Nicosia is
not a step toward recognition of the self-styled Turkish Cypriot
regime, a spokesman for the British High Commission in Cyprus said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Piers Cazalet told Cyprus News Agency that "this is a change
of procedure whereby Turkish Cypriots now have to seek entry
clearance in Nicosia, rather than at their point of entry in
Heathrow or other British airports."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was referring to a British decision last week
that it would end visa-free entry to the holders of Turkish
Cypriot travel documents after processing almost 1,000 unfounded
asylum claims over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The decision "was taken purely on immigration grounds. It is
not politically motivated whatsoever," Cazalet stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said in the past two years Britain has had about 1,000
Turkish Cypriots who applied for political asylum. "This puts an
enormous financial and administrative burden on the British
government which we can no longer bear," he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has reacted furiously
to the British decision, describing it as a deliberate
action.
</P>
<P>
He warned that he would refuse to see Britain's special Cyprus
envoy David Hannay unless London lifts visa requirements for
Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Cazalet noted that Britain had explained to Denktash and to
other Turkish Cypriots the reason behind the decision.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on statements by Denktash that there will be no
more intercommunal talks in Cyprus, the British diplomat said "we
fully support the search for a political settlement in Cyprus
under the U.N. auspices."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the British Foreign Office also reiterated in
London Wednesday that Britain is supporting the U.N. effort for
the solution of the Cyprus problem, and sticks to that policy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the visa measure "is of a technical nature,
without any political importance and is aiming at controlling the
immigration problem."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed Greek Cypriot coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots set up a breakaway "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" in November 1983, recognized only by
Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu-Clinton Talks Spark Different Responses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli, Palestinian
politicians reacted differently Wednesday to the talks held
between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and United
States President Bill Clinton Tuesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Hardliners of the Israeli rightwing coalition lauded Netanyahu
for resisting U.S. pressure to make compromise to the Palestinian
side.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Silvan Shalom of the Netanyahu-led
Likud Party said Netanyahu went to Washington not to give in to
U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
Knesset (parliament) members of the National Religious Party
reiterated their strong opposition to carrying out the proposed
troop pullback in the West Bank, saying Netanyahu must stand
firmly against any U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
The Council for Settlers in the Territories issued a statement
that the settlers are proud of Netanyahu for standing up to
U.S. pressure and defending the interests of the settlers.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held after his talks with Clinton,
Netanyahu claimed the talks have produced some progress but no
major breakthrough. In another speech at the National Press Club
in Washington, he defended Israel's policy of continuing to expand
Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli opposition lawmakers lashed out at Netanyahu
and the rightwing government for failing to push forward the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Decrying the lack of concrete results of the Netanyahu-Clinton
talks, Secretary of the leading opposition Labor Party Ranan Cohen
called for an urgent meeting of Knesset's Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee to discuss Netanyahu's U.S. trip.
</P>
<P>
Labor lawmaker Moshe Shahal said the Washington talks are
doomed to failure from the very start because Netanyahu's hands
have been tightly tied by his hardline coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
He also warned against the escalation of Israeli-Palestinian
conflict due to the continued deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Another opposition leader Yossi Sarid of the Meretz Party said
the failure of the Washington talks has shown that only the
convening of a David Camp-style summit will save the deeply
troubled peace process.
</P>
<P>
In its initial response, the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) criticized the U.S. government for its capitulation to
Netanyahu's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has expressed hope that Clinton will pressure Netanyahu
to soften his tough stand and advance the peace process by
carrying out the long-delayed troop pullback.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Hasan Asfour said since the
Netanyahu-Clinton talks have failed, the Clinton administration
should step up its pressure on Israel now to make progress in the
stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to hold talks with PNA President Yasser
Arafat in a continued effort to narrow the huge gap between Israel
and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said that he has confidence in Clinton to save the
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Technology M&AMP;A Deals up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The value of global
transactions in the technology industry rose 17 percent to 242.8
billion U.S. dollars in 1997, a U.S. firm reported.
</P>
<P>
Deals of mergers and acquisitions in the industry soared 25
percent to 4,040 in 1997 against a 21 percent jump in 1996, the
Wall Street Journal today quoted the New Jersey-based investment
banking firm Broadview Associates as saying.
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies dominated the mergers and acquisitions market
globally, accounting for two-thirds of deals.
</P>
<P>
The software sector saw a steady growth in the M&AMP;A activity,
with 1,287 deals in 1997 valued at 31.5 billion dollars, up from
989 deals valued at 22.4 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The media sector also underwent a sharp increase in the number
of deals, up to 893 transactions valued at 43.1 billion dollars in
1997 from 662 valued at 35 billion dollars in 1996 and 524 valued
at 21.2 billion dollars in 1955.
</P>
<P>
Broadview found that more information technology companies
prefer M&AMP;A to public listing for funding.
</P>
<P>
A total of 202 technology firms went public in 1997 while 1,682
ones chose the M&AMP;A way. In 1996, there were 1,286 M&AMP;A deals, a
fourth of the number of public listings.
</P>
<P>
The 10 largest global transactions in the technology industry
were dominated by telecommunications and hardware deals. The most
noticeable was the merger of WorldCom with MCI communications for
37 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Broadview sees those companies developing technologies to
improve speed of data transmission, especially over the Internet,
to attract more M&AMP;A activities.

<HEADLINE> India Seeks Closer Ties with Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- India is willing to undertake
joint ventures and cooperation with Nigeria in the fields of
telecommunications, space technology, small-scale industry, power
and energy, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
It seems that India has particular interest in cooperation in
space technology with Nigeria as its High Commissioner to
Nigeria, Satinder Uppal, has called on the west African country
to utilize India's satellite recently put in space.
</P>
<P>
Apart from that, Uppal said, his country had also set up a
ground station in South Africa for cooperation in space
technology and mapping of geological data.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Nigerian government has expressed an
intention to send a delegation to India for discussion in this
area.
</P>
<P>
Due to the traditional relations between the two former
British colonies, there are more than 24,000 Indians living in
Nigeria, the biggest foreign community from outside Africa.
</P>
<P>
They have made large investments in the textile,
pharmaceutical, plastics, agriculture, rubber, electrical and
electronics industries, providing employment for many Nigerians,
the envoy said.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 Nigerians have been trained in India over the last
20 years in a variety of fields, he said, adding that 25 percent
or more of the military administrators in Nigeria's 36 states
today have a stint of military training in his country.
</P>
<P>
Under the "very cordial" relations, Nigeria has become India's
biggest trading partner in Africa, with about five percent of
Nigeria's export going to India.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's exports to India, mainly crude oil, put the balance
of trade advantage in Nigeria's favor, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Uppal said, Nigeria is currently Africa's second
largest importer of Indian products, mainly pharmaceuticals,
rice, machinery, equipment and vehicles from India.
</P>
<P>
"We hope in the current Indian financial year ending March 31,
our exports will be a little over 200 million U.S. Dollars," he
said, without giving any further figures.

<HEADLINE> Iran Faces Massive Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran will face a budget deficit
of 20,000 billion Iranian rials (11.4 billion U.S. dollars) in
next Iranian fiscal year (to start from March 21), 150 percent
more than the predicted figure of the current year.
</P>
<P>
This prediction came in an editorial on Wednesday's English
language daily Iran News. The daily attributed this to a decrease
of hard currency revenue caused by oil price fall.
</P>
<P>
Iran's budget is usually a deficit-free one.
</P>
<P>
The daily criticized the country's reliance on oil industry as
too much, saying that "it is high time that we abandoned our high
expectations from an oil-based economy."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Parliament has cut the forecast for oil incomes for
the next fiscal year by 7.5 percent to about 13.8 billion
U.S. dollars from 14.9 billion dollars anticipated by the
government basing on an oil price of 17.5 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament set the oil price at 16 dollars a barrel for the
budget of the new Iranian year. But Iranian crude oil is traded
around 12 dollars at present. Officials believe that the country
can not fetch the projected oil incomes in the new year since oil
prices are not expected to rise.
</P>
<P>
Government officials have urged the Parliament to take
immediate measures to deal with the shortage of money in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Iran had expected 17.7 billion dollars oil revenues in the
current Iranian year basing on an average price of 17.5 dollars a
barrel of Iranian crude oil.
</P>
<P>
But it only earned 10 billion dollars in the first eight months
of the year. Experts said that the total oil revenue would be
around 15 billion dollars with the current oil price, 15.25
percent below the projected figure.
</P>
<P>
At present, Iran exports about 2.5 million barrels per day
(bpd), earning about 80 percent of the country's badly-needed
hard currency.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil production ceiling was raised by 340,000
million bpd to 3.94 million bpd this year according to a decision
by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in last
November.

<HEADLINE> Planes in Nigeria Warned Not to Take Off or Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Airline operators in Nigeria
have been told to stop taking off or landing in bad weather,
especially in the northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Any aircraft which violated the internationally accepted
minimum standard for visibility for landing and taking off shall
be grounded, Minister of Aviation Air Commodore ITA Udo-Imeh
warned.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has since the beginning of this year witnessed poor
visibility caused by thick haze of the Harmattan, a seasonal dry,
dust-laden wind coming from the Sahara up in the north.
</P>
<P>
Scores of air travelers on domestic routes were stranded at
some airports across the country. But there is yet no report on
the interruption of international flights because of weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Nigeria has suffered adverse
consequences of past violations of the standard prescribed by the
International Civil Aviation organization.
</P>
<P>
Lives and material resources were wasted because of
carelessness, he said, adding that his ministry was doing
everything possible to ensure an accident-free year this year.
</P>
<P>
An air tragedy two years ago claimed the life of the eldest
son of the Nigerian Head of State, General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Britain banned Nigerian aircraft from entering its airspace
last May over alleged lack of safety from the Nigerian part,
inviting retaliation from Nigeria with a ban on British aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The face-off remains though Britain lifted the ban three
months later. Negotiations have been reportedly begun between the
two countries to iron out the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Latvia Hopes for Regular Contacts with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Latvian Prime Minister Guntars
Krasts said Wednesday that contacts between Latvian and Russian
officials should become regular, the Interfax news agency reported
from Riga, capital of Latvia.
</P>
<P>
The prime ministers from 11 member-states of the Council of
Baltic Sea States (CBSS) will held a two-day meeting in Riga
Thursday on the development of economic cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Krasts said that when meeting with Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin at the meeting he would draw attention to the
need for developing the legal basis for relations between Latvia
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Riga is ready to sign not only the draft border treaty approved
by the Latvian government last year, but also many economic
agreements with Russia, the Latvian Prime Minister said.
</P>
<P>
Latvia is ready to conclude agreements with Russia on
reciprocal protection of investments, avoidance of double taxation
and air communication, he said.
</P>
<P>
On developing the Latvian-Russian relations Krasts noted Latvia
is interested in mutually beneficial cooperation with its eastern
neighbor. "Positive changes in relations between our countries
have taken place recently, bringing cooperation onto a new level,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Krasts expressed satisfaction with that "Russia recognizes the
Council of Baltic Sea States as an organization that discusses
projects for practical economic cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The three Baltic states on January 16 signed with the United
States a partnership Charter, which disturbed Moscow so much.
Russia holds that it indicates the beginning of preparations for
the next stage of NATO's eastward expansion, since the three
Baltic states refuse to accept the security guarantees proposal by
the Russian president.

<HEADLINE> More Americans Willing to Donate Organs: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Americans are increasingly
designating themselves as organ donors, a survey found.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based National Kidney Foundation (NKF), which
released the survey report today, said 55 percent of whites
surveyed and one third of blacks and Hispanics plan to be organ
donors.
</P>
<P>
These numbers are up from one third and one quarter
respectively in 1992 when NKF conducted a similar opinion poll.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey of 1,200 randomly selected individuals also
shows that people with children are slightly more likely to be
organ donors than those with no children under 19.
</P>
<P>
A poll of transplant recipients and physicians indicated a high
level of support for anumal-to-human transplantation or
xenotransplantation among these groups, NKF said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Americans are aware of the shortage of available
organs for transplant and accept the concept of
zenotransplantation.
</P>
<P>
There are about 53,000 Americans currently awaiting life-saving
transplants and ten people dying each day while waiting.
</P>
<P>
However, it was found that at least half of the transplant
physicians surveyed are willing to give xenotransplantation 10
years or more before it is required to show success, NKF said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Sends Farming Inputs for Coming Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural inputs needed
for this year's harvest seasons are being distributed to the
various regions in the country, the Agricultural Inputs Supply
Enterprise of Ethiopia announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Manager of the enterprise Sewinet Tizazu told local
journalists that the enterprise has so far procured 140,000 tons
of fertilizers as part of its plan to import 230,000 tons this
year.
</P>
<P>
The fertilizer is being distributed to areas that produce in
the small rainy season from February to May, Sewinet said, adding
that it has been transported to the northern Amhara and Tigray
regions directly from the port.
</P>
<P>
She said, the fertilizer to be utilized for the year would
reach the hinterland until the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise will supply 75 percent of the 360,000 tons of
fertilizer the country needs and the remaining will be procured
by private importers, she added.
</P>
<P>
According to the manager, the enterprise has earmarked 600
million Birr (about 87 million U.S. Dollars) for the purchase of
agricultural inputs this year.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia had a record crop harvest of 11.7 million tons in
1996. However, crop production sharply declined last year due to
drought and untimely rains in some parts of the country.

ANKARA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Constitutional Court
Wednesday rejected an appeal for the cancellation of the law which
orders the closure of casinos by February 11, semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The high court turned down the application, filed by certain
civil courts for the annulment of an article in the law no. 4320,
amending the Law on Encouragement of Tourism.

Judge Guven Dincer said in a statement following the court
session that the unconstitutional claim was rejected by a vote of

In their application, the local courts maintained that the law
did not conform with the principles of equality and was against
the freedom of labor.
</P>
<P>
According to the controversial law, which was officially

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Europe to Catch Up in Satellite Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, today urged Europe to catch
up in the race to develop and exploit state-of-art global
navigation satellite systems.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive today approved a strategic plan to ensure a
full European role in the development of Global Navigation
Satellite Systems (GNSS).
</P>
<P>
"The market is developing so fast that we need to develop now a
strategy for the future. In this technology, late in will mean
Europe is locked out of a market estimated to be worth 50 billion
dollars by 2005," said EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the EU still needed to decide whether to do it
alone or to cooperate with its international partners and that
cooperation under right conditions should be greatly preferred.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said the plan was aimed at a full European
role in system development and operation, guarantees of adequate
control of satellite signals and the opportunity for European
industry to compete on equal terms.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of today's decision, the commission will ask the
European Council of Transport Ministers and the European
Parliament to endorse this strategic plan.
</P>
<P>
Satellite navigations systems can be used to track dangerous
goods, identify fishing grounds, locate ship wrecks, enhance air
traffic control, guide blind people or advise drivers about
hazardous or congested roads.
</P>
<P>
But the two existing global systems -- GPS and GLONASS -- were
developed for military purposes and remain under the control of
the United States and Russia respectively.
</P>
<P>
A European system known as EGNOS, under development by the
European Space Agency and the air traffic control management
center Eurocontrol, is set to be in operation from 2000.

ADDIS ABABA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Over 630 Ethiopian
refugees who had been in neighboring Sudan for years due to the
then ravaging war and droughts in their homeland, have returned
home.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today from Humera,
Ethiopia's north-western town near its border with Sudan, the
returnees, after a day's stay in Humera, have been transported to
camps in Gondar and Endasellassie in the north.

The transport was carried out with the support of the
Organization for Rehabilitation and Development in Amhara region,
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the
Administration for Refugees and Returnees Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Each refugee family will receive 1,000 Birr (about 145 U.S.
Dollars), nine-month ration, blanket and utensils before leaving
for their respective localities, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,500 Ethiopian refugees have returned to their homeland
from Sudan through Humera since December 15, 1997. The Ethiopian

LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Republican Army issued
a statement today to reject the joint peace process document
tabled by the British and Irish governments last week.

The statement faxed to the BBC in Belfast said "responsibility

It said Prime Minister Tony Blair has "succumbed to the Orange

It added the IRA does "not regard the propositions... as the

Sinn Fein, the political wing of IRA which is against the

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis Brings Impact to Most Regions of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Most regions of the United
States now are feeling the impact of Asia's financial and economic
crisis, with the U.S. manufacturers reporting weakened demand from
Asia, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The impact of Asian financial turmoil was felt in most
districts," the Federal Reserve noted in its survey of economic
conditions by its 12 regional banks. "Manufacturers and
agricultural firms report weaker exports to Asia, and there is
some evidence of increased competition from Asian products in U.S.
markets."
</P>
<P>
The latest report, based on information collected through
January 11, indicates more widespread effects from the Asian
currency crises than the previous survey, released on January 3,
which had the first anecdotal hints of fallout.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian financial turmoil started to have some impact on
manufacturing activity," the latest report said. "Some districts
reported weaker export demand for industrial equipment, building
materials, aircraft parts, semiconductors, processed food and some
metals."
</P>
<P>
However, the Fed also said, "the pace of economic growth
continued to be moderate" and "labor markets remained tight or
very tight in all districts."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that qualified workers are in such short supply
in some fields, including computer-related workers, skilled
construction workers and technicians, that some firms scaled back
production or expansion plans, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
"A company in Nashville was forced to idle more than 10 percent
of its equipment due to labor shortages. In the Chicago district,
some projects were canceled due to a lack of labor, while in the
St. Louis district some contacts were unable to meet production
schedules," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The shortages are resulting in some upward pressure on wages,
but "prices were generally flat due to intense competition and
lower import prices."
</P>
<P>
Rising wages for retail jobs were noted in the Boston and
Richmond regions, while Boston said manufacturers were offering
double-digit increases to engineers.
</P>
<P>
"Most districts suggested that employers continued to be
creative in finding and recruiting additional labor," the report
said. "Some companies were subsidizing transportation for
employees located far away from work sites. Employers in several
districts adopted flexible work schedules and more generous
benefit packages."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Police in Angola have
discovered more than 1,000 weapons and ammunition hidden in
caches by Angola's former rebel UNITA movement, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police said the arms were found at Milunga in the northern
Uije province. The stockpiles were created for militiamen of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), who
recently handed Milunga back to government forces in line with a
1994 peace pact.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this month, three other arms inventories
as well as mass graves, were found at Sanza Pombo in Uije
province.
</P>
<P>
The area was for a long time a stronghold of opposition UNITA
during its war against the government forces after independence
from Portugal in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the two sides finally signed political and
military peace protocols in Lusaka, capital of Zambia in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The treaties were endorsed under the auspices of the United
Nations, which is monitoring implementation of the agreement in
the war-ravaged southern African country.

BRUSSELS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union's executive body, said today that it was planning
to end age limits on its civil servant exams.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said in a statement Wednesday that as the first
step, it would allow job seekers up to age 45 to sit for exams for
the basic civil service grades. The age limit used to be 32 or
35.
</P>
<P>
Noting that its age restrictions have been accused of being
"discriminatory and arbitrary", the Commission said it was going
to use the increased power given by new amendments to the EU
treaty to fight age discriminations.
</P>
<P>
"The European Commission today approved in principle ending of
age limits for admission to its competitions for recruitment," it
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, it also said that it would do it gradually and in
coordination with other EU institutions.
</P>
<P>
Erkki Liikanen, EU commissioner responsible for personnel
matters, has been leading the efforts to completely end the age
restrictions.
</P>

But other officials have expressed concern about issues such as
career development, pension plans and recruitment policy, said his
spokeswoman.

TEHRAN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Wednesday called on two regional organizations to use
their influences to end the ongoing massacres in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, Kharrazi
sent two separate letters to Secretary General of the Arab League
Esmat Abdel-Meguid and Secretary General of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) Salem Ahmad Salem, voicing his concern about
the continuing massacres of civilians in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
In his letters, Kharrazi said that massacres of civilians in
Algeria had caused deep regret and concern in Arab, Islamic and
African nations, prompting every responsible government to offer
every possible assistance for an immediate halt to the unprovoked
killings in that country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the cooperation of regional organizations would
obviously help end the massacres in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Iran, as chairman of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) is ready and willing to offer every
possible assistance for curbing bloodshed in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Following the massacre of over 400 people in Algeria in recent
weeks, Kharrazi has contacted with foreign ministers of Italy,
Syria, Morocco, Greece and France and sent letters to heads of
several international organizations including U.N Secretary
General Kofi Annan, calling for international efforts to put an
end to the Algerian tragedy.

<HEADLINE> AL Denounces US for Arming Israel With F-15Is </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) Wednesday
criticized Washington for providing Israel with advanced F-15I war
jets as baring its bias towards the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. move is contradicting the principle of neutrality the
U.S. ought to adhere to as a main sponsor of the Mideast peace
process," said AL Assistant Secretary General Ahmed bin Holei.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency, Holei voiced regret
over the step to beef up the Israeli air force when Washington is
renewing its mediation efforts to end the 10-month-old deadlock in
the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In what many see as a make-or-break attempt to save the peace
process, U.S. President Bill Clinton held talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the White House Tuesday and will
meet with Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Beating a pessimistic note, the Arab League official said
nothing more can be expected from the Washington meetings.
</P>
<P>
"The general mood is that the meetings are expected to fail in
view of the Israeli Likud government's insistence on closing all
doors to advancing the stalled Mideast peace drive," he said.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on the Palestinian track hit a deadlock after
Israel began to build a new settlement in Arab East Jerusalem
last March and a spate of suicide bombings followed.
</P>
<P>
Israel has purchased 25 U.S.-made F-15I war planes. The arrival
of the first two of them in Israel Monday has prompted fear among
the Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The F-15I planes, with a range of at least 4,500 kilometers, are
among the fastest warplanes in the world. It can fly at double the
speed of sound carrying 11 tonnes of missiles and bombs. They
enable Israel to strike targets as far as Iraq, Iran and Libya
without refueling.
</P>
<P>
Israel now possesses 90 F-15 planes, 112 Phantoms (F-4), 160
F-16 Falcons and 94 Israeli Kafir planes, and are seeking more,
according to local strategic experts.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a reconnaissance squadron of 24 Phantoms and
four early warning planes, Israel has two tanker planes to refuel
planes in the air and 22 Hercules transport planes. There are also
96 Skyhawks in store.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Wednesday received at the
Red Sea port of Aqaba a new shipment of military equipment as part
of the 300 million U.S. dollars military aid pledged by the
U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The military equipment included M60-A3 tanks, M110 Howitzer
canons, spare parts for helicopters, armored personnel carriers
and various ammunition, Jordan's official news agency Petra
reported.
</P>

The new shipment was part of the military aid program offered
by the U.S. after Jordan's signing of the peace treaty with
Israel in 1994 to help develop the kingdom's military
capabilities, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to assure you all that this equipment will be
used professionally by Jordanian soldiers with pride to enhance
the defense capabilities of our country on the road to peace and
stability and to defend our country's progress and achievements,"
said Tahseen Shurdum, Chief of Staff of the Royal Land Forces at
the ceremony held at the Aqaba port.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Probes Assets of Banned Welfare Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish authorities are
investigating the assets of the recently banned pro-Islamic
Welfare Party (RP) both at home and abroad, semi-official Anatolia
News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry officials began procedures just after the
decision to authorize the ministry to investigate the RP's assets
was officially published Monday, according to the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The ministry had already completed the groundwork on the probe
into RP's assets since the decision to shut down the party was
announced last Friday by the Constitutional Court, said the news
agency.
</P>
<P>
It added that the investigation will also involve cooperation
with the interior and justice ministries.
</P>
<P>
Provincial administrations all over the country will set up
commissions to confiscate all inventories of the local RP offices,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
If any evidence of possible RP's overseas assests is
discovered, the commission will send inspectors to the concerned
countries to carry out a probe.
</P>
<P>
The RP was closed on charges of its violation of the secular
principles of the country.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Confident of Technical Evaluation Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said Wednesday that he has strong confidence that the
results of the forthcoming technical evaluation meetings will be
in favor of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remarks at a news conference after his talks with
United Nations chief arms inspector Richard Butler who has
left here for Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Aziz proposed a freeze on the discussion of
the access to the presidential palaces and other sensitive sites
of the U.N. arms inspectors until the results of technical
meetings, which are scheduled to be held on February 1, come out.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the participation of arms experts from the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council or other countries
in the inspection will help both sides to reach conclusion about
"where we stand."
</P>
<P>
He said Russia and France will increase the number of experts
for the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), and that China has
decided for the first time to join the mission of the UNSCOM,
which he described as good development to make the composition of
the UNSCOM balanced.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been accusing the Americans and the Britons of
dominating the work of the UNSCOM, which is responsible for
verifying the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that 112 visits have been made by the arms inspectors
in the past 19 months to sensitive sites, during which they have
used very sophisticated instruments, but have not found any
prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the main reason that UNSCOM's inspectors
want to enter the presidential sites is for espionage, not for
disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Air Force Jets Force down UNITA Cargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A South African airplane was
forced down near Menongue, a city in southwestern Angola Tuesday
by the Angolan air force for transporting cargo for the former
rebel UNITA movement, an air force official said today.
</P>
<P>
Francisco Lopes, the official in charge of operation in
Angola's air force, told a press conference in Menongue that
Angola's fighter jets and bombers had to confront the plane which
had intruded into the country's southwestern territorial space at
11:00 GMT Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations indicated that the private plane
had been transporting cargo for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Peter Bitzker, the 37-year-old pilot for the South African
plane, told Xinhua that he was a pilot for private planes and had
been working for many companies.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, he said, he had flown many times to
transport cargo and ammunition for UNITA. Only six months ago,
he had flown weapons for UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The plane had flown form South Africa via Botswana to Andulo,
a central Angolan city where one of UNITA's headquarters is
located. When it was forced down by the air force, it was merely
200 km away from the destination.
</P>
<P>
The eight people on board the plane include three crew members
and five passengers. One of them disclosed that there were
military coaches among them who are expected to train UNITA
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the eight people have been detained in a
military camp near Luanda for further interrogation.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. security Council passed a resolution in October 1997
to impose sanctions on the former rebel movement. However, there
were still reports of violations of the embargo, over which the
Angolan government has expressed its indignation, said Lopes.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the Angolan air force stopped and
forced down such planes.

<HEADLINE> IBM's Shares Drop Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The stock of the International
Business Machines Corp (IBM) dropped 7 percent today after the
computer giant warned that its fourth-quarter profit would fall
short because of the continued negative impact of a strong dollar,
weak Asia markets and several one-time expenses.
</P>
<P>
IBM shares were down 7.75 U.S. dollars a share, or 7.2 percent,
in early afternoon trading. It was the investor's first chance to
react to the financial warning, issued after the close of the
markets Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IBM's warning also led Dow Jones industrial average down
today. At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow average was down 108.36
at 7,764.76, nearly wiping out Tuesday's 119-point climb.
</P>
<P>
IBM's 1997 fourth-quarter net income rose to 2.1 billion
dollars, or 2.11 dollars per diluted share, just below analyst
estimates. Revenue was 23.7 billion U.S. dollars, up 3 percent
from 23.1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Revenue from Asia was flat at 4.4 billion U.S. dollars. If not
for the Asia crisis, revenue would have risen 10 percent, IBM
says.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1997, IBM earned 6.1 billion U.S. dollars on 78.5
billion U.S. dollars in revenue, up 3.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Buy 26 Boeings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Airlines (THY)
signed a credit agreement with U.S. Eximbank and Boeing company
Wednesday to buy 26 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the 2.5 billion-dollar agreement, the 85 percent of the
deal will be met by loans of the Eximbank and the remaining 15
percent by the Turkish Treasury.
</P>
<P>
Boeing will deliver the first batch of the jets in July and the
last by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
The THY made the deal in order to further promote its
competitive capacity on the world civil aviation market, a THY
official said.
</P>
<P>
With the new injection, the THY would gradually phase out some
of its aged Boeing 737-400, 37-500 and RJ-100 jetliners over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
The THY now has a fleet of 65 aircraft.
