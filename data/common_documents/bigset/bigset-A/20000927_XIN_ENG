During the second meeting of the Indo-U.S. Joint Working Group
(JWG) on Counter-terrorism held here on Tuesday, India conveyed
its serious concern over Pakistan's sustained attempts at
sponsoring cross-border terrorism in the name of "Jehad" (holy war)
, said the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed during the meeting that inter-agency teams from
both countries would share experience, exchange information and
coordinate approaches and action to deal with the menace of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides unequivocally condemned all acts, methods and
practices of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, whatever the
considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial,
ethnic, religious, or any other nature that may be involved to
justify them," a joint statement issued at the end of the talks
said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side welcomes further anti-terrorism assistance
programs from the U.S., the specifics of which will be determined
later, and the increased levels of counter-narcotics training and
assistance from the U.S., an Indian foreign office official was
quoted by the PTI as saying.
</P>
<P>
The head of the U.S. delegation, U.S. Coordinator for Counter-
terrorism Michael A. Sheehan told the local press here that the U.
S. was in the process of setting up an office of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in New Delhi.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Victory over Netherlands Boost for Asian Hockey: Former Olympians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's victory over the
Netherlands in their Olympics field hockey match at Sydney signals
a revival of Asian hockey, former Pakistani Olympians said in
Karachi on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great boost for Asian hockey and it will help promote
the game in Pakistan in particular and in Asia in general," said
Abdul Waheed Khan, a member of Pakistan's gold medal winning team
in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan eliminated the defending Olympic champions, the
Netherlands, 2-0 to earn a semi-final berth against South Korea
who defeated India on the basis of the league match result between
the two teams.
</P>
<P>
Australia take on the Netherlands -- who were given a second
life after Britain's stunning 2-1 win against Germany -- in the
other semi-final.
</P>
<P>
No Asian team has made it through to the semi-finals in the
Atlanta Olympics in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Anwar Ahmed Khan, who was also in the victorious 1960 Pakistani
team, said Pakistan's win "is a gift for Asia."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was the last Asian country to win the Olympic title at
the Los Angelese Games in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Former coach Hanif Khan said: "Its time the Asian nations plan
together, Asia can counter European nations because this is the
game we ruled for years."

<HEADLINE> Likud Leader's Planned Visit to Temple Mount Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) on Wednesday vehemently denounced the planned visit
to the Temple Mount by Ariel Sharon, leader of the Israeli right-
wing Likud party, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement distributed to the mass media, the PLC termed
this "provocative visit" at this sensitive stage as a blatant
violation of Islamic sanctities and an insult to the feelings of
the Palestinians and Arab and Muslim nation.
</P>
<P>
It said that Sharon's visit to the site, which hosts various
Islamic holy spots such as the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa
Mosque, would escalate tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
The PLC held the Israeli government responsible for the
potential negative impacts of the visit, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Israeli government to cancel the visit so as to
avoid aggravation of the situation and boost peace between the
Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The PLC also appealed to Arab and Muslim nations for their
solidarity in defending the cause of Jerusalem and restoration of
their legitimate rights, including the return of Palestinian
refugees, self-determination and an independent Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Attorney General Decides to Drop Charges Against Netanyahu EDS-1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Attorney General
Elyakim Rubinstein announced Wednesday evening that he has decided
to drop all criminal charges against former Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The ruling cleared the way for Netanyahu to return to the
spotlight after his short "time-out" from the political arena in
the wake of last year's humiliating general election defeat by
incumbent Prime Minister Barak.
</P>
<P>
According to Justice Ministry official, Rubinstein made the
decision to close the file because he found no sufficient evidence
to prove the underlying foundations of all the criminal charges
against Netanyahu, including bribery, grand larceny, fraud, breach
of trust and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided to close the file against Mr. Netanyahu
concerning the suspicions attributed to him because of insufficient
evidence for a criminal trial," Rubinstein said.
</P>
<P>
The allegations against Netanyahu began last October when
Israeli media revealed that he had attempted to pass on to the
state a bill of 440,000 shekels (about 100,000 U.S. dollars) he
received from Jerusalem contractor Avner Amedi, although the work
was done for his family privately and the government should not
have paid for it.
</P>
<P>
During the ensuing investigation, the police also found that
Netanyahu had taken some 700 gifts with him when he left the prime
minister's official residence. These gifts, which he received in
his capacity as prime minister, should be turned in to the state
according to the law.
</P>
<P>
In March, the police finished their investigation and
recommended indicting Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
However, Jerusalem District Attorney Moshe Lador, who was
directly handling the case, decided in June that the case should be
closed without indictment after discovering contradictions in the
testimony of Amedi, who had been turned state's witness against
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In a 22-page document released Wednesday evening, Rubinstein
elaborated his detailed reasons for finally accepting Lador's
argument and closing the case.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the charge that Netanyahu tried to get the state to
pay a private bill, Rubinstein wrote that it could not be "
conclusively established" that Netanyahu knew that Amedi's bill
consisted of the private work in addition to the work Amedi did for
him in his official capacity as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the charges of disruption of judicial procedures,
Rubinstein wrote that it could not be conclusively established that
Netanyahu had intentions to cover up his crime when he met with
Amedi following the publication of an investigative report on the
affair.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Rubinstein censured Netanyahu's conduct in the
affair. Netanyahu should have told officials in the Prime
Minister's Office immediately that he owed a private debt to Amedi,
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
All these misconducts, however, did not reach criminal
proportions, concluded Rubinstein.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rubinstein reportedly also cleared Netanyahu's wife,
Sarah, and two former officials in Netanyahu's Office, Moshe Leon
and Ezra Seidoff, of respective charges related to this case.
</P>
<P>
The ruling made Netanyahu's comeback possible. Recent public
opinion polls, including one released Wednesday morning, showed
that Netanyahu would finish in a dead heat with Barak if early
elections were held.
</P>
<P>
As Barak's government only holds one-third seats in the 120-
member Knesset (parliament), most analysts predicted an early-
election is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Such a prospect prompted Likud Knesset faction chairman Reuven
Rivlin to press Netanyahu to make an immediate decision over
returning to politics.
</P>
<P>
"I urge Benjamin Netanyahu, if he wants to come back and end the
time-out he chose for himself, to return to activity immediately
and put an end to this whispering campaign and to the postponement
that can cause the Likud grave trouble," Rivlin told Israeli Army
Radio on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who is currently abroad and will not return to Israel
until Thursday, has not responded to the call. But he is expected
to make a formal announcement before the start of Jewish New Year
on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996 general elections, Netanyahu, as Likud's candidate,
defeated Labor candidate Shimon Peres by a delicate margin and
assumed the premiership.
</P>
<P>
However, due to his negative attitude toward the peace process
with Arab states and his too obvious political petty tricks behind
his friends and enemies' back, his governing collapsed only three
years later and he was easily defeated by the left-wing Barak in an
early election in May 1999.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Tourism Expands Despite Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government said
Wednesday that the country's tourist industry had made a good
performance despite the odds caused by the past civil wars.
</P>
<P>
The country received a total of 331,000 tourists in 1999,
Rwanda News Agency quoted officials with the Ministry of Commerce,
Tourism and Industry as saying on the World Tourism Day that falls
on September 27.
</P>
<P>
Describing the figure "quite impressive", the officials said
that number of the tourists would see a further increase this year.
</P>
<P>
But lack of skilled professionals, and infrastructures, as well
as the past civil wars posed threats to the further growth of the
industry, cautioned the Director of tourism of the ministry,
Emmanuel Werabe.
</P>
<P>
The war and genocide in 1994 virtually wiped out the tourist
infrastructures, and badly damaged the country's image, said
Werabe.
</P>
<P>
Our national parks which had always constituted attraction
sites by excellence lost their commercial character for various
reasons, said Werabe.
</P>
<P>
However, speaking at a ceremony to mark the World Tourism Day,
the country's Minister of Commerce, Tourism and Industry Alexandre
Lyambabaje said that Rwanda is till an attractive destination for
tourists, despite the odds.
</P>
<P>
Among these include mountain gorillas which you can never
easily see anywhere in the world except Rwanda, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda also shares some picturesque volcanic mountains on the
border with Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, said
Lyambabaje.

<HEADLINE> UN Human Settlement Center Warns Against Social Exclusion in Urban Governance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Center for Human Settlements (UNCHS-Habitat) has warned that good
urban governance can not be achieved if cities continue to
generate social exclusion, denying the benefits to the poor
marginalized groups.
</P>
<P>
Briefing journalists here on Wednesday on Habitat's global
campaign for good governance and the campaign for secure tenure,
the executive director of the center, Anna Tibaijuka, said good
urban governance calls for partnership whereby people participate
and agree on how things should be done.
</P>
<P>
"If part of your population are excluded, you can't boast of
good urban governance," said the Habitat chief.
</P>
<P>
"This process requires training, capacity and a mechanism to do
away with social exclusion," Tibaijuka explains.
</P>
<P>
Involvement of the private sector is also crucial in resolving
urban problems, she said, but the problems in urban centers cannot
be solved if the citizens themselves are not accountable.
</P>
<P>
Tibaijuka, who had earlier made a familiarization tour of
Habitat projects here, commended the Tanzanian government for its
good performance in finding mechanisms to check social exclusion.
</P>
<P>
She cited the new Land Act as one of the major achievements
made so far to ensure the benefits to be shared by the
marginalized groups, particularly women.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, who said Yugoslav voters want change, voiced his hope
Wednesday that the election would produce a democratic government.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here through Annan's spokesman said, "In his
view, the election results demonstrate a clear wish on the part of
the voters of the FRY (the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) for
genuine change."
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general has been following with close interest
the developments in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," the
statement said. "The secretary-general hopes that the election
will result in a government with a clear mandate, with which an
open and honest dialogue will be possible, and that the problems
of the region will be addressed in the spirit of cooperation
rather than confrontation."
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Federal Election Commission has said a second-
round election is needed because neither President Slobodan
Milosevic or his challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, won more than 50
percent of the votes needed for outright victory.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A former godfather of the
Marseilles gangsters was shot dead in a gambling club in central
Paris Wednesday afternoon in an apparent settlement of accounts,
said police.
</P>
<P>
Francis Vanverberghe, 56, also known as "the Belgian," was
spilled with a rain of bullets when he was sitting at a gambling
table of "L'Artois Club's" gambling store located on a small
street near the Champs-Elysee.
</P>
<P>
One gunman entered the club and emptied all the charges of his
11.43 minimeter-caliber automatic pistol, shooting nine bullets in
the head and chest of Vanverberghe.
</P>
<P>
The killer and his accomplice immediately fled the scene with a
motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the 11.43 minimeter-caliber shotgun was
exclusively used by gangsters to settle accounts among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Vanverberghe used to be a leader of Marseilles gangsters but he
"retired" years ago and since then had lived with his wife in an
apartment near Champs-Elysee.
</P>
<P>
He was detained by police for two months this year for illegal
pimping as he was suspected to have drawn profits from an
underground bar near his home.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Supports Recommendations on Peacekeeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Wednesday expressed its support for the
general thrust of the recommendations on the peacekeeping
operations made by a U.N. panel.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was briefed on the recommendations today
by Louise Frechette, U.N. deputy secretary-general, and Lakhdar
Brahimi, head of the panel on U.N. peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council expressed determination to take
final decisions on them as quickly as possible and agreed to
establish a working group to take this work forward.
</P>
<P>
The council agreed that the mandates of U.N. peacekeeping
operations must be clear, credible and achievable.
</P>
<P>
The council emphasized the need to improve the Secretariat's
ability to provide accurate, timely, frank and comprehensive
information and analysis.
</P>
<P>
The council agreed on the critical need to ensure that
peacekeeping missions are deployed rapidly with necessary levels
of qualified, equipped and well-supported personnel, with a
unified chain of command and clear rules of engagement.
</P>
<P>
In its report presented to the Security Council on August 23,
the panel recommended extensive restructuring of the Department of
Peacekeeping Operations, a new information and analysis unit to
serve all United Nations departments concerned with peace and
security, an integrated task force at headquarters to plan and
support each peacekeeping mission from its inception and more
systematic use of information technology.
</P>
<P>
Chaired by Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister,
the panel was established early this year at the request of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

<HEADLINE> Panama Expels Montesinos' Bodyguards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian government
expelled from the country seven bodyguards of former Peruvian
presidential advisor Vladimiro Montesinos, according to a
Panamanian Foreign Ministry's press release published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The press release says that on Tuesday the immigration
department canceled the tourist visas of the Peruvian bodyguards
and ordered them to leave the Panamanian territory within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
These Peruvians arrived in Panama on Sunday a few hours after
Vladimiro Montesinos, former Peruvian presidential advisor and
Peruvian intelligence chief, asked the Panamanian government for
political asylum.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government refused at first to grant Montesinos
political asylum, but afterward offered him temporary territorial
asylum because of the requests from heads of state and of
government of several Latin American countries and the United
States, as well as from Cesar Gaviria, secretary-general of the
Organization of American States (OAS).
</P>
<P>
Montesinos, President Alberto Fujimori's main advisor, bribed
an opposition parliamentarian to defect to the ruling party so
that the president could control the Congress.
</P>
<P>
However, all the bribing process was recorded on video and
later broadcast by the "N" cable television channel in a 56-minute
video clip.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian opposition considered this scandal as one more
proof of the electoral fraud of the last general elections and
ordered Montesinos detention, who fled the country and arrived in
Panama to dodge the judicial authorities of his country.

KUWAIT CITY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The epidemic Rift Valley
Fever (RVF) has killed 33 people in Saudi Arabia as the number of
people infected by the disease rose to 160, Saudi Ministry of
Health said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 30 people have recovered from the disease and left
hospital, the ministry said, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
RVF, first identified in Kenya in 1930, began to hit the
southern Saudi city of Jizan, near the border with Yemen, early
this month. The symptoms of the disease are very high fever,
extensive blood diarrhoea and dysfunction of kidneys.
</P>
<P>
The killer disease was believed to have been brought into Saudi
Arabia through cattles imported from Africa.
</P>
<P>
As isolated cases were also reported in other parts of the
kingdom, Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz has ordered concerned
authorities to intensify efforts to contain and eradicate the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,500 Saudi officials and 150 teams of veterinarians are
taking part in the anti-RVF campaign.
</P>
<P>
Several cabinet ministers have also begun field tours in the
affected areas for inspection.

<HEADLINE> Legal Ruling on Netanyahu to Come out Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Attorney General
Elyakim Rubinstein had decided to announced his decision whether or
not to drop all criminal charges against former Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday evening, Justice Ministry officials
declared a short while ago.
</P>
<P>
The announcement had been slated for noon Thursday. However
Rubinstein has to bring it forward to 19:30 p.m. local time (16:30
GMT) Wednesday evening because of wide medial leaks that the
Netanyahu case will be closed without indictment.
</P>
<P>
The ministry official refused to reveal any further details.
</P>
<P>
The allegations against Netanyahu began last October when
Israeli media revealed that he attempted to pass on to the state a
440,000 shekels (about 100,000 U.S. dollars) bill he received from
Jerusalem contractor Avner Amedi, although the work was done for
his family privately and the government should not have paid for
it.
</P>
<P>
During the ensuing investigation, the police also found that
Netanyahu had took some 700 gifts with him when he left the prime
minister's official residence. These gifts, which he received in
his capacity as prime minister, should be turned in to the state
according to the law.
</P>
<P>
In March, the police finished their investigation and
recommended indicting Netanyahu on accounts of accepting a bribe,
grand larceny, fraud, breach of trust, and obstructing of justice.
</P>
<P>
However, Jerusalem District Attorney Moshe Lador, who was
directly handling the case, decided in June that the case should be
closed without indictment after discovering contradictions in the
testimony of Amedi, who had been turned state's witness against
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported late Tuesday night that after several
months' weighing, Rubinstein finally decided to accept Lador's
argument and close the case.
</P>
<P>
If this is true, the ruling would clear the way for Netanyahu to
return to the spotlight, after his short "time-out" from the
political arena in the wake of last year's humiliating general
election defeat by the incumbent Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
As Barak's government only holds one-third seats in the 120-
member Knesset (parliament), most analysts predicted an early-

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy: No Peace Without Agreement on Syrian-Israeli Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's Middle
East peace envoy Miguel Moratinos said here Wednesday that there
would be no peace in the Middle East unless a peace agreement is
reached on the Syrian-Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos made the remark after his talks with Syrian Foreign
Minister Faruk Shareh Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said his talks with Shareh focussed on relations between the
EU and Syria under the new Syrian leadership of President Bashar
al-Assad, who came to power in June.
</P>
<P>
The EU supports the new Syrian leadership as Syria is an
important party in the Middle East, he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU seeks to revive Syrian-Israeli negotiations in a bid to
reach a comprehensive peace in the region, said Moratinos, pointing
to attempts by both parties to resume two-way negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and Syria resumed in December in the
United States after an impasse of almost four years, but broke down
only weeks later in disputes over the fate of the Golan Heights,
which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said he would also meet with the Syrian president
before leaving for Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The European envoy arrived in Damascus Wednesday morning on a
short visit to Syria.

NICOSIA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot police on Tuesday
night seized 35 kilograms of good-quality cocaine, with a street
value of over 4 million Cypriot pounds (6.4 million U.S. dollars),
Cyprus News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The police are in contact with the Interpol to determine the
whereabouts of the suspects behind the cocaine trafficking case,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
The drugs were found in cartons in a warehouse in Ypsonas near
the southern port town of Limassol.
</P>
<P>
It is believed the drugs were brought to Cyprus in a container
which arrived on September 2 from Haifa, Israel, and were to be
shipped to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Police and customs authorities are carrying out investigations
to determine whether there are more drugs in the customs.
</P>
<P>
Police said this was the largest amount of cocaine ever found on
the island, which indicates that there is an organized gang of
criminals behind the case.
</P>
<P>
The container, which came from a Latin American country, had
passed through several countries before arriving in Cyprus, police
said, without disclosing further details.

The delegation is to discuss with Lebanese authorities whether
266 illegal immigrants that arrived on the island earlier this
month came from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, headed by Interior Ministry Permanent Secretary
Kyriacos Triantafyllides and comprising police deputy chief
Nathanel Papageorgiou and Foreign Ministry officers, is expected to
stay in Lebanon for two days.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Cyprus News Agency, the delegation
will hand over more evidence and information to prove that the
illegal immigrants, mainly Pakistanis and Kurds, came to Cyprus
from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The 266 illegal immigrants were rescued from a sunk boat off
Cyprus' western coast on September 13. They are now being held at a
ship off the southern town of Limassol.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government insists that the illegal immigrants
should be sent back to Lebanon according to an agreement signed
between the two countries last year that envisages the return of
illegal immigrants to the country from which they sail.
</P>
<P>
But the Lebanese government is still disputing evidence that the
illegal immigrants came from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot authorities said they have evidence, including a
testimony from the boat's captain who had been arrested, and
photographs to prove their claim.

<HEADLINE> System Exists for Government Formation: Lebanese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
said Wednesday there is an explicit system in the process of
government formation, the official NNA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud said consultations with newly-elected parliament members
on the premiership will also go on in line with the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent government led by Prime Minister Salim Hoss will
resign on October 17 when the new parliament is formed.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese constitution stipulates that the post of prime minister
is set for a Sunni Muslim who is designated by the president and
must get the nod of two thirds of the parliament members.
</P>
<P>
After the conclusion of the general elections in August, Lahoud
has talked with dozens of deputies on the new government,
especially the premiership. He repeatedly announced that he "has
the same distance with all candidates."
</P>
<P>
But former billionaire prime minister Rafik Hariri was seen by
local press as the "sole" candidate to head the new government.
</P>
<P>
Hariri scored a landslide victory in the just-ended elections.
He and his allies took 65 seats in the 128-seat parliament. But he
has been at odds with Lahoud, since he resigned the premiership in
1998 after Lahoud was elected president.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Speaker Nabih Berri said the new government
must have political reconciliation. "We hope the new authority can
carry out social and economic policies to solve the current
problems in our countries," said the Shiite Muslim politician.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that the formation of the new government will
be clear after October 10.
</P>
<P>
In order to gain enough support in the parliament, Hariri has to
deal with various political sections and allocate several posts for
each of them in the government as a price.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Plane in Iraq to Show Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A Jordanian plane carrying a
75-member delegation arrived in the Iraqi capital Wednesday evening
on a visit to show solidarity with the sanctions-hit country.
</P>
<P>
This was the first plane from an Arab country to arrive here
since Iraq reopened the Saddam International Airport on August 17.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Jordanian Health Minister Tareq Suheimat, who led
the delegation, said Jordan had informed the United Nations
Sanctions Committee of the flight, but did not ask for its
permission.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed the hope that this will be the beginning
of resumption of regular civil flights between Jordan and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian cabinet officials, lawmakers, doctors, reporters and
writers were aboard the Airbus 320 plane, which landed at 19:15 p.
m. (1515 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Health Minister Umid Medhat Mubarak and Minister of
Transport and Communications Ahmad Murtadha Ahmad Khalil welcomed
the Jordanian delegation at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Jordan announced that it had submitted a
request to the U.N. to allow the resumption of air links with
Baghdad and said it was awaiting an answer.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is the most important trading partner of Jordan and also
its sole crude oil provider at a price much lower than that in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly urged Amman to resume flights to Baghdad
and allow the planes flying to and from Iraq to use its air space,
arguing that the U.N. trade embargo on Iraq does not apply to
passenger flights.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two Arab neighbors have witnessed a major
improvement since the July visit to Amman by Iraqi Vice President
Taha Yassin Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions ever since its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.

DAMASCUS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Bashar al-
Assad met here Wednesday with European Union (EU) Middle East peace
envoy Miguel Moratinos on the stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the current situation of the Middle East
peace process and the efforts being made to put it on the right
track for just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, the
official SANA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Bashar expressed welcome to any EU-led efforts meant to activate
the peace process. Moratinos also said the EU was ready to
contribute to the efforts to revive the peace talks between Syria
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and Syria resumed in December in the
United States after an impasse of almost four years, but broke down
only weeks later in disputes over the fate of the Golan Heights,
which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zambia Seeks More Assistance for Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Wednesday reiterated
its appeal to the international community to consider granting
more aid to refugees hosted in the country in the spirit of burden
sharing.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a three-day regional journalist training
workshop on refugee issues here on Wednesday, Zambia's Home
Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa said the economic constraints
faced by his government and indeed most other African governments
have limited their capacity in adequately meeting the needs of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government is looking forward to more assistance
being rendered to the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) for disbursement to refugees, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said this assistance would improve Zambia's existing
infrastructure like roads, schools and clinics, which would in
turn have the added advantage of encouraging refugees to abide by
the law and relocate to other places.
</P>
<P>
The government is aware that the standard of living of the
refugees in designated areas should not exceed that of the
nationals in surrounding areas, as this would promote hostility
against them, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated his government's intention to continue
upholding its obligations towards refugees, as guided by the
international conventions, to which it is party.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that UNHCR continues with training programs to
improve the welfare of refugees in Zambia and the world over, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The understanding of refugee issues by the press will ensure
informed reporting of matters concerning refugees in the media
which is paramount in sensitizing the international community and
the general public in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The proposed objective of the training workshop is to create
and enhance awareness among journalists on the plight of refugees.
It has drawn senior editors and journalists from 10 Southern
African Development Community countries.

MAPUTO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has carried out
campaigns in different areas to fight leprosy in the country since
last April, the Noticias newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Making the cause and cure of leprosy known to relevant
communities is of top importance to combat the disease, Mozambican
Health Minister Francisco Songane was quoted as saying on Tuesday
at a meeting bringing together leprosy experts from seven African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy remains a serious health problem in Mozambique, where
the overall prevalence is estimated at 4.28 cases for every 10,000
inhabitants, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It said the prevalence of the disease is related in particular
to high levels of illiteracy, malnutrition and the lack of a
reliable supply of clean drinking water.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Sudan Pledge No Interference in Each Other's Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Uganda and
Sudan have reiterated their commitments to refrain from
interfering in each other's internal affairs or doing anything
that undermines the security and stability of the other, said a
press release issued here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The press release was issued at the end of a two-day meeting by
foreign ministers from Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Uganda over
relations between Uganda and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed at the meeting that the governments of Egypt,
Libya, Sudan and Uganda in collaboration with the Carter Center,
Canada, the United Nations Children's Fund and the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees shall set up a mechanism to search
for and repatriate all abducted Ugandan children in Sudan, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the meeting also underlined the
importance of ensuring that trade between the countries continue
uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic ties between Uganda and Sudan were suspended in 1995
and remained so despite a pledge made by the two countries to
exchange ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
Sudan had accused Uganda of giving support to the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army while Uganda, for its part, had accused
Sudan of supporting the rebel Lord Resistance Army.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, it was reported that Sudan, in a communique signed in
Canada with the Ugandan government, had agreed to work towards the
release of about 6,000 abducted Ugandan children.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Twenty South African
students will have the opportunity to undergo training in tourism
for a year in Germany thanks to a project launched by the two
governments.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at uplifting South African people with
tourism skills, said South African Deputy Minister of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism Rejoice Mabudafhasi at the
launching ceremony in Soweto on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There is a need for well qualified, trained people to provide
impetus to the tourism sector in South Africa, Mabudafhasi said.
</P>
<P>
She said "the project will, for the next three years, provide
training in tour guiding and tourism to 60 students -- men and
women selected from South Africa's nine provinces."
</P>
<P>
"This is a key to realizing the African renaissance and the
growth of the representative involvement in the tourism sector,"
she stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to Mabudafhasi, South Africa's tourism industry has
tremendous potential to create jobs, and the government has
recognized that appropriate skills and experience are necessary to
facilitate employment growth as well as international
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, Germany embassy representative Evan der
Gied said the German government feels that there is need to
educate people who really understand South African culture so they
can guide tourists.
</P>
<P>
A lot of Germans have visited South Africa but they were left
with unanswered questions because they could not communicate, Gied
said.

<P>
PARIS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- France said on Wednesday that
the forthcoming air flight to Iraq by a French plane is a purely
private initiative and the government has nothing to comment on it.
</P>
<P>
After a Boeing passenger plane belonging to a private air
company flew to Iraq on September 22 with some doctors on aboard,
a second French plane, rented by the non-government organization
of "Children of the World-Human Rights," is expected to fly to
Baghdad on September 29 with about 100 French and European
personalities.
</P>
<P>
"It is a purely private initiative. We have nothing to comment
on the declarations of this or that," said French Foreign Ministry
assistant spokesman Bernard Valero.
</P>
<P>
He said that the French Foreign Ministry has not yet informed
the United Nations Committee of Sanctions against Iraq about the
forthcoming flight to Iraq because it has not got sufficient
information for notifying the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The organizer of the flight, Yves Buannic, said that he is
coming under "a mixture" of foreign and French pressure to cancel
the flight.
</P>
<P>
Some French associations have criticized some foreign services
in France, if not solely the U.S. embassy in Paris, for
maneuvering to stop the flights from Paris to Baghdad.

MOSCOW, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Strategic Missile

intercontinental ballistic missile from a mobile pad.
</P>
<P>
The missile blasted off from the Plesetsk cosmodrome at 12:50 p.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The permanent members
of the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday reached an
agreement to lower the percentage of oil revenues Iraq must pay to
a U.N. Gulf War compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with relevant U.N. resolutions, Iraq has to pay
30 percent of its oil revenues to a compensation fund for Gulf War
damages.
</P>
<P>
The five permanent members, namely China, Russia, France,
Britain and the United States, agreed to lower this to 25 percent
in early December before the next phase of the "oil-for-food"
program begins.
</P>
<P>
With the lowered percentage, Iraq will have more money to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian goods for its people who are
suffering from the stringent U.N. sanctions imposed on the country
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, French ambassador to the United Nations

to be briefed soon on this compromise so as to seek the consensus
of the full Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Although the agreement was reached among the five permanent
members, there were no negative comments from the non-permanent
members of the council till now, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was time to make some changes in the procedures, the
ambassador added.

<HEADLINE> Putin: No Drastic Cut in Russian Armed Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir
Putin said Wednesday that the country's armed forces would not be
drastically cut and that the defense money should be spent more
appropriately.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no wholesale massive reductions of the Russian
armed forces," Putin told a session of the top advisory Security
Council. "Measured, calm and smooth work is needed to optimize the
country's entire military machine," he said.
</P>
<P>
The session was scheduled to discuss the restructuring of the
armed forces, but the motion was moved to November.
</P>
<P>
"Not everything is ready for the session and it will take time
to formulate decisions and work out their format," Putin said,
noting that "the leaders of all departments with military units
have objections" to the issues prepared for the council's meeting,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On military spending, Putin said the country spends over 35
percent of the budget on national defense. "This is far too much...
We cannot yet say for certain that we are spending the taxpayers'
money thriftily."
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Defense Ministry troops, there are military
units in yet 11 other power structures, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Although all the military units implement important tasks, "
parallelism is far from always being justified," Putin pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Russian media have reported earlier that the armed forces would
be reduced by 350,000 to 365,000 servicemen and 120,000 civilian
personnel.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry, the General Staff and other ministries
and services have sent their proposals on the planned changes.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the reductions to the need to redistribute
budget spending in favor of better training of the troops without
additional financing, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Might Reduce Oil Supply if EU Releases Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) hinted Wednesday that it will reduce
its supply to defend the prices if the European Union releases its
strategic reserves to reduce quotations.
</P>
<P>
Some European Union (EU) nations have used crude from their
strategic reserves to calm down the market, said OPEC president,
also Venezuelan Mines and Energy Minister Ali Rodriguez, who did
not mention the names of those countries.
</P>
<P>
An eventual EU joint decision to release its reserves could
cause a movement so great that it would pull down the prices of
crude and force OPEC to adopt some measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. announcement last weekend of releasing 30 million
barrels of its oil reserves caused the immediate drop of the crude
prices below 30 dollars per barrel after a historical quotation of
37 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC aims at having the crude prices to go down to 22
dollars per barrel, as a minimum, and 28 dollars as a maximum.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and French President
Jacques Chirac demanded on Tuesday the release of the EU crude
strategic reserves to have prices drop.
</P>
<P>
Britain opposed the idea of using the EU members' strategic
reserves, because they are resources for cases of urgency, not for
price control.
</P>
<P>
EU Finance ministers will discuss price on September 29 in
Brussels.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Durable-Goods Orders Rise 2.9 percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- New orders to U.S.
factories for big-ticket manufactured goods rose by a solid 2.9
percent in August, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase, the third in the last four months, pushed up
orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three
years, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 216.1 billion U.S.
dollars last month.
</P>
<P>
In July, durable-good orders plummeted 13.1 percent, according
to revised figures, an even bigger drop than the government
previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year basis, August orders were up 3.2 percent. For
the first eight months of the year, orders were up 9 percent from
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders rose 6.5 percent, thanks to a pickup in
orders for airplanes and aircraft parts. That followed a record 32.
4 percent decrease in July.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile transportation sector, durable-goods
orders rose 1.9 percent in August, the eighth increase in the last
10 months. In July, these orders dropped 5.5 percent. The
transportation sector can swing widely from month to month because
it includes costly items such as airplanes, ships and military
tanks.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of big-ticket items, a good sign of current demand,
went up by 1.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 214.
7 billion dollars in August. They fell by 2.4 percent the month
before.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Italian telecommunications
police Tuesday night arrested eight men on charges linked to
production and distribution of child pornography in a joint
operation with Russian police, following a 19-month investigation.
</P>
<P>
A health-care worker, a government official, two businessmen,
and a university student were among the eight arrested in a
nationwide operation stretching from Salerno in southern Italy to
Venice and Milan in the north, Italian news agency Ansa reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police advised 490 people throughout the country, including 18
minors, that they were under investigation and 600 search warrants
have been issued.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that the pornography, which included so-
called "snuff" footage where victims are eventually killed, was
produced in Russia and distributed in the U.S., Germany and Italy
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The material was apparently paid for by money transfers,
amounting to payments into Russian bank accounts of up to 600
million U.S. dollars over the last 19 months.

<HEADLINE> "Superminis" Now Safer in Crash Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 27 (Xinhua) - Small cars are safer than ever
before, according to crash test results for superminis and urban
vehicles released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study by the European New Car Assessment Program (NCAP)
show more cars in this class achieving high safety scores.
</P>
<P>
However, the results from the tests show that drivers,
passengers and pedestrians are all at risk of serious injury in
collisions at speeds between 18mph and 40mph.
</P>
<P>
The study names the Fiat Seicento, Citroen Saxo, Nissan Micra,
Ford's best-selling Fiesta and Ka models and the Vauxhall Corsa as
the worst offenders.
</P>
<P>
The Toyota Yaris is hailed as the best performer in its class,
with the Peugeot 206, Renault Clio, Skoda Fabia and Volkswagen
Polo also riding high in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
Superminis were first tested by Euro NCAP in 1997 when three
stars were awarded to two cars, two stars to four cars and one
star to just one.
</P>
<P>
Chris Patience, head of technical policy at the Automobile
Association said: "These latest results give buyer a useful safety
guide with which they can compare the performance of cars within
their class."

GAZA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on Wednesday afternoon gave the go-ahead to the digging of the
first Palestinian oil field along Gaza Strip coasts.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader told reporters that the event was "a main

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Seize 100 Kilograms of Base Morphine and Heroin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish anti-narcotics police
on Wednesday seized 100 kilograms of base morphine and heroin
hidden in a lorry in northern Zonguldak province, the Anatolia News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip-off, the police searched the lorry which was at
a port of the province to leave for Russia and found the drugs.
</P>
<P>
The drugs were thought to be smuggled to Turkey from Iran.
Several suspects were taken into custody, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a commercial and cultural bridge between Europe and
Asia because of its geographical position. Nearly 70 percent of the
illicit drugs produced in the rest of the world is smuggled to
European countries via Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Until last month of this year, the Turkish forces have seized 3,
219 suspects in 1,458 operations and seized 2,850 kilograms of
heroin, 22.6 tons of hashish, 976 kilograms of base morphine, 56
kilograms of opium, six kilograms of cocaine, 5.5 tons of acid
anhydride, 618,336 captogan pills and 14,964 synthetic drugs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 1,583 kilograms of heroin, 50 kilograms of cocaine,
15.5 kilograms of opium and 8.3 tons of acid anhydride were
confiscated in joint operations with United States, German,
British, Romanian, Belgian, Russian, Dutch, Spanish, Italian and
Greek anti-narcotics units.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, a total of 6,121 suspects were captured in 2,587
separate incidents while anti-drug forces impounded 2,249 kilograms
of heroin, 5,458 kilograms of hashish, 288 kilograms of base
morphine, 13 kilograms of cocaine, 26.2 tons of acid anhydride and
1,749,305 captogan pills.

<HEADLINE> United Nations Vows to Reach Last Child With Polio Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Touting the strategic plan 2001-2005 for the final chapter of
global eradication, Annan declared that the race to reach the last
child with polio vaccine had begun.
</P>
<P>
"Our race to reach the last child is a race against time,"
Annan said. "If we do not seize the chance now, the virus will
regain its grip and the opportunity will elude us forever."
</P>
<P>
Annan's statement came during an unprecedented gathering of
leading players in the polio eradication effort, including Time
Warner Vice-Chairman Ted Turner, Rotary International President
Frank Devlyn, Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland of the World
Health Organization (WHO), Executive Director Carol Bellamy of the
U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), government representatives from
polio-affected countries, corporate and public sector donors, and
actress Mia Farrow, who suffered from polio as a child and whose
son Thaddeus is paralyzed by polio.
</P>
<P>
Polio is a highly infectious disease which mainly afflicts
children below the age of three. The virus invades the nervous
system and can cause paralysis.
</P>
<P>
"We must negotiate access to all children for national
immunization days, particularly in the priority countries affected
by conflict," Annan said. "We must ensure the safety of health
workers and volunteers, many of whom work daily to track the
disease long after immunization banners have come down. We must
use all the instruments of the U.N. system to finish the last
chapter of polio eradication."
</P>
<P>
Delegates gathered at the U.N. headquarters in New York to
galvanize the necessary financial resources and political will to
certify the world polio-free in 2005, a target set in 1988.
Spearheading the initiative are WHO, UNICEF, Rotary International,
and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
Symbolizing the race to beat polio, Annan and Thaddeus Farrow
started a specially-designed Countdown Clock, which will tick down
the number of seconds remaining until the certification deadline
at the end of 2005.
</P>
<P>
The clock, donated by international watchmaker OMEGA, will also
track the decreasing number of polio cases around the world. The
number has dropped 95 percent since 1988, with roughly 7,000
reported cases in 1999 and less than 2,000 so far this year. The
Countdown Clock will be on display at the United Nations until the
world is certified polio-free.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland opened the gathering by unveiling the Strategic Plan
2001-2005, which details the steps required to stop transmission
of the wild polio virus worldwide within the next 24 months;
safely contain laboratory stocks of the virus; certify the world
polio-free by 2005; and eventually end immunization against polio.
</P>
<P>
"We know what we have to do. We have the tools and the strategy
to do it. The challenges outlined can be surmounted, but only if
current and new partners commit their support through 2005,"
Brundtland said. "I urge you all to play your part in making
history."
</P>
<P>
Bellamy, UNICEF's executive director, praised the "truly
Olympian efforts" of all the partners working toward polio
eradication, but stressed that complacency or fatigue would
jeopardize the initiative.
</P>
<P>
"Reaching our goals will require inspired teamwork from all of
us," Bellamy told the gathering of the polio partners. "
Transporting fresh polio vaccine from the plants where it is
manufactured to the remote regions where it is needed is a relay
race requiring many hands. At the starting line of that relay are
the vaccine producers who must continue to ensure timely
production."

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Aegean Ferry Accident Rises to 62 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The death toll has risen to 62
late Wednesday with a number of passengers still missing after a
Greek passenger ferry carrying 511 people rammed into a rocky
outcropping in stormy weather and sank three miles off the
southern Aegean island of Paros on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The 3,783-ton Express Samina, which was carrying 447 passengers
and 64 crew, departed the port of Piraeus for Paros on Tuesday
afternoon and developed a crack on its right side and started to
tilt sharply before it sank.
</P>
<P>
The 110-meter vessel was due to be withdrawn from service late
December, and Piraeus port officials said Wednesday that the 34-
year-old ship had been thoroughly inspected before sailing and had
been found seaworthy.
</P>
<P>
This is the first biggest sea tragedy in Greece this year
following a fire broke out in a Greek super fast ferry last year
in Patra, which killed 14 people.
</P>
<P>
As the air and sea search and rescue effort continues, Greece's
justice minister has ordered an immediate investigation into the
cause of the sea accident, promising that charges would been
pressed against those responsible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Greek parliament observed a minute's silence in
honor of the victims of the tragedy and political parties in the
country also canceled all activities scheduled for the day.
</P>
<P>
Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos and Prime Minister Costas

<HEADLINE> EU Clears Boeing-Hughes Annexation in Satellite Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Wednesday it would clear the proposed acquisition by the Boeing
Company of the satellite business of the Hughes Electronics
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said after an
in-depth investigation, it believed that the planned acquisition
will not lead to a dominant position of the two companies in
Europe's satellite market.
</P>
<P>
Earlier there were doubts that the acquisition could
significantly strengthen Hughes' position in commercial
geostationary communication satellites ("GEO" satellite) and
satellite customers might be induced to procure launch services
from Boeing.
</P>
<P>
Boeing, a U.S.-based company which is active in commercial
aircraft, defense and space industries, supplies navigation
satellites as well as satellite launch services.
</P>
<P>
Hughes, a subsidiary of General Motors, is the world's leading
manufacturer of commercial GEO satellite. It procures satellite
equipment and provides statellite-based communication services and
pay-TV.

<HEADLINE> EU to Set Up European Aviation Safety Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
decided Wednesday to set up a European Aviation Safety Agency,
mainly aimed at drawing up common standards to ensure the highest
possible level of safety in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The European Union (EU) will at last have the means to conduct
a genuine aviation safety policy," said Loyola de Palacio, vice
president of the European Commission, the EU's executive branch.
</P>
<P>
"The creation of an Aviation Safety Agency is a decisive step
for Europe. It will enable us to continue to guarantee our
citizens a level of safety that is among the highest in the world,
while giving our industry the means to compete on an equal footing
outside the EU," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that such an aviation safety agency is needed as
the public demand for better quality of service with fewer delays
and lower fares, highest safety and less environmental pollution
caused by the increasing air traffic.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Athletics Official Criticizes Banning of Hammer Thrower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 27 (Xinhua) -- World champion hammer
thrower Mihaela Melinte of Romania, the great favorite of the
Sydney Olympic competition, was led away from the qualifying event
Wednesday because it was said she had failed a test for dope, last
June, during a contest in Italy.
</P>
<P>
"It is the biggest infamy I have ever met with!" Nicolae
Marasescu, Secretary-General of the Romanian Athletics Federation,
was quoted as saying by the Rompres National News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The International Federation's spokesman does not tell the
truth," he said, stressing that the test they are speaking of was
made at a competition in Milan, last June, on the sixth, and the
alleged positive drug test was communicated to our federation
after 111 days, which is in flagrant contradiction with
international regulations that specify that "the test results
shall be communicated within the shortest delay".
</P>
<P>
According to Marasescu, "It was only on September 25 that we
got a fax message demanding explanations. We replied on September
26, recalling that Mihaela Melinte had been checked on May 5 and
tested negative. And sample A was analyzed in the official
laboratory in Barcelona. On June 26, the same sports woman gave
urine, blood and capillary samples in Paris and she tested
negative there too.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as a many-times world record-keeper at hammer
throwing, she passed 30 dope tests, and she tested negative with
all of them."
</P>
<P>
"Again, there is a sheer forgery in the statement by the IAAF
spokesperson that claims that our federation received the result
of sample B, of the cross-test that is. We have got nothing!" the
secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
Marasescu's opinion is that "the sports big powers have been
annoyed by the unprecedented performance of the people at the
Olympics, with their seventh position in the standings by medals
embarrassing too many people".

<HEADLINE> Sharon's Planned Visit to Temple Mount Draws Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A planned visit by Ariel
Sharon, leader of the opposition Likud party, to the Temple Mount
in Old City of Jerusalem has angered the Palestinians, who
threatened Wednesday to launch large-scale protests, according to
Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, who just returned to Israel from a visit to the United
States on Tuesday, said earlier Wednesday that he will invite all
Likud lawmakers to accompany him in the visit, scheduled to take
place on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians from all over the West Bank are threatening to come
to the Temple Mount to prevent Sharon from visiting the site, which
hosts various holy spots, such as the Dome of the Rock and the Al-
Aqsa Mosque and the relics of the Jewish First and Second Temple
which Israel claimed laid beneath the earth.
</P>
<P>
The sovereignty over the Temple Mount was the deal-breaker in
July's Camp David summit between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians said Sharon's visit, which is to happen 24
hours before the start of the Jewish New Year, is an intended "
provocation" and might lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
The youth wing of Palestinians' Fatah movement and the head of
Wakf, the Muslim religious trust that holds de facto control over
the Mount, said Tuesday that they will do everything to prevent
Sharon's visit.
</P>
<P>
Jibril Rajoub, who is in charge of terror prevention in the
Palestinian National Authority, said Wednesday that his force will
not lift a finger to prevent violence due to the political nature
of Sharon's visit.
</P>
<P>
However, Sharon and Likud officials argued that "Every Israeli
citizen and tourist has the right to visit the Temple Mount."
</P>
<P>
Israeli police are still meeting with Wakf officials before
making decision on whether to permit the visit to proceed.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts pointed out that Sharon may want to use this visit
to distract media attentions from Israeli Attorney-General Elyakim
Rubinstein's planned ruling Thursday afternoon on the criminal
investigation against former Likud leader and ex-prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
If Rubinstein drops all charges against Netanyahu as expected,
it will clear the way for the former prime minister to challenge
party leadership against Sharon.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Keen to Develop Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
keen to promote tourism in the country and special emphasis is
being given to sustainable tourism development and eco-tourism.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Secretary of Tourism and Culture Samin Jan
Babar here Wednesday at a Photographic Exhibition to mark the
World Tourism Day.
</P>
<P>
For a country like Pakistan, he said, tourism can contribute
towards environmental protection, economic development and create
job opportunities thus helping fight against poverty. At the same
time, it can bring national integration, international
understanding and the much-needed foreign exchange, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, offers a remarkable combination of culture
and adventure and its tour operators package unique products such
as the Indus Valley Civilization, Gandhara, the Moghal heritage
and early Muslim civilization along with northern areas quite
successfully.
</P>
<P>
Samin Jan Babar said Pakistan is a special interest destination
and a time has come when collective efforts had to be made to
develop all year round tourism in order to maximize return.

<HEADLINE> Eviction of White Farmers in Zimbabwe Needs Court's Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's white commercial
farmers will not be evicted from their acquired farms until at
least 90 days' formal notice has been given and a court order
obtained.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court, sitting as a constitutional court, has
granted an interim order in the case brought by the Commercial
Farmers' Union (CFU) against four ministers, the Commissioner of
Police and the President.
</P>
<P>
The order, which does not stop the acquisition process, but
slow down resettlement, was issued Tuesday after both the CFU and
the Attorney-General's Office agreed to its terms.
</P>
<P>
The state can give a notice to a white farmer only after the
land is acquired and the 90 days of notice start when the farmer
is given the order by the court.
</P>
<P>
Resettlement is in a three-state process: first, the land must
be acquired; then the previous occupants must be evicted;
afterwards, the new settlers are allowed in.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has announced to acquire 3,041 white
farms to distribute 500,000 landless Zimbabweans.

<P>
NAIROBI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister Nicholas
Biwott for Tourism, Trade and Industry has urged industrialized
countries to share their technology advancement with developing
countries for mutual benefit from global trade, newspapers here
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Biwott made the remarks here Tuesday when he received in his
office a delegation led by former Japanese Agriculture Minister
Tikuichirou Jamazawa.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries are unable to produce goods that are
competitive in the world market due to the low rate of technology
transfer from developed countries, Biwott said.
</P>
<P>
He said Kenya and the rest of the developing countries want
access of their products into the world market on a lower or zero
tariff to enhance production.
</P>
<P>
At present, Kenya's exports to Japan include coffee, tea and
macadamia nuts. About 40 percent of the country's macadamia nuts
are exported to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Jamazawa urged Kenya to enhance marine, fruits and
horticultural exports to Japan as the market for these goods is
vast.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Rejects Accusation on Sex Abuses on Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government has rejected a report by the New York-based Human
Rights Watch (HRW) claiming that female refugees in the country
are sexually abused, local newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Johnson Brahim, acting director of refugees in the Ministry of
Home Affairs, was quoted as saying on Tuesday that the report is a
grave exaggeration and the organization has done injustice to
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The HRW released a report on Tuesday accusing Tanzania and the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) of having
failed to protect female refugees from rape and sexual abuse by
local Tanzanians and fellow refugees.
</P>
<P>
There have been a few cases of crime in the refugee camps but
this normal in any society, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Save for a few cases of crime, refugees live peacefully in
Tanzanian camps," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Women elsewhere are also vulnerable to rape and sexual assaults,
he said, querying "how safe is New York where the author
documented the report?"
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern over the tendency of using individual
complaints to generalize issues without even checking with the
other side.
</P>
<P>
According to the director, Tanzania is determined to enhance
refugee safety and there is a mechanism already in place to ensure
peace.
</P>
<P>
"Every camp has 20 police officers and the system of using
refugees as local guards is working well," he said. "Criminals
netted in refugee camps are dealt with legally as it is done with
other citizens."
</P>
<P>
Brahim also dismissed as unfounded a recent report by East
African, a Nairobi-based English weekly, that Tanzania intends to
repatriate some 700 Somali refugees.
</P>
<P>
"The Somali immigrants are legally recognized by the government
and there are legal terms safeguarding their stay," he said.
</P>
<P>
Latest UNHCR statistics show that some 474,000 refugees from
Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Somalia
are currently sheltered in a total of 20 camps in Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> European Commission Approves Plan to Reform Competition Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
adopted a proposal Wednesday to reform the competition rules of
the European Union (EU) applicable to restrictive practices
between businesses and their abuses of dominant positions.
</P>
<P>
The reform in competition laws will "extensively amend" the
current system for implementing Articles 81 and 82 of the EU
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for Competition Affairs Mario Monti described
it as the most important legislative initiative in the competition
field since the 1990 Merger Regulation of the European Community.
</P>
<P>
"After forty years, businesses are well acquainted with the
competition rules and the national authorities can also take part
in implementing them. This will allow the commission to
concentrate on combating restrictive practices and abuses of
dominant positions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is intended to strengthen competition in the 15-
country EU. "To that end, it will extend to national competition
authorities and courts the power to apply Community law in full,"
the commission, EU's executive arm, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The current settlement system concerning competition rules
involves the notification of agreements to the commission, which
is alone empowered to authorize those who restrict competition.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the notification system dose not serve to
safeguard competition and the abolition of the current system will
enable the commission to target the most serious restrictions and
abuses.
</P>
<P>
The reform initiative will also strengthen the commission's
power to detect and punish cartels and other infringements of the
rules, the commission said, adding that the proposal will,
therefore, improve the protection afforded to competition and
ensure that consumers are able to benefit fully from the European
single market.

<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The total trade volume of
enterprises under the Beijing Municipality in the first eight
months of this year stood at 7.298 billion U.S. dollars, up 42.7
percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total volume, export amounted to 2.967 billion U.S.
dollars and import 4.331 billion U.S. dollars, up 57.2 percent and
34.2 percent respectively over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that export generated by the capital's foreign-
invested enterprises in the period amounted to 1.78 billion U.S.
dollars, up 115.7 percent over the same period last year, making
up 60.1 percent of the city's total. Export produced by processing
enterprises accounted for 56.6 percent of total exports.
</P>
<P>
Beijing mainly imports machines and electronic products, which
accounted for 80.1 percent of the city's total imports.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from Beijing Municipal Foreign Economic And

one hand, the global economy is seeing rapid development and the
Central Government encourages the increase of import; on the other,
various departments of Beijing Municipality have provided better
services and support for enterprises engaged in foreign trade.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Contribute More Money to U.N. Refugees Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Administration
Wednesday pledged to donate another 9 million U.S. dollars to the
U.N. Relief Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East
(UNRWA).
</P>
<P>
This will bring to 89 million dollars the total U.S.
contribution
to the cash-strapped UNRWA for the year 2000, said an embassy
statement issued during a meeting in Amman of donor countries.
</P>
<P>
Of the 9 million dollars, 6.6 million dollars will go to UNRWA's
general fund and 2.4 million dollars for special projects, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting Tuesday with UNRWA Commissioner-General Peter
Hansen, Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein called on the
international community to observe its financial obligations to
UNRWA, which runs into a deficit of about 30 to 40 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
UNRWA should continue to provide its services to the Palestinian
refugees, and the international community must respect its
financial pledges to the agency so that it can meet its
responsibilities towards the refugees," said the monarch.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Jordan has housed over 1 million Palestinian
refugees, who had fled their homes during successive Middle East
wars.
</P>
<P>
UNRWA began operations in 1950 to provide relief, health,
education and welfare services for Palestinian refugees, most of
whom live in poor conditions in refugee camps scattered in Lebanon,
Syria, Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Syria Seek to Improve Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- As a Syrian delegation led by
Interior Minister Mohammad Harba now in Ankara for a visit to
Turkey, Turkey and Syria are trying to mend their ties strained two
years ago over Ankara's threat of war.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Interior Minister Saadettin Tantan met Tuesday with
Harba on security issues and cooperation in fighting terrorism,
organized crime and smuggling, Turkish Daily News reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tantan told a news conference after the talks that there was a
security cooperation agreement between the two countries, and that
the two ministers decided to improve cooperation over security
issues.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Harba said that the two countries shared an 800-
kilometer-long border, which necessitates cooperation on security
matters.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the two ministers agreed to continue the
common struggle against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK),
which has been engaged in an anti-Ankara campaign since 1984 for
self-rule in the Kurdish-populated southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Turkish side also asked Syria to provide
the PKK archives that have been kept in the Syrian capital
Damascus, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials said that the visit was a regular one, being
part of the security mechanism established between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said that it came in the wake of a visit to
Syria by Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer to attend the funeral
of late Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in June, indicating the two
sides' efforts to mend ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and neighboring Syria are at odds notably over the
Kurdish rebels issue and sharing regional waters.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, tension rose when Turkey threatened military action if
Syria continued to shelter Kurdish rebels, including their
chieftain Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was resolved several weeks later when Ocalan, who is
now jailed in Turkey, left Damascus and Syria agreed to sign a
bilateral accord to join forces in what was termed the struggle
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In October 1998, the two countries signed the agreement in
Turkey's southern city Adana, under which Syria pledged to stop
supporting PKK activities on its territory.
</P>
<P>
Another contentious point has been the sharing of the waters of
the Euphrates and Tigris, which originate in Turkey and flow down
to drought-stricken Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Both Syria and Iraq accuse upstream Turkey of building dams on
the two rivers that significantly reduce water flow to their
territories, and attempting to use the waters as weapons in case of
crisis, an allegation rejected by Ankara as "unjustified."
</P>
<P>
Turkey favors the distribution of the water in proportion to the
size of agricultural land in each country, while Syria and Iraq
insist on the equal sharing of the water resources.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Turkey is trying to force Syria to allow
water to flow from the Orontes River into the Amik Plateau in
southern Turkey for urgently-needed irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Syria has blocked the flow of the Orontes River within its
borders, in response to Ankara's refusal to strike a binding
agreement with Damascus on the amount of water that will be allowed
to flow into Syria from the Euphrates River.
</P>
<P>
Syria, together with Iran and other Arab countries, has been
uneasy at the close ties between Turkey and Israel, notably their
growing military cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Urges E. Timorese Militia to Surrender Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
insisted again here Wednesday that East Timorese militia must
surrender their firearms to the local security authority by
Wednesday at the latest.
</P>
<P>
"We take two steps in our efforts to disarm the militia. The
first step is a persuasive approach, and the second is a legal
approach. We hope that all militia elements will voluntarily
surrender their firearms on Wednesday, at the latest," Indonesian
Coordinating Minister for Social, political and Security affairs
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"If until Wednesday they refuse to hand over their firearms, we
will take legal actions as the second step," Yudhoyono added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the progress on disarmament process, he said, "We
still don't know how far it progressed. We should wait until the
day turns to Thursday, of course."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Defense Minister Mahfudz said that if until Wednesday
the militia keep refusing to hand over weapons, the military would
launch raids and sweeping against them, adding it would also
arrest those (elements of militia) who are found of possessing
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yudhoyono also said that the disarmament of militia
elements in West Timor is a part of the government's effort to
deal with East Timorese refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
"That (the disarmament of militia) is not an independent
problem, but it is related to the comprehensive settlement of East
Timorese refugee problem. We want the problem (East Timorese
refugees) can be dealt with soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been under a strong pressure from the
international community following the death of three international
workers in Atambua, Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province, on
September 6. The workers were believed to have been killed by what
the United Nations called "pro-Jakarta East Timorese militia gang.
"
</P>
<P>
The world body then passed a resolution No.1319/2000, insisting
that the Indonesian government disarm and disband the element of
militia as well as launch a thorough investigation into the
Atambua incident.
</P>
<P>
The East Timorese militia and many refugees entered Indonesia
last year in the wake of a U.N.-sponsored direct ballot during
which most of East Timorese voted in favor of independence from
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the number of East Timorese refugees in the
border line of East and West Timor, the country's Nusa Tenggara
province, stands at 130,000.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government is still considering whether to
repatriate them or replace them to other areas. There are mounting
fears that the refugee issue could trigger another serious social
problem in East Nusa Tenggara.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 27 (Xinhua) -- the Malaysian government
Wednesday approved a study of the proposed US$2.5 billion Trans-
Asia Railway project linking Singapore to Kunming, China, giving a

</P>
<P>
Malaysian Transport Minister Ling Liong Saik said that with the

</P>
<P>
"If these recommendations are accepted, all the ASEAN countries

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate on
Wednesday expressed support on the on-going military offensive in
Jolo, Sulu and thumbs down call on a cease-fire against the Abu
Sayyaf bandits.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Senate President Franklin Drilon
said he does not share the sentiment of calling a cease-fire
following reported violation of human rights in Sulu.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is to our national interest that the military
should pursue its operations against the Abu Sayyaf without let-up.
Declaring a cease-fire at this stage will not only help the
bandits regroup and strengthen their forces," Drilon said.
</P>
<P>
Drilon said he supports a Senate investigation into reported
violation of human rights in the area but wants it after the
military operation is over.
</P>
<P>
The Senate chief said the on-going military offensive should
have a limited time frame since the government cannot afford to
prolong the offensive because of its negative effects on the
investment climate and on the lives of the people of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Drilon warned the military to respect at all
times the human rights of innocent civilians caught in the
crossfire.
</P>
<P>
"The Armed Forces should be more deliberate and careful in
their bombardment of suspected Abu Sayyaf hideouts because the
civilians will surely be hurt and their properties unduly damaged,
" he said.

According to the vice minister, at least 45,000 tourists from
all over the world visit Angola annually.
</P>
<P>
After a one-year civil war, the situation in Angola has
relatively calmed down. The tourist department, which has realized
that Angola's various landforms including plateau, primitive
forests, karst areas and deserts are attractive to foreign
tourists, is planning to make full use of the abundant tourist
resources in the country.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebel Leader Sankoh Seriously Ill: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The detained former leader of
Sierra Leone's Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Foday Sankoh, is
critically ill with prostate cancer, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Ministry of Social Welfare in the
capital Freetown on Tuesday, foreign medical assistance might be
required for Sankoh's further treatment.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who founded the RUF and launched in 1991 a civil war
lasting for nine years, is being held at a secret safe place by
the government, awaiting a trial by an international tribunal on
war crime charges.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was arrested by the government forces in May this year
following his rebel fighters renewed military operations and
abducted about 500 United Nations peacekeeping personnel in
violation of the Lome Peace Accord signed last July.
</P>
<P>
The RUF recently appointed a new interim leader, with the
consent of Sankoh, to reopen negotiations with the government in a
bid to put back on track the dead-locked peace process in the war-
torn west African country.

SHIJIAZHUANG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A 46-km by 21-km inland
lake has become increasingly attractive for tourists because of
its clean water and graceful ecological landscape.
</P>
<P>
The lake, named Anguli Nur, is 300 km northwest of Beijing and
is believed to be the largest of its kind in Beijing's neighboring
Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
"The lake and its surrounding 10,000 hectares of grassland are
free from industrial pollution," said a local tourism official.
</P>
<P>
"We have received tens of thousands of visitors during the past
summer season," he said.
</P>

According to the official, most of the tourists are from
Beijing and Tianjin, and some business people from the two cities
have decided to invest in tourism development projects there.
</P>
<P>
Historical records showed that more than 1,000 years ago, the
Anguli Nur area became one of the royal summer resorts and hunting

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's coastal city
of Dalian, a famous tourism attraction, closed 346 sauna houses
across the city earlier this month in an effort to save water
resources.
</P>
<P>
A local official source said that there was a total of 483
bathhouses in Dalian, of which more than three quarters were sauna
houses.
</P>
<P>
The source said that after the government's ban of sauna houses,
only 112 public bathhouses and sauna rooms in 25 hotels can
continue their business.
</P>
<P>
Dalian is one of the cities suffering the most severe water
shortages. Due to a drought lasting for two years, the city is now
facing a worsening water supply problem.
</P>
<P>
The city launched an unprecedented water-saving drive recently -
- the government set up a water supply quota for its residents and
charges fees ten to twenty times higher for overuse of water.
</P>
<P>
According to a local official source, most of the sauna house
owners have showed understanding towards the government's decision.

<HEADLINE> Thai Bourse to Launch Educational Programs for Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Hoping to create new
investors in the future, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is
going to launch an educational program for primary and secondary
school kids, as well as university students.
</P>
<P>
The program, which is due to start in October, will consist of
two courses, the "SET Junior Investor Program", which aimed at
primary and secondary school students, and the "SET Young Investor
Program" for university students, according to a SET statement
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the program, it said, is to broaden the SET's
potential investor base by providing the youngsters with
fundamental knowledge of Thailand's capital market and stock-
market investment.
</P>
<P>
"Through the program, the students will have a better
understanding about the investment skills and principles in the
stock market, the detailed structure of the Thai capital market
and the effects of the market to the whole national economy, " the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The SET board believes that the program will help to promote a
future generation of confident and qualified investors in the
country's stock industry.
</P>
<P>
The SET index has plunged 40 percent so far this year, making
Thai bourse the worst player among Asian stock markets. The
universal lack of interest of Thai people in the stock market is
cited by analysts as a major reason for the failure. Currently,
only 0.6 percent Thais own stocks and fewer are engaged in active
trading.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Urged to Invest in Pakistani Food Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian investors have
been urged to capitalize on the opportunities offered by Pakistan
in its 1.0 billion U.S. dollar food and beverage industry.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan High Commission here is organizing a trade mission
from Malaysia headed by the Pulau Pinang Chinese Chamber of
Commerce and Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs,
which is scheduled for later this year, according to the High
Commission Commercial Counselor Athar Jamal Abro Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The high commission is also organizing a 10-member delegation
from the Associated Chinese Chamber of Commerce in February 2001,
he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of investment opportunities for Malaysian
businesses as Malaysia like Pakistan is also rich in agriculture,
the Pakistani diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysian investors can participate in downstream activities
like packaging, processing, canning and other preservation methods
as Malaysia is far ahead in the food manufacturing and research
and development sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite being endowed with 16 million hectares of fertile land
which is under fruit and vegetable cultivation, Pakistan lacks a
well-developed post harvest technology setup.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan produces an average of 10 million tons of agricultural
products annually ranging from fruits like citrus, mangoes, dates
and bananas.
</P>
<P>
Athar said some 40 percent of Pakistan's farm products went to
waste during transportation and further wastage came from lack of
refrigeration facilities.

<P>
PARIS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Air France is holding the U.S.
Continental Airlines before a court for its alleged role in the
crash of the Concorde supersonic aircraft on July 25, said Air
France officials on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Air France and its insurance companies have issued a writ
against the Continental Airlines before the Court of Commerce of
Pontoise near Paris which is specialized in judging disputes
between commercial companies.
</P>
<P>
Investigators found that a metal strip on the runway of the Air
France Concorde at Charles-de Gaulle-Roissy airport could have cut
the tire on the undercarriage of the plane and brought about a
chain reaction which led to the crash of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The metal strip was believed to have been dropped from a DC-10
passenger plane of the U.S. Continental Airlines which used the
same runway soon before the accident took place, according to
French investigators from the Bureau of Accident Investigation.
</P>
<P>
The crash on July 25 killed 113 people, most of them German
tourists, and led to a permanent suspension of the airworthiness
certificate of the Concorde aircraft by France and Britain.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Little known Mils Schumann of
Germany defeated pre-race favourite Wilson Kipketer of Denmark to
win the men's 800 meters gold medal at the Sydney Olympic Games on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old, who finished third in the semifinal at 1:44.22,
clocked a time of one minute 45.08 seconds to win Germany the
first gold medal from athletics at the Games.
</P>
<P>
"I think most people didn't know who I was before the Olympics
and they didn't know how fast I could run," said the newly-crowned
gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
"I had a dream I could win a medal of some kind, but to take a
gold it's just unbelievable, I can't believe it happened.
</P>
<P>
"I had trained really hard for the past six or seven weeks with
no competition. It worked for me," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kipketer, a world record holder and three time world champion,
had a too late burst and failed to win his first Olympic gold
medal. He had difficulty winning his heat but delivered a strong
semifinal victory in 1:44.22.
</P>
<P>
"No, I did not start too late, I didn't wait too long. In the
last 300m, I was in a group, I got chipped on the leg. I lost my
rhythm. It was not a tactical problem," said the Kenyan-born
Danish.
</P>
<P>
"At 150 meters there was still a group, so I had to run out a
bit. The race was a little bit crazy that was the game. I was
coming here to fight and now I have the silver. Something is
better than nothing. I didn't expect it like this, but something
it just happens," he added.
</P>
<P>
Aissa Djabir Said-Guerni of Algeria, 23, took the bronze in 1:
45.16.
</P>
<P>
"I am really, really happy. It was all come true. I am still
young, this is just beginning for me," said the European season's
lead, who took his semifinal in 1:44.19.

<P>
XI'AN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The most influential Chinese

selling dictionary, with a circulation of 400 million.
</P>
<P>
On average, one in three Chinese own a copy of the Xinhua

said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-English edition of the dictionary has been
published this year, Yu added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Eximbank Issues Floating Rate Financial Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- With ratification from the
People's Bank of China, the China Export and Import Bank (Eximbank)
successfully issued 5 billion yuan in floating rate financial
bonds, with a maturation term of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The Eximbank adopted a bidding pattern of a basic margin in
interest rate, and the winning basic margin was revealed to be 0.
59 percent.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the issuance said the interest rate for the
bonds will be redefined every year according to the current
interest rate and the basic margin.
</P>
<P>
He said members of the bank's underwriting team has reached 43,
including both State-owned commercial banks, national shareholding
banks and commercial banks and credit unions in major cities,
which have basically formed a nationwide bond issuing and sales
network.
</P>
<P>
The successful issuance will further promote the development of
the bank's credit businesses. As the State-owned export credit
institute, Eximbank has supported the export of high-tech and high
value-added electronics and machinery products and complete sets
of equipment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, Eximbank had honored mature principal of
12.4 billion yuan and paid an interest rate of 7.97 billion yuan,
maintaining a good repayment record. The bank has finished 40
percent of its bond issuance plan for this year.

<HEADLINE> China to Face Water Tension in 30 Years: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China will face serious water
resources problem when its population is expected to peak at 1.6
billion in 2030, according to a report released today by the
Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE).
</P>
<P>
The report, titled "Strategy of Water Resources of Sustainable
Development in China", predicts that the per capita amount of
water resources in China will fall from its current 2,200 cubic
meters to 1,760 cubic meters in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
According to an international standard, a country will
experience a water shortage if its per capita water resources is
under 1,700 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The report was completed by 43 academicians from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering and
nearly 300 experts.
</P>
<P>
China's annual volume of water utilization will reach 700
billion to 800 billion cubic meters around 2030, approximating the
limit of China's usable water resources, which is, 800 billion to
950 billion cubic meters, says the report.
</P>
<P>
As China strengthens its control over the population, the
increase of water utilization should also be checked when its
population reaches 1.6 billion, the report stresses.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that China should adopt new strategies,
such as water-saving agriculture, urban water pollution control
and sustainable water utilization, to ease the overuse of water.
</P>
<P>
During a forum on China's water resources sponsored by CAE
today, experts discussed issues including flood prevention,
agricultural and urban water usage, controlling water pollution
and protecting water resources.

<HEADLINE> Asian Businesses Holding Back on New Tech Investment: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Most Asian executives agree
that the Internet will increase competition, but many of them are
holding back on heavy investment in new technology, according to a
recent survey by the Asian Wall Street Journal in association with
PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
The results were compiled from interviews with 500 senior
executives in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and the Republic
of Korea in July and August.
</P>
<P>
Respondents were selected randomly from companies headquartered
in the region and spread across industries, from real estate and
manufacturing to finance and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The survey found 69 percent of the executives polled said they
don't think the Internet is a passing fad; 17 percent said they
think it is, and 14 percent said they are undecided.
</P>
<P>
More than three-quarters said their intranet and/or e-mail
systems had made "internal processes" more efficient, while 60
percent said they experienced cost-savings from these systems.
Another 21 percent were able to reduce staff.
</P>
<P>
But many of the company web sites simply offered non-
interactive information on goods and services; only 15 percent let
customers make online transactions. Between a third and a half of
the executives whose companies did not have a web site said they
simply don't see the value of investing in one.
</P>
<P>
Despite a stated optimism about opportunities the Internet
offers, many companies and executives hesitate to seize them.
</P>
<P>
Less than half of the companies surveyed had assigned someone
to explore online business ventures. And senior business people
often confided they don't feel well informed about e-business
practices.
</P>
<P>
When asked if they think it is better to be cautious than to be
a market leader in e-business, more than half said yes.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that Asian companies with regional or
international operations tend to have more sophisticated web sites
and are more likely to say they see the Internet fueling not just
opportunities but competition.

<HEADLINE> First Arab Flight to Baghdad to Take off Within Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A Jordanian plane, the first
Arab flight to sanctions-hit Iraq, is expected to take off from
Amman at 3:00 p.m. (1200 GMT) Wednesday, said an airport source.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus 320 will carry 100 passengers, including cabinet
ministers, lawmakers and members of the national basketball team,
and a large amount of medicine and medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
The flight is in defiance of the U.N. sanctions against Iraq,
which, in place for 10 years, includes a ban on planes flying to
and from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Acting Information Minister Mahmud al-Kayed said that Jordan
had "notified" the United Nations of the flight, but did not
receive any response.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the flight would pave the way for the
resumption of air links with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Jordan announced it had submitted a request
to the United Nations to allow the resumption of air links with
Baghdad and said it was awaiting an answer.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Tareq Suheimat will head the delegation, which
will also include Kayed and the ministers of municipal, rural,
environmental affairs and social development.
</P>
<P>
During the 24-hour visit, Suheimat will meet his Iraqi
counterpart Umid Medhat Mubarak and visit hospitals to get on-the-
spot information about their conditions and assess their needs.
</P>
<P>
Suheimat said Wednesday that the trip, which aims to underscore
the kingdom's strong support for the Iraqi people, will be the
first step towards strengthening and developing inter-Arab
relations.
</P>
<P>
On August 17, Baghdad reopened Saddam International Airport
after 10 years of idleness. Ever since, the airport has received
several foreign planes on humanitarian missions, but none from Arab
states.

<HEADLINE> WHO Chooses Vaccine Components for 2001 Influenza Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO has recommended three components of the influenza vaccine for
manufacturers to produce the vaccine for the southern hemisphere
influenza season of year 2001, WHO announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The three components, an A/Moscow/10/00 (H3N2)-like virus, an A/
New Caledonia/20/00 (H1N1)-like virus and a B/Sichuan/379/99-like
virus, were decided by international experts Tuesday at a WHO
meeting in the Greek town of Crete.
</P>
<P>
WHO holds a consultation meeting each September to formulate a
recommendation for the composition of inactivated influenza
vaccines intended for the following southern hemisphere winter (
from May to September of the following year). The timing of WHO's
recommendations is critical to allow sufficient time for companies
to produce the vaccine before the new influenza season starts.
</P>
<P>
WHO strongly recommends that the use of vaccine as an effective
preventive measure against influenza, a potentially fatal disease.
About 50 to 80 percent of vaccine recipients will be protected
against the disease when there is a good match between the vaccine
and strains of influenza virus that are in circulation.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, most of the population has been previously
exposed to influenza A (H3N2), influenza A (H1N1) and influenza B
viruses and is known to have some degree of residual immunity.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, one dose of influenza vaccine should be
sufficient for all ages except young children. Previously-
unimmunized children should receive two doses of vaccine with an
interval of at least four weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Track super stars Gail Devers,
Nourredine Morceli and Wilson Kipketer all stumbled in the Olympic
Games on Wednesday as German cyclist Jan Ullrich added a Games
gold to his bulging professional haul.
</P>
<P>
American Devers, one of the best sprinter-hurdler in history,
lost probably her final attempt at the Olympic 100m hurdles title
when she failed to finish her semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Two-time 100m Olympic champion Devers clipped the fourth
barrier, lost her stride rhythm and ran straight into the fifth.
</P>
<P>
It was Olga Shishigina of Kazakhstan who walked away with the
100m hurdles gold Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Nourredine Morceli of Algeria was ousted
from the men's 1,500m final after tripping 100 meters from the
finish of his semifinal.
</P>
<P>
The former world record holder and three-time world champion
clashed with American Jason Pyrah as the leading pack rounded the
final bend. Although he kept his balance, his momentum was lost.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Nils Schumann beat three-time world champion Kipketer
in the men's 800m final.
</P>
<P>
Schumann clocked one minute 45.08 seconds to beat Kipketer,
born in Kenya but who switched allegiance to Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Women's 800 and 1,500m champion Svetlana Masterkova of Russia
pulled up in the 1,500m heats with a calf injury and burst into
tears.
</P>
<P>
Ullrich added an Olympic gold to his impressive haul which
includes a Tour de France and a Vuelta a Espana.
</P>
<P>
The German won the men's Olympic road race, mounting a three-
man attack 25 kilometers from the finish before breaking away in
the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
American Venus Williams nipped Russian Elena Dementieva 6-2, 6-
4 for the gold in women's tennis singles, becoming only the second
player to win Wimbledon Open, the U.S. Open and the Olympics in
the same year.
</P>
<P>
Sebastien Lareau and Daniel Nestor of Canada won the men's
doubles tennis, beating defending champions Todd Woodbridge and
Mark Woodforde of Australia in four sets.
</P>
<P>
Legally blind Marla Runyan advanced out of qualifying in the
women's 1,500m. She has an incurable retina condition called
Stargardt's Disease that has reduced the middle of her eyesight.
</P>
<P>
American sprint star Marion Jones shook off the drug
allegations surrounding her husband C.J. Hunter as she went after
her second gold of the Games.
</P>
<P>
"I've said it all along. Today was going to be the most
difficult because of two rounds of the 200 and having to jump,"
said the 24-year-old Jones after qualifying for 200m semifinals.
</P>
<P>
World shot put champion Hunter, 31, is facing a two year ban
after testing positive for steroids four times in June and July.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Religious Leaders Hail Promulgation of Religious Rules (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The rules on religious
activities of aliens China issued Tuesday will better protect the
religious freedom of foreigners in China and ensure their normal
religious activities, said the leaders of China's five major
religions at a symposium today.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Religious Affairs issued Tuesday
the Rules for the Implementation of the Provisions on the
Administration of Religious Activities of Aliens within the
Territory of the People's Republic of China, detailing the
regulations on religious activities of foreigners in China.
</P>
<P>
Bishop Fu Tieshan, chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic
Association, presided over the symposium and said that with a
growing number of foreigners participating in religious activities
in China and China's increasing religious and cultural exchanges
with other countries, rules of this kind are needed to strengthen
administration.
</P>
<P>
Qoxi, president of the China Advanced Institute of Tibetan
Buddhism, said, "the rules stipulate that the Chinese government
respects the freedom of religious belief of aliens within Chinese
territory, whether they believe in religion or not, or whichever
religion they believe in. This demonstrates the determination of
the Chinese government to uphold the policy of religious freedom
as well as its sincerity of respecting foreigners' religious
freedom, which, will be definitely applauded by the international
religious circles."

Haji Shamsiddin Mahmud, vice-chairman of the Islamic
Association of China, agreed with Qoxi. "Since 1994, our
association has received 2,400 foreign believers and they
expressed appreciation for the religious freedom policy adopted by
the Chinese government," he said, adding that all Islamic
countries have issued similar rules.
</P>
<P>
Chen Meilin, a senior official from the Three-Self Patriotic
Movement Committee of Protestant Churches of China, said the rules
protect the legitimate rights of religious bodies and ensure
normal exchanges between Chinese religious organizations and
foreign religious circles.
</P>
<P>
Min Zhiting, president of the China Taoist Association, said, "
Taoism is a native religion of China, and with the development of
cultural exchange, Taoism has more and more foreign converts, so
the issuance of the rules is in the interest of Taoism."
</P>
<P>
Monk Yan Jue from the Buddhist Association of China said the
rules, which regulate the religious activities of foreigners in
China, safeguard the nation's legal system and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Participants all agreed that the rules are workable for they
detail every aspect of religious activities by foreigners in China.
The rules embody the principle of maintaining the independence of
religious organizations in China and protect the religious freedom
and normal religious activities of foreigners in China.

<HEADLINE> UAE Newspaper Urges Iraqi Cooperation for Sanctions Lifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A United Arab Emirates (UAE)
leading daily has urged cooperation from Iraq to profit from the
positive situation to ensure an early lift of the crippling U.N.
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
An editorial carried Wednesday by the Dubai-based official
Arabic "Al Bayan" said that there have been some developments in
the region indicating a strong desire to help lift the U.N. embargo
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government should halt its threats, use the current
situation for the interest of the Iraqi people through constructive
statements and show its readiness to cooperate with the U.N. to
achieve the Iraqi people's aspirations, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the foreign flights to Baghdad defying the
U.N. embargo last week "could be a new phase that calls for a
lifting of the U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq, if Saddam Hussein's
regime react well towards these changes."
</P>
<P>
Following the French and Russian lead, Jordan is to send a "
humanitarian" plane to Saddam International Airport on Wednesday,
which will be the first Arab sanctions-busting flight, said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
Another French plane, the second in two weeks, will fly from
Paris to Baghdad Friday while India is planning to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government can profit from these initiatives to
alleviate the blockade, "but the observer to the region's situation
notices that whenever sympathy increases with Iraq, its regime
increases offensive against neighboring countries and resumes
threats on its political address, the matter that cannot be
acceptable by those sympathetic with Iraq, or by the whole
international community," the paper pointed out.

JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein will announce
Thursday that he has decided to close the case against former Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, for lack of
evidence, but to issue a reprimand over their behavior in the
Amedi-gifts affair, Channel 2 reported late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
It was further reported that the decision on former Prime
Minister's Office staffers Moshe Leon and Ezra Seidoff, two of
Netanyahu's accomplice, will be made after the High Jewish Holy
Days, which begins this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The allegations against Netanyahu included bribery taking, grand
larceny, fraud, breach of trust, and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Population density in Israel is among the highest in the
world, having reached an average of 278 people per square kilometer
in 1999. The growth in population density is recorded with other
data in Israel's "Statistical Yearbook," released Tuesday by the
Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS).
</P>
<P>
Population density differs significantly in various regions of
the country, the Yearbook shows. The Tel Aviv area is the most
crowded, with a density figure of 6,700 people per square
kilometer. Population is the sparsest in the south, where the
figure is just 16 people per square kilometer.
</P>
<P>
Only a few countries in the world have higher density levels: in
Europe, just the Netherlands and Belgium are more crowded, showing
respective density figures of 372 people and 332 people per square
kilometer.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Forecasts for rain in the coming days have raised concern of
a possible new wave of West Nile fever, after two more people died
Tuesday from the disease, bringing the total number of fatalities
this summer to 19.
</P>
<P>
Health Ministry Director-General Shuki Shemer warned Tuesday
that accumulation of water on the ground while the weather remains
relatively warm could increase the mosquito population.
</P>
<P>
Most experts agree that stagnant water and warm conditions are
the ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes, which are as yet the
sole known transmitter of the disease to human.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli delegation to the Washington talks with the
Palestinians is set to ask their American hosts to push the
Palestinian delegation into commencing negotiations on the
permanent status agreement, a senior diplomatic source said.
</P>
<P>
The team, headed by acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami,
wants the negotiations to be based on proposals raised by President
Bill Clinton during the Camp David summit and ideas raised
afterward concerning sovereignty over the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem-based source said that the Americans will hold
talks with both sides separately, "with both sides attempting to
convince the U.S. to pressure the other."

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
is due in Cairo Sunday as the first leg of his first trip abroad
since taking office in July.
</P>
<P>
Bashar is expected to hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on the current situation in the Mideast peace, especially
the Syrian track, the Arabic Al Akhbar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents will also discuss ways of restoring
solidarity of the Arab world and means of strengthening bilateral
political and economic relations, the government newspaper quoted
Syrian sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have achieved no progress on
key issues though discussions and contacts have been carried out on
and off these days while the peace process between Syria and Israel
has been stalled since January.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the Golan Heights captured by Israel in the 1967
Mideast war had been the deal-breaker in the Syrian-Israeli peace
talks early this year. Syria held firm in its demand for a total
return of the Heights while Israel insisted a conditional handover.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Bashar will also visit Saudi Arabia and Bahrain
during his coming trip.

CANBERRA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
slightly softer Wednesday.

<P>
At the end of the day, the Australian dollar was worth 54.94 US
cents compared with 54.97 at Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
It was also trading at 59.10 yen from 59.04 and at 62.12 euro

The intervention of the Group of Seven on last Friday only
dropped the Australian currency from it's fast diving.

The weakening of the Australian dollars was imputed to a too

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Urged to Postpone Entering Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan manufacturers have
urged the government to postpone plans to join a free trade zone
of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) for
at least one year, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The delay is needed to help the country's industry pull through
troubles including the ongoing power and water rationing and high
interest rates, Surinder Tana, chairman of the Kenya Association
of Manufacturers, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is among the nine countries of the 20-member COMESA trade
bloc which have promised to join the free trade zone when it is
launched on October 31 this year. While other members have asked
for more time to implement economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"Currently we are on the verge of collapse," Tana said, adding
that "COMESA imports will come in at duty free levels and our raw
materials still attract import duties so we have got a non-level
playing field."
</P>
<P>
Tanzania withdrew from COMESA earlier this year partially over
concerns about the impact of unfettered foreign competition on the
domestic industry.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's manufacturing sector, which accounts for around 13
percent of the country's gross domestic product, grew by only 0.7
percent in the year to June, compared with 1 percent in 1999.

State Minister for Finance Gabriel Opio said that the loan will
be paid back over a period of 50 years, and it attracts an
interest of 0.75 percent.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Open Anti-Fraud Office in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
planning to open a permanent anti-fraud office in Nigeria to deal
with the growing plague of financial fraud, media here reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Duncan McKelvie, head of the west Africa section of Britain's
National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), said that British
officials in Nigeria had been working with the Nigerian police to
combat the financial fraud, which reportedly hits tens of
thousands of businesses and individuals around the world every
year.
</P>
<P>
McKelvie said the British police authority hopes to pay more
attention to the growing fraud problem in Nigeria as Britain is
becoming a favored target of the criminal gangs of the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Nigerian criminal code 419 dealing with fraud,
McKelvie said: "There is not enough attention paid to 419 in the
UK. We want a greater awareness policy, publicity."
</P>
<P>
The United States opened a permanent anti-fraud office in
Nigeria in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was ranked earlier this month as the world's most
corrupt country according to a survey by the Berlin-based non-
government organization Transparency International.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's civilian government led by President Olusegun
Obasanjo has pledged to fight fraud and corruption as they damage
the country's image and investment surroundings.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Seven Indian tourists and a
Swiss pilot have been killed in Switzerland's worst ever
helicopter accident.
</P>
<P>
Two helicopters of Air-Glaciers, a private company, collided in
the Swiss canton of Valais on Tuesday afternoon, killing eight
people and injuring four others, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
The injured were immediately taken to a hospital in Valais's
capital of Sion, where doctors said their lives were not in danger.
</P>
<P>
Around 60 Indian tourists witnessed the disaster as they waited
for their turn to go on a round of five-minute sight-seeing
flights. They said the helicopters' rotors touched during a
landing approach, causing the aircraft to crash into a football
field.
</P>
<P>
The site of the crash has been cordoned off by police, and an
investigation has been opened into the causes of the accident,
which experts termed as the worst helicopter crash in Swiss
aviation history.
</P>
<P>
Weather conditions were good at the time, and eyewitnesses said
human error was the most likely cause of the collision.
</P>
<P>
The crash was not the first for Air-Glaciers this month. One of
their helicopters went down on September 5 in canton Vaud, killing
the pilot who was alone on board.
</P>
<P>
The private company operated five aircraft and three
helicopters, which could be hired for anything from business trips
to heli-skiing excursions.

<HEADLINE> NZ Minister on Balance between Funding Elite Athletes and Participation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister for
Sport, Fitness and Leisure Trevor Mallard said here Wednesday
there needs to be a balance between funding New Zealand elite
athletes and spending money to get all New Zealanders into
physical recreation.
</P>
<P>
Mallard's remarks were a response to the on-going public debate
over whether enough money is being invested in New Zealand elite
athletes. The debate has been prompted by the country's medal
count to date at the current Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
After 11 days at the Olympics, New Zealand now lies in the 34th
place on the medal table with one gold and three bronze medals.
Neighboring Australia sits in the fourth, with 12 gold, 20 silver
and 12 bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
Some local commentators blamed the difference down to money
being invested to sport across the Tasman.
</P>
<P>
Mallard said funding for New Zealand's elite athletes will be
on the government's agenda. But he added that there had to be
funds allocated for both elite athletes and to get all New
Zealanders into physical recreation. The two are inter-related,
he thought.
</P>
<P>
He said it is also important to build up a solid foundation for
sports at club and school level.
</P>
<P>
"If we keep talented kids active through their school lives and
if they develop their skills and we have good talent
identification, that might mean that at the 2008 Olympics we may
have quite a few more champions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mallard pledged pushing for more funds for sports. "It has to
compete with other areas in the government budget," he said.

athletes excel in the 2001 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Kuala
Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
PASI Secretary-General Tigor Tanjung said the program would
include improvements to the periodical training which would
determine the correct time for an athlete to reach his or her peak
form.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the mistakes "caused our sprinters to run out of
steam in the Olympics, where they should have reached their top
form," Tigor was quoted bu Wednesday's Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Around 50 athletes selected during the 2000 National Games (PON)
in East Java last June and the Asian track and field championships
here in August are now being groomed for the regional sporting
event.
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed with our runners' performance in the
Olympics. A review of technical and nontechnical matters in the
training program is expected to prevent the same mistake when we
enter the SEA Games," Tigor said.
</P>
<P>
He said he noticed some of the sprinters prematurely peaked at
PON because they were chasing after numerous incentives, including
cash bonuses offered by their respective provinces.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia sent women's sprinter Irene Truitje Joseph and men's
sprinters Yanes Raubaba, Erwin Heru Susanto and John Murray to
Sydney. But all the four failed to qualify for the second round
in their events, each finishing sixth in the respective heats.
</P>
<P>
Tigor also said the runners were mentally unprepared for the
Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
He said all of the sprinters would continue their preparations
for the SEA Games once return from Sydney, on October 2.

<HEADLINE> Canada Beats Australia for Men's Doubles Tennis Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- In one of the major surprises
of the Olympic tennis tournament, Sebastien Lareau and Daniel
Nestor of Canada defeated Australian pair Mark Woodforde and Todd
Woodbridge in the gold medal match 5-7, 6-3, 6-4 and 7-6.
</P>
<P>
It marks the first time Canada has won any Olympic medal in
tennis.
</P>
<P>
With Mark Woodforde retiring at the end of the season, the
heavily favored Australian pair known as "The Woodies" had hoped
to finish a career that has seen them dominate men's doubles for
more than a decade with a big finish.
</P>
<P>
This was thwarted, however, by a Canadian pair that were on top
of their game, and on top for most of the match. Woodforde and
Woodbridge struggled to gain any advantage, as the Atlanta gold
medalists simply could not cope with the power serve of Nestor and
his play around the net.
</P>
<P>
The first set was a dog fight as service breaks resulted on
both sides of the net. The Woodies won it, breaking Lareau three
times.
</P>
<P>
After that, the Canadian pair grabbed the ascendancy. Lareau
and Nestor held all the aces, constantly returning the ball at the
Australians' feet, making it extremely difficult. The third and
fourth sets saw Lareau and Nestor control the tempo of the play,
dominating points at the net.
</P>
<P>
With Canadians keeping the pressure on the Australians, the
Woodies generally looked to lack the necessary spark to take the
match, finding it difficult to get a good percentage of first
serves in play.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth set, the Australians came out with an increased
hunger, looking as if they had added some necessary steel after
losing the third set. But Lareau and Nestor answered every
challenge as Woodbridge and Woodforde looked like they might grab
the necessary break, but the big points fell to the Canadians.
</P>
<P>
The tie break was controlled by Lareau and Nestor and it
typified the Woodbridge's difficulty on serve, the Australian
finishing off the match by double-faulting on match point.

<HEADLINE> Day 12 Roundup: Two Super Stars Fall in Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Track super stars Gail Devers
and Nourredine Morceli both stumbled in the Olympic Games on
Wednesday as German cyclist Jan Ullrich added a Games gold to his
bulging professional haul.
</P>
<P>
American Devers, one of the best sprinter-hurdler in history,
lost probably her final attempt at the Olympic 100m hurdles title
when she failed to finish her semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Two-time 100m Olympic champion Devers clipped the fourth
barrier, lost her stride rhythm and ran straight into the fifth.
</P>
<P>
Olga Shishigina of Kazakhstan walked away with the 100m hurdles
gold Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Nourredine Morceli of Algeria was ousted
from the men's 1,500m final after tripping 100 meters from the
finish of his semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Morceli, the former world record holder and three-time world
champion, clashed with American Jason Pyrah as the leading pack
rounded the final bend. Although he kept his balance, his
momentum was lost.
</P>
<P>
Women's 800 and 1,500m champion Svetlana Masterkova of Russia
pulled up in the 1,500m heats with a calf injury and burst into
tears.
</P>
<P>
Ullrich added an Olympic gold to his impressive haul which
includes a Tour de France and a Vuelta a Espana.
</P>
<P>
The German won the men's Olympic road race, mounting a three-
man attack 25 kilometers from the finish before breaking away in
the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
Venus Williams of the United States downed Elena Dementieva of
Russia 6-2, 6-4 for the gold in women's tennis singles, becoming
only the second player to win Wimbledon Open, the U.S. Open and
the Olympics in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Sebastien Lareau and Daniel Nestor of Canada won the Olympic
gold medal in men's doubles tennis, nipping defending champions
Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde of Australia in four sets.
</P>
<P>
Legally blind Marla Runyan advanced out of qualifying in the
women's 1,500m. She has an incurable retina condition called
Stargardt's Disease that has reduced the middle of her eyesight.
</P>
<P>
Marion Jones, newly-crowned 100m champion, resumed pursuit of
five golds by qualifying for the evening semifinals of the women's
200m. Joining Jones in the next round was 400m champion Cathy
Freeman.
</P>
<P>
Since her victory in the 100m, Jones has been engulfed in
controversy surrounding husband C.J. Hunter's positive drug tests.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Ousts Russia in Last Second Shot for Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian women bursted
into tears and jubilance after a thrilling upset win over Russia
68-67 with a last second shot in the quarter-final of the women's
basketball tournament at the Sydney Olympic Games here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil advanced to the semifinals and will take on host
Australia on Friday to fight for the berth in the final.
</P>
<P>
Alessandra Oliveira nailed the winning ball with 1.3 seconds
left on the clock and gave the Brazilians a 68-67 lead and the
victory they need to jump into the top four.
</P>
<P>
The Russians, bronze medalists at the 1999 European
Championships, dominated in defense and held the lead for most of
the first half before the Brazilians improved their shooting
percentage to 51.9 percent to cut the gap at 39-38 at the interval.
</P>
<P>
The tournament's second highest scorer, Brazilian captain
Janeth Arcain, played a strong first half by scoring 10 points and
grabbing nine rebounds. But in a major blow to the side she was
called for four personal fouls with 33 seconds remaining in first
half.
</P>
<P>
Arcain started the second half on the bench and returned to the
court with just under seven minutes remaining. she added another
three points before fouling out with 4.23 minutes left in the
match.
</P>
<P>
The lead changed hands for seven times before Oliveira sank the
clutch shot 1.3 seconds before the end of the game. Irina
Routkovsaia threw up a prayer in the last second but it bounced
off the rim and could not stop Brazil from heading into the top
four of the 12-team women's basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
Early in the afternoon, host Australia gained the first
semifinal berth by beating a straggling Polish team 76-48.  The
Opals jumped to a 16-4 lead with three 3-pointer by Jenny Whittle
in the first five minutes into the game. And Laruen Jackson's 11
points, five rebounds and four blocks helped Australia to build 43-
28 lead at the halftime.
</P>
<P>
Australia's lead steadily increased in the second half and
reached 30 points late in the game as Poland's shooting percentage
dropped to 27.7 in the rest of time in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Jackson scored game-high 17 points and nine rebounds and six
blocks, while 2.13-meter center Malgorzata Dydek led Poland with
12 points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Poland will play for the seventh place on Friday against Russia.
</P>
<P>
The other two semifinal berths will be decided later this
evening as South Korea faces France and the defending champion the
United States takes on Slovakia.

<HEADLINE> Sailing Gold Medal Races Postponed due to Unstable Winds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Two gold medals sailing races
were postponed to tomorrow due to unstable winds here on Wednesday,
with Australian crews leading in both the men's and women's 470
fleet races.
</P>
<P>
"No further racing today," a spokesman said, "as race officials
are reluctant to run medal-deciding races in conditions which
might be unfair."
</P>
<P>
While light breezes predominated on the Sydney Harbour,
thunderstorms forecast for later Wednesday were likely to bring
even more unreliable conditions.
</P>
<P>
The women's 470 dinghies were the only class to make it out to
the course, after a delay of more than three hours, but they were
recalled and will return to race with the men's 470s on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Racing in the men's 470s was called off for the day earlier in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Light and fluky winds on Sydney's picturesque harbour have
plagued the regatta since it began 11 days ago, forcing constant
delays and postponements in the 11 classes.
</P>
<P>
Australia are seeking their first sailing gold medal since a
double success in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong and Stowell lead Germans Nicola Birkner and Wibke
Buelle by nine points in the women's 470s, and Australian world
champions Tom King and Mark Turnbull also lead U.S. pair Paul
Foerster and Bob Merrick by five points going into the 11th and
final race in the men's 470s.

<HEADLINE> Injury Forces Devers to Quit from 100m Hurdles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- American Gail Devers, two-time
Olympic gold medalist in the women's 100 meters dash, was forced
to withdraw from the 100 meters hurdles because of her injury in
her semifinal heat at the Olympic Games here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I had an injury. I was praying that god would help me get
through it but that wasn't his plan," said the 35-year-old, who
won four Olympic golds.
</P>
<P>
"I had an MIR scan on Tuesday last week I think it was and it
showed that I had forn it (hamstring) even more. I was hoping to
just mentally get myself through it. But it wasn't meant to be."
</P>
<P>
Devers, favorite of the event, missed the chance to win her
first gold medal in the women's 100m hurdles, where she was fourth
four years ago in the Atlanta Olympics and fifth in Barcelona in
1992.
</P>
<P>
In the semifinal heat, she stopped competing after her fourth
of ten hurdles, walked out of the lane scrambling, which was a
scary reminder of the 1992 Olympics when she fell while leading
and had to scramble over the finish line for fifth place.
</P>
<P>
The American, who lost two years of her career because of a
life-threating thyroid disease, dominated her first round heat in
12.62 and the second round in 12.77, the third fastest time behind
Olga Shishigina of Kazakstan 12.66 and Melissa Morrison of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"I would have like to have won, but I do have a strong belief
in God," said Devers. "I have run really well all season and
haven't felt any pain. But God must not have wanted me to win, I
don't know why. Tonight I didn't get my dream, but my dream still
lives on."
</P>
<P>
Devers is the member of the U.S. relay for 400 meters, but she
was no ideal if she will run it.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. I will have to talk to my doctor, I think my
injury is worst than we thought," the disappointed hurdler said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Private businesses in south
China's Guangdong Province have been playing a bigger role in
foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that foreign trade volume done by
private companies in the province in the first six months of the
year went up by six times according to comparable figures during
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
During that period of time the private companies signed
contracts with overseas investors involving 760 million U.S.
dollars of overseas investments, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
By late 1999, Guangdong had 161,100 private businesses, with a
combined registered capital of 156.67 billion yuan (about 18.88
billion U.S. dollars) and more than 1.95 million employees.
</P>
<P>
A total of 559 private companies have been given permits to
import and export. Last year, private companies did 3.13 billion U.
S. dollars worth of foreign trade, of which, exports made 1.94
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This month, 21 private businesses sent their own
representatives to attend an economic, technological and trade
fair in Europe.

<P>
Xi'an, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming and Urumqi have become
important regional economic centers in the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
Fixed asset investment in the central and western regions by
the central government has increased remarkably during the ninth
five-year plan period.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, fixed asset investment in the central and western

rose to 39 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The initiation of a large number of railway, hydropower,

<P>
The central and western regions have been the focus of China's
poverty relief efforts. It is estimated that the country's poverty-
stricken population, mostly living in the central and western
regions, decreased from 65 million in 1996 to 34 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The industrial structure of the central and western regions has
improved remarkably, with the service sector developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
By 1999, the primary industry accounted for 22 percent of the
gross domestic product in central and western regions, the
manufacturing sector 44 percent and the service sector 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the ninth five-year plan, the Chinese
government has issued a series of policies that give the central
and western regions greater freedom in attracting foreign
investment and undertaking border trade.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the investment environment has been greatly
improved and export earnings have been increasing rapidly in the
central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the increasingly close ties between the west
and east have also led to closer economic and technological
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In September 1999, China formally announced its Western
Development Strategy, which, according to the SDPC, is a much
grander and more systematic program in promoting concerted
regional economic development than any other regional economic
development models employed before.
</P>
<P>
The new strategy, which involves infrastructure, environmental
protection, industrial structure adjustment and science and
technology advance, will produce a more extensive and greater
impact on the development of the central and western regions, said
a SPDC official.

BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Three-Self Patriotic

canonization of 120 "saints," saying the move "distorts history."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, the two religious organizations
say that the Chinese people, including all patriotic Christians,
could never accept the move because the canonization of Chinese or
foreign missionaries who had committed severe crimes against the
Chinese people is an open challenge to the sovereignty of Chinese
churches and to the feelings of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The statement says that the Vatican should repent of the past
crimes against the Chinese people committed by the missionaries,
instead of allowing certain people in the Holy See to further
tamper with history and fool the world under the guise of the term
canonization.

<HEADLINE> Relieve Farmers From Heavy Load: Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao has
reiterated the call for relieving farmers from heavy levies and
illegal charges in some localities.
</P>
<P>
Wen told a recent national teleconference on reducing financial
load on farmers that "Reducing the financial burdens on Chinese
farmers is an imperative government task."
</P>
<P>
Wen is concurrently a member of both the Political Bureau and
Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the countryside is generally sound, though
there are some problems that must not be ignored, such as the
difficulty for farmers to increase their incomes, excessive levies
by local governments and local officials' simple and rough style
of work, posing a threat to economic development and social
stability in rural areas, said the vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
The key to cutting farmers' financial burdens is to carry out
the central government policies on rural taxation, with the
average levy not surpassing five percent of the total annual
income of the farmers and the budgetary figure of 1997, he noted.
</P>
<P>
All the extra charges by local authorities must be waived and
returned to the farmers, Wen said, adding that local governments
must not levy illegal taxes on farmers in any form.
</P>
<P>
He also talked about the reduction of taxes on farmers in
disaster-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
The official emphasized that to reduce the financial load on
farmers, the taxation system must be reformed by streamlining
relations on distribution between the state, the collective and
the individual.
</P>
<P>
Local officials should be taught to improve their awareness
about central government policies and the law, which is a
guarantee for reducing the farmers' burdens, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Chinese farmers are not wealthy, he said. "We
must give more to farmers and take less from them," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also urged local officials to learn how to handle various
contradictions in the countryside under new circumstances. Leading
local officials must go to the site whenever a major incident
involving groups of farmers occurs, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Challenges, Chances for Tourism Industry in Bangladesh  By Chen Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DHAKA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Tourism Day is being
observed Wednesday in Bangladesh as in elsewhere all over the
world with this year's theme being "Technology and Nature: Two
Challenges for Tourism at the Dawn of the 21 Century."
</P>
<P>
Tourism is now a booming industry globally and the present
world order with its emphasis on liberalization and globalization
has created new opportunities for its development.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, however, earned very little from this sector, and
the income from foreign tourists last year even showed a decline.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics of the Bangladesh Parjatan (
tourism) Corporation (BPC), the national tourism organization
earned 2.45 billion taka (45.4 million U.S. dollars) in foreign
currencies from the sector in 1999, which is 0.12 percent less
than that of the previous year. A total of 172,781 foreigners
visited the country in the year.
</P>
<P>
"The earnings from the country's tourism sector are not
significant compared to the same of the neighboring countries like
India, Nepal and Bhutan," a senior official in the BPC said.
</P>
<P>
Lack of proper policy-planning, inadequate diplomatic efforts
by the local missions abroad and fund constraints are hindering
the growth the country's tourism sector, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the insufficient communications facilities across the
country and the insecurity at different tourism spots are also
responsible for the dissatisfaction among the visitors from home
and abroad, he maintained.
</P>
<P>
On the world map of tourism, Bangladesh suffers from the
problem of "image crisis." It has no symbol like "Taj" in India as
recognized attraction for the tourists. On the other hand, the
media that build images of the country only speak of poor law and
order situation, uncalled-for botheration at the port of entry or
at the immigration counter which often discourage the visitors.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the existing problems, Bangladesh is still a
fascinating country for those visitors who are keen to know the
unknown and unspoiled natural beauty and resources.
</P>
<P>
It has the longest sea beach at southeastern Cox's Bazar, the
romantic spot to see the sunrise and sunset. It also has Sundarban,
the largest mangrove forest of the world.
</P>
<P>
There are the Royal Bengal tigers and the spotted dears, and
also many historic palaces, shrines, forts and other places of
tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
"There are a good possibility for development of tourism in
Bangladesh. It will not be neglected on the world tourism map of
coming 20 years," said Francisco Franzialli, Secretary General of
World Tourism Organization during his visit to the country in last
March.
</P>
<P>
Recently the government has taken various initiatives for
further promotion and development of the tourism sector. Necessary
steps are being taken to establish Exclusive Tourist Zone in order
to attract local and foreign investors for participation in the
development of tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The government is now implementing the recommendations of the
strategic Tourism Master Plan in phases within the country's
national Five Year Plan, which made an allocation of 3 billion
taka (55.5 million dollars) in private sector and 120 million taka
(2.2 million dollars) in public sector.
</P>
<P>
Local tourism experts urged the government to consider some
suggestions for sustainable development of tourism in the country,
including allowing tax holidays for tourism business, increasing
necessary communication facilities, inviting joint ventures from
home and abroad and formulating a national tourism policy and
execution of that policy on priority basis.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the suggestions would be helpful in
developing tourism as a viable industry in the country, they
believed.

<HEADLINE> Probe Set for Complaints of Human Rights Violations in Sulu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has ordered the military to look into reports of human
rights violations in the ongoing rescue-and-offensive operations
in the southern province of Sulu, a senior official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview
that the president had specifically instructed the military at the
start of the military operations on September l6 primarily aimed
at rescuing the hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf to accomplish its
task "with least harm to innocent civilians and damage to civilian
property."
</P>
<P>
This instruction was part of the four-point guideline issued by
the president to the military, which also includes exhausting all
means to safely rescue the hostages; destroying the Abu Sayyaf so
that it can no longer engage in kidnappings for ransom; and
ensuring close cooperation and coordination among all agencies of
government in accomplishing these goals.
</P>
<P>
"We have been very careful about that. The president gave
strict instructions to the Armed Forces of the Philippines chief
of staff that for every incident and complaint, they should be
investigated immediately," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora was reacting to reports that Sulu residents have
complained that many human rights violations were committed during
the rescue operations for l7 hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier urged residents to lodge complaints
before the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) so these incidents
could be investigated.
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview, Defense Orlando Mercado said that the
government will make the appropriate announcements once it
verifies the report.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Trade Between Tanzania and Neighbors Remains High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The level of illegal
cross-border trade between Tanzania and its neighbors remains high
due to a lack of favorable business environment in almost all of
these countries, the weekly Financial Times reported here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a study report issued by the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID), rampant unrecorded trade in
the region points to a lack of political will and commitment to
establish a free intra-regional trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The report said formal cross-border trade is still constrained
by high tariffs, and other non-tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
The hurdle includes long and cumbersome documentation
procedures, instability of the foreign exchange rates, harassment
of the traders by state organs, lack of working capital and credit
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's overall informal trade with all its neighbors
amounted to 277.1 million U.S. dollars during the 1995-1996 period,
with overall trade balance equaling 74.1 million dollars in favor
of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's informal cross-border trade balance was positive
with Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and
Mozambique, and was negative with Kenya, Zambia and Malawi, said
the report.

<HEADLINE> (Specially for China-Africa Cooperation Forum) Roundup: Uganda Sees Success in Enterprise Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Ding Qilin, Wang Shangzhi
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The way in which the Ugandan
government liberalized its state-owned enterprises almost a
decade ago has served as a booster to its sustained economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The process of privatization has helped the state enterprises,
which were once regarded as a heavy burden to the government, cut
production costs, raise efficiency and generally become more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
So far about 115 state enterprises, accounting for 85 percent
of the country's total, are involved in the privatization program
and the number is expected to increase gradually.
</P>
<P>
Results, officials say, have been positive -- employment
increased by 11 percent on average compared with the figure 10
years ago, the output and sales of the divested enterprises shot
up by 88 percent and 64 percent respectively and taxes paid by 78
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, at the very beginning of 1990s, a total of 137 state
enterprises in Uganda, covering such sectors as trade, commerce,
agricultural production processing, manufacturing and insurance,
were estimated to turn out less than 30 percent of their total
production capacity and contribute only 5 percent to the country's
annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Lower efficiency of these enterprises made it impossible to
generate enough resources to finance and reinvest in their
operations. On the contrary, they mainly relied on direct and
indirect subsidies from the government, amounting to 200 million U.
S. dollars or 8 percent of the country's GDP per annum.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that these subsidies were 5.5 times
the government's health expenditure of 37 million dollars or about
twice for that of education totaling 88 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under such a circumstance, Uganda started the process of
selling off its public enterprises in 1991 under an Economic
Recovery Program put forward by its government under the
leadership of President Yoweri Museveni in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The move was designed to turn those state enterprises with
heavy losses into ones with profitmaking.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the joint efforts by the government and enterprises, "
the privatization process in this east Africa country has achieved
initial success," Michael Opagi, executive director of Uganda
Privatization Unit (UPU), said at a recent privatization seminar
here.
</P>
<P>
"The economy has benefited in terms of expanded tax base,
improved productivity and competitiveness, and job creation," the
UPU said. Most of the divested enterprises have increased their
output and productivity and contributed more taxes to the
government's treasury.
</P>
<P>
Taking Hima Cement Factory as an example, its output had
witnessed a rapid increase from 300 tons in January 1995 to 900
tons in June 1996. Lake Victoria Bottling Co. has also expanded
its production capacity from 200,000 cases to 630,000 cases per
month after it was divested.
</P>
<P>
The privatization process has also helped create more job
opportunities. The number of workers employed by Hima Cement
Factory has risen from 308 to 820 while the workforce of Lake
Victoria Bottling Company has expanded to 420 from 195.
</P>
<P>
After the first phase of the privatization of commercial public
enterprises, the government is gearing up its efforts to embark on
the process of selling off its large state enterprises including
the Uganda Electricity Board and railways, which is hopeful to be
completed by 2004.
</P>
<P>
Opagi said: "We should have completed the whole privatization
process by now, but we lost a lot of time, about one and a half
years when the Divestiture Reform and Implementation Committee(
DRIC) was under investigation by Parliament."
</P>
<P>
"We need to have conscious business decisions in this country
to guide privatization of some of these public enterprises, but
not politics," commented Opagi.
</P>
<P>
Though it has been delayed, the government still shows its full
confidence in the future and attaches great importance to
challenges that it is confronted with.
</P>
<P>
Opagi noted that the privatization process is facing cumbersome
decision making and inadequate divestiture procedures.
</P>
<P>
These have resulted in incomplete divestiture due to lack of
clear land titles, ownership conflicts, unforeseen divestiture
costs, and disputes between buyers and sellers, the UPU executive
director added.
</P>
<P>
The tender process has been blotted with speculative bidders
who present very high bids but have no capacity to meet the
payment, he complained.
</P>
<P>
Other challenges include insufficient public education on the
privatization process and state asset stripped of by some
management and employees in the public enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To tackle these problems, the Ugandan privatization authorities
have put in place new guidelines for the divestiture process with
a view to streamlining the process and to enhancing its
transparency, integrity and quality.

<HEADLINE> NZ Receives More Foreign Investment in 1st Half of 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- There was 900 million New
Zealand dollars (374 million U.S. dollars) of approved net foreign
investment in New Zealand in the first six months of this year,
according to the Overseas Investment Commission (OIC) of New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The OIC said in its half-yearly report that it consented to 108
applications compared with 155 in the previous six months covering
700 million NZ dollars (291 million U.S. dollars) in net
investment.
</P>
<P>
The 108 approvals involved investment of 2.3 billion NZ dollars
(955 million U.S. dollars). But much of this was foreigners with
interests in New Zealand selling to other foreigners, with only
900 million NZ dollars ending up in net investment in this country.
</P>
<P>
The report shows Australia was the main source of net
investment with 594 million NZ dollars (247 million U.S. dollars),
followed by the United States with 250 million NZ dollars (104
million U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the previous six months, the United States was New Zealand's
largest source of net investment with 312 million NZ dollars (130
million U.S. dollars), followed by Australia with 250 million NZ
dollars (104 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Recovers Amid Stronger Regional Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso slightly
recovered against the U.S. dollar early Wednesday amid stronger
regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
The peso averaged 46.189, firmer compared to the previous close
of 46.245.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said stronger regional currencies boosted the strength
of the peso in the early session.
</P>
<P>
However, they said a higher corporate demand for the dollars
may restrain the peso's further gains.
</P>
<P>
Value of trade turnover reached a hefty 66 million dollars in
early trade.

<P>
MANILA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Manila stocks ended higher
Wednesday as investors positioned in heavily battered blue chip
issues.
</P>
<P>
The 30-company Phisix, the market's main index, rose 13.07
points to close at 1,439.24.
</P>
<P>
The broader all-shares index also added 1.4 points to 679.23.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a technical correction from the market's
persistent weakness in the previous sessions caused the uptick.
</P>
<P>
However, they said the market's upward movement was tempered by
the lingering worries over economic and political woes in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The falling peso, the new round of oil price hikes, the
anticipation of more interest rate increases, and the unresolved
hostage crisis in southern Philippines are keeping investors away
from the market.

<HEADLINE> Americans to Make Open Sky Inspection Flights Over Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.S. military
inspectors will make a monitory flight over Russia on Wednesday
within the framework of the Open Sky Agreement of 1992, the Itar-
Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors have chosen a 5,000-kilometer route going over
the Moscow region, St. Petersburg, the Kola Peninsula and
Arkhagelsk, Tass said, quoting Russia's Center for Reducing
Nuclear Danger.
</P>
<P>
Under international cooperation terms, inspections are made
aboard host country planes. The U.S. inspectors will take Tu-154M
planes from Gagarin cosmonauts' training center.
</P>
<P>
The Open Sky agreement, designed to ensure air control over
military activity, was signed in 1992 by 27 European states, the
United States and Canada. All countries except Russia and Belarus
have ratified the document.
</P>
<P>
As the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament, has
yet to approve the agreement, only preparatory "test" flights are
made over Russia, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Ten such flights over Russian military facilities have been
scheduled for the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Premier Hopeful to Face Share Deal Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The National Counter
Corruption Commission (NCCC) of Thailand launched a formal
investigation into Thaksin Shinawatra's controversial stock
transfers and planed to question his household employees, who
received billions of baht worth of stocks over the past several
years, The Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin, a telecommunications tycoon and leader of Thai Rak
Thai (Thai Love Thai) Party, is considered the lead contender to
become Thailand's next prime minister due by year end.
</P>
<P>
The Shinawatra family has denied the media access to the four
employees - a nanny, a housekeeper, a chauffeur and a security
guard - who now face an imminent summons as part of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The NCCC decided Tuesday to fully investigate after gathering
information concerning allegations that Thaksin provided false
information in mandatory asset reports. He filed the reports with
anti-corruption authorities following his appointments to the
cabinet in 1994 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin said he was prepared to be investigated, claiming he
was the victim of a political conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
Still, possibly hinting at his line of defense, he said he
might have simply forgotten to list certain assets in the reports
because his holdings were so vast that they were difficult to
track.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty of the offense by the Constitution Court, he
would face a mandatory five-year ban from political activities.
</P>
<P>
After announcing its decision to begin a full investigation,
the NCCC began preparing to establish a subcommittee to gather
evidence and take witnesses' depositions.
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee must determine why Thaksin's domestic
employees held large amounts of shares when Thaksin assumed the
posts of foreign minister in 1994 and deputy prime minister in
1997.
</P>
<P>
If the panel establishes that those shares actually belonged to
Thaksin or his wife, then investigators will focus on why Thaksin
failed to report them.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin has insisted he never intended to break the law. But if
he is to defend himself by saying that he forgot some information
in filing his asset reports, he would also need to explain why
most of the shares were transferred back to his family after his
cabinet tenures ended.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Revenue Department is reportedly checking whether
the stock transfers involving Thaksin's employees violated tax
laws. Legal observers say the tax queries could put considerable
pressure on the employees. None of the employees has been allowed
to speak to the media.
</P>
<P>
Some more recent share transfers by Thaksin were apparent
efforts to comply with the law that prohibits cabinet members from
owning more than 5 percent of any company, and from owning any
share in any company that might present a conflict of interest
while in office. Shin Corps fits into the latter category.
</P>
<P>
Thaksin and his wife recently transferred most of their shares
in Shin Corps to their son and to her brother.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Update Bank Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada announced
Tuesday that it will update bank notes introduced 15 years ago to
make the Canadian dollar more secure.
</P>
<P>
"The new notes will incorporate state-of-the-art security
features that will make Canadian bank notes even more secure than
they are now," said Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will take advantage of high-tech, anti-
counterfeiting measures in issuing the new series of bank notes in
denominations of C$5, C$10, C$20, C$50 and C$100.
</P>
<P>
The C$10 bill will enter circulation in January 2001, to be
followed by the C$5 note in the same year. The other new notes
will be put in use over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Thiessen assured users that "they will be able to hold and use
existing notes for as long as they want," saying "the current
notes will remain legal tender even after the new notes are
introduced."
</P>
<P>
Though counterfeiting cost the country about 4 million Canadian
dollars (about 2.7 million U.S. dollars) last year, it was not a
big problem. The Bank of Canada decided to update its notes
because "affordable high-resolution color copiers, inkjet printers
and computer scanners have increased the potential for
counterfeiting," Thiessen said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Thwarts Tamil Tiger Assassination Plot in Jaffna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A Tamil Tiger rebel plot to
assassinate Jaffna district candidates of several political
parties contesting the October 10 Sri Lankan general election has
been thwarted, a press release said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The plot was revealed following the recovery of a large number
of documents from two Tamil Tiger rebels who defied a halt order
at an army checkpoint in Kokuvil in the Jaffna peninsula on
September 18.
</P>
<P>
A press release by the department of Information said that the
rebels had tried to rob a grenade at the checkpoint in their
attempt to get away. The army personnel had opened fire
immediately and killed one of them on the spot.
</P>
<P>
The other had escaped leaving a bag containing several
documents and a large collection of literature.
</P>
<P>
Both of them have been identified as members of Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) intelligence unit.
</P>
<P>
Among the documents found were letters prepared by an
organization calling on candidates to withdraw from the upcoming
election and letters warning Jaffna residents not to exercise
their votes or cooperate with the security forces.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the dissolution of the Parliament on August 18,
election-related violence is on rapid increase in Sri Lanka. The
government has blamed the LTTE for most of the violent incidents.
The formidable suicide bombing is a common practice by Tamil Tiger
rebels.
</P>
<P>
An LTTE suicide bomber blasted himself on September 15 in the
center of capital Colombo, killing at least four people and
injuring more than 20 others. It was revealed that the suicide
bomber was targeting Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine
Nimal Siripala de Silva.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga was also a victim to the Tamil Tiger
suicide bombing. She lost her vision in the right eye during last
December presidential election when a suicide bomber struck.

SYDNEY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Venus Williams of the United
States added Olympic gold medal to her medal collection when she
defeated Elena Dementieva of Russia 6-2, 6-4 in the women's tennis
singles final here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The victory over the 18-year-old Dementieva extended Williams'
winning streak to 32 matches.
</P>
<P>
Williams will try for her second gold when she and sister
Serena play in the doubles final Thursday against Kristie Boogert
and Miriam Oremans of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Like other opponents, Dementieva couldn't cope with Williams'
power. In the sixth game the Russian barely avoided getting hit in
the face by an ace.
</P>
<P>
Williams is unbeaten since losing at the French Open in early
June, and her winning streak is the longest since Martina Hingis
won 37 consecutive matches in 1997. Martina Navratilova set the
record of 74 victories in a row in 1984.

<P>
Monica Seles won the bronze Tuesday. The U.S. team lost a

<P>
SHENZHEN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China's first on-line
medicare system was launched earlier this month in China's first
special economic zone of Shenzhen in Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
This system enables people in Shenzhen to get services in some
hospitals and drugstores across the country, said Xue Deheng, an
official with local Social Insurance Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with the traditional medicare system in which people
can only reach medical institutions indirectly through some social
insurance companies, the on-line medicare system is more
convenient and can provides more choices for the people," said Xue.
</P>
<P>
As the system develops, he added, about 350 community clinics,
over 200 hospitals, and hundreds of drugstores in Shenzhen will be
available. Seriously sick patients can also transfer to some
better hospitals in Beijing or Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The relevant insurance companies pay the medical institutes
regularly, charged to medicare accounts through the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Declares Three Suspects in U.N. Staff Murder Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman said law enforcers have declared three suspects
in the September 6 murder of three foreign U.N. staff in Atambua,
East Nusa Tenggara province (West Timor), Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The three, who are now being detained, are suspected of
participating in the attack on the Atambua office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and subsequent
murders, the Indonesian Observer daily Wednesday quoted Marzuki as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki did not say where and when the three were arrested. "To
date their status is as suspects," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government set up an investigation team on the
Atambua murder case following the incident.
</P>
<P>
"We gave the investigation team a relatively limited time of
two or three weeks to investigate the matter. After that, real
steps to resolve this case will be taken," Marzuki noted.
</P>
<P>
On September 6, hundreds of East Timorese militias attacked the
UNHCR office in Atambua, killing three U.N. workers.
</P>
<P>
On September 8, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution,
urging the Indonesian government to disarm and disband the East
Timorese militias who are living in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has set up Wednesday as the deadline
for East Timorese militias to surrender their weapons to the
government.
</P>
<P>
The East Timorese militias and many refugees entered Indonesia
last year following a ballot in August during which most people
voted for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
There are still about 130,000 East Timorese refugees in
Indonesia, most of them are in West Timor bordering with East
Timor.

<HEADLINE> Chile Demands U.S. Provide Secret Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government has
demanded the United States provide copies of documents that link
Chile's former secret police chief General Manuel Contreras to the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
</P>
<P>
"We have presented a note to the American government to get
their explanation about some situations," Chilean Foreign Minister
Soledad Alvear said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A special report prepared recently for the U.S Congress by the
CIA, said that Contreras not only supplied the U.S intelligence
community with information about Chile's armed services from 1974
to 1977, but also hoped to be paid for his efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, CIA officials finally decided not to
put Contreras onto the payroll because of his hard-line policies,
but the agency did give him a single, undisclosed monetary payment
for his collaboration.
</P>
<P>
The report caused a very strong reaction in Chilean society,
which asked American authorities to make a more clear explanation.
</P>
<P>
Chilean President Ricardo Lagos said on Monday that "history
will judge the CIA's intervention in Chile's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
Contreras is serving a prison sentence for his involvement in
the 1976 car bomb assassination of Orlando Letelier, then foreign
minister of the government of former President Salvador Allende.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Company Drops Sponsorship to Irish Snooker Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Irish cigarette maker Gallaher
Ltd said in Dublin on Tuesday the company was withdrawing its
sponsorship of the Benson and Hedges Irish Masters snooker
tournament following recent government moves to ban tobacco
advertising.
</P>
<P>
A division of Britain's Gallaher Group Plc which makes Benson
and Hedges and Silk Cut cigarettes, the company said the annual
tournament may now be lost unless an alternative sponsor could be
found.
</P>
<P>
Anti-smoking lobbies welcomed the decision.
</P>
<P>
Peter McDonnell, a solicitor who represents victims of smoking
including former world snooker champion Alex Higgins who is
battling throat cancer, said in a statement: "Up to 7,000 people
die from smoking-related illnesses in this country every year."
</P>
<P>
"Cigarette companies have been associated with sports not out
of any gesture of good corporate citizenship but because of the
image it allowed them to create for their products."
</P>
<P>
McDonnell said he believed the tournament could find other
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government decided this year to outlaw tobacco
industry advertising and sports sponsorship, anticipating European
Union laws which plan to phase out almost all tobacco promotion
and sponsorship by 2006.

<HEADLINE> Prost F-1 Team Lose Major Sponsorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The major sponsor of Alain
Prost's Formula One racing team has decided to pull out, which
would end a three-year-long partnership.
</P>
<P>
French tobacco brand Gauloises Blondes has sponsored the Prost
since 1997 and this season's backing runs to an estimated 21.82
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But after a disappointing 2000 campaign in which the team have
failed to score a world championship point, Gauloises Blondes
decided to quit.
</P>
<P>
"The benefits of the partnership with Prost Grand Prix do not
justify the constantly rising investment required by this type of
sponsorship," a company statement said.
</P>
<P>
Four times world champion Prost, who has just signed a two-year
engine deal with Ferrari to replace his current Peugeot power-
units, said he was not surprised by the news.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman described the relationship between the team and
Gauloises Blondes as "friendly and open".
</P>
<P>
But he knew that an end would come sooner or later. "The end
of their sponsorship is not at all a surprise and I have been
prepared for it a long time," he said.

<HEADLINE> Don't Party Ahead of Time, Schumacher Warns Fans </HEADLINE>

<P>
ROME, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Michael Schumacher warned
Ferrari fans against thinking the world drivers' title was in the
bag because anything could happen.
</P>
<P>
"Let's take it easy when we talk about everything being a done
deal," he said in an interview with Rome newspaper La Repubblica.
The interview was published on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"As we say in Germany, it's too early to pack your bags. I
never party ahead of time. I never do it. The numbers still don't
put us in the clear," he said.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher led home Brazilian teammate Rubens Barrichello in
the U.S. Grand Prix on Sunday. He is now leading by eight points
over McLaren's defending champion Mika Hakkinen.
</P>
<P>
With two races left in Japan and Malaysia, Schumacher is hot
favored to win for Ferrari its first drivers' crown since South
African Jody Scheckter in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"It's true we have a privileged position but you should never
lose concentration," he said.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher said "nothing is ever certain in Formula One",
comparing it to a "puzzle with 3,000 pieces."
</P>
<P>
"With the Ferrari I have in my hands, I can win everywhere. I
will try to do it next in Japan and then finally we can start the
party," he added.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Heritage Untouched in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Most of the heritage left by
Jewish people half a century ago still exists in China despite
conclusions from Western scholars that it was destroyed after the
founding of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey in Harbin, capital of northeast China's
Heilongjiang province, shows that hundreds of buildings, which
were built by Jews in the early 20th century, such as banks,
residences, shops, synagogues and beadhouses have not changed in
appearance.
</P>
<P>
The biggest Jewish cemetery in the Far East spreads calmly in
the city. People can easily identify names and biographies
inscribed on 700 tomb tablets in Hebrew, as well as Jewish
hexagrams, now the symbol of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Harbin Archives has preserved 5,000 Jewish files written in
different European languages. To the disappointment of archivists,
the files have not been noticed by Western scholars.
</P>
<P>
"Westerners know little about Jewish people in China, creating
a vacancy for the study of Jewish history in the world," said
Zhang Tiejiang, a scholar with the Heilongjiang Social Sciences
Academy.
</P>
<P>
European Jews first entered China via a business route in the
11th century and many of them settled down in the former capital
of Kaifeng in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of last century, some 60,000 Russian Jews came
to northeast China to help construct railway networks.
</P>
<P>
They soon became the operators of China's first banks, shops
and cinemas in Harbin, the largest Jew inhabited city in Asia at
the time.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, Shanghai became an asylum for European
Jews who fled Adolf Hitler's hands. The city still preserves a
synagogue and some other Jewish sites. The municipal government
and universities have recently set up a Jewish museum and two
research societies.
</P>
<P>
Besides staying in China as permanent citizens, many Jews left
the country during World War II. It was reported that a Chinese
envoy to Berlin had signed dozens of thousands of visas for Jewish
people.
</P>
<P>
"There was a harmonious relationship between Jews and Chinese
half a century ago. After the Jews left China, the Chinese people
have been voluntarily protecting their heritage. The government
has this year issued an order to ban the destruction of Jewish
sites as their offspring would one day visit them," said Gao
Yingxiang, deputy secretary-general of the Harbin City People's
Government.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Jewish people left China after World War II
ended. Jews with a Chinese background and their offspring now
mainly live in the Middle East, Australia, Europe and the United
States. Many of them are political and financial celebrities.
</P>
<P>
In Israel, they established a "Harbin Jews Society". A number
of Jewish people began visiting their parents' old residences in
China in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Chinese president Jiang Zemin who was
visiting Israel said that Chinese and Jews have formed friendly
ties since ancient times and that China will do its best to push
forward the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
China and Israel have increased cooperation in the fields of
technology, agriculture, aviation and telecommunications. Trade
volume between the two countries reached 600 million U.S. dollars
last year, more than 20 times that of 1992 when they established
diplomatic relations.

<HEADLINE> Afforestation at Headstreams of Yangtze Pays Off (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China's effort to curb eco-
environmental deterioration at the headstreams of the Yangtze
River, China's longest, has paid off.
</P>
<P>
A recent satellite remote sensing survey shows that the amount
of eroded soil in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and Chongqing
Municipality has been reduced to 1.3 billion tons from 1.5 billion
tons, a drop of 11 percent. Forest coverage in the region has
risen from 28 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhongwei, director of the Yangtze River Water Resources
Committee, attributed the change to the comprehensive treatment of
soil erosion at various levels in the region and a nationwide
afforestation campaign.
</P>
<P>
China has invested tens of billions of yuan over the past
decade in reducing soil erosion and building tree belts along the
upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
To date, 60,000 square kilometers of eroded fields have been
turned into fertile farmland. The amount of land covered with
grass and trees has risen from 22 percent to 41 percent. Farmers'
per capita annual net income has climbed to over 2,000 yuan on
average thanks to profits from building orchards and to the higher
grain output on improved farmland.

<P>
Huize County, which is adjacent to the Jinsha River, a major
tributary of Yangtze, planted trees on 200,000 hectares of land in
the past 10 years, expanding plant coverage from 17 percent to 32
percent of the county's total area.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhongyou, a 58-year-old farmer in Huize County, said: "In
the past, my family opened up new farmland every year, but we
found it harder to live when rivers dried up and forest
disappeared."
</P>
<P>
"Inspired by the government-initiated 'grain for green' program,
I have converted 2.6 ha. of low-yielding farmland into green areas.
Consequently, flour and rice have replaced sweet potato as the
staple food of the family," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River, known as the cradle of the Chinese nation,
runs through 11 provinces and cities with a total length of 6,300
kilometers. The river valley covers a quarter of China's total
farmland, one-third of its population and two-fifths of its total
industrial and agricultural output value.
</P>
<P>
However, the region suffers from serious water and soil erosion
due to land degradation, overgrazing and deforestation.
</P>
<P>
Shi Liren, a water conservation expert, warned that the eco-
environment at the upper reaches of the Yangtze River is still
quite fragile, despite improvement over the past few years. It is
a long-term and arduous task to restore the environment in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The State Forestry Administration plans to invest 100 billion
yuan in an afforestation project along the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River and the Yellow River in the upcoming 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are also drafting their own plans to convert
crop-fields into forest and grass land.

<HEADLINE> Hostage Rescue Operation Hits Snag in Philippines by Pan Jiaxu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' military
operation to rescue the 17 hostages still held by the Abu Sayyaf
on Jolo island has met "unexpected" difficulties, while the
military admitted the operation will take longer time.
</P>
<P>
Military officials were reported Wednesday as saying that they
had been over-confident about completing the rescue operation
within the one-week time frame set by the government
</P>
<P>
"We have been overly optimistic in estimating how long it will
take. But the problem is more difficult than we expected, so I am
accepting that responsibility," Angelo Reyes, chief of staff of
the Armed Forces said.
</P>
<P>
He said the enemy had a more accurate knowledge of the terrain
on the 897 square-kilometer jungle-clad island, adding that bad
weather also hampered the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada, however, defended the military over
its failure to crush the Abu Sayyaf within one week, saying that
the military officials and soldiers were "doing their best."
</P>
<P>
"I gave one week deadline at the beginning but because of the
unforeseen circumstances like three days of bad weather, the
operation was hampered. But they are working hard," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Instead of issuing another deadline, Estrada said he would just
monitor and await the conclusion of the ongoing rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
The military operation started on September 16. Four days later,
two French journalists were able to escape from their Abu Sayyaf
captors.
</P>
<P>
The hostage crisis began on April 23 with a cross-border
abduction of 21 people, mostly foreigners, from the Sipadan resort
in neighboring Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
All the Sipadan hostages except one Filipino have been freed.
But the Muslim rebels continued to take new hostages. Still in
their captivity are 13 Filipinos, three Malaysians and one
American.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the bad weather and the terrain problem as listed by
the military, some analysts say, the rescue operation has been
prolonged due to two more decisive factors.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, they say, the military missed their best chance to
complete its mission on the first day of the attack, allowing the
Abu Sayyaf to have time to move the hostages away.
</P>
<P>
According to the analysts, once the bandits had time to take
the hostages away from the spot which was already identified
before launching the offensive, the terrain problem inevitably
works since the bandits are all locally grown up.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, they point out, the mounting civilian casualties also
weigh heavily in the all-out military operations.
</P>
<P>
Although the military killed more than 100 Abu Sayyaf members
in the past 11 days of combat operations, there were also seven
civilians killed, dozens of others wounded, in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
A military report said the fighting have also forced a total of
36,313 villagers to flee their homes and only some 14,000, or 40
percent of the refugees, were receiving relief aid.
</P>
<P>
The grave impact on local residents is a factor the government
has to take into account especially as the military action
resulted in no progress in hostage rescue.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a military spokesman said the rescue of the 17
hostages may take a few more weeks or a month. Presidential
Spokesman Ricardo Puno also said Tuesday that no deadlines were
given to the military to
finish the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
This, analysts say, means that the government has turned to
choose a more effective but longer way, instead of the blitz-like
massive military assault, to rescue the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The military also said all the hostages are alive and still in
Jolo, dismissing rumors that the abductors and their hostages have
slipped through a naval blockade around the island.
</P>
<P>
However, there were no words about the fate and whereabouts of
the hostages, causing worries from Malaysia over the safety of the
Malaysian hostages.
</P>
<P>
"I am getting very worried and anxious now. What is happening
to my three Malaysian hostages?" Malaysia's ambassador to the
Philippines Mohammad Arshad said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the military asked people to be more patient on the
difficult situation and more confident of their ability.
</P>
<P>
"Please allow us to continue doing this job the best way we
know how. We ask you to be patient," said the chief of staff of
the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, on his part, said the
military can not stop the operation because the government has to
"stop this vicious cycle," referring to the Abu Sayyaf's tricks to
release hostages and then kidnap new ones.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said the military operation now focuses on "objective,
not timetable," still confidence it will end soon.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Former President's Son Gets 18-Month Jail Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Supreme Court has
ruled that former president Soeharto's youngest son Hutomo "Tommy"
Mandala Putra and a business colleague Ricardo Gelael be jailed
for 18 months over a land scam involving the National Logistics
Agency (Bulog).
</P>
<P>
"That is what I have heard and I went to the Supreme Court
today (Tuesday) (to find out more), but could not get a copy of
the ruling," Tommy's lawyer Nudirman Munir was quoted by national
newspapers Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Munir said he would file a request with the Supreme Court for a
review of the case as soon as he receive a copy of the verdict.
</P>
<P>
"The ruling is unfair as there was no evidence to prove my
client caused losses to the state," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tommy and Gelael were both accused of having tried to enrich
themselves to the detriment of the state.
</P>
<P>
In October 1999, the South Jakarta District Court exonerated
Tommy and Gelael, both executives of the wholesale firm PT Goro
Batara Sakti, of all corruption charges related to the 1995 land
exchange deal with Bulog, citing a lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta appeals court had upheld the South Jakarta District
Court which had freed the two of the charges.
</P>
<P>
Munir said he had been informed by court sources that the
Supreme Court had overturned the ruling of a lower court.
</P>
<P>
Tommy has been surrounded by controversy lately, culminating in
President Abdurrahman Wahid ordering his arrest by the National
Police. The president did not provide any reasons for the order,
but many believed it was connected with the bomb blast at the
Jakarta Stock Exchange building earlier this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar exported a total of
342,000 tons of various beans and pulses, including popular Matpe
and Pedesein, in the first six months of this year, dropping by 11.
4 percent compared with the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>

In 1999, the country exported 685,800 tons of beans and pulses
and foreign exchange earned represented 17.72 percent of the total
export value then.

Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is also known as the third largest exporter of beans
and pulses in the world.

<HEADLINE> Italy Supports Lifting Sanctions Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini on Tuesday confirmed Italy's support for lifting
sanctions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Italy has always been in favor of suspending, if not totally
lifting these sanctions, at least the ones on fuels," Dini told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Dini added that Rome "had already suggested that the European
Union make a radical revision of its position on Serbia," and that
ending sanctions is a question also involving other important
countries, such as the United States and Russia, which are members
of the Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
Dini said even the Yugoslav opposition has asked that some of
the sanctions be removed, in particular those dealing with oil
imports.
</P>
<P>
Aside from oil, sanctions against Belgrade include a United
Nations' ban on sales of military materiel, diplomatic isolation,
the freezing of Yugoslav federal and Serb assets in Europe as well
as those of the companies close to President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
According to Yugoslavia's State Election Commission, opposition
leader Vojislav Kostunica finished first with 48.22 percent in
Sunday's election, while Milosevic was second with 40.23 percent.
With neither candidate receiving 50 percent of the vote, a runoff
has been scheduled for October 8.

<P>
CARACAS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Libyan Energy Minister
Abadalla al-Badri said the decision by the U.S. government to
release 30 million barrels of oil from its strategic reserve was
made at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remark on Tuesday in Caracas after Friday
's U.S. announcement to use its strategic oil reserve in an
attempt to ease tension on the world market caused by soaring oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan official said the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) could be forced to cut back production
if oil prices fall after the U.S. decision.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, al-Badri expressed his appreciation over
efforts made by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to keep "fair"
oil prices at this time.
</P>
<P>
Al-Badri did not specify suitable oil prices, but the reference
price band of OPEC is 22-28 U.S. dollars, which is believed by
OPEC member countries to be a suitable and sustainable floating
price range.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan oil minister is currently in Caracas for a two-day
OPEC summit, which begins on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> IOC Won't Change Decision against Raducan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee said Wednesday that that won't change decision against
Romanian gymnast Andreea Raducan who has been stripped of a gold
medal for taking a head-cold tablet.
</P>
<P>
The IOC officials expressed their sympathy for the sweet
gymnast, but said that they could abide by the rules.
</P>
<P>
They admitted the tiny 16-year-old was the victim of an
accident and gained no benefit from the pills, they stuck to a
firm "rules are rules" line.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the worst experiences I have had in my Olympic
life," IOC executive board member Dr Jacques Rogge said.
</P>
<P>
"Having to strip the gold medal from the individual gymnastic
champion for something she did not intentionally do is very tough.
But the rules are the rules."
</P>
<P>
Rogge said he was also disappointed Raducan's teammates Simona
Amanar and Maria Olaru, who finished second and third, had
returned their medals in protest over the decision to revoke
Raducan's title.
</P>
<P>
The 1.48m and 37kg Raducan was found to have traces of
pseudoephedrine exceeding permitted levels when tested after she
won her gold medal last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IOC accepted it was the fault of the Romanian team
physician Ioachim Oana who mistakenly gave her two over-the-
counter cold remedy tablets.
</P>
<P>
But IOC media director Francois Carrard said the Olympic
movement could not allow sympathy to divert its anti-drugs
campaign.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how sad this can be in an individual case ... the
mere presence in an athlete of a prohibited substance constitutes
doping and as such contains automatically the invalidation of the
result," Carrard said.

<HEADLINE> Poor Farmers Better-Off Through Migration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 80,000 farmers have
got rid of poverty by migrating out of the Mount Shi area, one of
China's poorest areas, in Baise district, southwest China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
"The best way out of poverty for residents in Mount Shi area is
to resettle in some resources-rich areas," said Huang Aiguo,
director of the local Aid-the-Poor Office.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard and costly to tap this harsh area in need of water,
roads and resources."
</P>
<P>
Baise is one of the 18 poorest regions in China with
mountainous areas accounting for over 95 percent of the total land
area.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that of the total 82,300 migrants from Baise
since 1993, about 78,500 farmers have been able to earn an annual
income of 1,000 yuan (about 120 US dollars) on average, which
guarantees basic food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Local government has also provided necessary fund for migrants
to move houses, building new homes and buying seeds.
</P>
<P>
"We mainly plant cash crops, including longan and sugarcane
which are planted in areas at low altitude, and walnut and
chestnut in areas at higher altitude.
</P>
<P>
Farmers remaining in Baise have also become better-off as less
population enjoy more resources.
</P>
<P>
The number of poor farmers in Baise totaled 1.87 million in
1990, accounting for 60 percent of the rural population, but now
the rate has dropped to 4 percent".

WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Two teenage students were
seriously injured in a school shooting on Tuesday in New Orleans,
Louisiana, USA.
</P>
<P>
The two boys, ages 13 and 15, shot at each other with the same

<HEADLINE> Mexico Confident of Stability in Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Mexico, an independent
oil producer from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), is confident that a rapid stabilization of the
world oil market is possible to achieve.
</P>
<P>
Mexican Secretary of Energy and Mines Luis Tellez said in
statement on Tuesday that the current high oil price of over 30 U.
S. dollars per barrel has jeopardized the economic growth of the
world and of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Tellez said that years of depressed oil prices have led to low
investments in the sector and the oil industry has faced many
hardships in the past.
</P>
<P>
He believes the U.S. release of 30 million barrels of reserved
crude will help stabilize oil prices in the short term,
considering the prospects for greater consumption during the
impending winter.
</P>
<P>
Tellez predicted that oil prices will stay high because of the
low level of inventories, though supply surpasses demand.
</P>
<P>
OPEC announced that after October 1, it will increase oil
production by 800,000 barrels daily (bpd) to stabilize prices at
levels of 22 to 28 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, whose finances are dependent on internal and external
sales of oil, extracts 3.4 million bpd of oil, 53 percent of which
is for export.
</P>
<P>
Oil represented 32.5 percent of Mexico's tax earnings in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Secretariat of Energy and Mines announced that Mexico would
raise production to 3.7 million bpd by the end of the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall On Earnings Warning From Kodak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
again Tuesday as a profit warning from Eastman Kodak increased
worries about investment returns in a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 175.82 at 10,632.
33 points, extending its loss of 39.22 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 53.27 at 3,687.80 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 8.90 at 1,430.13.
</P>
<P>
The market plunged after Kodak announced that its third-quarter
earnings will be below the expectations because of rising material
costs, weakness in euro, the common European currency, and other
factors.
</P>
<P>
The latest warning of disappointing earnings hit both blue
chips and tech shares. Investors got concerned about investment
returns after the first batch of companies warned earlier this
month that their earnings in the third quarter will not meet the
Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
Concerns about the price of oil and the weakening euro in the
recent days intensified worries about corporate earnings and
investment returns. The price of sweet crude was 31.53 U.S.
dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange Tuesday, down
nearly seven dollars last week but worries about its effect on
corporate profits remained.
</P>
<P>
While stocks of manufacturers and retailers were lower, energy
issues were higher. Among them were Halliburton, Exxon Mobil and
Enron.
</P>
<P>
Some tech issues also moved higher. Microsoft rose after the
Supreme Court ruled that the software maker's appeal of its
antitrust case should be heard in lower court.
</P>
<P>
Handheld computer maker Palm was also higher. But Intel fell
for the third consecutive session after the chipmaker issued a
profit warning late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 4.65 at 654.83 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 0.56 at 928.45. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 5.49 at 509.89.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-6 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,604 down, 1,284 up and 487
unchanged.

NYSE volume increased to 1.09 billion shares from 977.53

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has seized contraband
valued at over 126 million naira (about 1.2 million U.S. dollars)
from suspected smugglers between January and June this year,
according to a senior customs official on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Gwangwazo, the public relations officer of the Nigeria
Customs Service (NCS), told the media in the capital Abuja that
the service made 153 seizures during the period and the related 46
suspects had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Gwangwazo said the NCS had concluded arrangements to prosecute
the suspects.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the seized goods included used vehicles, second
hand clothes, tires and automobiles spare-parts.
</P>
<P>
The NCS would re-double its efforts to curb smuggling as it is
an economic crime that could ruin the country's economy, he said,
adding that "our resolve to fight smuggling is irrevocable".

<HEADLINE> Britain Provides 40 Million Pounds Aid for Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
agreed to provide 40 million pounds to Ghana to aid the country's
development and poverty reduction programs, the Ghana News Agency
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed in the capital Accra, the
first 18 million pounds of the funding would be released
immediately, while a further seven million would be available
before the end of this year, and the balance would be disbursed in
two equal installments in June and December of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Ghanaian Deputy Minister of Finance Victor Selormey said after
the signing ceremony that Ghana's development partners were
encouraged to provide the assistance because there was evidence
that the government has been seriously exploring avenues and
putting in place measures to ease the burden on the people.
</P>
<P>
He commended Britain for her continued and unflinching support
when most countries have reduced theirs.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the government's commitment to its objective
of stabilizing and restoring growth of its economy, and expressed
the hope that the sacrifices would yield high dividends in the
very near future.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Kill Another 3500 Animals in Foot-and-Mouth Disease Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- About 3,500 animals are
to be killed on Wednesday to create a depopulated area of three
kilometer wide around the two farms which suffered an outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease earlier in month.
</P>
<P>
The Foot and Mouth Disease Control Center in the country said
almost 3000 pigs, 400 cattle and some sheep and goats would be
slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
The center said killing the animals in the surrounding area of
the quarantine region in Camperdown, KwaZulu Natal of the country
might minimize the risk of the disease's possible spreading out.
</P>
<P>
"Such an approach is regarded as absolutely essential not only
for the local farming community, but for the entire agricultural
industry in South Africa," the control center said.
</P>
<P>
The foot-and-mouth virus was first detected on a Camperdown pig
farm on September 15, prompting officials to have killed about
700 pigs immediately.
</P>
<P>
Last week officials were confident the highly contagious
disease had been contained, but on Friday a cow on an adjacent
farm was tested positive, leading to the further destruction of 53
head of cattle on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of the trade-sensitive disease threatens South
Africa's meat industry. Botswana, Singapore, Mauritius and Namibia
have already banned livestock and animal products from South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is believed the disease was brought to South Africa in pig
swill from a ship which docked in Durban harbor. It was possibly
imported from India, Thailand or the Middle East, where the foot-
and-mouth strain was detected earlier, according to reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The two-time defending
champions Cuba will again clash with the United States in the gold
medal match of the Olympic baseball tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban team, which hold a win-loss record in the Olympics
since baseball became an official Olympic sport in 1992, entered
the tournament as prohibitive favorites and haven't disappointed.
</P>
<P>
They have shown the form that made them near-perennial world
champions, indluding their 3-0 defeat of Japan in the semifinals
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite their dominating record, the Cubans have shown glimpses
of vulnerability. During the preliminary pool play, they dropped
a game to lightly regarded the Netherlands, halting their 21-game
Olympic winning streak.
</P>
<P>
The American team will try to loosen the Cuban stranglehold on
the gold. They are keen to improve upon their mediocre Olympic
record compared to the country's rich baseball history. The
American team only had a bronze medal from 1996 Atlanta Olympic
Games.

SYDNEY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Canadian women and Australian
men look to dominate the canoe/kayak sprint heats in the Sydney
Olympic Games at the Sydney international Regatta Center on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the first heat of the k1 500m event, Akos Vereckei of
Hungary will be the clear favorite in the men's field. His arch-
rival will be Michael Kologanov of Israel.
</P>
<P>
In the men's k2 500m race, DAniel Collins and Andrew Trim, the
Olympic bronze medalists in 1996 and world champions in 1997, have
a good chance to win the gold for Australia. The German Olympic
gold medalists Kan Bluhm and Torsten Gutsche retired from
competing but their successors Ronald Rauche and Tim Wieskoetter,
who won the European title of the event, are strong oppositions.
</P>
<P>
The current world champion and favorite of the women's k1 500m
CAroline Brunet of Canada will meet Hungarian Rita Koban, the
defending champion and current European champion in her heat. The
kayakers only have to finish in the top three to qualify directly
for the final on Sunday.

SYDNEY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The women's quarterfinals
begin on Wednesday while the Olympic basketball tournament moves
to the SuperDome.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Australia, which finished undefeated after the
preliminary rounds, is first up in the 20,000-seat stadium. It
will face Poland, whose 2.13m center Malgorzata Dydek leads the
competition in scoring, rebounds and blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
The Australians are in excellent form and if they can contain
Dydek, they should have too much depth and experience for Poland.
</P>
<P>
The second quarterfinal match will be played between Russia and
Brazil. It could be the game of the tournament so far between two
very evenly matched teams.
</P>
<P>
Russia has an edge in rebounds, assists and blocked shots,
while Brazil has a superior defensive record and commits fewer
turnovers than the Russian team.
</P>
<P>
France and the United States are favored to beat their

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Yemen to Fight Rift Valley Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Yemen have
decided to join hands in fighting against the killer epidemic of
Rift Valley Fever (RVF), which has claimed dozens of lives in both
countries, the official SPA news agency reported Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced in a joint press conference of Saudi
Minister of Agriculture and Water Resources Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz
Bin Muammar and his Yemeni counterpart Ahmed Salim Al-Jabali held
after their meeting in the southern Saudi port of al-Tawal.
</P>
<P>
Muammar said a joint technical committee had been formed to
coordinate the efforts to combat the fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
He called for cooperation from the people of both countries to
the concerted efforts of the two sides to eliminate the epidemic
virus.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Al-Jabali said it was the first time RVF hits the
region, a matter which necessitated international assistance.
</P>
<P>
RVF virus is transmitted from livestock to human by mosquitoes.
It causes high fever, diarrhea, nausea, internal bleeding and
dysfunction of kidneys that can result in death.
</P>
<P>
RVF, first identified in Kenya in 1930, began to hit the
southern Saudi city of Jizan, near the border with Yemen, early
this month.
</P>
<P>
The disease was believed to have been brought into Saudi Arabia
through cattles imported from Africa or through people already
infected with it.
</P>
<P>
The disease has claimed 33 lives in Saudi Arabia and 31 lives in
Yemen. Over 100 people have also been infected by the virus in each
of the two countries.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein
announced Wednesday evening that he has decided to drop all
criminal charges against former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
including bribery, grand larceny, fraud, breach of trust and
obstruction of justice.
</P>

The ruling cleared the way for Netanyahu to return to the
spotlight after his short "time-out" from the political arena in
the wake of last year's humiliating general election defeat by
incumbent Prime Minister Barak. (Israel-Netanyahu-Charges)

GAZA -- The Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) on Wednesday
vehemently denounced the planned visit to the Temple Mount by Ariel
Sharon, leader of the Israeli right-wing Likud party, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement distributed to the mass media, the PLC termed
this "provocative visit" at this sensitive stage as a blatant
violation of Islamic sanctities and an insult to the feelings of
the Palestinians and Arab and Muslim nation.
</P>
<P>
It said that Sharon's visit to the site, which hosts various
Islamic holy spots such as the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa
Mosque, would escalate tensions in the region. (Palestine-Temple

<HEADLINE> UN Mission Head Dismisses Nigerian Involvement in Diamond-Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 27 (Xinhua) --Head of the United Nations Peace
Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) has dismissed an accusation that
Nigerian peace keepers were involved in the diamond smuggling as "
unfound and uncharitable", reports available here on Wednesday
said.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted UNAMSIL head Olu Adeniji as saying during a
trip in here on Tuesday that the accusation by UN peace keeping
force commander in Sierra Leone Major-General V. Jetley was aimed
to cover his failure and incompetence in the peace keeping mission.
</P>
<P>
Adeniji, a Nigerian and special representative of the UN
Secretary-general Kofi Annan in Sierra Leone, stressed that no
Nigerian soldier was anywhere near the diamond mining areas in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
In a leaked report allegedly compiled by Jetley, the Indian UN
peace keeping force commander accused three senior Nigerian
officers with UNAMSIL of involvement in diamond-smuggling
activities with Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front (
RUF).
</P>
<P>
Adeniji noted that he had made cautions a couple of times on
the way the Indian general had directed the multi-national force
in Sierra Leone, adding the general had failed to consult officers
of other nationalities other than his indian colleagues.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that it was the lack of consultation and
proper leadership that led to the abduction of about 500 UN peace
keepers by the RUF in May.

<HEADLINE> British Government Pledges More School Repairs, Nursery Places </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The education secretary told the ruling Labor's annual
conference in England's southern coastal town of Brighton that
some 600 schools would be transformed or replaced, with 7.8
billion pounds (11.3 billion U.S. dollars) being spent over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
Some 11,000 schools have had work done under the modernization
program and several thousand more are currently being repaired, he
said, adding now another 7,000 will benefit.
</P>
<P>
"Our job is to ensure that every school is a good school --
that the roof doesn't leak, that the heating works, that the
children are warm, that temporary classrooms are replaced, that
schools are refurbished," Blunkett said.
</P>
<P>
He said the investment in nursery education will increase to 2
billion pounds (2.9 billion dollars) by 2003-4 from the current
levels of around 1.6 billion pounds (2.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
All three-year-old children in England and Wales will be
guaranteed a free part-time nursery place from September 2004,
amounting to five two-and-a-half hour sessions a week, he added.
</P>
<P>
Blunkett told delegates that he wanted nursery education to
become universal and as natural as primary and secondary education.

<HEADLINE> IMF-World Bank Annual Meeting Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the World Bank ended the plenary sessions of its
annual meeting Wednesday, a day earlier than scheduled after
police clashed with thousands of protesters in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Dozens were injured during the violence as protesters went on
the rampage throwing stones at the police, who replied with water
canon and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 activists were detained, Czech police sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Trevor Andrew Manuel, chairman of the 55th Annual Meeting of
the IMF and the World Bank, said in his closing speech that during
the meeting, the finance ministers and the central bank chiefs of
182 countries discussed the challenges of economic stability,
equity and the need to reform the two global lenders.
</P>
<P>
"Our task is to turn words into deeds," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Horst Kohler said in his concluding
address that the Millennium Annual Meeting had been very
productive, not just in the formal sessions, but in many personal
encounters and discussions with constituencies within the IMF.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that globalization required cooperation, and
required institutions that organized this cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "we need to act together in partnership and
solidarity, mindful of our common humanity to make sure that
globalization translates into a better life for all," added Kohler.
</P>
<P>
World Bank Group President James D. Wolfensohn said the world
must not forget that globalization is favorable to an ever growing
number of poor countries, which is essential for maintaining peace
in the future.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the new support programs must in the future be
adjusted to condition in coordination with the receiving countries.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said that for their implementation, an intensive
cooperation between the IMF and World Bank and other multilateral
initiatives, including the private sector and non-governmental
organizations, was necessary.

<HEADLINE> British Health Secretary Pledges Anti-Cancer Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing the Labor Party conference in the southern coastal
town of Brighton, Milburn said increased funding would help more
people to survive the disease.
</P>
<P>
He was unveiling the government's National Cancer Plan, which
aims to reduce the number of deaths from the disease and improve
treatment for patients.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to increase the number of cancer specialists working
in the National Health Service (NHS) by one third over the next 10
years and to improve waiting times.
</P>
<P>
From next year, women with breast cancer will wait no more than
one month between being diagnosed with the disease and receiving
treatment, Milburn said, adding this target will be spread to
cover all cancers within a few years.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see the fastest improvement in cancer services
anywhere in Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Milburn said extra money would be made available to help those
dying from the disease. "We all know from our own communities the
very real differences hospices make to the lives of people with
cancer and their families.
</P>
<P>
Milburn also promised to tackle the health gap between rich and
poor people. "A child born into a poverty will live nine years
less than a child born into wealth. We make a new commitment to
narrow the health gap between children rich and poor," he said.
</P>
<P>
The health secretary also pledged to improve the pay of doctors
and nurses. "Britain's hospital doctors and family doctors do an
excellent job and we will pay them for that. The NHS needs its new
doctors and we will pay them accordingly," he said.

<HEADLINE> Human Negligence Seen as Key Factor in Ferry Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We cannot blame the company, nor the crew or the officers or
the structure of the company or the company's controls of its
ships for the 'blindness' of one of the ship's officer, who was on
the bridge and could not see a lighted rock, but rather he goes
head and falls on it," said Costas Kliromonos, president of Minoan
Flying Dolphins (MFD).
</P>
<P>
He said that the company had checked the 34-year-old vessel
twice following the report of the ship's engineer, who was fired a
week ago, which doubted the ship's seaworthiness.
</P>
<P>
Kliromonos said that the man was let go for tardiness and not
for his negative report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Panagiotis Kasdaglis, the sailor on the bridge of
the vessel at the time of the sea accident, said Wednesday night
that he could not attribute human error to the causes of the
accident, which has already killed at least 63 people.
</P>
<P>
He believed that gale force winds and lack of visibility caused
the accident because the ship, which had a speed of 18 knots, was
on the correct course, according to the maps, the two compasses
and the rest of the navigational equipment.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Michalis Stathopoulos has ordered a full
judicial inquiry into the causes of the disaster.
</P>
<P>
The "Express Samina" ferry carrying 447 passengers and 64 crew
rammed into a rocky outcropping and sank completely in 20 minutes
near the southern Aegean island of Paros Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The number of those killed was expected to climb higher as
hopes of finding survivors diminished as time passes because of
the bad weather conditions in the region.
</P>
<P>
This was the worst sea accident in Greece since 1965 when the
ferry "Iraklion" sank off the Aegean island of Falkonera killing
217 people.
</P>
<P>
While Greek political parties extended their condolences and
sympathy to the families of the accident victims, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, European Commission President Romano Prodi
and Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem Wednesday also expressed
their condolences to the victims' families.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Clinton touted the new data as "more good economic
news," saying it would reduce government interest payments and
keep down interest rates.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the Office of Management and Budget
said that the current year surplus would be 2.4 percent of the
gross domestic product, "the largest surplus as a share of the
economy since 1948."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the government remains on track for
Clinton's plan to eliminate the government's debt held by the
public by 2012.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the estimated surplus of at least 230 billion
dollars follows a surplus of 124 billion dollars in fiscal 1999
and 69 billion dollars in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The last time America had three surpluses in a row was over 50
years ago in 1947-49," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first surplus in the federal budget that
excludes the big social security and Medicare programs since the
medical system was established in 1965, the White House said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council's Role Irreplaceable: China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking the floor at a debate of the U.N. General Assembly on
the work of the United Nations in 1999, Wang said the council's
responsibility and political leadership for peacekeeping should be
preserved and upheld.
</P>
<P>
"The purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter as well as
other long-established principles for peacekeeping such as
neutrality, consent by parties to the conflict and non-use of
force except for self-defense should continue to be observed," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N., which has a primary responsibility for
maintaining world peace, should make more positive contributions
to stopping massive humanitarian crises and prevent the tragic
massive killings of innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, we are fully aware of the complexity of
international intervention and the risk of inappropriate
intervention," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Big powers and blocs of countries should respect the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country involved in
the conflict rather than use humanitarian intervention to
interfere in its internal affairs or trigger new conflicts," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to international security, the Chinese envoy said
global strategic stability is the foundation on which world
security rests.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. should continue to take necessary actions to prevent a
certain country's move to undermine global strategic stability
through the development of a national missile defense system,
which is a very dangerous move, Ambassador Wang said.
</P>
<P>
On the question of development, he emphasized the U.N.'s due
role in narrowing the gap between the poor and the rich and
promoting common prosperity in the international community by
putting top priority to poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan submitted his annual report
on the U.N.'s role in the 21st century to the General Assembly in
March this year, covering major challenges facing the
international community.
</P>
<P>
It served as a basic document for the Millennium Summit
convened in early September. The gathering of some 150 heads of
state or government endorsed Annan's call for meeting targets in
education, poverty reduction and HIV/AIDS prevention among others
for the next 15 to 20 years.

<P>
ATHENS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Greece said Wednesday that it
would not interfere in the second round of the presidential and
parliamentary elections in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Greece will not be involved in the pending second round of
voting in Yugoslavia," government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said
at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav people had voted and had decided, he said, adding
it appeared that changes were underway in Yugoslavia that could
help in the upgrading of the country's relations with Europe.
</P>
<P>
Reppas stated that the political forces in Yugoslavia could
deal with the second round of voting, with a sense of
responsibility and taking under consideration the country's
interest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos
reportedly said Wednesday that what the Yugoslav people needed was
to have democracy consolidated in practice to enable hope and
expectation to be created for a stable course of developments in
that country.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday's elections in Yugoslavia, both President Slobodan
Milosevic and the opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, failed
to win the 50 percent figure that would make a second round of
voting unnecessary, according to the announcement made by
Yugoslavia's Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
The second round of elections in Yugoslavia will possibly take
place on October 8.
