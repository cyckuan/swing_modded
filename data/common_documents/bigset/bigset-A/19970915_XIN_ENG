<HEADLINE> Third Generation of Party Leadership "Strong," Say Delegates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The remarkable progress China
has made in the past five years has proved that the third
generation of the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the
core is a strong and outstanding leading collective.
</P>
<P>
This is a view shared by many delegates at the on-going 15th
National Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
China has achieved rapid economic development over the recent
five years. It is exceptional in the world to have achieved "soft
landing" of the national economy while successfully curbing
inflation, said Li Zhijian, a Standing Committee member of the
Beijing Municipal Party Committee.
</P>
<P>
The facts have proven that the third generation leadership with
Jiang Zemin as the core has judged China's current situation based
on China's reality. What merits special attention is that the
leadership has specially emphasized that the greatest reality in
China is that the country has been and will be in the primary
stage of socialism in a considerably long period of time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Sixian, head of Xuhui District, Shanghai, commented that
the Party Central Committee has established an excellent image in
the international community with distinctive characteristics and
the collective leadership has handled well the relations between
reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
Ma Sizhong, provincial governor of central China's Henan
Province, said the fact in which the Party Central Committee has
steadily improved the material and cultural life of the people
over the past five years proves the leadership has full capability
to promote China's reform and opening up and socialist
construction to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Shanghai's Pudong New Area said by citing many
convincing facts from Pudong's development to support the point.
Over the past five years, Pudong's GDP has grown from 10
billion yuan in 1992 to 51 billion yuan in 1996, according to a
delegate from the booming Shanghai area.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from east China's provinces of Jiangsu and Shandong
also spoke highly of the achievements scored in their respective
provinces. They owe the achievements to holding high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the strong leadership of the
Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Blessed With Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region is to rank itself among China's richest provinces next
century, thanks to its superior resources as well as the central
government's policy favoring the development of the western parts
of the country, said a Xinjiang official here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lequan, a delegate to the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, which opened here on Friday, quoted
Jiang Zemin's report at the opening session of the congress as
saying that the government will enhance its support to the middle
and west regions, and that priority will be given to
infrastructural construction and resources exploitation in the
region.
</P>
<P>
"Xinjiang benefits much from the state policy which is
preferential to developing the country's central and west
regions," said Wang, secretary of the Xinjiang regional Party
committee.
</P>
<P>
The country has allocated a total of nearly 50 billion yuan to
tap its rich petroleum resources. So far over ten oil-fields have
been developed with a total production capacity of 17 million tons
of crude oil per year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 39 major chemical projects with a total investment of
over 30 billion yuan are being built in Xinjiang, including an
ethylene plant with an annual capacity of 140,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, the largest cotton producer in the country, vows to
turn the region into the nation's largest cotton spinning base
with an annual capacity of three million spindles, as well as a
super-large base for commercial cotton with annual production
expected to reach 1.5 billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
"Xinjiang has explored the potential markets of central Asian
countries along the border and taken advantage of the second
Asian-European continental bridge, that passes through it, to
carry out economic cooperation with foreign countries," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Covering one sixth of the country's total area, Xinjiang
borders eight countries, from India to the south to Mongolia to
the north.
</P>
<P>
"Xinjiang is shaping an export-oriented economic structure with
main focus on these bordering countries," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang boasts the country's richest resources in 29 areas,
including petroleum, coal and natural gas.

<HEADLINE> German Army Plane Crash, 24 Feared Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A German army plane has crashed
into the Atlantic Ocean off the Angola coast, probably claiming
the lives of all 24 people aboard, German Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe said here today.
</P>
<P>
"There is no hope of any survivors," Ruehe said in a news
conference here.
</P>
<P>
The Soviet-made Tupolev 154 was en route from Germany to Cape
Town in South Africa for ceremonies marking the 75th anniversary
of the South African navy.
</P>
<P>
The last radio signal received from the plane was registered
late Saturday when it was about 1,500 kilometers west of Angola.
</P>
<P>
Because no emergency signals had been sent, there was great
uncertainty over where the plane went down exactly, Ruehe said.
</P>
<P>
The search conducted by a French military aircraft and a
British plane had been fruitless so far, but another massive
search operation would be launched, he added.
</P>
<P>
Those on board were 12 German navy soldiers, 10 flight crew
members and wives of two of them.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Develops National Tourism Master Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean cabinet minister
said the government is developing a national tourism master plan
as an effort to promote the growing sector.
</P>
<P>
Mines, environment and tourism minister Simon Moyo said on
Sunday the master plan would, among other things, enhance
environmental management to ensure the protection of the
environment for the benefit of future generations.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry is also working on facilitating the realisation
of continued investment in the tourist sector in view of the fact
that there is yet untapped potential, especially in most of our
rural areas where safari tourism can take advantage of the
wildlife resource and scenery management benefits accruing from
the communal areas management programme for indigenous resources
(campfire)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts believe that growth of tourism has
caused major ecological problems particularly in areas like
Victoria Falls, the country's premier tourist resort.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has in recent years grown to become one of the major
sectors in Zimbabwe, with receipts as a percentage of gross
domestic product increasing from 2.6 percent in 1990 to 4.6
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Moyo added Zimbabwe hosts a regional investment forum in
October this year which is expected to draw tourism experts from
the Southern African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was supportive of joint venture
investments between indigenous people and foreign investors and
had put in place a number of incentives to promote development of
the industry.

<HEADLINE> Somali Factions Criticized for Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU,September 14 (xinhua)-- A local human rights
organization has today strongly criticized the Somali faction
leaders and their administration for being responsible about the
current high crime rate.
</P>
<P>
In a two page communique issued today, the North Mogadishu
based human rights organization, Dr Ismail Jumale Human Rights
Center, criticized the faction leaders for their failure to cope
with the increasing insecurity in the Somali capital which
brought about abductions, killings and torture against innocent
civilians in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The communique has demanded the unconditional release of Mr
Idiris Mohamed Osman, the head of the WFP office in Mogadishu,
who was abducted by unidentified gunmen in South Mogadishu two
days ago after performing his Friday prayers peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The Human Rights Center was bewildered that four abduction
cases in recent weeks were all victimized figures from the
minority or less armed clans in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The center especially underlines the abduction cases of the
WFP employee, Osman, the French aid agency, ACF, staff member and
the brother of a well known businessman who all belong to the
minority clans in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The communique signed by the two co-chairpersons of the human
rights center said they're concerned about the fate of Osman, the
WFP officer, whom they said was abducted for his clean
humanitarian efforts.
</P>
<P>
The human rights center said Osman has strongly opposed
corruption activities and illegal profit seeking by members from
the strong clans in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The center has called the faction leaders to stand firm
against such gross human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
Dr Ismail Jumale Human Rights Center has also accused the
faction leaders that the perpetrators of these human rights
violations are their armed supporters who repetitively commit
these crimes in the areas they control. Dr Ismail Jumale center
warned that the political assassinations, the rape, torture and
abduction in the absence of a national security institution will
not be tolerated as they will be registered and will be rewarded
one day.
</P>
<P>
The human rights center has appealed the political factions,
the traditional leaders and the intellectuals to collaborate in
preventing these crimes especially the human rights violations
against the poor defenseless minorities.
</P>
<P>
They have also called the people to work collectively towards
the restoration of the rule of law so as to secure the basic
rights of the people regardless of clans.
</P>
<P>
This is the first and strongest critics made by the local
human rights center against the faction leaders.

<HEADLINE> "Millennium Bomb" to Hit High Street Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Shoppers all over the world
could be hit by the so-called "Millennium Bomb" next month as the
first bank and credit cards are issued with expiry dates in 2000.
</P>
<P>
It is increasingly accepted that the bug, the result of the
date change from 1999 to 2000, will affect millions of ordinary
consumers, as well as computer users.
</P>
<P>
Stores and restaurants are bracing themselves for the
possibility that thousands of customers will be unable to pay,
because terminals will refuse to accept cards bearing an "00" date
unless they have been reprogramed.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the first cards will be issued in October,
after a year's delay as banks and retailers have tried to ensure
there will be no problems.
</P>
<P>
Many computers recognize the year by its last two digits, for
example, 97 for 1997.
</P>
<P>
When the date reaches 00, millions of computers worldwide will
believe the year is 1900, causing widespread chaos unless they are
reprogramed.
</P>
<P>
Visa and Mastercard, the two biggest credit card schemes, were
reported to have reprogramed more than 3.5 million terminals and
cash machines throughout Europe. But problems may still arise.
</P>
<P>
Some models of microwave oven and VCR recorder with calendars
are vulnerable to failure because of the date change and there are
fears that televisions, washing machines and toasters could also
go wrong.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer specializing in "Year 2000" issues, said, "Nobody
knows how bad it will be. I am expecting a lot of legal action."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Land Policy to Benefit Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Zimbabwean
National Land Acquisition and Minister Without Portfolio Joseph
Msika has said large estates like the Lowveld Sugar Estates,
Eastern Highlands Timber, tea and coffee plantations will be
spared from the compulsory land designation exercise.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Land Acquisition Committee in Matabeleland
south Sunday, Msika said the estates contributed immensely to the
country's agro-based economy and should not be disturbed just for
the sake of it.
</P>
<P>
"The land redistribution exercise should not be taken
emotionally, because if everyone cries to be resettled anywhere,
there is a danger that we are killing the economy," he said,
challenging blacks who wanted to take over white-owned commercial
farms to be prepared to equal or better their former owners.
</P>
<P>
He said whites should not view the exercise as racism in
reverse as the government was only trying to resolve the land
imbalance created by decades of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate that the few whites who own most of the
productive land are contributing greatly to the national economy,
but 17 years after independence it is unacceptable that a
majority of people are still landless after fighting a brutal war
of liberation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government is not going to take all the farms owned by
white people, but will only enforce the new concept of one person
one farm to ensure that no one monopolises the land," he said,
adding only in very special cases would an individual be allowed
to own a maximum of two farms.
</P>
<P>
The National Land Acquisition Committee recently identified a
total of 1,772 commercial farms countrywide, covering over 4.6
million hectares to resettle the landless peasants.
</P>
<P>
During the past 17 years, the government resettled some 70,000
people with financial assistance from Britain, which was later
withdrawn citing mismanagement of the land resettlement program.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi today voiced Tehran's support for Lebanon's resistance
against Israeli aggressions.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with his Lebanese counterpart Fares
Boueiz, Kharrazi said the Israeli regime has planned to create
a new crisis in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said that the scheme can only
be interpreted in the context of its terrorist and expansionist
objectives against the Muslims and the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Lebanon and announced Iran's readiness to support the
international and regional efforts to stop the Israeli
aggressions.
</P>
<P>
According to a report carried by the official news agency
IRNA, Boueiz appreciated Iran's attention to the Middle East
problems and to the Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
The telephone conversation came at a time when the
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is touring the region
in a bid to revive the Meddle East peace process which has been
stalled since March. Iran has been a main supporter of the
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas who have been fighting against
Israeli occupation of south Lebanon in the last active battle
front of the region.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, Philippines Sign Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and the
Philippines have signed two agreements on trade and cultural
cooperation, visiting Philippine President Fidel Ramos said today.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at a news conference that three memorandums
of understanding to promote consultations between their foreign
ministries, labor and manpower development, and reciprocal
investments were also signed today.
</P>
<P>
During the past two days, the first Philippine president ever
to visit Kuwait held discussions with Kuwaiti leaders on ways to
remove obstacles to bilateral trade, which has been shrinking in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 Kuwaiti-Philippine trade slid to only 34 million
U.S. dollars compared with 202.4 million in 1992. Ramos said he
saw a big potential of economic and trade exchanges between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the memo to facilitate labor and manpower development, the
president hoped that more opportunities would be created for
technical and professional Filipinos to work in Kuwait. The
oil-rich Gulf state now hosts 60,000 Filipinos mainly working as
house maids.
</P>
<P>
Ramos expressed the belief that through his visit to Kuwait,
bilateral relations would be further strengthened and trade and
investment opportunities generated for both Kuwait and his
country.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, the chambers of commerce and industry of the
two countries were expected to sign a protocol of agreement on
promotion and encouragement of mutual investment between the
private sectors of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ramos arrived here Saturday morning at the second leg of his
four-nation tour which has taken him to Russia, and will take him
to the Czech Republic and Austria. He is expected to leave for
Prague, Czech, early Monday morning.

<HEADLINE> GCC Foreign Ministers Meet in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states met in southern Saudi
resort city of Abha today mainly to discuss issues of improving
relations with Iran, the Middle East peace process and regional
security.
</P>
<P>
Reports by Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) from Abha said that
Chairman of the 64th GCC ministerial meeting, Qatari Foreign
Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem Al-Thani expressed the hope at
the inaugural session that relations between the GCC and Iran
would develop in the future.
</P>

turn with the election of moderate Mohamad Khatami as new
Iranian president.
</P>
<P>
Kuna said the ministers would also discuss economic and
environmental issues, and the unifying customs tariffs which has
so far covered 94.5 percent of the total goods in GCC states will
also be emerged in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting started after the ministers held talks with
visiting State Secretary of the United States of America
Madeleine Albright earlier today during which the ministers
welcomed her efforts to revive the Middle East peace process
while Albright urged the GCC states to take part in the Doha

<HEADLINE> Albright Hopes GCC Members to Attend Doha Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright today expressed the hope that all the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) member states will attend the 4th
Middle East and North Africa economic summit to be held in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
She made the remark while meeting foreign ministers of the
GCC states in the southern Saudi resort city of Abha, Kuwait News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I want to reiterate strongly our hope that members of the
council will participate in this year's Middle East and North
Africa Summit, which the government of Qatar was graciously
agreed to host," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
She added "the efforts to increase regional economic
cooperation is not, as see to suggest, a kind of concession to
Israel. It is a vital underpinning to the long term prospects for
peace."
</P>
<P>
"The Doha summit is another opportunity to convey a message
to the world that the Middle East can be a source of economic
dynamism and opportunity and that the Gulf states are active in
diversifying their own interests and building regional
prosperity," the U.S. secretary of state noted.
</P>
<P>
GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), Qatar, Oman and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Ben Jassem Bin
Jaber al Thani today affirmed at the meeting his country's
resolve to hold the controversial summit, saying the meeting will
be held in November as scheduled despite difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and the UAE had announced their intention to
boycott the summit due to Israel's participation. So far, Kuwait,
Bahrain and Oman have not publicly expressed their attitudes to
the summit yet.
</P>
<P>
But Gulf diplomats said Kuwait and Bahrain also favor a
boycott, while Oman plans to attend the summit due to be
held in the Qatari capital Doha.
</P>
<P>
Albright is currently on a Mideast tour, which includes
Israel, Palestinian self-rule areas, Syria, Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Her maiden trip to the region aimed at reviving the stalled
Mideast peace process that came to a halt since Israel began
construction of a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in
March.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Demands Change in Turkish Stand on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides has called on the international community to bring about
a shift in Turkey's policy to facilitate a settlement to the
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Clerides was quoted by Cyprus News Agency as speaking at a
rally today in a village located in south east of the island, that
"if the international community moves decisively in the direction
of Ankara to persuade it to abandon its intransigent positions and
adopt a constructive approach, I am sure that we can look to the
future with optimism."
</P>
<P>
Clerides pledged to continue his own positive and constructive
policy in the interests of a solution as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We shall continue to be consistent and work wisely and with
resolve, taking into account the just cause of our struggle," the
President added.
</P>
<P>
He said the initiative to push for a Cyprus solution is
expected to culminate early next year, after the presidential
elections, due in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led two rounds of direct talks between President
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, held in
July and August, ended in failure due to Denktash's refusal to
further negotiate a settlement until the European Union (EU)
postpones a decision to begin accession talks with Cyprus early
next year.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, we are working to better prepare future
talks and render them effective this time," Clerides noted.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Turkish moves to block Cyprus' course toward
accession of the EU, the President said these were "not only
ineffective but also helped the EU to reiterate its stand
that our course to Europe will not be halted and that
membership talks will begin as scheduled in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when
the island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took
over the northern third in the wake of a failed coup by
Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Interior Ministry OKs Controversial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Interior Ministry
today cleared the way for a highly controversial Jewish
housing project in East Jerusalem's Ras Amud Arab neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's Construction Appeal Committee rejected an appeal
against the project filed by two council members of the
Jerusalem Municipality, who argued that the building permit was
not legally issued and the project would have disastrous
political ramifications if carried out.
</P>
<P>
But the committee ruled today that the permit to the American
millionaire buyer Irwing Moscowitz was issued legally by a
sub-committee of the municipality, adding that it had no
authorization to examine the political ramifications of the
project.
</P>
<P>
Moscowitz, with the full backing from the hawkish Jerusalem
Mayor Ehud Olmert, hoped to build 70 housings for Jews in
the mostly Arab neighborhood Ras Amud, which is near the
Mount of Olives.
</P>
<P>
In late July after the Jerusalem Municipality issued the
permit to start the construction, a political and diplomatic
uproar erupted over the danger of going ahead with such
controversial plan.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Arab countries sternly warned that the
housing plan would lead to new violence and collapse of the
peace process which has been halted since Israel began in
March building the Har Homa settlement in southeastern
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
And Israeli opposition Labor party warned that the start of
Ras Amud project could cause a disaster reminiscent of the
bloodshed between Israel and the Palestinians after the opening
of an underground archaeological tunnel in East Jerusalem last
September.
</P>
<P>
Under the political pressure, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
later promised that the government would not allow the project
to begin. Israeli government informed the United States, Egypt
and Jordan of its decision made in a Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ornan Yehutieli, one of the two council members who
appealed the permission to Moscowitz, said today that he
believed Olmert and Moscowitz would soon press ahead with the
housing project since the last hurdle was cleared.
</P>
<P>
He blasted Olmert and Moscowitz for trying to ignite a
widespread confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians, citing
that the project is not a solution to Jewish housing problem
whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
"I think that as soon as the time is possible, they
will find the way because this is the button they have to
press in order to light a big fire in Jerusalem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yehutieli said that he had appealed to the Jerusalem
District Court in the last attempt to block the dangerous
project. The court is expected to hear his appeal in the
next few days.

<HEADLINE> Reporters Found Guilty of Libeling Mubarak's Sons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A Cairo court today sentenced
five reporters to a suspended one-year prison term for libeling
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's sons in a high-profile suit
against two Saudi publications.
</P>
<P>
The reporters, three Saudis and two Egyptians, were tried in
absentia and each was fined 20,000 Egyptian pounds and ordered to
pay a bail of 1,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
The court sentenced a sixth reporter, an Egyptian man who
appeared on court, to six years in prison and a fine of 1,500
pounds.
</P>
<P>
The court also ordered all the defendants to pay 501 pounds
(125 dollars) as temporary compensation to their suers and repay
all litigation costs.
</P>
<P>
Alaa and Gamal Mubarak charged the journalists on July 12 for
an article that accused them of peddling their father's influence
to explore their own benefits.
</P>
<P>
Ashraq Al Awsat daily, part of the Saudi publishing group of
the same name, published on May 27 an advertisement for its sister
weekly magazine Al Jadida containing an article implicating
Mubarak's sons in illegal business dealings.
</P>
<P>
The article, which was written for the Arabic daily and
advertised by its sister magazine, in fact never appeared and two
of the weekly's editors were sacked.
</P>
<P>
The publishers, who had apologized for the "wrongdoing" and
asked for leniency and forgiveness of Mubarak's sons, said they
confiscated all issues of the magazine before they reached the
newsstands.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's two sons, who are both prominent members of Egyptian
business groups, said the ad "included lies defaming their
characters and the reputation of their family."

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Transit Trains to Run Again as Strike Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Transit train workers in
San Francisco are expected to go back to work Monday after a
week-long strike to demand higher wages.
</P>
<P>
A tentative 43.5 million dollar agreement was reached Saturday
between the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) management and striking
unions. The breakthrough came during negotiations when the BART
agreed to offer a four-year contract instead of the three-year
contract it had with its unions.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, each of the BART's 2,600 employees
will be given a lump-sum payment in the first year and a 4 percent
wage increase annually for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
It was a compromise for both sides. The unions had sought
annual raises of respective 6.5, 5.5 and 5 percent for the next
three years, while the management insisted on an annual 3 percent
pay raise.
</P>
<P>
The BART normally carries about 275,000 riders daily on 93
miles of track that connect San Francisco and East Bay bedroom
communities. During the strike commuters had to switch to ferries,
buses, car pools and telecommuting and cope with endless traffic
jams.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion played a role in bringing in the agreement.
Throughout the week, the Bay Area residents expressed anger at
both the management and unions for disputing their lives. Some
said the disputing sides cared no public interests. The BART
employees are actually the highest-paid public transit workers in
the state and face no threat of replacement, while most of the
BART income comes from taxes and subsidies, they noted.
</P>
<P>
A local economist said when the negotiations were still going
on that the only real leverage was public opinion.
</P>
<P>
The management and labor were now confident that the public's
anger would dissipate once the trains start running again,
although many angry commuters had vowed that they would not return
to the BART. In fact, the BART customers have no other options.
Most commuters will have to return to the system.
</P>
<P>
The BART's longest strike took place in 1979 which lasted three
months. Its briefest walkout in 1991 lasted only 75 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Troop Pullback from Lebanon Called for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kalahani today asked for withdrawal of Israeli
troops from south Lebanon to avoid further losses there, Israeli
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio, Kalahani said at today's Cabinet
meeting that Israel should withdraw its forces from Lebanon and
replace them with a multinational force.
</P>
<P>
Israel can reach some sort of agreements with the Iran-backed
Hezbollah (Party of God) militia of Lebanon, which has been
fighting to oust the Israeli occupation, on troop withdrawal and
other security issues along the border, he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kalahani comes from the Third-way Party. The recent killing of
11 Israeli commandos in Lebanon has prompted fierce debate over
whether Israel should withdraw its troops or change its tactics.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military brass, including Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, opposed troops pulling out of Lebanon for fear of a
unilateral withdrawal would lead to an increase in bloodshed when
northern Israel is exposed to attacks from Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
However, Kalahani said, Israel could continue to sustain losses
as long as its troops station in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a security zone 10-15 kilometer wide in south
Lebanon along its border in 1985. Since then, about 300 Israeli
servicemen have been killed in military clashes with Hezbollah in
south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says Only Small Steps Achieved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright here tonight admitted only small steps were
accomplished during her week-long trip to the region with the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations to be reactivated at double
levels.
</P>
<P>
Big steps were needed, but small steps were better than no
steps, Albright emphasized during a joint press conference with
Jordan's King Hussein. She said Israel and Palestine agreed to
start top leader-level talks in Washington and minister-level
talks in New York at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The talks at double levels were set up amid crisis of
confidence and might bring new hopes for the Middle East peace
process, said the top U.S. diplomat, who will conclude her trip
right here in Amman after visiting Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas, Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albright called on Israel to refrain from
unilateral actions and the Palestinians to crack down on Islamic
terrorist actions in response to Israeli demands.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and the Palestinians needed to make "hard but
necessary decisions" to reactivate the peace talks, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Albright described her trip as "exceptionally good" and said
that the U.S. would continue to work very hard to revive the
peace process at an overall level.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decided to do so because it cherished very important
strategic interests in the region, said the secretary of state,
who arrived here this evening and immediately held the press
conference after a brief meeting with King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
She added that she would report about the trip to U.S.
President Bill Clinton whose interests here was "unparallel."
</P>
<P>
Albright had apparently failed to bridge the gap between
Israeli security demands and Palestinian request for a halt in
Jewish settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Her only success was in cobbling together a renewal of
high-level talks between the two sides later this month in the
U.S. in a bid to tackle their formidable differences.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat are scheduled to meet in Washington while
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Palestinian chief
negotiator Mohammoud Abbas to meet in New York.
</P>
<P>
During the talks late Friday in Damascus with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad, Albright also failed to return Syria and Israel to
negotiations in order to end the 18-month freeze in their peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Albright failed to get an Egyptian commitment for a
high-level participation at a regional economic summit set to
take place in Doha, Qatar in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
This morning, her efforts to persuade six Gulf Cooperation
Council countries to attend the Qatar meeting also turned out no
results.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Cabinet today
discussed the issue of cutting off aid from abroad to Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas), Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
After the weekly Cabinet meeting, David Bar-Ilan, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's communication advisor, said it was
still up to the discretion of the prime minister, Foreign
Minister David Levy and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
whether to actually act on the cabinet proposal.
</P>
<P>
"One of the ways to fight the infrastructure of terrorism
organizations is to deprive its funds which make its function
possible," Bar-Ilan said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "it is important to be able to do that especially
when most of the funding for the Hamas functions has gone from
western countries rather than as most people believe from Iran."
But he would not specify which organizations in western countries
were involved.
</P>
<P>
In coincidence, the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
who was visiting Saudi Arabia, today also urged Gulf states to do
everything possibler to deny financial aid to Hamas and other
radical Islamic groups which sabotage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, the main militant group opposed to peace agreement
between Israel and Palestinian National Authority (PNA), has claimed
responsibility for most of the suicide bombing attacks against
Israel in years.
</P>
<P>
Israel has urged the PNA to fulfill promises to crack down
on the infrastructure of Hamas and other militant groups in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President Reiterates Commitment to IGADD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar
Al-Bashir today reiterated his country's commitment to the IGADD's
(Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development for
central and east Africa) initiative.
</P>
<P>
Bashir made this statement during a meeting with IGADD
Executive Secretary Tiksiti Qabri, who arrived here Saturday
on a four-day visit to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
IGADD, which embraces Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia,
Eritrea, Somalia and Djibouti, has played a mediatory role between
the Sudanese government and John Garang, leader of the mainstream
rebel group in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
During the summit of IGADD which was held in July in the Kenyan
capital of Nairobi, the Sudanese delegation accepted the IGADD's
declaration of principles of 1994 for resolving the southern Sudan
question.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government had earlier rejected the declaration of
principles which call for separating religion from politics and
upholding political pluralism in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, the visiting IGADD executive secretary
said he expected an IGADD summit would be held soon with the
participation of John Garang to examine the peace effort in
southern Sudan, but no date had been fixed yet, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sudanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Osman
Mohammed Taha Saturday had a meeting with the IGADD executive
secretary on continental integration through the African economic
community. He underlined Sudan's commitment to regional
cooperation in the best interest of the peoples of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister Taha also briefed the IGADD official on Sudan's
effort together with South Africa for the establishment of peace
in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudan had requested South Africa's President Nelson Mandela
to play the role of mediator between the Sudan, Uganda and the
Garang-led rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
A meeting had actually taken place last month in South Africa
between Bashir and his Uganda counterpart Yoweri Museveni, but
Garang failed to attend, refusing to negotiate with the Sudanese
government delegation.

<HEADLINE> PNA, Syrian Presidents to Visit Egypt Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad
and Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat will
visit Egypt this week to discuss the Mideast peace process in the
wake of the recent U.S. peace-saving attempt.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will meet in the
south Mediterranean port of Alexandria tomorrow to evaluate the
situation following U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
visit, according to the Middle East News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Albright's first trip to the region since she took office in
January began on September 10 and has taken her to Israel, the
Palestinian self-rule areas, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Mubarak talks will see to means of confronting the
Israeli punitive measures imposed on the Palestinians after a
series of suicide bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Al-Assad will exchange views on Thursday regarding
means of rescuing the faltering Mideast peace process, according
to MENA.
</P>
<P>
Syria and the PNA were the second and third stops of Albright's
tour, which failed to score major achievements in easing tensions
and relaunching the peace march on both tracks.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli negotiations were frozen since March last
year. The Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
refused to commit to the promises of its Labor predecessor to
return the Golan Heights it seized from Syria in 1967 in exchange
for peace with the neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks stalled in March over a new
Jewish settlement project in traditional Arab East Jerusalem,
which the Palestinians want as their future capital. The string of
suicide bombings in Jerusalem in the past five weeks has fueled
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who met Albright in Alexandria on Saturday, praised
her mission in the region as "balanced, promising and
encouraging." Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa called Arafat
Saturday night to brief him on Mubarak-Albright talks.
</P>
<P>
Albright told an Egyptian TV today that she made only minor
steps in easing the crisis of confidence between the Palestinians
and Israelis, affirming that the agreements reached in Oslo are
the foundations of the Mideast peace process and could not be
given up.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo agreements signed four years ago and the historic
handshake between Arafat and late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin in Washington started the Middle East peace process which
has been deadlocked due to Netanyahu government's policies on
issues like Jewish settlement expansion.

<HEADLINE> Albright Promises to Continue Aid for Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright pledged here today that the U.S. will continue
its aid to Jordan in appreciation of Jordan's special role in the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
During a joint press conference with King Hussein of Jordan,
Albright said the U.S. government would like to help Jordan keep
its prosperity by continuously channeling aid and grants to the
kingdom in a bid to strengthen the partnership between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. cherished its partnership with the kingdom very much
and hoped to maintain its leadership in the region through keeping
its partnership with Jordan, said the U.S. secretary of state, who
is on the last leg of her Mideast tour which has taken her to
Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Syria, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has become the 6th largest country in the world in
receiving U.S. aid. Over the past seven years, the U.S. granted
altogether some 1.5 billion U.S. dollars to Jordan in the form of
economic and military aid and debt write-off.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, Jordan has received some 200 million dollars
in aid from Washington. Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress was
reportedly trying to increase this year's aid to Jordan to 250
million dollars despite of its overall plan to cut down on
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Jordan contributed to the peace process by mediating the
Hebron accord between Israel and the Palestinians in January this
year, under which Israel promised to evacuate some areas in the West
Bank.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urged to Provide More Aid to Montserrat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chief Minister of the
Volcano-stricken Carribbean island of Montserrat called on here
today the British government to step up its efforts to help the
Montserrat people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with Britain's Sky Television early
today, Chief Minister David Brandt said: "I hope to get something
concrete to help us start over again."
</P>
<P>
"It is an amount of money (Montserrat is asking for). Not a
specific sum at this time but there are some things that are
critical. There is the question of housing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain has so far pledged an aid package worth 41.5 million
pounds (about 66.4 million U.S. dollars), including another
6.5-million-pound (about 10.4 million dollars) emergency housing
program.
</P>
<P>
Brandt, who was appointed Chief Minister last month after a row
over London's aid package forced his predecessor to quit, arrived
in London on Saturday for crisis talks with British government
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Brandt is expected to meet Prime Minister Tony Blair, Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook and International Development Minister George
Foulkes later today to discuss further British assistance.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement that
the British government is "acutely aware of longer term housing
shortage in the North (of the island). We are doing everything to
address this problem and are determined to accelerate this vital
work."
</P>
<P>
"Our commitment to the people of Montserrat is long-term. Our
Sustainable Development Plan will create a lasting and viable
infrastructure in the North of Montseratt," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Montserrat's Southfriere Hills volcano became dramatically
active from July 1995, destroying many places on the tiny island in
eastern Caribbean.

<P>
OTTAWA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Visitors from overseas
countries made fewer overnight trips to Canada in July than in
June, the fifth consecutive monthly decrease since last February's
peak.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada reported today that visitors from overseas
countries took 345,000 trips of one or more nights to Canada in
July, down 1.7 percent from June.
</P>
<P>
This was the lowest number of overnight trips to Canada by
overseas visitors since January 1996 and was 15 percent lower than
February's peak.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, most European currencies and the Japanese
yen have lost some value compared with the Canadian dollar.
</P>
<P>
In July, Americans made more overnight trips to Canada than in
the previous month, up 1.0 percent, according to the statistics
agency.
</P>
<P>
Overall, foreigners took 1.4 million trips to Canada in July,
practically unchanged from June.

<HEADLINE> Congress Hailed As Milestone in Party History (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Although the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is still going on,
people have already got a common idea that the congress, the CPC's
last in the century, will have a far-reaching bearing on the
future of China. Hence, the congress is called "another important
milestone in the history of the CPC."
</P>
<P>
Since the congress declared open in September 12, quite a few
delegates to the congress have made two historical comparisons
which may help understand the significance of the congress.
</P>
<P>
First, the congress has established Deng Xiaoping Theory as the
guiding ideology, as the case of the Seventh National Party
Congress that established Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding
ideology.
</P>
<P>
This is another historic decision of the CPC, which marks
another leap in the Party's theoretical development. It is of
epoch-making significance.
</P>
<P>
Second, the exposition made in the report to the congress on
both the pattern of public ownership and the forms of its
realization is another emancipation of the mind and a theoretical
breakthrough. Earlier, the Party formulated the basic line with
economic development as the central task at the end of the 1970s,
and decided to begin establishing a socialist market economy in
1992.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned conclusion was drawn mainly from the report
Jiang Zemin delivered at the opening session of the congress.
</P>
<P>
As the congress has fulfilled the agenda of discussion of the
report, which together with the revision and adoption of the
report constitutes the main agenda and task of the congress,
people can draw conclusion on the outcome of the congress.

<HEADLINE> Congress Hailed As Milestone in Party History (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the fact that the current congress differs from the
Seventh National Party Congress in terms of their respective
situations and tasks, the congress literally carries some
similarities with the congress in 1945 -- the last but the most
important congress in the period of democratic revolution, and
moreover, and with the two waves of emancipation of the mind
during the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The Seventh CPC National Congress of 1945, in the wake of
Yan'an Rectification Movement, proceeded to break completely away
from the inclination of dogmatizing Marxism-Leninism.
</P>
<P>
The congress wrote Mao Zedong Thought into the Constitution of
the Party. Consequently, a sound theoretical foundation
unanimously agreed throughout the Party has been established, with
which the CPC successfully led the nation to triumph over the
Japanese invaders, and a few years later, founded the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, which was
convened in 1978, fundamentally shattered the argument of "two
whatevers" (the notion that after the death of Chairman Mao
Zedong, whatever policy decisions he had made must be firmly
upheld and whatever instructions he had given must be followed
unswervingly) on the basis of discussions over the criterion of
truth beginning in May that year.
</P>
<P>
The congress resolutely shifted the Party's central task to the
modernization drive, "a great turning point" that drew an end to
the two-year-long wavering after the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Reforms and opening-up in the wake of that emancipation of the
mind in 1978 met another barrier in the early 1990s when it came
to the theoretical puzzle whether a market economy could be
introduced in a socialist countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
At the beginning of 1992, Deng Xiaoping, architect of China's
reform and opening policy, made talks in his south China tour, in
which he put forward the famous "three favorables" -- favorable to
promoting the growth of the productive forces in a socialist
society, increasing the overall strength of the socialist state
and raising the people's living standards. This gave rise to the
second major emancipation of the mind in the new period.
</P>
<P>
Later on in October of the same year, the third generation of
CPC leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core mapped out the major
strategic policy to establish the socialist market economy and to
accelerate the reform and opening-up, as well as the socialist
modernization drive. The following five years witnessed
significant successes.
</P>
<P>
After making the historical comparisons, the congress delegates
have drawn the following conclusion: Each major progress in the
history of the CPC resulted from the restoration of and adherence
to the Party's ideological line of "seeking truth from facts" and
the emancipation of the mind under the guidance of the line.
Especially in the last 20 years or so, along with each wave of
emancipation of the mind, there are inevitably breakthroughs in
reform and opening up and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The delegates pointed out that although Jiang Zemin's report to
the 15th Party congress covers a wide range in terms of time and
space, the essence of Deng Xiaoping Theory -- "emancipating the
mind and seeking truth from facts" is embodied throughout the
report. It is where the hope and confidence of the current
conference lie. It is also why the conference has been highly
acclaimed by more than 2,000 delegates, including many veteran
revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
After nearly 20 years of reform and opening up, China's reform
and development have come into a critical period with some
deep-rooted contradictions and problems waiting for solution. It
is understandable that people hold different views concerning the
national situation and development stage and some even are in
puzzles and have doubts about the orientation of the country's
further economic restructuring.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Deficit Falls in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel's current account
deficit reached some 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of
this year, Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics announced today.
</P>
<P>
This marked a reduction of 34.6 percent from nearly 3.7 billion
dollars registered in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The six-month figure comprised exports valued at 16.1 billion
dollars, imports worth 21.6 billion dollars and 3.1 billion
dollars in unilateral fund transfers to the country.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1996, exports stood at 14.7 billion
dollars, imports at 21.2 billion dollars and unilateral fund
transfers at 2.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The statistics indicate that imports of goods and services in
the January-June period grew by 380 million dollars from the same
period last year, because of an increase in expenditure on foreign
labor.
</P>
<P>
Within the overall imports volume of the first half of this
year, there was a decline in volume of the imported goods, but an
increase in imported services.
</P>
<P>
"The improvement is very important for the economy, because it
has reduced the danger of increased foreign debt above capacity,"
economist Professor Haim Ben-Shahar of Israeli Ben-Shahar
Associates commented on the deficit decline.
</P>
<P>
"But this was a result of reduced growth, not structural change
in the economy," warned the professor.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the fundamental solution for the current
account deficit is to cut government spending. "For every one
dollar reduced in government expenditure there will be at least a
one dollar reduction in the deficit under current conditions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's data also shows that foreign debt increased by
some 2.2 billion dollars compared with a year ago, with a
1.1-billion-dollar rise in the economy's foreign-based assets.
</P>
<P>
Overall net foreign liabilities in the first six months of this
year totaled 20.3 billion dollars, which included assets of 28.6
billion dollars against a debt of 48.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment here reached 1.4 billion dollars in the
first six months of 1997, compared to 1.3 billion in the same
period last year. Meanwhile, Israeli overseas investments shrank
to 500 million dollars from 700 million dollars a year earlier.

<P>
The puzzles and doubts, if not removed, will obstruct the
reform process or even make the people lose their historical
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
That's why the 15th Party congress has held high the banner of
Deng Xiaoping Theory and further explained China's future
development. Undoubtedly, the move is of great significance.
</P>
<P>
Although the 14th Party congress has established the guiding
position in the Party for Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 15th congress has
decided to stipulate in the Party Constitution that the Party
takes Deng Xiaoping Theory as a guiding ideology to guide the 58
million Chinese Communist Party members. The move can guarantee
"holding high the banner." This explains why the congress
delegates call the current congress a meeting which "has made
historic contributions."
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Party Congress has further expounded the principle
of keeping public ownership in a dominant position and developing
diverse forms of ownership side by side, making it a basic
economic system in the primary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Making clear that public ownership can take diversified forms,
the move has won a consensus among the congress delegates, who
pointed out the breakthroughs in theory will direct economic
restructuring, in the state sector in particular.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the conference will advance the entire
Party into a new realm ideologically and theoretically. After
breaking the ideological confines, China's reform will enter a new
period, bringing about a new economic and social development
stage.

State Council and the United Front Work Department of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China jointly held a reception
here this evening to celebrate the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival,
which falls on tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The reception was given in honor of consultants of the State Council
and members of the Central Research Institute of Culture and
History.
</P>
<P>
At the reception, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing made a speech, praising
them for their hard and efficient work in the past, especially in
the process of Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the Mid-Autumn Festival, Li said, "We are
eager to see an early reunion of the people across the Taiwan
Straits."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the only way out for Taiwan is the realization of
reunification of the Taiwan Island and the mainland. "Any attempt to
separate the Taiwan island from its motherland by the reactionary
forces on and outside the island will be unpopular and doomed to
failure.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the reception were Cheng Siyuan, vice-chairman

<HEADLINE> Former Pak PM's Swiss Accounts Frozen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government has
ordered four Swiss banks to freeze accounts and lockers in the
name of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto "on the basis of
solid evidence that the wealth was ill-gotten," a senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
"The freeze order is effective from September 8," Saiful
Rehman, chairman of the Ehtesab (accountability) Cell, told a news
conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Accounts in the names of Benazir's spouse Asif Zardari and
mother Nusrat Bhutto were also frozen, said Rehman, who provided
the Swiss government and banks with the evidence.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss banks and all their branches which froze the
accounts, vaults and lockers of the three will provide details of
all the transactions made since opening of the accounts, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss banks include Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS),
Barclays Bank (Swiss) and S. A. Citi Bank (Switzerland), he said.
</P>
<P>
Rehman recalled that the former prime minister had always
denied the existence of her foreign bank accounts and challenged
that if proved all the wealth amassed may be acquired by the
government.
</P>
<P>
"She will be obliged and the looted money soon be returned to
the national exchequer," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking assistance of British and French authorities as
well and have identified the banks and account numbers of the
former prime minister and her spouse," he added. He hoped these
accounts would also be frozen.
</P>
<P>
He charged that the "royal couple" made billions overnight by
"underhand deals" and that they tailored rules and regulations and
altered policies and procedures for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
This hectic task (getting the accounts frozen) has been
achieved within 100 days of the cell's coming into operation on
June 1, 1997, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The present government proceeded against the plunderers of
national wealth fully honoring independence of the judiciary and
free press and abiding by the rule of law, he added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Textile Exports Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' textile
exports reached nearly 2 billion U.S. dollars in the first eight
months of this year, up 7.5 percent from a year ago, official
figures showed today.
</P>
<P>
The slight increase was a result of higher demand from the
United States, a major quota country for Philippine textiles,
according to a report issued by the country's Garments and Textile
Export Board (GTEB).
</P>
<P>
The United States remained the biggest buyer of the country's
textiles, with its payments accounting for 62 percent of the
Philippines' total receipts from textile exports during the
period.
</P>
<P>
The United States purchased 1.23 billion dollars worth of
Philippine textiles during the period, an 11-percent hike from a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Canada, another quota country, also improved at an
impressive rate of 9.7 percent from 37.4 million dollars to 41
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the total textile exports, 80 percent were apparel while the
rest were composed of linens and other embroidered household
items.

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral will meet his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, in New
York on September 23 to discuss outstanding issues between the two
countries, an official spokesman announced here today.
</P>
<P>
"The forthcoming meeting, which was arranged bilaterally, will
be part of the ongoing dialogue between the two countries," the
spokesman for the External Affairs Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
He said Gujral is scheduled to arrive in New York on September
21 to attend the 52nd session of the U.N. General Assembly,
according to the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
Besides his meeting with the Pakistani prime minister, Gujral
is also expected to have talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on
September 22 during his four-day stay in New York, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement brought to an end weeks of speculations over
the date for the Gujral-Sharif meeting.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi, which has opposed any third party mediation in
Indo-Pak disputes, favored a date which can dispel any impression
that India, Pakistan and the United States are involved in
trilateral talks in New York.

<HEADLINE> Britain, Ireland Urge Unionists to Join Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain and Ireland issued a
joint statement today to persuade pro-British unionists into
joining the Northern Ireland peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The statement, by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and
Bertie Ahern of Ireland, was made in Belfast, of Northern Ireland,
just before the negotiations were due to open.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the two main concerns of the Ulster Unionist Party
(UUP), the two leaders pledged that the people of Northern Ireland
would decide the territory's future and that they wanted
guerrillas to disarm during the talks.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement came hours before the first substantive
plenary session of the year-old peace talks was scheduled to open
in Belfast's Stormont Castle buildings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UUP leadership was due to meet to decide whether
or not it would hold direct negotiations with its arch-foe, the
Irish Republican Army's political wing, Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers said Northern Ireland's British status
would not change without the consent of its 1.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
"Consent will be a guiding principle for them in the
negotiations, from which no outcome is of course excluded or
pre-determined," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Parliament Speaker in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Parliament Speaker
Nabih Berri arrived here today for talks with Iranian officials
on issues relating to the Islamic world, the Middle East and
Israeli aggression against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA quoted the Lebanese speaker as
saying upon arrival that at present Lebanon has no other choice
but to resist Israeli aggressions.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Israeli regime of breaking the will of the
Lebanese people "over and again" between 1993 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that despite Israeli attacks, the Lebanese
people's unity and resistance against Israel have been
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Israeli regime has two options, either
to retreat or face the resistance and blows dealt to it by the
Islamic forces.
</P>
<P>
Specialists here said that the purpose of Berri's visit is to
seek more political, financial and military support from Iran.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri today termed the visit of the Lebanese speaker as
effective in expanding bilateral coordination.
</P>
<P>
He said that without doubt these kinds of visits would
play an significant role in coordinating the policies of the two
countries in solving the issues facing the region.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in the principle of defending the innocent and
taking stand against every act of aggression. Due to this we
will continue our support for the Lebanese government. We condemn
the aggression by the Zionist regime as well as the violation of
international laws by that regime," Nateq-Nouri assured his Lebanese
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Iranian leaders, including Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei,
former president Heshemi Rafsanjani, new President Mohammad
Khatami and Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi have sent messages of
condolence to Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, Lebanese Iran-backed
Hezbollah's Secretary-General, for the killing of his son by
Israeli troops in south Lebanon last Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a more than 1,000 square-kilometer security zone
in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its northern communities from
cross-border guerrilla raids. Lebanese Islamic resistance forces
have been fighting to drive the Israeli troops out of Lebanon
since then.

<HEADLINE> EU Jobless Rate Falls Twice in Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate across
the European Union (EU) fell to 10.7 percent in June and again to
10.6 percent in July, Eurostat said today.
</P>
<P>
The new rates, which were seasonally adjusted, were down from
the 10.8 percent for the first five months of the year, said
Eurostat, the EU's statistical office based in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, average jobless rate in the 15-member EU was
10.9 percent in July 1996 and 10.7 percent in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
As a recent trend, the jobless rate for men fell from 9.5
percent to 9.3 percent while that for women ebbed from 12.6
percent to 12.5 percent over the May-July period this year.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat, which linked the drops to falling rates in the United
Kingdom, the Scandinavian countries, Portugal and Spain, estimated
that a total of 18.0 million people were jobless in the EU in July.
</P>
<P>
However, the encouraging overall trend did not extend to
Germany, where unemployment continued to rise to 9.7 percent,
particularly for young people, whose jobless rate was 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Spain registered the highest unemployment rate of 19.9 percent
among EU members in July, while Luxembourg and Austria had the
lowest ones of 3.8 percent and 4.5 percent respectively, Eurostat
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) registered a total of 10.84 billion U.S. dollars in foreign
debt by the end of 1996, the local Gulf News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, nearly 9.8 billion dollars, or 90 percent were in
the form of short-term debts while the remaining 1.04 billion
dollars were debt servicing, a report of the Kuwait-based Inter
Arab Investment Guarantee Corp showed.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, foreign debt accounted for 24.8
percent of UAE's gross domestic product (GDP) last year.
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the UAE Central Bank showed that the
country's deficit in 1996 rose to a record high of 4.82 billion
dollars despite a surge in oil earnings.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank attributed this to a sharp increase in
expenditure an unprecedented 19.48 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's daily oil output stands at 2.16 million barrels under
a quota agreement with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. Crude oil and gas sales account for more than
two-thirds of its total revenue.

<HEADLINE> HK Elections Called Stepping Stone to Universal Vote (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The elections in May next
year are a stepping stone that will set Hong Kong firmly on the
road to the universal suffrage envisaged in the Basic Law,
Administrative Secretary of the Special Administrative Region
(SAR) Anson Chan said here today.
</P>
<P>
Delivering her first major speech after the handover at the
American Chamber of Commerce, Chan said it is hardly surprising
that there should have been vigorous debate about the arrangements
for the first Legislative Council elections which have been
announced and are now being discussed throughout the community.
</P>
<P>
"This debate was not only expected; it is perfectly healthy,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"Various groups in Hong Kong have different views as to whether
our proposals for a combination of proportional representation
for geographic constituencies; corporate voting in our functional
constituencies; and block voting in the election committee is
more or less democratic than other forms of election," she said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there is no universal truth about the perfect
election, Chan said each society should be allowed to develop its
own process, based on its own particular social, historical,
political and cultural conditions.
</P>
<P>
"I think we could all agree that Hong Kong's social, political
and historical conditions are different from most, if not all;
that a degree of care and attention is required, particularly in
relation to the unique situation embodied in One Country, Two
Systems, and the specific intent and spirit of our constitutional
imperatives, i.e. the requirements of the Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
She quoted Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the inauguration of
the SAR, who said: "A gradually improved democratic system suited
to Hong Kong's reality is an important guarantee for its social
and political stability" and SAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa at
the same ceremony: "Democracy is the hallmark of a new era for
Hong Kong."

<P>
She told the audience that the SAR government will launch an
unprecedented effort to enroll a far greater number of eligible
electors and do all it can to ensure that many more people get out
and vote.
</P>
<P>
"We will go all out to try and break previous records. I
believe Hong Kong people will respond to the opportunity -- the
historic opportunity -- to take part in its first democratic
election as part of China," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the elections will be overseen by an independent
electoral commission, which she said "will be an impartial and
apolitical body whose jobs will be to ensure that the election is
not only conducted openly and fairly, but is also seen to be so."
</P>
<P>
According to the administrative secretary, the overall result
would be a balanced legislature representative of the
multi-colored spectrum of opinion and aspirations of the
community.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't live up to that, you will soon hear about it. For
one of the other heartening facts about post-transition Hong Kong
has been the continuing good health of the press."
</P>
<P>
Turning to the importance of the rule of law, Chan said it has
remained resolutely and independently at the heart of Hong Kong's
way of life.
</P>
<P>
"The rule of law is the very essence of Hong Kong's success and
must be protected and preserved by all of us," she said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached last week between the Chief Justice of
the SAR and the British Lord Chancellor to make available two of
Britain's Law Lords to serve on the SAR Court of Final Appeal was
"universally applauded for the signal it sent about the
independence of our judiciary and the quality of justice we can
expect in the SAR," she said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on her recent private tour of Shanghai to receive a
professorship, Chan said, "No one who has seen the huge physical
and human progress that is evident everywhere in Shanghai can
doubt that China is moving with the times."
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to being part of an increasingly open,
prosperous and powerful China that will play an increasingly
prominent role on the world stage to the benefit of China and the
rest of the international community," Chan said.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Criticizes Jewish Presence in Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Middle
East peace envoy Miguel Moratinos today denounced the overnight
occupation of two buildings in East Jerusalem's Arab neighborhood
Ras Amud by three Jewish families.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy,
Moratinos criticized the move by the Jewish radicals as a
"provocation." He expressed the hope that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks against the planned building in the
neighborhood would also apply to the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, who has met with Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) leader Yasser Arafat and other officials in the past days
following a visit here by United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, is working to resume the deadlocked
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Levy also criticized the action taken by the Jewish families
as "unnecessary and damaging" to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian rioting was sparked Sunday night as soon as
the settlers moved into two empty buildings in the neighborhood,
where the Miami-based American millionaire developer Irving Moscowitz
intends to build 70 housing units for Jews.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian protesters threw stones at the settlers and smashed
their cars before a large number of Israeli police rushed to the
scene to separate the parties.
</P>
<P>
Despite the heavy presence of Israeli police, some Palestinian
youths threw stones at the buildings housing the 15 Jewish adults
and children. And a group of leftist Israeli peace activists held
a demonstration to protest the settlers' move.
</P>
<P>
The settler families denied that they took the action to
damage the visit of Albright here days ago, who demanded
Israel refrain from taking unilateral steps that could scuttle
the chance of resuming the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
They also refuted reports that Netanyahu knew about their plan
to move into Ras Amud, saying he only learned their plan shortly
before they took the action.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a heated debate erupted across Israel's political
spectrum amid huge differences over the settlers' action between
the ruling coalition and the opposition camp.
</P>
<P>
The rightist camp welcomed the action and called on the
government to allow the settlers to continue living in Ras
Amud. Zvi Handel, a lawmaker from the National Religious party,
hailed the action as a proper response to the recent suicide
bombings in Jerusalem launched by Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Tsomet lawmaker Modi Zanberg said that even the government had
to honor the law, especially after it became clear that the entry
to the buildings by the Jewish families was legal. Jerusalem
police has refused to evict the settlers from the buildings which
were legally purchased by Moscowitz.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Labor party's Knesset (Parliament) faction leader
Ranan Cohen condemned the settlers' move and called on Netanyahu
to stop such provocation, citing that it would only encourage
more terrorism and heighten Palestinian frustration.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid also denounced the latest
developments, saying the settlers should be removed from the
neighborhood immediately.
</P>
<P>
Due to the sensitivity of the issue of East Jerusalem,
Israeli government has promised to the Palestinians and Arab
countries that it would not allow the project to be carried
out at the stage. Netanyahu's media adviser David Bar-Illan said
that the prime minister will invoke state security to block
the project.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday incident came right after the Interior Ministry
gave the green light to the project by rejecting a petition
against it filed by two leftist city councillors.
</P>
<P>
Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein said that he is studying
the legality of the Ras Amud project before making comments on
the project. But he confirmed that the government could block
the project by invoking state security and public order.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Ministry Addresses Nuclear Exports (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cui said that China has always adopted a cautious and
responsible attitude towards nuclear exports and exports of all
materials which could in any way lead to the proliferation of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
China's nuclear exports are strictly limited to peaceful uses,
and China abides by the three principles of nuclear export, said
Cui, adding that China practices strict control over the structure
and approvement procedures for nuclear exports.
</P>
<P>
China has gradually reinforced and perfected its control
structure for nuclear exports in recent years in order to comply
with the needs of the socialist market economy and to satisfy the
requirements of the legal system, said Cui.
</P>
<P>
The State Council issued a May notice strictly implementing the
country's policies on nuclear exports, according to Cui. He said
the notice stipulates that nuclear materials, equipment and
relevant technologies, as well as nonnuclear materials for
reactors, and dual-purpose equipment, materials and relevant
nuclear technology that China exports can not be provided to or
used in nuclear facilities which are beyond the guarantees and
monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
The notice stipulates that departments and companies are
prohibited from cooperating with nuclear facilities beyond
scrutiny by the Agency, as well as from exchanging professionals,
technology and information with the said entities.
</P>
<P>
Cui said the notice strictly regulates on the export of
dual-purpose articles related to nuclear materials, and that
China's control list complies with international standards.
</P>
<P>
China used this as the basis for issuing regulations on the
control of nuclear exports, said Cui.
</P>
<P>
He noted that relevant Chinese departments are formulating
regulations on export controls for dual-purpose article related to
nuclear materials, and will require a control list in line with
international standards.
</P>
<P>
Cui said the measures will reinforce control of nuclear exports
and exports of all articles which might possibly lead to
proliferation of nuclear weapons.

<P>
The regulation stipulates that nuclear exports will be the
responsibility of departments appointed by the State Council, any
all other departments and individual are strictly prohibited from
engaging in related activities.
</P>
<P>
The State is in the process of implementing a licensing system
for nuclear exports. All related items and relevant technology on
the "Nuclear Export Control List" must have appropriate licenses
prior to exportation.
</P>
<P>
The application process for nuclear exports will be examined by
departments in charge of nuclear industry and departments in
charge of nuclear export.
</P>
<P>
Export items with a direct bearing on national security, the
public interest and foreign policy must be approved by both the
State Council and Foreign Ministry if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government retains the right to terminate exports
of approved nuclear materials if the recipient violates the
regulations, or if there is any danger of nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Cui said the Chinese government's position on the issue is
quite clear.
</P>
<P>
China is a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
and a member of the IAEA, said Cui, adding that the nation has
always supported a complete ban and the thorough destruction of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
China does not advocate, encourage, or undertake nuclear
proliferation, and nor will it help other countries develop
nuclear weapons. China steadfastly observes legitimate obligations
for preventing nuclear proliferation, said Cui.
</P>
<P>
China has consistently supported the efforts of the
international community to prevent nuclear proliferation and has
actively participated in the talks to enhance the supervisory
capacity of the IAEA. China has contributed to the success of
related talks, said Cui, adding that the country is fully prepared
to bear its international responsibilities and adopt corresponding
measures to contribute to the supervision effort.

Cui pointed out that it is necessary to achieve security
guarantee from nuclear-free nations, promises that major nuclear
powers will refrain from the first use of nuclear force, and
international cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
The ministry spokesman pointed out that the regulation issued
by the State Council on September 10 represents yet "another
important step" the Chinese government has taken to further
enhance and improve the management on nuclear exports based on
relevant international norms and the government's consistent stand
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The regulation reaffirms China's policy on nuclear export and
reinterates the the three principles for nuclear exports --
guaranteeing peaceful use; accepting the supervision of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA); and refraining from
transfering nuclear materials to a third party without approval
from China.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also prohibits providing any help to nuclear
facilities beyond the scope of monitoring by the international
supervisory body.

<HEADLINE> Congress Delegates Favor Industrialized Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to the on-going
15th national congress of the Communist Party of China agreed that
the emergence of industrialized agriculture in rural China is
another breakthrough after introducing the household contract
responsibility system with remuneration linked to output.
</P>
<P>
A unique feature of the industrialized agriculture is to take
market needs and efficiency as the sole purpose and serves the aim
of an intensive and commercialized production on a large scale
through integrating production, processing and sales.
</P>
<P>
Delegates attending the congress shared the view that the
Party Central Committee has endorsed the new creation of hundreds
of millions Chinese farmers, which has been proved an inevitable
trend of modern agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yanjiang, secretary of the Luozhuang Township Party
Committee in east China's Shandong Province, said the key to
achieving a big stride in rural economic development is to solve
the problem of low profit in farm production, develop agriculture
on a fairly large scale and promote the coordinated development
between industry and agriculture. The industrial management of
agriculture may meet these requirements, he added.
</P>
<P>
The industrial management of agriculture was based on the
development of rural industries, improvement of farmers'
management skill and the growth of a market-oriented economy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Xia Houli, deputy head of the Dagangshan Township in east
China's Jiangxi Province, said practice has shown that the
industrial management of agriculture is an effective form of
developing a large-scale farm production on the basis of a
stabilized agriculture.
</P>
<P>
It has opened a new way for accelerating the growth of
agriculture through intensive production, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bian Ming from north China's Shanxi Province stressed the
importance of aiding key and rural enterprises which manufacturing
brand-name products in the course of promoting industrial
management of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shaokui, head of the Hebei Provincial Commission of
Science and Technology, said: "We should attach great importance
to the role of science and technology in promoting industrial
management of agriculture."
</P>
<P>
Key enterprises and scientific and technological departments
should use their advanced technology and other strong points to
contribute to the industrial management of agriculture.

<HEADLINE> France to Break State Monopoly in Telecommunication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The French government will
open seven head digits of phone numbers for lots drawing this
evening in a symbolic move to break state monopoly in the
country's telecommunication market.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the state-owned France Telecom, Cegetal
telecommunication group, Bouygues of the Italian telecommunication
group STET, and Siris, owned by the European consortium Unisource
and the U.S. giant AT&AMP;T, are competitors for the digits.
</P>
<P>
The three international private telecommunication groups have
expressed their wish that France would open its phone service
market immediately, while France Telecom has presented technical
difficulties for doing it right now.
</P>
<P>
This evening, the digits two, four, five, six, seven, eight and
nine, which are head digits of specialized numbers or long
distance and international numbers, are open for lots drawing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France Telecom will maintain monopoly over the
digits zero, one and three, which are the respective head digits
of French domestic phone numbers, the European emergency numbers,
and video- and audio-phone service numbers.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive organ of the European
Union (EU), has authorized the competitive subscription to
telephone services within the 15-member regional alliance by the
year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Albright's Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran today rejected recent
allegations by the United States that Iran is the main source of
tension in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"First of all Iran is not the source of tension in the Middle
East; the presence of foreign forces and the U.S. in the region is
the source of tension," Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
said, responding to a question posed by Xinhua, at his first press
conference since taking office on August 20.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright reportedly said last
week when she was visiting Israel that Iran is the source of
tension in the Middle East because it is seeking weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iran is, on the contrary, interested in reducing regional
tensions, and has put strengthening ties with the neighboring Arab
countries in the Gulf region in top priorities, the Iranian
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the very presence of the U.S. forces in the Gulf would
lead to an arms race in the region.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that the U.S. has deployed about 20,000
troops and the Fifth Fleet in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Regarding recent U.S. overtures to hold talks with Iran,
Kharrazi said that Washington was not seriously seeking resumption
of ties with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Americans are not serious in their
requests for negotiations. We are ready to negotiate only when it
is based on mutual respect, the recognition of Iran's realities
and the principle of non-interference," he added.
</P>
<P>
He further stated that the U.S. must lift its sanctions and
stop leveling allegations against Iran before any talk is
possible.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S., once strategic allies, broke diplomatic
relations in 1980 after the Iranian Islamic Revolution and
U.S. hostage crisis. And the United States has been imposing
economic sanctions against Iran ever since.
</P>
<P>
"How can we talk about negotiations when all types of
sanctions are imposed on us and all types of accusations are
leveled against us?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Referring to whether setting up ties with the U.S. is against
the Islamic Revolution principles, Kharrazi said, "With the
exception of Israel that we fundamentally do not recognize, it is
not against the Islamic Revolution that we would have ties with
other countries."
</P>
<P>
Tehran would re-establish relations with Washington if it
changes its conduct, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi denied reports that the U.S. position had changed
toward Iran after some 30 million voters turned out to cast their
votes in the presidential elections on May 23.
</P>
<P>
After the elections, U.S. President Bill Clinton reportedly
called Iran a "great nation" and the landslide victory of
(President) Mohammad Khatami as a "reaffirmation of the democratic
process" in Iran.
</P>
<P>
But Kharrazi said, "I do not see any change in the positions of
the American government after the elections."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the American media changed their stance
to Iran after the elections and put it as "a positive step."
</P>
<P>
"After the elections, we saw that the tone of the American
press on Iran had changed. This is the acceptance of a
fact ... resulting from the presence of over 30 million people in
the presidential elections," he added.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Algeria Sign Accords to Promote Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Syria and Algeria signed
nine agreements here this morning to promote trade and economic
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
One of these agreements was on establishing a joint businessmen
council, another on preventing dual taxation and the others on
cooperation in trade, media, science and customs.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony was attended by Syrian Prime Minister
Mahmoud Zouebi, who met this morning with the Algerian delegation
that was accompanying President Liamine Zeroual on his two-day
visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Zouebi underlined the importance of developing cooperation
between the two countries in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Syria and Algeria amounted to 430
million Syrian lire (10 million U.S. dollars) in 1996, with 427.7
million Syrian lire (9.95 million dollars) being Syrian exports to
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Syria's exports to Algeria include lentils, blood serum,
unmanufactured cotton and clothes.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Damascus, President Zeroual held talks with
his Syrian counterpart Hafez Al-Assad and other senior officials
on the new developments in the Middle East, especially the stalled
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Congress Delegates Favor Industrialized Agriculture (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wang Chuanyou, a congress delegate from a farm in northwest
China's Xinjiang, said agriculture has been regarded in China as
having good social effects but low economic performance.
In the case of industrialized agriculture, added-value of farm
produce will be increased through intensive processing.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' involvement in processing and sales will bring
increased income to them. This will compensate agriculture, and
greatly push up its economic efficiency, he said.
</P>
<P>
To promote the healthy development of industrialized
agriculture and kindle farmers' enthusiasm in this regard, many
areas have worked out relevant policies and measures, according to
delegates to the congress.
</P>
<P>
By now, the provinces of Shaanxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Hebei,
Anhui and Hubei have worked out policy documents to push ahead
with the move; Zhejiang, Yunnan and Heilongjiang have also taken
measures to support major enterprises; Shandong and Fujian are
working out related policies.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Beijing, Tianjin, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Shandong and
Hebei are mapping out long-range development plans for
industrialized agriculture in line with their respective
agricultural development situations.
</P>
<P>
Delegates believe that industrialized agriculture, though a
gradual process, will contribute more to rural economy and even to
the entire national economic development as long as China
continues with the experiment and practice in industrialized
agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Declare Emergency When API Reaches 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Air Pollutant Index
(API) reading should reach 500 before any kind of emergency is
declared, Malaysian National Disaster Management Committee
Chairman Mohamed Rahmat said today.
</P>
<P>
The air quality throughout Malaysia is deteriorating due to the
worsening haze condition with today's API showing that the Gombak
area in Selangor State almost reached "hazardous" level with a
reading of 298.
</P>
<P>
Six other areas -- Nilai, Kuala Lumpur, Kajang, Klang, Petaling
Jaya and Melaka -- also reached a "very unhealthy" level, with
readings of between 200 and 300, an Environment Department
statement said today.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed, also information minister, told reporters after a
committee meeting that for the present it has been proposed that
open air burning be banned and factories directed to reduce their
smoke emissions.
</P>
<P>
He said it was also proposed at today's meeting that the number
of vehicles entering and leaving the worst haze affected areas be
restricted.
</P>
<P>
These proposals would be first submitted to the cabinet this
week for urgent implementation, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the committee proposed that police monitor open
burning activities in the Klang Valley where the capital city is
located. The committee also urged that cloud seeding be continued,
 earth works be reduced to check dust pollution and people dampen
their surroundings to prevent dust from going into the air.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is now enveloped by what has been described as its
worst-ever haze, a phenomenon blamed on forest fires in
Indonesia's Sumatra and Kalimantan regions.
</P>
<P>
According to Meteorological Department prediction, the haze
would continue for several more days.
</P>
<P>
Schools in the country need not close because of the haze but
they have been advised to reduce curricular activities, the
minister said, adding that only when the API exceeded the 400 mark
would schools be closed.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee advised those leaving their houses in
areas where the API reading has reached the 250 level to wear the
mouth mask.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said
the government will declare a state of environmental emergency
only if the haze pollution hanging over the country reaches a
critical level.

<P>
BEIRUT, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States' Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright today promised the U.S. will pay the
same attention to the Lebanese track as to others in the whole
Middle East peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Albright said at a joint news conference with her Lebanese
counterpart Farez Boueiz that the Lebanese track which the
U.S. supports and totally commits to is "absolutely essential" to
a comprehensive Middle East peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. must go forward to all tracks," she emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Albright held a meeting with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi,
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and Foreign Minister Boueiz prior to
the news conference.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the U.S.-Lebanese relations, Albright said that "We
have some important bilateral business and we are looking forward
to ways that the United States can assist in the recovery of
Lebanon,"
</P>
<P>
"We want to work with the Lebanese government and Lebanese
people to establish the rule of the law," she added.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz, on his part, told reporters that the role of the
U.S. as the broker in the peace talks has long been awaited.
</P>
<P>
He said that at today's meeting Lebanese leaders explained to
her the country's constant positions. "We stand for a
comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East and we look
forward to the implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions
425 and 424," he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped Albright's visit will mean that the U.S. has really
resumed its role as the driving force for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
After the conference, Albright is going to meet Lebanese
newspapers' presidents. She will leave here for home tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Albright, on her maiden trip to the region since she took
office eight months ago in a bid to bring to life the dying
Mideast peace process, arrived here from Jordan at noon.

percent and from 21 percent to 20 percent. Rates for one- and
three-month periods were cut by 2 percentage points, respectively
from 25 percent to 23 percent and from 23 percent to 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rates for overnight and six- and 12-month periods remain
respectively at 15 percent, 12.125 percent and 12.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the third move by the central bank so far. The monetary
authorities have said it would reduce the rates in stages
according to the situation.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the Indonesian currency, the rupiah, at
the inter-bank spot market remained relatively stable for the day.
</P>
<P>
Until 10:00 a.m. local time, the rupiah value was recorded at
2,930/2,940 against the U.S. dollar, unchanged since Friday.
</P>
<P>
Money market dealers have not been active in making
transactions and have not responded to the central bank's move so
that the rupiah's exchange rate is still relatively stable, a
dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Another factor that has prevented the dollar from rising is
that the rupiah's liquidity has been relatively tight with
inter-bank overnight interest reaching 30 to 35 percent or rising
by about 5 percent from Friday's close, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's move to reduce the interest rate for the
third time within two weeks was a follow-up to the government
reform package announced on September 3 to relax the tight
monetary policy in stages.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has fallen more than 10 percent in the past month
and nearly 25 percent since January this year following offshore
speculative attacks on the currency and a rush by local companies
to hedge their foreign borrowings.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seeks Closer Ties with Arab World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran declared here today it is
determined to have closer ties with the Arab countries in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said at a press conference
"Holding ties with our neighbors is among top priorities in the
foreign affairs."
</P>
<P>
"We will seriously strive to build confidence and bring about
understanding with them," Kharrazi told foreign reporters at the
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi added that the Persian Gulf Arab countries had
modified their approach toward Iran in the aftermath of the
election of the new Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, a
moderate who favors closer ties with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
He said, "His Excellency Mr. Khatami have very much stressed
understanding between Iran and the Persian Gulf littoral countries
and we will try to implement his policies."
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old minister who used to serve as Iran's permanent
representative to the United Nations said "The Omani and Qatari
foreign ministers have traveled to Iran and I have held a
telephone conversation with Bahraini foreign minister. All of
these are in the direction of achieving better mutual
understanding."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi welcomed the recent emergence of "a relative unity"
among the Arabs against Israel.
</P>
<P>
"A sort of awareness has emerged between Islamic and Arab
countries after the recent developments in Israel and its harsh
treatment of Palestinians and its neighboring countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he criticized the U.S. and Qatar for planning to hold
economic conference in which Israel is scheduled to take part in
Doha, Qatar.
</P>
<P>
"We do not see it prudent that this conference would be held
at a time when Islamic world needs to be united," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is insisting on holding of this conference "because it
sees that Arab countries have formed a relative unity against
Israeli aggression," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about relations between Iran and Iraq, Kharrazi
criticized Iraqi government for its lack of sincerity when it
announced that Iranian Shiites could go on pilgrimage to holy
cities in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Iraq did not act sincerely in announcing
that the pilgrimage to holy cities would be free," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted "This could have been done through normal channels
between the officials of the two countries, adding "This kind of
approach by Iraq has created the suspicion that Iraq probably has
hidden agenda."

<HEADLINE> Belgian Businessmen Urged to Invest in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for Commerce
and Industry Joshua Angatia today called on Belgian businessmen
to invest in Kenya's tele-communications and energy sectors which
have been liberalized.
</P>
<P>
Opening a week-long seminar on investment, trade and tourism,
the minister said that there are also investment opportunities in
state companies which are being privatized through the sale of
government share holding.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Kenyan government is committed to ensuring
political and economic stabilities in the country which have been
considered as pre-requisites for development.
</P>
<P>
A high-powered businessmen delegation from the Francophone
Wallon region of Belgium is on a visit to Kenya with an aim to
explore possible areas of cooperation with Kenya in trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's Francophone Wallon region is known for mechanical
electronic engineering, steel works, chemicals and glass making
with a third of its population living on export business.
</P>
<P>
Issues to be discussed at the seminar include investment,
trade and tourism opportunities, and the possibilities of using
Eldoret International Airport for cargo flights between Kenya and
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is scheduled to meet Kenyan officials in the
horticulture, power, food processing, animal feeds, iron and
steel industries and airports.
</P>
<P>
So far, nine Belgian companies have invested in Kenya in
sectors such as shipping, tele-communication, transport, clearing
and forwarding and banking.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Belgium was the third biggest importer of Kenya's
French beans and a major importer of Kenya coffee.

<HEADLINE> China's First Non-governmental Ecological Protection Center Set up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China's first nongovernmental
ecological protection center recently opened in Keke Sheili near
the source of the Yangtze River on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
The center, which was constructed with special cold-proofing
materials similar to those used at China's South Pole Exploratory
Station, covers a total of 3,000 sq.m. and has floor space of 80
sq m.
</P>
<P>
The center will serve as a base supporting the living and
working conditions of individuals and groups undertaking
environmental protection projects and scientific research, and as
an international academic exchange center, according to Yang Xin,
the primary benefactor of the center.
</P>
<P>
The center was jointly sponsored by over a dozen young
volunteers. Yang recently published a book on his experiences
along the river, with 200,000 yuan in profits from sales of the
book helping to fund the center.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that three similar centers will be constructed over
the next five years, along with other centers for protecting and
treating wild animals.
</P>
<P>
Keke Sheili, located at the juncture of Qinghai Province and
the Xinjiang Uygur and Tibet autonomous regions, sits at an
elevation of over 5,000 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in
1989 revealed that the region is home to a large number of rare
animal species and a highly primitive ecological environment, as
well as an abundant array of plant and mineral products. The
report cited the region as one of the most extensive pristine
unpopulated areas in China.

BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A report released today by
the UN Conference on Trade and Economic Developments (UNCAD)
points to China's success in achieving single-digit inflation,
while recording an impressive growth rate approaching 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This should allow Chinese policy-makers to focus attention on

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Hold Babylon International Art Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq plans to hold the
Babylon International Art Festival, one of the most important
festivals in the Arab world, in spite of the seven-year-old
U.N. sanctions, according to the Iraq News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Culture and Information Minister Hamman Abdul Khaleq said
today the festival, the ninth of its kind, will open on September
22 in the ancient city of Babylon, about 90 kilometers south of
capital Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Babylon, whose history dates back more than 5,000 years ago,
was renown for being a cradle of primitive human civilization. The
annual art festival named after it was inaugurated in 1987, but
had to be temporarily canceled in 1990 and 1991 after the Gulf
Crisis broke out.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister said this year's festival will attract more
than 40 art troupes with 1,200 artists and more than 400 media
people and archeologists from 41 countries across the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the festival activities due to take place in the city
of Babylon and on its theaters will emphasize that life in
Mesopotamia is unfading and that Babylon is a cultural window
through which Iraq looks on to the Arab homeland and the entire
world.
</P>
<P>
The festival activities - to be broadcast by both radio and TV
in Arab countries and the world - will highlight the steadfastness
of the Iraqi people in the face of the sufferings inflicted by the
sanctions, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Global Communities Urged to Clean up Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) today called on all communities in the
world to clean up their local waterways by removing rubbish from
creeks, canals, beaches and ponds.
</P>
<P>
In a news release issued here today, the UNEP said that the
fifth annual "Clean Up the World" campaign had adopted water as
the theme for this year's event.
</P>
<P>
The campaign starting in 1993 is now emphasizing the
importance to implement "strategies to recycle and reuse waste
materials as well as to reduce waste at its source" as the
problems of waste management and the need for waste reduction are
common to communities the world over.
</P>
<P>
UNEP Executive Director Elizabeth Dowdeswell was quoted as
saying that "The Clean Up the World campaign has proven to be one of
the simplest and most effective ways of tackling these
(environmental) issues and at the same time help raise
environmental awareness."
</P>
<P>
Ian Kiernan, Founder and Chairman of Clean Up the World, noted
that as world leaders are lack of the political will to tackle the
global environmental problems as demonstrated by both earth
Summits, ordinary people must lead the way.
</P>
<P>
The annual event is scheduled to take place in more than 110
countries during 19-21 September and about 40 million people all
over the world are expected to involve in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Eight new countries have registered for this year's event,
namely Angola, El Salvador, Gabon, Madagascar, Palau, St. Kitts
and Nevis, Tanzania and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, more than 150 million people have taken part in
this global community-based movement which is one of the largest
community events ever staged in human history.
</P>
<P>
The "Clean Up the World" plans to involve every country in the
world by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> 4 Muslim Militants Hanged After Trial in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Four militant Muslims convicted
of staging terrorist attacks were sentenced to death and hanged by
a military court today in the country's single largest trial of
Muslim extremists.
</P>
<P>
The four were among 98 Muslims, including lawyers, students and
engineers, who went on trial on July 5 on charges of attempting to
topple Egypt's secular government by unleashing a wave of terror.
</P>
<P>
They alleged to be members of the outlawed Al-Gama'a
Al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group that launched a violent campaign
since 1992 to install a strict Islamic rule. More than 1,180
people have been killed in the violence.
</P>
<P>
The military tribunal in the Haekstep military base north of
Cairo issued life sentences against eight of the defendants and
sentenced 23 to 15 years in prison and 15 others to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Five were sentenced to seven years, eight to five years and
three to three years. All the above offenders are also sentenced
to hard labor.
</P>
<P>
Six others ended up with 10 to one-year-year imprisonment
without labor respectively.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five were acquitted and charges were dropped against one
of the defendants because he was dead.
</P>
<P>
Besides the common accusation of waging war against the
government, the accused faced additional charges including
killing police officers, nine bomb attacks on Cairo banks and
commercial centers, and participating in the 1994 assassination of
Raouf Kheiret, head of the state security department.
</P>
<P>
According to an anti-terrorism law, membership of the Islamic
Group is punishable by death, but the punishment has never been
imposed. So far, 59 extremists have been executed but for crimes
such as murder or armed attacks on banks.
</P>
<P>
Suspected Islamic militants began to be tried in military
courts in 1993, and the Haekstep court is the biggest such
facility.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Begin Third Round of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The crucial third round of
Indo-Pak foreign secretary level talks began here today to explore
options to resolve all outstanding bilateral issues, the Press
Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed, heading an
eight-member delegation, is scheduled to hold detailed parleys
from today to September 18 with his Indian counterpart, K.
Raghunath, against the backdrop of a summit between the prime
ministers of the two countries in New York on September 23.
</P>
<P>
During their second round of dialogue in Islamabad in June, the
two foreign secretaries decided to set up eight working groups on
all outstanding issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides later differed on whether there would be a
working group on Kashmir which is regarded as a core issue by
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
While Islamabad has contended that the decision covered the
establishment of a working group on Kashmir as on other issues,
India has argued that the two sides were only to work out a
mechanism for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
During the next few days, the two foreign secretaries are
expected to seek clarification over the contradicting
interpretations of the decision made in their second round of
talks.
</P>
<P>
They are also likely to lay the ground work for the keenly-
awaited meeting between Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral
and his Pakistan counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, in New York where both
leaders are expected to address the 52nd session of the U.N.
General Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Diversified Ownership to Pave Way for Restructuring (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new theoretical breakthrough in public sector will divert
people's attention from merely focusing on the state-owned sector
to promoting state assets and public sector.
</P>
<P>
In developing public sector, China not only should invigorate
state sector but the public sector elements in the mixed sector,
Luo Bingsheng, a delegate from the Capital Iron and Steel
Complex in Beijing, said.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough will result in the strategic
reorganization of China's state-owned firms, said Xing Bensi,
vice-president of the Party School of the CPC Central committee.
</P>
<P>
Xing said the state economic sector will retreat from some
ordinary industrial sectors so that they can concentrate on the
major industries that have a vital bearing on the lifelines of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
Another breakthrough at the current five-yearly Party congress
is the affirmation that public sector can and should take
diversified forms. And all management methods and organizational
forms that mirror the laws governing socialized production may be
utilized boldly. The congress has specially referred to developing
shareholding enterprises and joint stock enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to government sources, China started the experiment
for shareholding system in large state-owned enterprises in 1984.
By now, the number of shareholding enterprises established on the
basis of state firms has stood at a mere 900 due to some
misunderstandings about the economic system.
</P>
<P>
To expand the experiment, the Chinese government will introduce
the shareholding system and buy some shares from some enterprises
so that public capital can dominate, allocate and control more
social assets.
</P>
<P>
This will consolidate the dominant position of public sector
and state-owned economy, said Chen Huanyou, secretary of the
Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that now China has listed more than 700 firms
in the domestic stock markets with more than 270 billion yuan in
capital stock.
</P>
<P>
The move benefits the re-organization of state assets so that
these enterprises can complement each other and speed up merger
and combination, said Jin Renqing, vice mayor of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Some delegates commented that shareholding is not a remedy to
treat all illness. Shi Dazhen, minister of power industry, said
the transformation through shareholding should have Chinese
characteristics.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges EU to Take First Step to End Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran today called on
European Union (EU) and Germany in particular to take the first
step in paving the way for resuming ties with the Islamic
Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said at a press conference
here that "we are hurt by what the German government did to
us. It is the responsibility of the German government to secure
our demand so that a wound which has been caused as a result of
this issue would be removed."
</P>
<P>
"The EU should look for a cure for this wound and our demand
should be fulfilled," he added in the press conference, the first
since he won the vote of confidence from the Parliament on
August 20.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi criticized the EU's decision to recall its
ambassadors to Tehran after a German court found Iranian top
leaders involved in the killing of four Kurdish Iranian
opposition leaders in the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"This issue cannot be resolved through confrontation and
unusual solidarities. The only way to resolve this would be
through political will and negotiation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors of the 15 EU countries have been absent from
Tehran since April when they were withdrawn in a protest against
Iran since the Berlin Court accused Iranian leaders of involving
in the political assassinations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Iran said later the ambassadors could return but the German
envoy must be the last to do so, a formula seen by Bonn as an
attempt to undermine EU solidarity.
</P>
<P>
European Union's special envoy Paul Meurtz came to Tehran and
held two rounds of talks with Iranian officials early this month
but he left with no progress.
</P>
<P>
At today's press conference, Kharrazi also attacked European
countries for the recent temporary ban on the importation of
Iranian pistachio into Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The pistachio ban is used as a political leverage in the
relations between Iran and Europe," he added.
</P>
<P>
The ban which will be in effect till December 15 was imposed
on Iranian pistachio after the Netherlands announced that it had
received a container of Iranian pistachio that contaminated with
fungus.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that he would be willing to meet EU foreign
ministers on the sidelines of the upcoming United Nations
General Assembly in New York this month.
</P>
<P>
"If there is any request from the European countries, and if
I feel that this would help bring about better understanding, I
will not leave their requests unanswered," he said.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- International negotiations
on southern bluefin tuna quotas stalled today after Australia,
Japan and New Zealand failed to reach an agreement, Australian
Resources Minister Warwick Parer said today.
</P>
<P>
The three countries, which form the Commission of the
Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, were unable to agree on the
total allowable catch and national quota allocations, the minister
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is very concerned that the tuna stock is still
severely depleted and that there is not, as yet, clear evidence
that the stock is rebuilding," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Two species of tuna occur off the east coast of Australia, with
the southern species an important commercial fish.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the commission hoped to meet again in
October and that the next move would be to address the rapid
increase in catch by countries operating outside the commission,
such as Korea and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The commission agreed both countries should join as a matter of
urgency, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Military Urged to Stay away from Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami today urged the military to abstain from factional
affiliation in the political arena.
</P>
<P>
"The Armed forces have to abstain from factional politics and
do their utmost to serve the revolution," said Khatami while
speaking to the 10th gathering of the commanders and officials of
the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).
</P>
<P>
He stated that the military commanders have to stay aloof of
the ongoing factionalism in the society and emphasized the
importance of law and order in the society and highlighted the
role of armed forces in maintaining that order.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC is an elite force in the Islamic Republic and
directly controlled by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. It has
about 200,000 forces in ground forces, naval forces and marines.
</P>
<P>
However, Khatami praised the country's armed forces, saying
that "the Islamic Iran relies on the its powerful and faithful
armed forces to defend its interests against the hegemonic powers
of the world."
</P>
<P>
He said that the armed forces are "humble and flexible toward
the will of the nation and sharp edged against the enemies of the
nation and revolution."
</P>
<P>
The president rejected monopoly of ideas and viewpoints in the
society and called as a "blessing" the diversity of opinions in
the political scene of the country.
</P>
<P>
Calling separation of the new generation from that of the
revolution as a threat to the revolution's survival, Khatami
expressed satisfaction over the strong bonds between the two
generations in the country.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of mobilizing the young generation
for defense of the country and called for further planning on
the national issue.

<HEADLINE> Iran Warns Against Turkey, Azerbaijan, Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi today warned that the closer ties between Israel
and Iran's two neighbors Turkey and Azerbaijan have endangered
Iranian national security.
</P>
<P>
The minister told a press conference "We are naturally
considering the presence of the Zionist Regime in such countries
as Azerbaijan and Turkey and cooperation among them as against our
national security."
</P>
<P>
"We are not pleased at all with this. Naturally we are
watching these types of developments with serious concern,"
Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
He said "It is our natural right to be concerned about such
developments. We think that this is not in the interests of the
region that the Israeli regime would want to be present in this
region."
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the Iranian government strongly slammed the
Israel-U.S.-Turkey joint military maneuvers scheduled for
mid-November in the eastern Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi has said that such
cooperation is a source of crisis in the region and set Turkey
against the world of Islam.
</P>
<P>
"Iran considers Turkey a member of the Islamic community and
rejects its cooperation with the Zionist regime as detrimental to
the interests of the Muslims in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman condemned the scheduled joint maneuver between
Turkey and Israel and called it a threat to Arab states as
well as the whole region.
</P>
<P>
As for Azerbaijan, local observers noted Iran feels uneasy with
its intelligence cooperation with Israel.

<HEADLINE> First Shipload of Oil from Overseas Explorations Sent to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINHUANGDAO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese oil tanker
carrying crude oil of the China National Oil and Gas Corporation
(CNOGC) from Peru's Talara oilfield arrived at Qinhuangdao Port in
north China this morning.
</P>
<P>
This is the first shipment since China started oil development
in foreign countries in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yan, deputy manager of CNOGC, said that global oil and
gas reserves are unevenly distributed and countries which lack
petroleum usually have to import petroleum or get involved in
exploration and development of oil resources in other countries
and then share the production with the owners.
</P>
<P>
China's annual oil and gas demand has grown five percent
because of the rapidly growing economy, but domestic oil and gas
output has increased less than two percent a year.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is necessary to take part in exploration and
development in foreign land to meet some of the domestic demand
and increase technical exchanges," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
The 60,000 tons of crude, which has a market value of 70
million yuan, was obtained by providing Peru with long-term
technical service. China can produce 320,000 tons of crude oil at
the Peruvian oilfield annually.
</P>
<P>
China has had contracts on a number of oil exploration and
development projects in Peru, the Sudan, Venezuela, Canada,
Thailand, Kuwait, Turkmenistan and Russia,since 1992 when it first
started exploration of oil resources overseas.
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, it will take part in five oil projects, which will
require a total investment of three billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Zhou Yongkang, General Manager of CNOGC,
said that in the next five years, China will expand its oil
exploration business, focusing on the Middle Asia, Russia, and
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, China will have a production capacity of over 20
million tons of oil abroad, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
So far, 21 Chinese provinces and autonomous regions have also
opened up to overseas oil companies. By the end of August, CNOGC
had signed 36 oil contracts with oil companies from nine
countries, for exploration on 402,800 sq km of land.

<HEADLINE> Former PNG Military Commander Charged with Sedition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea's (PNG)
former military commander Jerry Singirok has been charged with
sedition over the rebellion he led against the Sandline
mercenaries in March, the Australian Associated Press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Singirok, who has been dismissed from the military, was charged
on summons last week.
</P>
<P>
He did not appear at the Waigani court house today, where his
lawyer Moses Murray applied to have the case adjourned until a
second inquiry into the 35 million US dollar Sandline contract was
completed.
</P>
<P>
PNG Prime Minister Bill Skate gave an undertaking in July that
all charges against soldiers involved in the rebellion would be
withheld pending the outcome of the new inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Magistrate David Rea refused Murray's application today and
adjourned the case until September 26.
</P>
<P>
The magistrate also said Singirok must make a personal
appearance at the court, otherwise he would issue a warrant for
his arrest.
</P>
<P>
Singirok, former brigadier-general, launched a military mutiny
on March 17 against the deal to use foreign mercenaries to put
down a nine-year separatist uprising in Bougainville, an island in
PNG.
</P>
<P>
He labeled the contract "corrupt" and accused politicians and
bureaucrats of benefiting personally from it.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks of civil and military unrest followed, forcing then
Prime Minister Julius Chan and two ministers to stand aside from
office while an inquiry was held into the deal.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the inquiry cleared the Chan administration of
any corruption allegation and said Singirok was closely involved
in planning the mercenary strike against rebel leaders.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Scores Nigerian Economy Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank, in this year's
edition of its assessment of the world economy, has given Nigeria a low
score, the Guardian newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
In its report titled Global Economic Prospects and the Development
Countries, the World bank says the per capita income for Nigeria has been
dwindling in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the figure was 250 U.S. dollars. But a year later, the
figure dropped by 0.7 percent to 215 dollars. A further drop of 0.8
percent is estimated for 1996.
</P>
<P>
It acknowledges that "High oil prices over the past two years
allowed (Nigeria) a swing from budget deficits averaging 12 percent of
GDP (gross domestic product) in 1990-94 to likely surpluses in
1996-97."
</P>
<P>
However, as "there are few signs of significant improvements in
fundamental policies", the bank says Nigeria and other large economies
in Africa "continue to face significant policy challenges".
</P>
<P>
"Government controls over interest rates and a dual exchange rate
system (which subsidises dollars for government use at one-fourth the
price for private market) remain in place, while progress on
privatization or public sector reform has slowed significantly", the
bank says.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, of the three billion dollars of foreign
direct investment flowing into Africa annualy between 1994 and 1995,
two billion dollars came into Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
But the bank observes that most of the fund has gone into oil and
oil-related fields in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Except for Nigeria and South Africa, the bank projects an aggregate
growth rate of "a little more than four percent a year for the coming
decade" for sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The challenge for African and other developing countries, the bank
says, "is to establish conditions that help attract more global
production and realise more of its benefits."
</P>
<P>
Such include "political and macro-economic stability, open trade
and investment regimes, improvement in transport and communications
infrastructure, adequate protection of property rights and a
predictable institutional environment without excessive red tape."

<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled visit by
President Jiang Zemin to the United States later this year will
help promote economic and trade relations between China and the
United States, Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of foreign trade and
economic cooperation, said here today.
</P>
<P>
The visit, a major event in the Sino-US relations, is to give
an impetus to the negotiations on China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO), he said at a press conference held today
by the on-going 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China.
</P>
<P>
"Progress has been made in the Sino-US negotiations on China's
entry into the WTO. However, there still exist certain differences
between the two sides, mainly in the fields of service trade and
farm produce business," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
"China has made active efforts in this respect and signed
agreements with some signatories to the WTO on bilateral market
access," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope other WTO signatories will take a positive attitude
toward China's entry into the WTO," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Without China's participation, the WTO is an incomplete organ.
The WTO and its signatories will be the largest beneficiaries
after China is admitted into the body," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Two Kenyan companies are
collaborating to develop a web site that will enable the business
circle in eastern Africa to trade via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Media Street Ltd. is working with the international courier
DHL in the computer venture, the East African weekly newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Media Street's Managing Director Barney Lodge said that
www.eastafrica.com will provide an instant window, through which
exporters can display their products, and an on-line mechanism
for closing deals and collecting cash.
</P>
<P>
A commission is charged for all the sales made through the
network but no fee is levied for displaying products on the web
site.
</P>
<P>
Although using the Internet to export products does not cut
down freight costs, it lowers the cost of information
procurement, said Lodge.
</P>
<P>
DHL's role will be to provide efficient delivery services to
consumers who place orders through the net.
</P>
<P>
"We are already using the web site to export flowers by
courier and we hope to expand into other products including
coffee, tea and horticulture," said Lodge.
</P>
<P>
The idea behind the web site is not only to advertise goods
and service wares but also to educate consumers by providing
information about the production process, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Shell, Mobil Move to Run Nigerian Refineries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Shell and Mobil, the two
leading investors in Nigeria's oil industry, may jointly manage
two of the country's refineries in a bid to improve the
efficiency of the plants.
</P>
<P>
Towards this end, the two international oil giants are
expected to present a full technical report on the two refineries
to the minister of petroleum resources today.
</P>
<P>
The report, according to industry sources, entails the
technical auditing of the two plants to ascertain the state of
their machineries, equipment and manpower.
</P>
<P>
The Port Harcourt and Warri refineries, both in the oil
production base in southern Nigeria, have a combined capacity of
335,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
But due to the poor conditions resulted from lack of timely
maintenance, the refineries have been operating with limited
capacities for years, contributing to the frequent fuel scarcity
of the leading African oil producing country.
</P>
<P>
"If the report is accepted, Shell and Mobil will handle the
turn around maintenance (TAM) as well as manage the two
refineries," the Daily Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Constant fuel scarcity due to poor management and lack of fund
for periodical maintenance of the refineries seriously slowed
down economic activities in the country earlier this year. The
Nigerian government has to resort to the import of the fuel
products to improve supply.
</P>
<P>
The move to invite foreign companies to repair and run the
refineries is expected to boost the production of oil products in
the country.

expanded future bilateral cooperation," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that China and Chile are economically complementary
despite a wide geographical separation, and expressed China's hope
to expand economic and trade with the country.
</P>
<P>
Wu Briefed the Chilean visitors on the reform of China's
state-owned enterprises and noted that the constantly expanding
reform effort has served as a catalyst to promote enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the reform of state-owned enterprises will enter
a new stage following the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Sandoval praised China as a major power in the Asia-Pacific
Region, and noted that Chile attaches great significance to ties
with China and is ready and willing to expand economic and trade
ties of cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Sandoval arrived in Beijing on Saturday at the invitation of

<HEADLINE> Diversified Ownership to Pave Way for Restructuring (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The new definition on public
ownership and affirmation to its diversified forms, deemed as a
breakthrough at the on-going Party congress, have pointed out the
way forward for China's economic restructuring, the development of
public sector in particular.
</P>
<P>
This view is shared by delegates to the ongoing 15th National
Party Congress which opened on September 12.
</P>
<P>
It is another emancipation of the mind following the one which
took economic construction as the center of the Party's work in
the late 1970s and the decision made at the last congress in 1992
to establish socialist market economy, the delegates said.
</P>
<P>
Disregarding the traditional understanding to take public
sector as merely the state- and collectively-owned sectors, the
current Party congress affirmed that public sector also includes
the state-owned elements in the mixed sector.
</P>
<P>
"This means the increasing market shares and diversified
economic development will not fundamentally affect the socialist
nature, although they will inevitably lead to declining shares of
state-owned sector," a delegate said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new definition, public sector accounts for
one-third of the mixed sector, which pushes China's public sector
by seven percentage points, reaching 76 percent of the country's
gross national product (GNP) in 1996. The figure means that the
public sector remains dominant in China's economy.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Message Signals Greater Prosperity for China: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The message given by Jiang
Zemin at the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) signals an era of even greater prosperity for the
Chinese nation, former Nepali Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba
said today.
</P>
<P>
"He (Jiang Zemin) has reiterated the party's belief in
continuing the economic reforms while strengthening the legal and
governance systems by streamlining government organs, maintaining
stability and unity and allowing the people even greater
participation in this process," Deuba told Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
He said he was very impressed by what he saw during his visit
to China in April 1996 in his capacity as the prime minister of
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"The almost magical growth of the city of Shenzhen gives the
message that the Chinese people are capable of achieving even the
unimaginable by dint of sheer hard work, intelligence and
discipline under visionary leadership," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that China will become a strong economy in
the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Deuba added that many other Nepalese along with him are
observing with keen interest the plans and policies pursued by the
Chinese government to realize the goals of profound economic
change and the resultant prosperity from the coastal regions to
the rural interior.
</P>
<P>
"Many developing countries trying to alter their economic
landscape, and Nepal, all the more so, can learn a great deal from
the Chinese determination for a better future, " the former prime
minister said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Ruling Party Warns Against Dirty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Dirty campaigning for
positions of the Ruling Movement For Multi-Party Democracy (MMD)
has become rife in Lusaka, party chairman for elections Ackson
Sejani warned on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted Sejani as warning that all those
involved will be dealt with sternly.
</P>
<P>
Ackson Sejani called for a clean campaign where there will be
no underhand methods such as mud-slinging, name-calling and
intimidaion during the run-up to the party district elections,
which were originally scheduled for last week, have been postponed.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, MMD Lusaka District Chairman Harrson
Mukupa said the party will be destroyed if the forthcoming
elections are not free and fair.
</P>
<P>
He said the constituency officials should desist from
hand-picking candidates who are only loyal to one individual.
</P>
<P>
However, MMD Lusaka Provincial Chairman Christopher Chawinga,
who is aspiring for re-election, accused on Sunday Sejani of
leaning to one side by allowing MMD Deputy Treasurer Sylvia
Masebo to plant candidates of her own choice throughout the
consitituency.
</P>
<P>
But Masebo said, "I don't want to be drawn into discussing
cheap politics with a desperate man who became provincial
chairman by accident."
</P>
<P>
Sejani also said he is merely a political referee in the
elections and his only concern is to ensure the election
regulations are adhered to by all contestants.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak Meet in Alexandria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak met with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat to discuss the Mideast peace march in the wake of
the recent U.S. peace-saving attempt.
</P>
<P>
Their talks were focused on evaluating the situation following
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit and discussing
means of confronting the Israeli punitive measures imposed on the
Palestinians after a series of suicide bombings in Jerusalem,
Egypt's MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting in the south Mediterranean city, on the
Egyptian side, were Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and the
president's political adviser Osama el-Baz.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian side were Secretary General of the PLO
Executive Committee Mahmoud Abbas, Local Government Minister Saeb
Erekat, Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabiel
Shaath.
</P>
<P>
Albright said last Friday that under her sponsorship Abbas and
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy will discuss means to move
forward the Mideast peace march in New York by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
The meeting and Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad's coming visit
to Alexandria Thursday, were arranged as Albright's first trip to
the region has taken her Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas,
Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Ambassador Eissa Darwish said today that Mubarak and
Al-Assad will focus on the outcome of Albright's Mideast tour,
ways to promote the Arab stance, bilateral ties, regional and
international events.
</P>
<P>
Syria and the PNA were the second and third stops of Albright's
tour, which failed to score major achievements in easing tensions
and relaunching the peace march on both tracks.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli negotiations were frozen since March last
year. The Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
refused to commit to the promises of its Labor predecessor to
return the Golan Heights it seized from Syria in 1967 in exchange
for peace with the Arab neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks stalled in March over a new
Jewish settlement project in traditional Arab East Jerusalem,
which the Palestinians want as their future capital. The string of
suicide bombings in Jerusalem since end of July has fueled the
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leoneans Flee Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Sierra Leoneans are
fleeing the port area of Freetown in fear of attacks by the west
African peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG, reports reaching here
said today.
</P>
<P>
The residents were seen streaming to other areas of the capital
city or to the hinterland, carrying their property on their heads, in
cars, buses and trucks.
</P>
<P>
Reports attributed the development to ECOMOG's warning last week to
bomb the area, if Sierra Leonean troops continued its shooting at
ECOMOG aircraft.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Force Commander Victor Malu accused the
Sierra Leonean troops of deploying anti-aircraft guns amidst civilian
population, but said this would not deter his men from attacks.
</P>
<P>
On September 7, ECOMOG aircraft dropped two bombs in the Freetown
port. One did not explode, but the other damaged a vessel docked in
the port.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG accused the vessel of bringing in arms and ammunition,
apparently violating the sanctions imposed by the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS), but Sierra Leone said there were
only rice on board.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the bombardment, the Sierra Leonean troop moved
into the port area with anti-aircraft guns and other heavy weapons.
</P>
<P>
Aliu Kamara, spokesman of the ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary
Council affirmed last week that Sierra Leonean troops fired at ECOMOG
troops but failed to bring any of them down.
</P>
<P>
He expressed disgust at ECOMOG planes flying over Sierra Leonean
territories and vowed that this will never be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Aliu Kamara argued that ECOWAS has not right to impose sanctions or
blockade on Sierra Leone and that it can only make recommendations to
the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of ECOWAS member countries approved sanctions and blockade
on Sierra Leone at their summit ending August 30 in Abuja, to force
out the government of Major Johnny Kromah, which came to power after
the May 25 coup.

<HEADLINE> Tariff Cut Conducive to Foreign Investment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Import and export tariff cut
will be conducive to further improving China's investment
environment and encouraging foreign investment, a senior official
of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC)
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Lowering the tariff rate will also improve China's
competitiveness in the international market, the official said.
</P>
<P>
China has announced a drop of import and export tariff rate
from 23 percent to 17 percent on average as of October 1. The
reduction will affect more than 4,800 items, or more than 73
percent of the goods subject to tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the move shows that China will make good
on President Jiang Zemin's promise to lower the tariff rate in a
large way. Jiang made the statement at the 3rd APEC Informal
Leaders Meeting in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, China has cut tariffs several times, bringing the
rate down by 60 percent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, 1996, it readjusted its taxation policy and
canceled tax exemptions for equipment imported by foreign-funded
businesses, which increased production costs of foreign-funded
enterprises, especially hi-tech companies that need to import
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The tariff cut will help reduce production costs of
foreign-funded firms, and bring more investment into China.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stands Test in Currency Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A local leading banker said
that Hong Kong has passed with an A grade in the test of Southeast
Asia's financial turmoil, in which speculative attacks have sunk
currencies in the region to record lows.
</P>
<P>
C. P. Langley, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks
(HKAB) for the year of 1997, told Xinhua: "The period of turmoil
has been an excellent text whether or not 'one country, two
systems' really works,"
</P>
<P>
There were doubts about whether Hong Kong would remain in
complete control of its monetary and fiscal policies, its monetary
authority and its currency after July 1, though the Basic Law
mandates that Hong Kong and the Chinese inland areas should adopt
two financial systems within one country.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has managed
the situation under the two systems, by itself, and in a most
competent way possible," said Langley, who is also general manager
of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC).
</P>
<P>
"It (SAR) has stood alone, the currency has stood the test,
along with the stock market and the financial service sector as a
whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong dollar was under pressure when international
speculators had forced the devaluation of the Thai baht,
Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit, Indonesian rupiah and
Singapore dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), which plays the
function of the central bank in Hong Kong, immediately raised the
interest rate in local money market to tighten the liquidity, and
the Hong Kong dollar stood firm.
</P>
<P>
"That's what all we have to do," said Langley, who joined HSBC
in London 36 years ago and came to Hong Kong in 1972.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, compared with other currencies in Southeast Asia,
there was virtually no pressure at all on the Hong Kong dollar,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was rather like that one of the mischievous boys came on
to the big lion and just gave a few probes of mischievous pattern.
The lion snarled and so they run away," said the chairman of HKAB,
a body founded by statute in which all banks in Hong Kong are
obligatory to join. "I don't think they will be back."
</P>
<P>
But Langley acknowledged that the Southeast Asian currency
crisis did produce an effect on Hong Kong by leaving broader
interest rate differential between the Hong Kong currency and the
U.S. dollar. The three-month interest rate differential once went
up to 300 basis points, and now it has fallen to 175 basis points,
still much higher than the normal level of between 40 to 50 basis
points.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident that there is steady progress towards the normal
level," the banker said. "It is a matter of weeks rather than a
matter of months."
</P>
<P>
He added that what this turmoil has done in fact is that it
enhanced the reputation of Hong Kong as the leading international
financial center in the region.
</P>
<P>
Institutional investors are confident that fundamentals in Hong
Kong are better than anywhere else, he said.

<HEADLINE> 10 Gas Fields Discovered in Malaysia-Thailand Joint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Operators in the
Malaysia- Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) have so far
discovered 10 gas fields out of 20 exploration wells drilled.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Deputy Chief Executive Officer of
Malaysia-Thailand Joint Authority (MTJA) Songpope Polachan at the
Association of International Petroleum Negotiators 1997 Fall
Conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the operators are being vigorously pursued to
further quantify and confirm the gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), if
the contractors discovered hydrocarbon in commercial quantity in
the contract area, they were required to submit a development plan
to MTJA for approval before they could proceed with the works and
investment on the oil or gas field development.
</P>
<P>
Under the PSCs, for gas development, the MTJA and contractors
together are required to negotiate for the sale of natural gas to
prospective buyers on a joint-dedicated basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
JDA, which is governed by MTJA, covers an area of 7,250 square
kilometers of overlapping "Continental Shelf" claimed by Malaysia
and Thailand in the lower part of the Gulf of Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The National Secretary of the French Communist Party (PCF)
Sunday once again justified the participation by the PCF into the
government, despite criticism on the government decision to
partially privatize the France Telecom group and accept the European
single currency.
</P>
<P>
At the 67th ``Humanite Festival'' organized by the PCF this
weekend, the militants from the party showed their lack of
understanding of the government's policy which they judged too
liberal.
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time in 70 years, Britain and the Irish
Republicans are sitting around the same table for negotiations,
which are judged as ``historic'' by the Northern Irish parties. The
Irish Republican Army has definitely re-installed a ceasefire after
violating it, while its political wing, Sinn Fein, has promised in
written form to respect the pact of non-violence.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French Communist Party National Secretary Robert Hue said
on Sunday that France now needs a relaunch of its public services
and public enterprises instead of a dismantling of them. He was
speaking at the Humanite Festival in the presence of the government
ministers from the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
-- Northern Ireland peace negotiations resumed today in Belfast
with the presence of a delegation from Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) which is for the first time
participating in the negotiations. Two ``unionist'' parties, the
Democratic Ulster Party and the United Kingdom Unionist Party, are
boycotting the talks. British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned that
the IRA and Sinn Fein are linked, and that if the IRA resumes acts
of violence, the Sinn Fein cannot sit on the negotiation table.

<HEADLINE> China to Use More Foreign Funds, MOFTEC Vice-Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to make
active, rational and effective use of foreign capital, encouraging
investment in industries to which China gives priorities,
Vice-Minister of foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Sun Zhenyu
said here today.
</P>
<P>
China will make big strides in the use of overseas investment
after the conclusion of the 15th National congress of the
Communist Party of China, Sun said at a press conference held by
the press center of the congress here today.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to improve investment environment and raise
efficiency to make headway in the utilization of foreign funds,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the significance of the cut in tariff rates as of
October 1, which was announced yesterday, Sun said China will
reduce its average tariff rate from 23 percent to 17 percent. The
country will gradually dovetail its economic development with
internationally acknowledged practice.
</P>
<P>
On the non-tariff issue, he said, china has committed itself to
attaining the long-term target a decade ahead of the fixed date.
That is to say that China will call off all non-tariff measures by
the year 2010.

<P>
On foreign trade, Sun said the five years since 1992 were a
period in which China's foreign trade and economic cooperation
achieved its fastest progress.
</P>
<P>
In the period from 1992 to 1996, China's total foreign trade
value reached 1.168 trillion US dollars, a figure bigger than the
aggregate trade volume realized from the founding of new China in
1949 to 1991, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The figure reflected an annual average growth rate of 16.4
percent which was above the growth rate of the national economy
and nearly eight percentage points higher than the annual growth
of world trade in the same period of the time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sun predicted that China's import and export value will climb
to 400 billion dollars in the year 2000, which means that in the
four years between 1996 and 2000, China will offer a market worth
700 billion dollars and trade opportunities worth 1,400 billion
dollars to the world.
</P>
<P>
On promoting the bilateral trade between the both sides of the
Taiwan Straits, he said, investment from Taiwan constitutes a
fairly large proportion in overseas investment poured into China.
</P>
<P>
"We have worked out a series of measures to protect the
interests and rights of Taiwan investors. We hope the Taiwan
authorities will give up policies impeding investment on the
mainland of the motherland and do more practical work for the
reunification of China," he said.

<HEADLINE> France Welcomes Progress from Albright Mideast Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine today welcomed the little improvement of the situation in
the Mideast which came after the United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright visited Israel and some Arab countries last week.
</P>
<P>
But he described the decisions made by Israel on Sunday in order
to relax the tension with Palestinians as ``small steps''.
</P>
<P>
``We should salute the efforts by Madam Albright who has exerted
strong pressure by asking the Israeli government to change its
policy toward the Palestinians,'' said Vedrine in an interview with
Radio Europe One.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government announced on Sunday a step-by-step lifting
of the blockade of the Palestinian territories, the unblocking of
payment of some Israeli fund for the Palestinian Authorities, and a
veto against the building of a new housing project in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
``These few decisions are a beginning for correcting the
situation of extreme tension which was created before. We hope that
Madam Albright can pursue her efforts, and that France and Britain
and other European countries can join these efforts to give back the
form to this peace process,'' said Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine last Friday described the policy adopted by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu toward the Palestinians as
``catastrophic'' which had ``driven Palestinians to the level of
exasperation and despair''.
</P>
<P>
``The Israeli government, which does not really like criticism,
takes into account what was said, above all when it was said by
friends,'' Vedrine noted in the interview today.
</P>
<P>
He said that Friday's criticism of Israel, which aroused an
outcry from the Israeli government, was ``an appeal from the
heart.''
</P>
<P>
``I call a cat a cat... Madam Albright said the same thing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that if the peace process is not relaunched, the
perspective would become ``darker and darker'' for Israel and its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
``One should continue the peace process as if there was no
terrorism, and one should fight the terrorism as if there was no
peace process,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Higher in Thin trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
finished slightly higher against the U.S. dollar in thin trading
today.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 72.28 U.S. cents marginally higher
than previous close of 72.18.
</P>
<P>
Citibank senior dealer James Wallace said the currency market
was lethargic as a result of lack of local data and the absence of
Japanese traders due to a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
Wallace said the Australian dollar retained a slight upward
bias with support from local exporters and "it looks like it will
move upwards a little in the next few days."
</P>
<P>
The market remained swayed by sentiment dictating as easing
monetary policy stance with 59 percent of economists now expecting
a cut before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 87.17 from 87.03 against the
Japanese yen and at 1.2825 from 1.2872 against the German mark.

<HEADLINE> Urgent: Albright Pays Sudden Visit to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States' Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright arrived here today, ending a
two-week-long speculation about if her peace mission will cover
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
She hadn't decided if she would visit Lebanon just hours ago
when she was in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"There is not a final decision yet," Albright told a joint
press conference with King Hussein of Jordan, but adding "I do
understand the importance of the Lebanese track" of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon was not officially included in the secretary of state's
first Middle East tour since her taking office eight months
ago. This has provoked strong criticism by Lebanese, who said she
didn't treat Lebanon as an independent country.
</P>
<P>
During her stay here, she is expected to meet Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri for
discussions on the Lebanese track of the peace process and the
increased clashes in south Lebanon for the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Albright is also expected to persuade Lebanon to drop its idea
of boycotting a regional economic summit scheduled for November in
Doha, Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has joined several other Arab countries in announcing
the boycott of the summit -- which will see the participation of
Israel -- in protest against Israel's hardline policy towards the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright's on-going mission has brought her to Israel, the
Palestinian-rule areas, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. She made a
stop-over in Cyprus before her arrival here.

HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate and
the underemployment rate in Hong Kong for the June-August period

<P>
TEHRAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran today rebutted as
"despicable" an allegation by Israel that Tehran was involved in
recent explosions in western Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman for the foreign ministry, also
denied Iran's attempts to build long-range nuclear weapons alleged
by Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said that these rumors were prompted by the failure of the
Israeli regime in its expansionist policies, and the closer
relations of the Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
On developments in Algeria, he condemned the recent series of
killings of innocent people by radical elements.
</P>
<P>
He particularly denounced several attacks on mosques and the
assassination of a prayer leader, saying these acts are
anti-Islamic and will hurt the feelings of Muslims world over.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi called for arrest and punishment of the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
"Iran supports all solutions that will end the suffering and
bring peace and tranquility to the Muslim nation of Algeria," he
concluded.
</P>
<P>
The fundamentalists active in Algeria have been blamed for the
violence. About 60,000 people have been reportedly killed since
the government scrapped a general election dominated by the
radical Islamic Salvation Front in January 1992 .

<HEADLINE> Famous Scientist's New Thought at Party Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Talking about the
opportunities, the latest developments in science and technology
are what should be taken advantage of by the Chinese, a
distinguished scientist told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Rapid development in science and technology around the world
today has constantly brought about many new-born industries, which
in turn benefit the development of the entire society," Zhou
Guangzhao, a delegate to the current 15th National Party Congress, said
this today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou is currently the president of China Association of Science and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
This digitally-minded theoretic physicist let the reporters
look at his laptop computer,into which he had input pictures of
some of the world's most famed scientists and remarkable
inventions.
</P>
<P>
"Only those nations emphasizing science and technology, and
education while getting themselves fully prepared in terms of
knowledge and competent personnel are capable of seizing the
opportunities," said the ex-president of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"The report laid a special emphasis on the role of science and
technology as the decisive factor behind economic development,"
Zhou said, stressing that efforts should be made to carry out this
guiding principle.
</P>
<P>
"In another word, we should give full play to our creativeness,
obtain the intellectual property right for industrial development
of the nation, cultivate a standardized and developed market
economy, and engage ourselves in the international competition,
association and division of labor, replace materials with digits,"
Zhou explained.
</P>
<P>
"If we lag behind modern technologies, we would be trapped in a
cul-de-sac," Zhou took E-mail as an example."But when you have
caught up with them, a complete readjusting of your former
knowledge structure is highly compulsory."
</P>
<P>
"For instance, now that the TV, computers and E-mail have been
integrated, is it still necessary for the country to keep so many
ministries?"
</P>
<P>
Zhou called for an attitude of seeking truth from the facts,
and emancipating the mind and base undertakings on the country's
actual conditions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the reality in China," the scientist said, "China
should develop knowledge-intensive and energy- and raw
materials-saving products with high added-value, which is an
effective way out for a country like China with a large population
but insufficient resources."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Likely to Lift Quotas on Kenyan Textile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A new report by a U.S.
governmental agency has given a marked boost to Kenya's campaign
to lift the quotas imposed on some of its textile exports to the
United States, the East African newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. sharply limited the number of pillowcases and certain
kinds of shirts that could be imported from Kenya in 1994 after
Kenya had been found to serve as a trans-shipment point for Asian
textile and apparel exporters seeking to evade U.S. quotas.
</P>
<P>
Now the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), at request
of a U.S. congressional committee reviewing a bill intended to
expand U.S.-Africa trade, has furnished evidence that can be used
to help Kenya win renewal of quota-free status for pillowcases
and shirts, said the report.
</P>
<P>
An ITC study issued last week suggested that giving Kenya
virtually unlimited access to the U.S. clothing and textile
market would have negligible impact on American producers and
workers.
</P>
<P>
Quota-free entry for all of sub-Sahara's textile-exporting
countries would cause few lost jobs and very little economic loss
for U.S. manufacturers, the ITC stated.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya's trade and apparel sector has the capacity and the
capability to regain a share of the U.S. market," the report
observed.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya would first have to provide safeguards against
unlawful textile trans-shipments to the U.S. only then would the
pillowcase and shirt quotas be lifted, said the ITC.
</P>
<P>
Kenya had enjoyed a six-fold jump in its textile and apparel
sales to the U.S. in the three years before the imposition of
quotas.
</P>
<P>
Annual exports of these Kenyans goods to the U.S. peaked at 37
million Dollars in 1994 and fell to 28 million in 1995, the year
after the quotas took effect.
</P>
<P>
Currently Kenya still ranks as the fourth-largest sub-Saharan
textile and clothing exporter to the U.S., but its seven-percent
share of total sub-Saharan exports of such goods to the U.S. lags
far behind Mauritius's 43 percent, which represented 165 million
Dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Lesotho rank second and third on this scale,
with U.S. market shares of 20 percent and 17 percent
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Party Chief of Mao's Home Village Praises Jiang's Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A delegate to the five-yearly
Party congress from late Chinese leader Mao Zedong's home village
said he was so excited and inspired that he clapped his hands on
more than 10 occasions when he listened to Jiang Zemin's report at
the opening session last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mao Yushi, secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Branch of
Shaoshan, in central China's Hunan Province, said he was so eager
to tell his fellow villagers about Jiang's report that he called
them through mobile phone minutes after the conclusion of the
opening session and before leaving the venue, the Great Hall of
the People.
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Jiang Zemin has given a terrific report," shouted Mao
to his phone. "I joined other delegates in clapping hands more
than 10 times when listening to his report. I still feel pains in
my palms," said Mao Yushi.
</P>
<P>
However, when he was about leaving for the hotel to tell his
fellow villagers more of the congress, he was stopped by overseas
reporters on the staircases outside the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
When he was asked to compare Mao Zedong with Deng Xiaoping, he
said, "Both Mao and Deng advocated seeking truth from facts and
serving the people. They were identical on this point. Of course,
they were in different times and therefore faced with different
tasks."
</P>
<P>
In the order of seniority in the Mao clan, Mao Yushi, 51, is
Mao Zedong's junior by one generation. Around 70 percent of the
1,200 people in his village have the surname of "Mao."
</P>
<P>
"Since I have come for the Party congress, I must speak for
farmers, especially on the rural policy and rural economic
development," the village Party head said.
</P>
<P>
"We farmers can witness the solid changes brought by Deng
Xiaoping Theory," said he, adding there was no decent houses in
Shaoshan Village in the early 1980s. By now, all the villagers
have built their new houses.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the average per capita annual income in his village
reached 5,200 yuan, some four times the national figure. All
families in the village have bought television sets, refrigerators
and washing machines. Some of them have bought air-conditioners
and stereos and six farmers have their own cars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The village Party secretary is relieved that the report by
Jiang Zemin has taken agriculture as the center of economic
development. Still, Mao put forward some suggestions on promoting
agriculture by science and technology, the building of grassroots
organizations and the public security issue.
</P>
<P>
Shaoshan Village has two Party branches with over 60 Party
members. Some 30 more villagers have applied for the Party
membership. July 1, the birthday of the CPC, September 9, the day
when Mao Zedong passed away, and December 26, the birthday of Mao
Zedong, have become regular commemoration days for the village
Party members, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Vehicle Sales Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Vehicle sales in Kenya,
particularly from major franchise holders, continued to drop
sharply in August with extended weekends, holiday anxiety and
civil strife cutting selling time.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund's decision on July 31 to cut
key aid package to Kenya also dealt a blow to the motor industry,
according to a report from today's "East African".
</P>
<P>
Nearly all major players lost further ground compared to the
first quarter this year when the buoyant market has been brought
to a sedate level, according to data released by the Kenya Motor
Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
August's domestic figure of 976 sales in the eastern African
country are down by eight percent of 78 units, compared with the
1996 monthly average of 1,054 units.
</P>
<P>
Toyota led with 1,156 units sold in the first eight months of
the year in Kenya, ahead of Nissan, which sold 1,126. Isuzu is
third-placed, having registered 949 new vehicles by the end of
last month.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi from Simba Colt Motors took fourth position with
758 units sold, followed by Peugeot from Marshalls EA, which sold
702 units.
</P>
<P>
The Mercedes range of luxury cars, medium and heavy range of
trucks took joint sixth place by placing 368 new vehicles on the
Kenyan road.
</P>
<P>
Given that the macro-economic indicators in the motor industry
were initially favorable, especially with the reduction of duty
in the 1997 budget, the total vehicles sold from January to
August are fewer than expected and behind schedule, the report
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Kumaratunga Arrives on State Visit to Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga, being accompanied by a delegation of some
40 officials and businessmen, arrived here today on a four-day
state visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
During her visit, President Kumaratunga will hold talks with
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed which will focus on
bilateral, regional and international issues, according to a
statement by the Malaysian foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
She will witness the signing of government to government
agreements between Sri Lanka and Malaysia, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to a Sri Lankan High Commission statement on the
visit, a number of memoranda of understanding will be also be
signed during her visit between the Board of Investment of Sri
Lanka (BOI) and leading private sector conglomerates in Malaysia
on projects including infrastructure development, industrial and
science parks, airport expansion and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan president is also scheduled to deliver a keynote
address entitled "Cooperation and Conformity in Globalization" at
the Institute of Diplomacy and Foreign Relations here.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga's visit is the first ever by a Sri Lankan head of
state since both countries established diplomatic relations in
1957. The last visit by a Sri Lankan head of government to
Malaysia was made by Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The visit is expected to boost economic ties between Sri Lanka
and Malaysia which have shown an upward trend in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's export to Malaysia has increased sharply from 6
million U.S. dollars in 1994 to 27 million dollars in 1996 when
its imports from Malaysia amounted to about 159 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Dialogues on Charter Changes Start in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Presidential
Palace today started the first of a series of consultation
meetings which will also be held in 31 cities and municipalities
on proposed charter changes.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the Ramos administration claimed that such
conferences were meant to persuade the people to support charter
change moves to extend the president's term.
</P>
<P>
Palace officials denied this, adding the consultation is not
aimed at "preempting" the scheduled September 21 mass rally, in
which some 1 million people will gather to voice their anger over
amending the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The multi-sectoral dialogues will be held between September 15
and 19 and led by several cabinet members. Some 500 to 1,000
participants are expected to attend each conference.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos called for the consultation meetings on
September 3 when former president Corazon Aquino and Cardinal
Jaime Sin urged the holding of the September 21 anti-Charter
change rally.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for our people to be given the opportunity to
pause, and be informed and reflect... on the issue of charter
changes as well as our economic condition with greater sobriety,
calm and discernment," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, President Ramos' failure to clarify that he would not
seek a second term or the extension of his term is leading the
country to political instability, for which many foreign investors
have pulled their funds out of the country, fueling the sharp
devaluation of the peso.
</P>
<P>
The business community has complained that the Ramos
administration has talked too much about charter changes rather
than the development of the economy.

</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, China will focus on new

co-operative projects.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China has developed legal protection for

<HEADLINE> Operation Launched to Eradicate Kenya's Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
mobilized as many as 20,000 policemen in an operation to end a
four-week violence in the tourists' resort of Mombasa and its
environs, the " East African" quoted a senior police officer as
reporting today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper quoted Japheth Mwania, who is in charge
of Coast Province police, as saying that the operation will not
end until the violence is eradicated.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan police spokesman Peter Kimanthi told the paper that "By
Monday, the security situation will have changed dramatically."
</P>
<P>
Mwania, who was transferred from Nyanza Province in an
emergency reshuffle, has set up operational headquarters at
Ukunda, one of the raiders' target areas.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that security forces had targeted four areas in
Kwale and Kilifi districts in the Coast Province where more than
60 people have been killed by armed gangsters during the past one
month.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that in an operation starting at Ukunda on
Thursday evening, the Kenyan police killed 10 suspected raiders.
</P>
<P>
Mwania is leading a combined force of the general service
Unit, one company from Gilgil, administration policemen and
members of the Flying Squad from Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Leaflets circulating in coast region have called on
non-coastals to pack up and go and more than 100,000 upcountry
dwellers in the Likoni area alone are estimated to have fled
since the violence started with armed raiders attacking Likoni
police stations on August 13.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi reiterated on Thursday the
government's intention to end the violence once for all.
</P>
<P>
Tourist hotels in the coast region have been dealt a crippling
blow by the on-going month-long orgy of violence and brutal
killings.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the country's tourism industry had lost
about 10 million U.S. Dollars due to a 50 percent drop in hotel
bookings in the past one month.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Move Government Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
decided today to move the government building behind the
parliament instead of putting up a new wing for new ministers.
</P>
<P>
TVNZ reported that the new project will cost the government 160
million New Zealand dollars (101 million U.S. dollars) while
putting up a new wing only needs 94 million dollars (59 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The original plan to build a new wing to accommodate more
ministers after the formation of the new coalition government last
December has met strong opposition from the public. They accused
the government of trying to build a "palace" by spending 94
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Now the government decided to move the government building
known as the Beehive because of its shape to make room for an
expansion of the parliament building. But ironically, the cost
will rise to 160 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jim Bolger said the whole project could be
completed by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The 11-storeyed Beehive was built in the 1970s. It now houses
all the government ministers.

<P>
The culture with Chinese characteristics is not rooted in
desert or sterile land, but has developed through inheritance,
reforms and development of Chinese traditional culture.
</P>
<P>
Yet our national culture comprises both the cream and dross.
Aimed at building socialist culture, we should discard the dross
and select the essential through careful analysis and study.
</P>
<P>
Socialist culture with Chinese characteristics not only
reflects the basic features of socialist economy and politics, but
lends a great impetus to their advance as well.
</P>
<P>
Dialectical understanding of the inter-relationship among
economics, politics and culture is one of the viewpoints of the
historical materialism.
</P>
<P>
It is based on this very understanding that we believe that the
building of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics cannot
be separated from the overall cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
At present, China is at an important historical period of
inheriting the past and ushering the future, and all fields,
including economic, political and social life, are undergoing fast
and profound reforms and development, thus putting forward
extremely urgent tasks and providing extremely rich materials for
the building of socialist culture.
</P>
<P>
Once the above mentioned two aspects are combined, I believe
that a socialist culture featuring characteristics of both the
nation and the time will be guaranteed, enabling it to become a
kind of scientific, popular and national socialist culture serving
the modernization drive and the needs of the world and the future.
</P>
<P>
With a new century right on the corner, we are fully confident
of the future of China.
</P>
<P>
We should set our sights high not only over the economic
construction, but also over the cultural progress as well just as
what Jiang said in his report: "In the great practice of the
socialist modernization drive, we are sure to create a more
magnificent socialist culture with Chinese characteristics and
make due contribution to human civilization."

<HEADLINE> New Medical Technique In China Helps Bone Cancer Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Doctors at Shibei Hospital
in Shanghai have cured a young osteoblastoma patient by removing
the tumor from his left tibia after intensive chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
The traditional treatment for osteoblastoma, which occurs in
young or middle-aged people and which has a high mortality rate,
is to amputate the infected part and to use chemotherapy for the
entire body. This could result in serious side effects however, or
even allow the cancer to spread.
</P>
<P>
When the 18-year-old patient was admitted to hospital, Dr. Cao
Mingjun, director of the orthopedics department, decided to use a
new medical technique with the help of other doctors to avoid
amputating his limb.
</P>
<P>
They first injected large chemical doses into the bone marrow
of the tibia to kill the cancer cells and then removed the
tumor. They put a special artificial replacement for the tibia,
which will help him live a better life.
</P>
<P>
The technique has proven to be an effective way to help ease
the pain of serious handicapping caused by amputation.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Manufacturing Sector Likely to Dwindle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's manufacturing sector
might dwindle drastically by the year 2000 because of lack of
investment, Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed the deteriorating situation in the
industry to the government's failure to check illegal trading
practices by some neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
It said that some foreign investors are reluctant to invest in
the local manufacturing sector because Zambia is rapidly turning
out to be a "dumping ground" for cheap goods from South Africa
and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Muyunda Mate, Director of Pro-Invest Agency,
as saying on Sunday that most of the big manufacturing firms will
pull out of Zambia by the year 2000 because of the "unconducive
economic climate".
</P>
<P>
"Zambia risks to have no direct foreign investment by the turn
of the century because the government seems not to care much
about the local sector," said Mate, whose company is involved in
enticing foreign direct investment to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the current situation would spell doom to the
local industrial sector and urged the government to counteract
and slap reasonable duty on all imported goods into the country
if local industries are to be protected.
</P>
<P>
In another related report, the paper said over 50,000 jobs
have been lost in the manufacturing sector since the
liberalization of the country's economy six years ago.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Infection Rate to Go Up in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The rates of infection of
HIV/AIDS will peak at about 27 percent of the adult population of
Zambia next year and decline gradually to 14 percent by
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
According to the government and United Nations report on
prospects for sustainable human development in Zambia available
here today, the rate of HIV/AIDS infection will continue to rise
rapidly towards the end of the decade and possible into the next
one.
</P>
<P>
The report said at its peak, the rate of infection will double
the estimated figure in 1995.
</P>
<P>
During 1995 alone, between 600,000 to 700,000 people were
estimated to be HIV/AIDS positive and between 40,000 and 50,000
were estimated to died from the disease.
</P>
<P>
Computer projections show that burden of AIDS and difficulties
that it brings to all aspects of life are likely to become
substantially greater in the year ahead, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Projections for the future population growth rates indicate
that the current 3.2 percent rate will decline to about 2.3
percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted leader of Zambia Congress of
Trade Unions (ZCTU) as saying at the weekend the AIDS pandemic is
threatening productivity and the survival of many companies which
are experiencing a high increase in the mortality rate of their
employees.

<HEADLINE> Israel Lifts Internal Closure on Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Army announced
today that the internal closure on Palestinian areas in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip was lifted at 5 o'clock this morning.
</P>
<P>
An army spokesman said that Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Army Chief of Staff Ammon Shahak have approved the
easing of the internal closure. However, he added that the
general closure on the territories remains in force.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 2,300 merchants, medical personnel, clergy and
staff of international organizations from the Palestinian-ruled
areas were permitted to enter Israel.
</P>
<P>
Following the bombing attack in Jerusalem on September 4, which
killed seven people and wounded 190 others, Israel re-imposed the
total closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip and demanded all
Palestinian workers inside Israel return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
Internal closure was also ordered on villages and towns under
Palestinian control and Palestinians were barred from entering
industrial zones in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel's decision to ease internal closure was a gesture of
good will in view of the initial steps taken by the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) in the anti-terror war after United
States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's three-day visit to
Israel and Palestinian-ruled areas last week.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have described Albright's talks with the PNA
as a qualified success, saying that she convinced the PNA that
it must wage an all-out war against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has arrested 120 militants in the wake of Albright's
visit. Palestinian and Israeli security officials also met
last weekend in what both sides termed a productive session.
The PNA later said that it would continue its fight against
terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Jewish Settlers Clash in East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Scores of Palestinians
clashed with Jewish radicals late Sunday night in East
Jerusalem's Ras Amud, after three Jewish families moved into this
mostly Arab neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Three Jewish families, including 15 adults and children,
moved late Sunday night into two empty houses in the
controversial neighborhood of 11,000 Palestinians and sparked
immediate protests from Palestinian residents there.
</P>
<P>
They began shouting abuses at each other. The Palestinians
dismissed the Jews as thieves to take over their houses in late
night and the Jews responded by saying that Jews had the right to
live there and would remain there.
</P>
<P>
The shouting game quickly erupted into a fist-fighting between
radicals from both sides. Some Palestinians threw stones at Jews
and smashed some of their cars. But the two groups were fastly
separated by a large number of Israeli police who were deployed to
prevent further violence.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said that the police would not act to
remove the Jewish families and would allow them to remain there,
because their entry into the houses was legal. The houses were
purchased legally by the Miami-based American businessman Irving
Moscowitz, who intends to build 70 housing units for Jews, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The three Jewish families took the action following a decision
by Israeli Interior Ministry not to block Moscowitz's housing
project. Earlier Sunday, the ministry's Construction Appeals
Committee rejected a petition by two leftist Jerusalem
Municipality councillors to demand for the revocation of the
building license to Moscowitz.
</P>
<P>
In strong reaction to the latest provocation, Palestinian
officials warned about the danger of an explosion of Arab
violence.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, Palestinian National Authority's Minister for
Jerusalem Affairs, called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to expel the settlers from Ras Amud and block the
building project there. He warned that the failure to do so would
lead to violence and kill what is remaining in the dormant peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli opposition Labor party leader Ehud Barak lashed out at
the action taken by the Jewish radicals by moving into the
controversial Arab neighborhood, denouncing it as a "dangerous
provocation" that caused serious harm to the chance of peace and
security in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu implied on Sunday that he would not give the
green light to the Ras Amud construction at this time when
the tension between Israel and the Palestinian side was running
high due to the prolonged deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's media adviser David Bar-Illan said that the prime
minister has the final say on approving the project and will
invoke state security or public order to block its
implementation.

CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela has said he would visit Egypt in October and was committed
to improving relations with all Mideast nations, the Middle East
Times reported in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
"I will visit Egypt in October as part of a tour of the Middle
East which could include Saudi Arabia and Oman," Mandela said last
week in an interview with the English-language weekly.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told the weekly that "our policy is to establish good
relations with all countries, regardless of the role they played
against the South African people during the struggle against
apartheid."
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the time will come when I can visit not only
Israel but Palestine," he said, calling on Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to fully implement the agreements signed with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During the days of apartheid, South Africa maintained strong
links with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa visited South Africa on
August 24-26, when he signed with his South African counterpart
Alfred Nzo several agreements of cooperation in tourism, science

prevention of fiscal evasion, and air services.

<HEADLINE> Navigation On Yangtze River After River is Dammed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River will still
be open to navigation after the Three Gorges Dam starts blocking
the river in early November, according to Chinese engineers.
</P>
<P>
The river was dammed once before for the Gezhouba water control
project in Hubei Province in the 1980s, halting navigation for
about half a year. Cargo was moved by train and passengers
travelled by changing ships.
</P>
<P>
To ensure normal navigation during the Three Gorges
construction work, engineers have devised a plan using
cofferdams. A water diversion canal and temporary ship lock will
be in use six years after the Three Gorges Dam starts stopping the
flow of Yangtze in early November. The permanent ship lock will be
responsible for ships after the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
The canal is 3,726 m. long and 350 m. wide.
</P>
<P>
Ship locks and lifts will be used for three months of the year
when the flood season begins and water flow exceeds 20,000
cu.m. per second at the dam construction site.
</P>
<P>
Engineers say that a temporary ship lock and lift are being
built on the northern bank and can move a 3,000-dwt ship quickly
cross the dam.
</P>
<P>
They say that preparations for the damming work has gone well
and an experiment with navigation on the canal was done on July
1. The canal will be put into formal operation in October. The
temporary ship lock will be put into service next April.
</P>
<P>
Departments have also started dredge work on navigation channels
near the site of the dam.

<HEADLINE> Shareholding Helps Increase State Assets Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Development of the
shareholding system will maintain and increase the value and raise
the efficiency of the state assets, Vice-Minister of finance Zhang
Youcai said here today.
</P>
<P>
It can consolidate the dominant position of the public
ownership and the guiding role of the state sector, said Zhang,
who is also director of the State Bureau of State Assets.
</P>
<P>
But he said the institution of the shareholding system in state
enterprises must be carried out carefully, warning against the
tendency of being impatience for quick success, violation of
operating rules and practice of fraud.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who is attending the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), told Xinhua, "If we don't
reorganize the state assets and put them in circulation, it is
impossible to solve the problem of irrational structure and
inefficiency and, worse still, the state assets will gradually be
devaluated."
</P>
<P>
Attracting and allocating social funds by expanding capital
market and taking part in developing the shareholding system and
the mixed sector, the state assets can optimize structure,
maintain their value and increase efficiency, he said, adding this
has been verified in the practices in Shanghai Municipality and
Guangdong Province, which have a large number of foreign-funded
enterprises of mixed ownership.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Zhang said, the two places exceeded
other areas in terms of the number of state-owned enterprises, the
total value of assets, the net value, interests of state-owned
shares and the total volume of state assets.
</P>
<P>
He also warned against the possibility of loss of state assets
in the course of their circulation.
</P>
<P>
The state has promulgated three regulations and over 100 rules,
thus having basically curbed the loss of state assets.
</P>
<P>
He called for building a unified, competitive and orderly
market in the development of shareholding and joint stock
partnership systems so as to prevent the practice of "rushing
headlong into mass action."
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a housekeeper of the state assets, had full confidence
in continuing to keep the state-owned sector in a dominant
position in China.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the end of 1996, the state assets in China
totaled 6.5 trillion yuan, 330 times the figure in the early
1950s.
</P>
<P>
State assets have produced 60 percent of the state revenue and
provided 67 percent of the job opportunities in urban areas, he
said.

BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- (At Xinhua's request, some
delegates to the current 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) write what they see, discuss and think during
the congress in diary form, which we think will provide outsiders
with some information about this major event. The following diary,
the fifth of its kind, was written by Professor Li Wenhai,
president of People's University of China. -- Ed.)
</P>
<P>
The report delivered by Jiang Zemin at the opening session of
the congress made an incisive exposition over the cause of
building socialist culture with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin stressed that a socialist culture with Chinese
characteristics is a major force in uniting and inspiring the
people, and an important indicator of our overall national
strength.
</P>
<P>
He further urged that the whole Party fully understand that
cultural advancement is essential and urgent because it plays a
great role in developing the cause of socialism and rejuvenating
the nation.
</P>
<P>
The reforms and development of culture, like rivers and forests,
have origins and roots. Then, what are the origins and the root
of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics?

the 5,000-year-old civilization of the Chinese nation and is
deeply rooted in our endeavor to build socialism with Chinese

<HEADLINE> Burundi Military Regime Rejects Summit Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Burundi military
regime of Major Pirre Buyoya has rejected to take part in the
Arusha mediation talks on the conflicts in the country as
directed by a recent Great Lakes region summit.
</P>
<P>
Local press today quoted Buyoya as saying in Bujumbura last
week that his government will not send a delegation to attend
the talks where members of the delegation were not assured of
security.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya also reiterated objections to mediator Junius Nyerere,
saying, "I personally respect Mwalimu Nyerere, but at the
mediation process he has been gradually failing to observe
neutrality and finally appears openly one-sided."
</P>
<P>
Nyerere should work alongside with another mediator and Arusha
should no longer be the venue of the talks, Buyoya said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Great Lakes region in the summit early this
month directed the Burundi military regime to the peace talks in
Arusha or prepare to face stronger sanctions for hindering
progress towards people in that central African nation.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi political crisis which was triggered by the
assassination of the country's first elected President Melchior
Ndadaye in 1993 reached a new turn in July 1996 following a
military coup that brought Major Pierre Buyoya to power after
toppling a civilian government of President Sylvester
Ntibantunganya.

<HEADLINE> Responsibility System For Grassland to be fully implemented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China's herdsmen are expected
to work under a contract responsibility system by the end of this
century, according to an agriculture official.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yanxi, vice-minister of agriculture, told a meeting here
recently that he approves of the results of the system in
improving animal husbandry and protecting the ecology of the
nation's vast grasslands.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, about 1.7 billion mu (113 million
hectares) of grassland, or 35.6 percent of China's usable
grassland, were being cared for under contract by herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
Most of China's pasture is located in frontier areas
inhabited by ethnic minority groups who used to live a migrant
life.
</P>
<P>
The full implementation of the contract responsibility system
is of strategic importance to developing frontier areas and to
improving herdsmen's life, Zhang said. Statistics show that some
16.74 million people in the pasture areas still live below the
official poverty line, accounting for about 30 percent of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
"The contract responsibility system has also proved to be
effective in preventing the grassland ecology from deteriorating,"
Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> High Growth Predicted for Latin America, the Caribbean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Latin America and the
Caribbean countries are expected to have a 5 percent growth rate
and a record low inflation of 12 percent in 1997, the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The figures would represent the lowest inflation in the region
in decades and one of its strongest economic performances in the
1990s, the bank's office of chief economist said.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Peru and some smaller countries are
expected to have growth rates approaching or over 6 percent, while
Brazil may have about 4 percent, a little pick-up from last year's
3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The region's weighted average inflation may drop to 12 percent
this year, or a median rate of 9.5 percent, down from the average
inflation of 18.5 percent in 1996 and 27.7 percent in 1995, and a
remarkable decline from over 100 percent inflation in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income for the region would rise an estimated 3
percent during the year, the bank said, but warning reforms must
be stepped up to ensure sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in its 1997 Economic and Social Progress also Report
released today, the bank said that Latin American countries are
facing three challenges: consolidating macro-economic stability,
completing structural reforms, and substantially elevating the
level of education of its work force.
</P>
<P>
It said that only 4 percent growth would be sustainable unless
these challenges are met.
</P>
<P>
To sustain a growth rate of 5.5 percent, Latin America must
complete structural reforms, which are lagging in sectors like tax
collection, privatization, labor and judicial institutions, it
said.
</P>
<P>
If the average education of the work force is raised from 5
years to 6.8 years in the next decade, growth could be increased
by at least another percentage point and poverty significantly
reduced, the report said.

Salvatore Schillachi was about to leave.
</P>
<P>
Coach of the month was Kim Ho, the man in charge of South
Korea's league team Suwon Bluewings.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Waives Import Duty, Sales Tax on Maize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government has waived import duty and sales tax on maize imports
to encourage importation of the grain from outside the country up
to the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The facility beginning from today was announced by President
Benjamin Mkapa while addressing the nation last night.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa declared 1997/98 as a food deficit period, calling on
relief organizations and other international agencies to help the
country in checking the food shortage.
</P>
<P>
He said the country faces an imminent food shortage, needing
over 916,000 tons of cereals in 13 regions.
</P>
<P>
The president assured the businessmen that the government will
liaise with the Tanzania Harbors Autority, the Tanzania Railway
Corporation, departments of customs and health to ensure quicker
clearance of consignments and ferry them upcountry.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will help maize importers obtain
warehouse facilities for storage of food stocks at reasonable tax
rates for a short period while making final disposal
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Mkapa said the government has prohibited the
exportation of maize.
</P>
<P>
He urged countrymen to use food sparingly, to desist from
extravagant celebrations which involve making brews that consume
cereals and legumes.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa further called on people not to be choosy on food,
especially during this period of shortage.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the food shortage to the poor methods still
dominant in the agricultural sector, noting that the country's
food supply still depends on unreliable rainfall.
</P>
<P>
He urged farmers in areas which receive short rains to start
preparing their fields early and using drought-resistant seeds.
</P>
<P>
Concerted efforts from all sectors of the population will be
needed in fighting famine, since such a situation is not
different from armed warfare, Mkapa said.

Cooperation (APEC) science and technology park network began formal
operation today.
</P>
<P>
The first APEC meeting on science and technology industrial
parks opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the three-day meeting, Song Jian, State Councilor and
Minister in charge of the State Science and Technology Commission
(SSTC), read a letter from President Jiang Zemin that said the
parks were begun more than half a century ago and have helped
commercialize, industrialize, and internationalize scientific
findings.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is sponsored by the SSTC and Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and attended by government officials, administrative
personnel of the science and technology parks, scientists at
research institutes, and business people from the 18 APEC members.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology parks in many countries have become new
areas of growth, Jiang said in the letter, adding that the network
should encourage exchanges and co-operation among member parks and
contribute to sustainable economic growth in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also wrote inscriptions for China's first group of four
state-level high-tech parks opened to the APEC members as of today
separately. They are high-tech parks in Beijing, Suzhou, Hefei and
Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
At an informal meeting of APEC last November, Jiang proposed
that an APEC science and technology park network be set up, and
the first one was built in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in
Guangdong Province. So far, more than 110 high-tech parks, 53 of
them state-level, have been established across the country.

<HEADLINE> Thai Farm Produce Exports Projected Higher This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports of farm
products are likely to reach 242 billion baht (6.8 billion U.S.
dollars) in value, up 8.3 percent in the baht value compared with
last year, a leading local research center predicts.
</P>
<P>
The baht's de facto depreciation since July 2 would be the main
factor contributing to the rise, the Thai Farmers Bank Research
Center says.
</P>
<P>
The export value of rubber is expected to reach 65 billion baht
(1.83 billion dollars) this year, up 2.6 percent from last year,
while exports of rubber products will be valued at 21.3 billion
baht (599 million dollars), up 12.2 percent owing to increased
orders from Japan.
</P>
<P>
The export value of vegetable and fruit will rise 7.4 percent
to 29.7 billion baht (835 million dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Exports of frozen chickens are also expected to increase 2.4
percent to 9.2 billion baht (260 million dollars) in value.
</P>
<P>
However, the research center says that rice exports this year
are expected to be worth 50 billion baht (1.4 billion dollars),
down 1.4 percent from last year, because of competition from other
countries and the drought in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Exports of frozen shrimps are expected to value 37 billion baht
(1.04 billion dollars), down 14.8 percent as local shrimp-raising
farms are troubled by diseases.
</P>
<P>
Other products are also expected to drop, according to the
research center.

<HEADLINE> SKorea Press: China to Further Develop Market Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China will further develop
market economy, a principle reiterated by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin at the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), a newspaper editorial said today.
</P>
<P>
Outlining China's blueprint for the 21st century, Jiang
stressed that China's economic development is still at the primary
stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that China is determined to further develop
market economy and make more active efforts to push forward its
reforms, said the editorial carried by the Korean Daily News today.
</P>
<P>
Unlike some other emerging countries in Asia, which are still
struggling to get out of economic difficulties, China's economy
has grown steadily into a strong force, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
However, the editorial added, the remarkable changes in China
did not come overnight. They are a result of unyielding efforts of
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
What is going on in China will leave a significant impact in
this region, the editorial said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stands Test in Currency Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A leading local banker said
that Hong Kong has passed with an A grade in the test of Southeast
Asia's financial turmoil, in which speculative attacks have sunk
regional currencies to record lows.
</P>
<P>
C. P. Langley, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks
(HKAB) for the year of 1997, told Xinhua: "The period of turmoil
has been an excellent test of whether or not 'One Country, Two
Systems' really works."
</P>
<P>
There used to be doubts about Hong Kong's complete control of
its fiscal policies, monetary authority and currency after July 1,
though the Basic Law states that Hong Kong and the Chinese
inland areas introduce two financial systems within one country.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has
handled the situation under the two systems, by itself, and in a
most competent way possible," said Langley, who also serves as
general manager of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation
Ltd (HSBC).
</P>
<P>
"It (HKSAR) has stood alone, the currency has stood the test,
along with the stock market and the financial service sector as a
whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong dollar was under pressure of devaluation, when
international speculators had devaluated the Thai baht, Philippine
peso, Malaysian ringgit, Indonesian rupiah and Singapore dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), which functions as the
"central bank" in Hong Kong, immediately raised the interest rate
in the local money market to tighten the liquidity, so that the
Hong Kong dollar could stand firm.
</P>
<P>
"That's what all we have to do," said Langley, who joined HSBC
in London 36 years ago and came to Hong Kong in 1972.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, compared with other currencies in Southeast Asia,
there was virtually no pressure at all on the Hong Kong dollar,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was rather like that one of the mischievous boys came on
to a big lion and just gave a few probes of mischievous
pattern. The lion snarled and so they run away," said the chairman
of HKAB, a body founded by statute in which all banks in Hong
Kong are obligatory to join.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they will be back," he noted.
</P>
<P>
But Langley acknowledged that the Southeast Asian currency
turmoil did have an effect on Hong Kong by leaving broader
interest rate differential between Hong Kong and U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The three-month interest rate differential between Hong Kong
and U.S. dollars once went up to 300 basis points, which now has
fallen to 175 basis points, still much higher than the normal
level of between 40 to 50 basis points.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident that there is a steady progress towards the
normal level," the banker said. "It is a matter of weeks rather
than a matter of months."
</P>
<P>
He added that Hong Kong's reputation has been enhanced after
this turmoil, as a leading international financial center in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Institutional investors are confident that fundamentals in Hong
Kong are better than anywhere else, he said.

<HEADLINE> Five Special Markets Being Built In Southeast China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Fuzhou, the capital of China's
Fujian province, is building five large specialized markets to
help local commerce and cater to the growing consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
One of them, a second-hand goods market built on four hectares
of land, opened for business recently in downtown Fuzhou. It
trades, appraises and stores used goods, and provides
information. The first phase of the market project cost 15 million
yuan (1.8 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The second market, the Yusheng Wholesale Market, handles farm
produce, clothing, and souvenirs. The main building, a
32,000-sq.m. structure was completed recently at a cost of 45
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The third is an arts and crafts center in a garden-style,
scheduled for completion next May.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of a wholesale aquatic products market is
under way on 13.33 hectares of ground and is expected to generate
2.3 billion yuan in sales annually.
</P>
<P>
The fifth market includes expansion of a footwear center that
opened in 1994. Fuzhou Footwear City has already become the
largest store of its kind in Fujian province.

<HEADLINE> World Bank/IMF Meetings Enhance Hong Kong Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meetings will give Hong
Kong an opportunity to demonstrate to the world that nothing has
changed after handover and business is as usual, said a leading
local banker.
</P>
<P>
C. P. Langley, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks
(HKAB) for the year of 1997, told Xinhua: "The meetings will have
a tremendously positive impact on Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
He said that earlier this year IMF reclassified Hong Kong as an
advanced economy. "They would not have done that if they had not
been confident that the structural strength of Hong Kong was a
permanent feature of the economic landscape."
</P>
<P>
"That was a vote of confidence in the future relationship
between the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and
the inland areas of China," said Langley, who is also general
manager of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC).
</P>
<P>
Now the annual meetings, hosted by China in the HKSAR, mean
another very important expression of confidence in the strength,
stability and future prospects of China, and especially of HKSAR,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The annual meetings, scheduled for September 23-25, are the
most prestigious annual event in the international financial
community. More than 14,000 participants, including finance
ministers and central bank governors, government officials,
representatives of international and regional organizations,
business executives and journalists, will come for the meetings,
the first major international event in Hong Kong after July 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will have the opportunity to show before them what
we have said before handover has come to pass after handover,"
Langley said. "Business as usual, stability and confidence -- all
these are facts of post-handover Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
As the chairman of the HKAB for a special year, Langley has
taken it as a top priority to convince overseas investors that
essentially nothing has changed after July 1. "It takes two
aspects, business as usual and stability," he added.
</P>
<P>
He cited as an example Hong Kong's banking system that stood
well in the test of the Southeast Asia's financial turbulence,
thanks to its solid foundation and prudent management.
</P>
<P>
"In a completely free and fiercely competitive market, banks
cannot afford to adopt imprudent policies. Banks have to be
efficient, profitable and inspiring consumers' confidence," said
Langley, who has worked for HSBC since 1961 and has been in Hong
Kong for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 of the world's top 100 banks are operating in Hong
Kong, one of the highest concentrations in the globe.
</P>
<P>
General managers of the three note-issuing banks in Hong Kong
-- HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank and the Bank of China -- chair
the HKAB by rotation for one year each.
</P>
<P>
HKAB is a body founded by statute mainly for the purpose of
regulating short-term deposit interest rates. All banks in Hong
Kong are obligatory to join the association, which represents
members' views to government bodies and monitors the observance of
framework of rules.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Wants to Replace 1950 Indo-Nepali Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Nepal has officially
proposed to India that the 47-year-old Peace and Friendship Treaty
between them be replaced with a new one, Nepali Foreign Minister
Kamal Thapa said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon returning home Sunday from a five-day visit to
India, Thapa said: "We have told them that we need a new treaty to
replace the 1950 treaty, but we haven't yet received any response
from India."
</P>
<P>
"We haven't yet put forth any specific proposals. Rather we
have, in principle, apprised them of our stance. We didn't discuss
the treaty in detail," he told reporters at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The Himalayan kingdom has already called for a review of the
1950 treaty, saying it does not reflect the changing times.
</P>
<P>
Thapa also pointed out that security provisions of the treaty
need to be approached in a new context while the provisions
regarding national treatment which are practical should be
maintained.
</P>
<P>
India has maintained that the treaty has provisions only for
scrapping, but none for modifications.

<HEADLINE> Haze Continues to Shadow Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Haze caused by forest fires
continued to envelope many parts of Indonesia Sunday as people
began praying for rain in hopes of quickly doing away with a
problem that would tarnish Indonesia's image abroad, Antara news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
In Palangkaraya, Central Kalimantan, thousands of Muslims
gathered in the parking lot of Bank Indonesia late Sunday
afternoon to pray for rain, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The prayers said if the country failed to control the forest
fires which caused the haze, it could taint Indonesia's image
abroad since the smoke was also affecting neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
At least 300,000 hectares of forest, mostly in Sumatra and
Kalimantan, have been destroyed by fires this year.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale plantations and timber companies have been blamed
for the smoke because they persisted in using fires to clear land.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said
earlier that the haze had reached unhealthy levels in Indonesia
and in neighboring Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He said about 20 million people are in danger of respiratory
problems due to the thick smoke.
</P>
<P>
The haze has also caused the delay of 800 flights and at least
seven boat collisions on Central Kalimantan's Mahakam River in the
last few months.
</P>
<P>
Antara said that Tabing airport in Padang, West Sumatra, was
closed on Sunday as visibility decreased to less than one
kilometer, far below the normal 3.6 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The forest fires are no longer limited to Sumatra and
Kalimantan. Smaller fires have also flared in Sulawesi, Irian Jaya
and Java, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In North Sulawesi only, it reported, fires have destroyed more
than 11,000 hectares of forest land since early August.

<P>
TOKYO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- People aged 65 or older now
account for 15.6 percent of Japan's population and those aged 70
or above make up 10.3 percent, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The record-high figures were announced by the Management and
Coordination Agency prior to today's Respect-for-the-Aged Day.
</P>
<P>
According to the agency, the number of people over 65 has
reached 19.73 million, up 730,000 from last year, and those over
70 have exceeded the 10 percent mark for the first time after
climbing 0.4 percentage point from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Of those over 65, women outnumber men by 40 percent, or 11.56
million to 8.17 million, respectively, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency, in a survey released Sunday, said nearly half of
the elderly questioned fear they will suffer from senile dementia
and will require nursing care as they grow old.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a poll conducted by the Yomiuri Shimbun, a leading
Japanese newspaper last month, also showed that a majority of the
elderly felt anxious about aging.
</P>
<P>
Aging worries affected 60.9 percent of respondents from 3,000
people polled nationwide in August, it said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Press Hails China's Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Australian press today
hailed China's economic reform outlined at the 15th Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), saying it would offer better
opportunities for Australian businessmen.
</P>
<P>
"The reform should lead eventually to long-term gains and bring
the prospect of better opportunities for Australian businesses
involved in the China relationship," Australia's leading newspaper
The Australian said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that Australians should understand the
connection, because China is now our third largest trade partner
in Asia behind Japan and South Korea, and is destined to become
the world's largest economy around 2020," it said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the reforms, outlined by President Jiang Zemin in
his opening address to the congress in Beijing last Friday, as a
huge challenge, the editorial said that "in the long term,
President Jiang's proposed revamp of the state-owned sector should
help provide the conditions for sustained economic growth and job
creation."
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review, the country's leading business
newspaper, said the speeding up of the reforms would offer China a
chance to take the lead in Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
"Although the (reform) program is clearly forced by domestic
imperatives, it gives China, faster than many anticipated, an
opening to seize Asian economic leadership after the appearance of
major systemic problems in Southeast Asia and the fizzling out of
Japan's Big Bang," the review said.
</P>
<P>
It said the statement of stepping up the pace of the reform is
"ideally timed," providing a "positive setting" for forthcoming
World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings in Hong
Kong and Jiang's visit to Washington late next month.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will see a glut of
1.45 million tons of steel bars this year due to the slowdown in
the construction industry.

products, ranging from 500 baht to 1,500 baht based on a rate of

YINCHUAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region has managed to bring the major endemic
diseases under control.
</P>

incidence dropped from 35 percent to three percent, and 140,000
patients had been treated by the end of 1996.
</P>

Fluorine poisoning affected 640,000 people in 480 villages. The
region has spent more than 70 million yuan (about eight million US
dollars) on water purification projects to deal with the problem
and and provides 480,000 people with low-fluorine water, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Brucellosis is spread by infected animals or animal
products. No new cases have been reported in recent years, and no
outbreaks of plague have been reported since 1962, due to
effective prevention measures.

Bangkok, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Gen. Mongkol Ampronpisit,
supreme commander of the Thai armed forces, has urged Prime
Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh to accept the draft constitution,
which is due to be voted on September 27.
</P>
<P>
Mongkol said that there was no other alternative but to support
the draft, which is seen by many as a major step for political
reform to eradicate corruption in politics, the Bangkok Post today
quoted a close source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mongkol said the prime minister and his coalition government
should back the draft or else some parties might try to take
advantage of the situation because they have already mobilized
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister announced early this month that his
government would vote for the draft although it contains
controversial clauses, and will seek amendment after its passage.
</P>
<P>
But it has been speculated that Chavalit has the house
dissolution as his trump card to ensure unified support for him in
a no-confidence debate scheduled for September 24-25.

<HEADLINE> China Using Psychology To Help Cancer Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Psychological help for
Chinese cancer patients has been developed by the Heilongjiang
Cancer Hospital in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
Patients who have benefited from the treatment have expressed
their gratitude. In the words of Zhang Yankun, one of the
patients, "The family-like atmosphere here helps me escape my
loneliness and fear."
</P>
<P>
Unlike the dormitory-like wards in most Chinese hospitals, the
Heilongjiang Cancer Hospital allows patients to live in groups or
in single rooms where they can cook, wash up, or hold
parties. Family members can visit them in special rooms or live
with them. And there are even patients who live at home but go to
the hospital for regular visits.
</P>
<P>
"Patients often become despondent after they're taken to
hospital and separated from their family members," says the
hospital's Dr. Chen Guangmao, "We try to make the patients feel at
home by giving them a family-like atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Open-air dances are held in the hospital garden, and patients
watch videos or listen to music in the hospital movie room, giving
them access to forms of entertainment enjoyed by ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
A "Cancer-Defiers Club" has also been established by patients
and doctors, where patients can learn of the latest developments
in treating cancer and can discuss their own experience. This
encourages patients to co-operate more in the treatment process
and helps speed up recovery a great deal.
</P>
<P>
One young man, for example, who was suffering from liver cancer
cried a lot after entering the hospital, but a group of cancer
survivors visited him and described their experience in dealing
with cancer. The young man survived in his struggle with cancer
and joined the group.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese doctors used to fight cancer with just an operation
and medication, and psychological therapy was neglected and
patients often died an early death in loneliness and desperation,"
Dr Chen commented, noting that hospital records show that patients
here live longer than was originally expected.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Hike Waste Disposal Quotient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital plans to
increase the disposal rate of the city's garbage to 60 percent by
the turn of the century, from some 40 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
As an important step to reach the goal, Beijing is to introduce
rubbish sorting in some public places and more institutions and
enterprises, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The city that produces about 13,000 tons of rubbish daily began
sorting rubbish last year into different categories so that glass,
plastics, metal, paper and others can be recycled.
</P>
<P>
However, local residents throw all kinds of garbage, of which
at least 30 to 40 percent can be recycled, in one place, making
recycling hard, the report said.
</P>
<P>
If all the rubbish that can be recycled is collected
separately, the city's rubbish can be reduced by more than 30
percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Environment Protection Bureau has asked producers
of plastic food container to recycle the discarded containers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city has decided to build more dumps with
furnaces for burning garbage in suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
For example, three furnaces which are being built in Changping
County are expected to burn 500 tons of rubbish each day, the
daily amount of garbage produced by Changping and its surrounding
areas.

<HEADLINE> Second Day of Balloting in Bosnia Elections Going Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Balloting in Bosnia's first
post-war municipal elections has entered its second day without
major serious incidents, a spokesman for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said in Sarajevo today.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations opened in all municipalities, except Zepce
this morning, Spokesman David Foley said.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE initially estimated that the turnout of voters was
almost 50 percent Saturday, and OSCE officials described this as a
great success regarding the fact that the voting will last for two
days.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that only one incident took place in Mostar
overnight when a group of drunk young Croats attacked two
policemen. One of them is a Croat and the other a Muslim.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the incident was only indirectly
linked with the elections, as the attacked policemen guarded a
building where OSCE supervisors were controlling ballot boxes.
</P>
<P>
Foley said measures were also taken in the western town of
Drvar to enable the completion of the entire electoral procedure
where local electoral commissions slowed down the balloting.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that 89 percent of registered voters decided
to elect authorities of municipalities where they had lived before
the war. Such a decision has been made by 96 percent of eligible
voters in the Croat-Muslim Federation and by 80 percent of voters
in the Bosnian Serb entity.

<HEADLINE> Real Shangri-la Is in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A team of Chinese experts
have concluded that Shangri-la, a mysterious and beautiful mecca,
is virtually located in the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture
in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Shangri-la, as described in British writer James Hilton's
classic novel "Lost Horizon" in the 1930s, was the site of forced
landing by an aircraft carrying several missionaries from
India. The missionaries found Shangri-la to be a peaceful, quiet,
and beautiful land in which human beings lived in harmony with
nature.
</P>
<P>
Shangri-la gained increasingly great fame as a result of the
best-selling book and an ensuing Hollywood movie based on the
novel. Nonetheless, the true location of Shangri-la remained a
subject of controversy throughout this century.
</P>
<P>
A team of Chinese experts, after the 6-month in-depth
investigations and studies into related materials, reached the
conclusion that "Shangri-La is, in fact, located in Diqing."
</P>
<P>
While Shangri-La is simply an English word translated from
another language, the true word Shangri-la can only be found in
Tibetan Diqing dialect meaning "an ideal place in the
imagination".
</P>
<P>
Diqing is well-known for its pyramidal snow-covered mountain
ridges and peaks, steep valleys, luxuriant grasslands, and
majestic temples, which, together with other attractive human and
natural environment, are the same as described in the book.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan provincial government recently announced a 10-year
program of building Diqing into a major tourism venue.

BEIJING, September 15 (Xinhua) -- China Xinjiang Airlines,
based in Urumqi, capital of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, has accepted delivery of an ATR 72-210A
aircraft produced by Aero International.
</P>
<P>
The 72-seat aircraft offers a larger capacity to cope with
typical passenger loads in China, with passenger/mile costs much
lower than for other aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang airline has announced that it will introduce an
additional four aircraft of the same type over the next year.
</P>
<P>
The new aircraft will be used for flights from Urumqi to some
domestic tourism cities throughout China, as well an a number of
cities within the region.
</P>
<P>
The China Xinjiang Airlines order represents a major
breakthrough in Aero Intl's entry into the Chinese market,
according to a company official.
</P>
<P>
The company anticipates that the potential Chinese market for
ATR 72 aircraft will reach 100 units over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
China is recognized as having one of the world's most rapidly
growing economies and will thus have a greater future need for
more aircraft to meet the demand of both business and leisure
travelers.

<HEADLINE> Dinosaur Fossils Unearthed in Hubei Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese paleontologists
have announced the discovery of rare dinosaur fossils dating
back some 90 million years in central China's Hubei province.
</P>
<P>
The fossils represent three dinosaurs from the "Bird-Foot
Family", according to paleontologists from the Institute of
Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences. The body of the largest dinosaur measures
some six meters in length and the smallest some two meters.
</P>
<P>
These fossils were unearthed on July 25 by farmers
constructing water conservancy facilities in a village in Yun
County. Local residents reported the find to officials and
scientists who later concluded the discovery of fossilized
skeletons of three dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
The find will greatly benefit studies of the geography and
climate in the mid-Cretaceous Period, according to
scientists. They also noted that the discovery will provide
valuable clues to the extinction of the giant creatures some 65
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
Paleontologists pointed out that the fossils indicated that the
dinosaurs suffered from various diseases which might have lead
to their death.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists perviously unearthed the teeth of primitive man
and fossilized dinosaur eggs in the same region.

CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Brazil beat Argentina 2-1 on
Sunday to secure the first semi-final berth of the Under-17 Soccer
World Championship before goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller palmed off
four penalty kicks to see Germany survive.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, runner-up at the 1995 U-17 World Championship,
unleashed enoumous attacks against the strong Argentine defense in
the first quarter-final match between the group C winner and group
D's runner-up in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The first half was on the way to be ended goalless until Fabio
Pinto scored in the 45th minutue. Pinto swung in the header from
the rim of the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's second goal came seven minutes before time, and it was
again from Pinto who scored his right kick with speed and force.
</P>
<P>
In another quarter-final match in Cairo, German goalie did
credit to his team with great saves in the penalty shoot-out, and
turned the game into a hilarious win of 4-3.
</P>
<P>
Both Germany and Mali had been intent on putting up a strong
defense since the kickoff. In the second half, the Malis gradually
dominated the court but they missed the chances.
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute property and 30-minute extra time ended in a
goaless draw. In the penalties, Weidenfeller, in a perfect show of
confidence and skill, pushed out four penalty kicks, while his

<HEADLINE> Dutch Take European Volleyball Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- They spiked harder, passed
smarter and blocked tighter when the Dutch added the European
volleyball championship to their Olympic title on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yet the championship hosts encountered real resistance from
opposite the net for the first time in the seven matches they
played at Eindhoven en route to winning the continental honor.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia at one time gave the Dutch side some tentalizing
headaches with solid blocks and smart passes. The Dutch spikers
finally proved their one-upmanship in the end with a 15-11, 10-15,
15-10, 15-9 victory.
</P>
<P>
Dutch playmaker Peter Blange and blocker Reinder Nommudor
turned out to be the heroes of the match. They often doubled up
their key roles by blocking up the net and digging to save at rear
court to unleash their versatility.
</P>
<P>
Blange and Nommudor paired off to successfully block several of
the Yugoslav killer smashes in the third set to curb the
counterattack from across the net.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 0-2 into the fourth set, Nommudor shot five cunning
serves in a row to disturb the playing rhythm of the Yugoslav
spikers before the score was reversed to 5-2 in favor of the Dutch
team.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's semi-finals, the Netherlands blanked world league
titlists Italy 15-9, 15-6, 15-13 while Yugoslavia whitewashed

<HEADLINE> Missing German, US Army Planes Might Have Collided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A German army passenger plane
which has been missing since late Saturday off Angola's western
coast might have collided in mid-air with a U.S. military
transport aircraft, a German Defense Ministry spokesman said late
this evening.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of a collision is relatively great, but it has
not yet been confirmed," said the spokesman in an interview with
the German news network N-TV.
</P>
<P>
The German plane, a Soviet-made Tupolev 154 with 24 people on
board, was en route from Cologne, Germany, to Cape Town in South
Africa for ceremonies marking the 75th anniversary of the South
African navy.
</P>
<P>
The last radio signal received from the plane was registered
late Saturday when it was about 1,500 kilometers west of Angola.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a U.S. Air Force C-141B Starlifter transport plane
had also disappeared at about the same time and the same location
on a flight from Namibia to Ascension Island in the South
Atlantic, said South African and German air force officials.
</P>
<P>
The Starlifter, with nine people on board, took off from the
Namibian capital of Windhoek and left Namibian airspace at about
5:20 p.m. local time, said the South African air and sea rescue
service. The German plane was due to make a stopover in Windhoek
at 6:30 p.m. the same day.
</P>
<P>
The German news agency DPA quoted military sources as saying
that they had been told that U.S. espionage satellites detected a
flash in the area in question that might point to a collision.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Defense later confirmed the
disappearance of the U.S. plane but said that it was still
premature to assume that it had collided with the German plane.
</P>
<P>
Rescue units from the United States, Germany, France and South
Africa have started a massive search for the whereabouts of the
two planes.

</P>
<P>
The next telecom event will be Africa Telecom 98 to be hosted

members, telecom events will increase frequency from the year
2000. For the first time, in 2000, there will be two regional
telecom events, Americas Telecom 2000 and Asia Telecom 2000. In
the year 2001, there will be Africa Telecom 2001 and Telecom
