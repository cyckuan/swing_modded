<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti FM Hails Arab Foreign Ministers Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Foreign Minister
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah Tuesday hailed the Cairo Arab
foreign ministers meeting held on Sunday as being "positive."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Kuwait's official Kuna news agency upon his return
from Cairo, Sabah, also Kuwait's first deputy prime minister,
said the meeting mirrored the Arab wish "to examine and discuss
the Arab position over current developments witnessed by the Arab
nations."
</P>
<P>
"At the meeting, intensive deliberations took place to make
our joint action and to shift from the present debilitated
situation to a stage that meets the ambitions of our Arab peoples
in view of setting the proper requirements of an Arab solidarity
based on clear and sound grounds," Sabah said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, he said, focused on the "sufferings of the Iraqi
people, caused by the Iraqi government's policies and practices."
</P>
<P>
Sabah said that the Arab nations seeked to work out a
mechanism of coordination with the United Nations Security Council
members to alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people while
ensuring full Iraqi implementations of U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the final statement of the meeting, Sabah said it
came to reiterate keenness on the safety and sovereignty of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged Iraq to "take necessary steps to prove its
peaceful intentions towards Kuwait and other neighbors by
admitting that its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 was a mistake."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf stormed out of
the Cairo meeting in protest of the statement.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. fighter jets on Tuesday fired missiles at
three targets in northern Iraq for the fourth consecutive day,
the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col Steve Campbell said the three
incidents occurred between 1:25 p.m. and 1:50 p.m. Iraqi time
(1025 and 1050 GMT) near the city of Musul in the northern no-fly
zone.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said the U.S. warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone
fired missiles after being targeted by Iraqi surface-to-air
missiles and anti-aircraft artillery systems.
</P>
<P>
The pilots all returned safely to their base at Incirlik in
Turkey after patrolling mission. And damage to Iraqi forces was
being assessed.
</P>
<P>
There were two Iraqi MiG planes that had entered the southern
no-fly zone on Tuesday, but no clashes happened as U.S. and
British planes were not patrolling the area at the time,
according to the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, which
oversees operations in the Gulf. (US-Iraq-Attack)

<HEADLINE> (Urgent) Pope Leaves Mexico for U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Pope John Paul II left here
for St. Louis, Missouri of the United States, Tuesday after a
five-day visit to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
He was seen off by Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo at an
official ceremony at the Benito Juares International Airport.
</P>
<P>
During his fourth visit to the Latin American country, the
78-year-old Pope signed a major document setting out the Catholic
church's goals for the new millennium and the actions to be taken.
</P>
<P>
The document, made known by the Pope at masses Saturday and
Sunday touches upon human rights, indigenous peoples,
globalization, foreign debt, corruption, drug trafficking and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Pope urged more than 110.000 people packed into
a soccer stadium to use their faith to fight violence, drug
trafficking and other ills of society in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
"In the new era dawning, an era of computers and the powerful
means of communication opening into an ever more fluid
globalization of economic and social relations," the pontiff urged
today's youth to guard against the danger of a soul-less world.
</P>
<P>
In his closing prayer Monday night, the Pope expressed sorrow
for victims of an earthquake in Colombia that killed more than 500
people.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the Vatican condemned the latest U.S. bombing
raids on Iraq, saying that the Pope believes that "military
measures don't resolve problems in themselves, rather they
aggravate them," just a day before the Pope was to meet U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Before the current visit, the Pope had visited Mexico in 1979,
1990 and 1993.

<HEADLINE> European Sprint Champion to Fight Drugs Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- UK Athletics confirmed on
Tuesday that Scottish sprinter Doug Walker has failed a drugs
test.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC report today, UK Athletics revealed his
identity following a report in the Glasgow Herald in which Europ
ean 200 meters champion Walker vowed to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
The sports body spokeswoman Jayne Pearce told the BBC that no
further details would be released about the case pending a full
investigation by a special committee, which is being set up.
</P>
<P>
The Glasgow Herald quoted Walker as saying: "I have never
taken any banned substance in my life. I have never used steroids
and I will be contesting the findings."
</P>
<P>
The story has overshadowed Tuesday's official launch of UK
Athletics, the new body in charge of track and field in Britain.
</P>
<P>
UK Athletics confirmed on Monday that two urine samples from
a"senior competitor at international level" had shown traces of a
banned substance.
</P>
<P>
Walker was subsequently identified in the Glasgow Herald but
told the newspaper: "There is no chance of my ever using drugs. I
have taken another substance, which is not on the banned list,
and which is regularly used by many athletes. I have been told it
could give the same reading.
</P>
<P>
"I am innocent and expect to be exonerated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dave Gibson, Walker's coach for the last nine years, insisted
there is a scientific explanation.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I fully expect him to be exonerated in the next
couple of weeks. We have hired a top lawyer and the best medical
advice.
</P>
<P>
"If Dougie had used drugs, I am not saying he would break the
world record, but he would run well inside 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"I still hope to see him do that, just as he has achieved
everything else in his career-and that is legally," he added.
</P>
<P>
Walker's legal advisor, Nick Bitel, also insisted that the
athlete had never taken an illegal performance-enhancing
substance.
</P>
<P>
He issued a statement which read: "Douglas continues to train
extremely hard for the 1999 track season and he is confident that
this false allegation will soon be behind him.
</P>
<P>
"The product which has been found can be produced from any
number of sources and is also naturally occurring in people's
bodies.
</P>
<P>
The statement added: "We know that something he has taken
could have been contaminated but he has not knowingly taken any
substance that gives this result, and he most certainly has not
taken a steroid."
</P>
<P>
Former world 10,000 meters champion Liz McColgan has urged
athletics chiefs to introduce blood testing in a bid to "weed
out"the cheats.
</P>
<P>
"If it was me and I was ever accused of drug abuse, I would
voluntarily provide a blood sample which enables a definitive
test to be made," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish Athletics Federation has vowed to support Walker
following discussions with his coach.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive David Joy said: "He is an international class
athlete, who has been a fine ambassador for the sport in Scotland
over the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking to grow here and expand athletics, and
naturally Dougie is a very important part of our future plans."
</P>
<P>
Walker first came to prominence in 1997 when he won the UK
200m title and was part of the bronze medal-winning 4x100m relay
squad at the World Championships in Athens and reached the
semi-finals of the individual 200m.
</P>
<P>
Last year he again won the UK title and broke the European
record in the rarely-run 300 meters with a time of 31.56 seconds.
</P>
<P>
But his main achievements came in Budapest where he won the
European 200m final and claimed a second gold in the sprint
relay.

<HEADLINE> Berger Says NATO Reduces Force in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Tuesday that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will
reduce its peacekeeping force in Bosnia by 10 percent over the
next two months as the region progresses to a more stable peace.
</P>
<P>
After a review of force requirements in Bosnia, NATO officials
have decided to shrink the 32,000-strong multinational force that
was deployed after the Dayton accords were reached in 1995, said
Sandy Berger, President Bill Clinton's national security advisor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here, Berger gave no figures except to
say the U.S. contribution to peacekeeping there would be cut from
the present 6,900 to 6,200 by March. The United States is one of
25 countries with troops serving as peacekeepers in Bosnia
</P>
<P>
"This is a good development, a reflection of the fact that
we're steadily making progress in Bosnia," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
He cited continuing "serious challenges" for the civilian
organizations that are trying to establish a stable political
system and rebuild war-torn Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Berger said NATO defense ministers would make a further review
of troop requirements in Bosnia this spring.
</P>
<P>
On the related subject of instability in nearby Kosovo, Berger
said Clinton remains opposed to sending U.S. ground troops there
to intervene in the conflict between Serb security forces and
rebellious ethnic Albanian forces.
</P>
<P>
He held open the possibility, however, that Clinton might
approve including American troops in a peacekeeping force in
Kosovo, assuming there is a political settlement first.

<HEADLINE> UK Ford Plant to Shut for Three Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Ford Motor Co's British unit
confirmed Tuesday a three-week shutdown and an extension of
short-time working because of a drop in exports.
</P>
<P>
"Due to a reduction in vehicle demand in European and some
export markets, Ford today announced that Dagenham would not be
producing vehicles on 25 full days between February 1 and April
30," the group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The decision will lead to lost production of 40,000 vehicles.
The company said that during the extended Easter shutdown,
investment actions previously planned for the summer shutdown will
be brought forward.
</P>
<P>
Ford said the cutback will involve 3,500 workers, who will
continue to be paid despite the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Doug Collins, chief Ford negotiator for the Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union, said, "This is clearly a serious
development."
</P>
<P>
"We will be discussing with the company a long term solution to
this problem. We cannot continue with a piecemeal approach," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Russia-China Cooperation Good to World Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said here Tuesday that active cooperation between Russia
and China is conducive to world stability.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the second session of the Sino-Russian Committee for
Friendship, Peace and Development, Primakov said both countries
are proponents of a multipolar world and against hegemonism,
diktat and use of force in international relations.
</P>
<P>
"The world is too varied for trying to squeeze it into a
structure under the management of some top authority," Primakov
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a result of common efforts, the two sides have
removed a series of obstacles such as border issues and cut their
military presence along their borders, bringing bilateral ties to
a new high at the end of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Primakov expressed the belief that Russia and China will keep
their partnership in the next century.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia stands ready to provide the most advanced
technologies to China under world prices. He noted the bright
prospects in major oil and natural gas pipeline projects.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said Russia hopes to change the situation whereby
bilateral economic relations lag behind political ties.
</P>
<P>
China is also dissatisfied with the current status of bilateral
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Deguang told Xinhua Monday
that last year's bilateral trade volume was only 5 billion U.S.
dollars, which did not "match the potential which exists for
cooperation between the large neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Russian Committee for Friendship, Peace and
Development was established in 1997 during the summit between
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.

<TEXT>
<P>
Zambian Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry David Mpamba,
Chinese ambassador to Zambia, Wang Yunxiang, and president of the
board of directors for the centre, Jiang mingkai, were present at
the foundation- laying ceremony.
</P>
<P>
At a reception for the begining of the construction of the
centre, Mpamba said that the construction of the centre signifies
strong cooperation between Zambia and China.
</P>
<P>
Once the centre is established, "we expect a number of
objectives to be realized," he said.
</P>
<P>
The objectives will include exposing and promoting Chinese
goods and services to the Zambian people and Zambian goods and
services in the Chinese Market, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the centre stands to promote the economic and trade
relations between the two sides and present new opportunities for
the two countries to benefit from the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba noted that "although Zambia and China are both
developing countries, the two can learn and benefit a lot from
each other's experiences."
</P>
<P>
Zambia's high potential in the agriculture, mining, tourism,
transport and manufacturing sectors presents great opportunities
for building new partnership between two countries, Mpamba said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Wang said, "The centre will not only provide
business information about China, help to find potential Chinese
investor in Zambia, but also promote two-way trade transactions
and flow of goods. In one word, it will be just like a bridge
between Chinese and Zambian business circles."
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the centre, a new chapter in
Sino-Zambian economic cooperation will be opened, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
To promote Sino-African economic and trade relations, China has
and will set up 11 investment centres in the continent, some of
which have been operational and some are still under construction.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu's Mentor Appointed Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu appointed his political patron Moshe Arens as defense
minister Tuesday, one day after he defeated Arens in a vote to
lead the right-wing Likud into the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement at a news conference held hours after
official results of the Likud primaries showed that Netanyahu was
overwhelmingly reelected the party's candidate for prime minister
in the May elections.
</P>
<P>
Arens, 73, was offered the post soon after Netanyahu fired
Yitzhak Mordechai over the weekend, for what he alleged
"disloyalty" to the Likud. Arens preferred to wait until the
results of the Likud primaries were released.
</P>
<P>
A professor of aeronautical engineering, Arens had served as
defense minister twice in previous Israeli governments.
</P>
<P>
He first replaced Ariel Sharon, now the foreign minister, in
the early 1980s after Sharon was forced to resign after an
investigation founded he was indirectly responsible for the
slaughter in two refugee camps in Lebanon during an Israeli
invasion war.
</P>
<P>
He was a strong proponent of defense industries during the
first term and left his post after the Lavi fighter jet was
scrapped due to the high cost.
</P>
<P>
The second time he took up the defense portfolio was between
1990 and 1992, when the country was in the midst of the
Palestinian uprising, or intifada.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991 Gulf War, he was prepared to punish Iraq for
its Scud attacks against Israel, but was overruled by then Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
</P>
<P>
Working in Washington in the mid-1980s as Israeli ambassador,
he launched the political career of Netanyahu by appointing him his
aide.
</P>
<P>
A strong supporter of Jewish settlement in the West Bank, Arens
opposed peace deals with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He blamed Netanyahu for Likud's disarray and challenged him for
the party's leadership, but vowed to support him if the prime
minister won the primaries.

<HEADLINE> 0126110fff Congolese Refugees Pouring into Red Cross Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- As the number of refugees from
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) increases, thousands of
Congolese are moving into the Lugufu camp, a Red Cross refugee
camp in western Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The camp could be filled to its 40,000 capacity within a month
at the present rate, said a media release from the Nairobi
regional office of the International Federation of Red Cross
available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
For the majority of the refugees, who are predominantly from
the DRC's Fizi region, it is a second stay in the Lugufu camp,
which opened in February 1997 to shelter those who had fled
previous conflict. When peace returned most were repatriated but
now many have sought safety in Tanzania again, according to the
Red Cross office at Nairobi .
</P>
<P>
Thousands more are waiting to come, and large numbers are said
to be hiding in the Congolese bush, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Those refugees in Lugufu are given routine medical screening,
because there is a threat of cholera in the border area between
DRC and Tanzania. A handful of cases have been detected among the
refugees arriving at Kigoma. No cases have yet been found in
Lugufu but a fully-equipped Red Cross cholera clinic has been
established in the camp.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Appalling results of road
accidents in the 15 member states of the European Union (EU) are
driving car makers to change their safety design for higher
standards with a help by the European New Car Assessment Program
(EuroNCAP).
</P>
<P>
European commissioner for transport policy Neil Kinnock made
the statement here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There are on average 123 deaths a day on the roads of the
European Union, that is 45,000 lives needlessly lost every year,
and the EuroNCAP crash test program is an important component in
the fight to cut that carnage," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to create a market for road safety and ensure that
the public has a reliable guide to the safety performance of the
cars sold most widely in the European Union," Kinnock said at a
press conference for launch of the EuroNCAP, which is backed by
the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, along with the
Dutch, Swedish and British governments and motoring and consumer
organizations across Europe.
</P>
<P>
When releasing results of the latest phase of crash testing
covering the best-selling small family cars, the commissioner said
the EuroNCAP ratings are fast becoming an industry standard, with
"Renault, for example, having made extra airbags standard on every
model."
</P>
<P>
"These tests also show that although cars are being designed to
offer far greater protection for their occupants, pedestrian
protection still leaves much to be desired," Kinnock said.
</P>
<P>
The EuroNCAP tests simulate the crashes that most commonly
result in serious and fatal injuries. A rating system that awards
one to four stars indicates the relative crashwhorthiness and
pedestrian friendliness of each car.
</P>
<P>
Among the EuroNCAP tested cars, Ford Focus, Mercedes A Class,
Opel Astra and Renault Megane scored the maximum four-star rating
in terms of the protection that they offer in accidents involving
front and side impact.
</P>
<P>
Kinnock also said that while legislation gives a minimum
standard, several manufacturers have long been designing cars that
far exceeded the legal minimum. "EuroNCAP shows that and at the
same time it provides increasingly better information to the
general public."
</P>
<P>
"Through our participation in NCAP, the European Commission is
trying to help to create a market for road safty by enabling car
buyers and users to know which cars offer the best standards of
collision protection," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Saudi Arabia to Promote Media Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Information
Minister Mushahid Hussain held talks here Tuesday with his Saudi
Arabian counterpart Faud Al Salman Al Farsi on ways to promote
media cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers discussed matters relating to the
strengthening of cooperation between news organizations of the two
countries, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Mushahid said it is important for Muslim countries to cooperate
and coordinate on media issues for enhancing the image of Islam
and protection of the interests of the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi information minister, who arrived here Tuesday for a
visit, assured Mushahid of his country's full cooperation in
realizing the objective.
</P>
<P>
They also called for exchanges of media delegations and
journalists between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They agreed in principle to sign a media cooperation agreement
which would govern future media cooperation between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Africa Told to Rely on Domestic Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This means promoting higher domestic savings for sustained
investment," said the newsletter released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, some African capital invested abroad estimated at
around 100 million U.S. Dollars may be attracted back and African
emigrants could be tempted to invest their savings in Africa," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The newsletter said since Africa offered high returns,
long-term capital flows to the continent could be stimulated for
portfolio investment in emerging stock markets and venture
capital.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, some progress has been made in starting new venture
funds for Africa," it said.
</P>
<P>
African industry, it said, must become more competitive to
supply the global market by improving indigenous competitiveness
and technology.
</P>
<P>
This could be promoted with Afro-Asian industrial cooperation
in different areas such as importing cheaper and more appropriate
capital equipment for resource-based industries, promoting
partnerships between African and Asian enterprises and importing
appropriate technology from Asia, it noted.
</P>
<P>
"The competitiveness of Africa's manufacturing sector also
needs to be enhanced. Goods from Africa would need to compete
effectively with similar goods from Asia in the domestic markets,"
 said the newsletter.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has authorized spending up to 25 million U.S. dollars to aid
refugees from the conflict in Kosovo, the White House said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The president has authorized up to 25 million U.S. dollars to
be made available from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration
Fund to meet the urgent and unexpected needs of refugees and
migrants," National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
"These funds will be provided as contributions to international
nongovernmental organizations who are working in Kosovo to ease
the humanitarian crisis due to the fighting," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The president remains engaged in our efforts to bring about a
political settlement in Kosovo that would give the Kosovars a high
degree of autonomy," Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
"We are working on a number of fronts... to try to bring about
a political settlement to this long-simmering conflict," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States made 20 million U.S. dollars from the
assistance fund available last autumn, when the fighting in Kosovo
displaced about 250,000 ethnic Albanians from their homes and left
many shivering in the mountains.

<HEADLINE> fff0126134  S. African Electoral Chief Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Tuesday confirmed that Johann Kriegler is quitting
his post as chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission
(IEC).
</P>
<P>
Mandela told a new conference in Johannesburg that he had
accepted Kriegler's resignation with great regret.
</P>
<P>
Kriegler is also resigning as a commissioner of the IEC. The
resignation would take effect on February 1.
</P>
<P>
The all-important IEC is an independent body to run the
upcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
Mandela thanked Kriegler for his service in the "challenging
post at a critical time for South African democracy."
</P>
<P>
He said he had consulted Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Home
Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi and that both men agreed
with his decision. Mandela also kept political parties informed.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that Kriegler's deputy, Brigalia Bam, would serve
as acting chairperson of the IEC while the process for finding a
new chief was under way.
</P>
<P>
"Government reiterates its commitment to the independence of
the IEC," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the resignation could be considered a crisis,
Mandela said: "I don't think so. I have spoken to all political
leaders and they agree with my view that we must not make this a
political issue, but look at it from the interests of the whole
country.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Kriegler had resigned over a lack of funding and the
controversial requirement for bar-coded IDs for voters, he said in
any situation there would be a difference of opinion on some
fundamental issues.
</P>
<P>
"But these are not the reasons which were given to me when I
saw Judge Kriegler at 11 (o'clock) this morning."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the IEC would be releasing a statement spelling
our Kriegler's reasons for quitting.
</P>
<P>
Kriegler had warned that it would be impossible to conduct the
election on the IEC's 550-million-Rand (92-million-dollar) budget.
</P>
<P>
He also warned of the "ominous specter" of tens of thousands of
black youths arriving at voting stations on election day, but
having to be turned away as a result of government's insistence on
bar-coded IDs as a condition for voting.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Gives Military Green Light to Respond Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton has
agreed to the U.S. military request to go ahead with responding
more aggressively to Iraq's challenges to U.S. and British
aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones in both northern and southern
Iraq, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are acting here in self-defense and in response to
concerted attacks by Saddam Hussein," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton had approved U.S. military commanders' request
for "more expansive rules of engagement" to attack Iraqi air
defenses.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said they now considered the entire Iraqi
air defense network to be a legitimate target for U.S. attacks.
</P>
<P>
"Since Saddam has more systematically challenged our
enforcement of the no-fly zone, our pilots understand and our Air
Force understands that if there are violations of the no-fly
zone... our response as appropriate will be against any of the air
defense systems that we think make us vulnerable," Berger said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, U.S. warplanes attacked five targets in the
northern no-fly zone in Iraq after being targeted by Iraqi forces,
the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Steve Campbell said two F-15E fighter jets dropped
precision-guided bombs and launched an AGM-130 missile at Iraqi
air-defense sites after being targeted by Iraqi anti-aircraft
artillery systems near Mosul in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
And a Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler, an electronic warfare plane,
fired a high-speed anti-radiation missile at another Iraqi target.
</P>
<P>
The above three incidents took place between 1:15 p.m. and 1:50
p.m. Iraqi time (1025 and 1050 GMT).
</P>
<P>
After that at about 3 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Iraqi time (1200 to
1230 GMT), the other incidents happened involving U.S. aircraft's
engagement with Iraqi air defense systems in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, Saddam Hussein urged Iraqis to be patient in the
battle against the United States, saying in a speech carried by
the Iraqi News Agency, "Your blood will not go in vain."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, an errant U.S. missile dropped a residential area
near the southern city of Basra, killing 11 people and injuring
dozens, according to reports.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers in Harare Stage Demonstration for New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A group of lawyers in Harare
staged a peaceful demonstration ahead of parliament of Zimbabwe's
1999 first session on Tuesday afternoon, demanding that the
drafting a new constitution be speeded up by the 150-member
legislative house.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrating lawyers who included those in private
practice were, however, driven away from parliament building by
riot police just before parliament resumed sitting, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A law lecturer from the University of Zimbabwe told the local
news agency that the issue of drafting a new constitution had been
on the cards for a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
The lecturer who refused to provide name said there was no
indication from the government that the new constitution would be
ready before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The new constitution should include the contributions from
every Zimbabwean, not the interests of our politicians alone
because that gives them the power to do what ever they want in the
running of the country without being questioned," he said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of a new Zimbabwean constitution to replace the
British-brewed Lancaster House constitution took center-stage last
year when some legislators insisted that the current constitution
did not represent the interests of all zimbabweans.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Chinese Investment Promotion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zambian Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry David Mpamba,
Chinese ambassador to Zambia, Wang Yunxiang, and president of the
board of directors for the centre, Jiang mingkai, were present at
the foundation- laying ceremony.
</P>
<P>
At a reception for the begining of the construction of the
centre, Mpamba said that the construction of the centre signifies
strong cooperation between Zambia and China.
</P>
<P>
Once the centre is established, "we expect a number of
objectives to be realized," he said.
</P>
<P>
The objectives will include exposing and promoting Chinese
goods and services to the Zambian people and Zambian goods and
services in the Chinese Market, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the centre stands to promote the economic and trade
relations between the two sides and present new opportunities for
the two countries to benefit from the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba noted that "although Zambia and China are both
developing countries, the two can learn and benefit a lot from
each other's experiences."
</P>
<P>
Zambia's high potential in the agriculture, mining, tourism,
transport and manufacturing sectors presents great opportunities
for building new partnership between two countries, Mpamba said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador Wang said, "The centre will not only provide
business information about China, help to find potential Chinese
investor in Zambia, but also promote two-way trade transactions
and flow of goods. In one word, it will be just like a bridge
between Chinese and Zambian business circles."
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of the centre, a new chapter in
Sino-Zambian economic cooperation will be opened, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
To promote Sino-African economic and trade relations, China has
and will set up 11 investment centres in the continent, some of
which have been operational and some are still under construction.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Eradicating Polio, Model for Int'l Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Recent worldwide
progress toward wiping out polio is the latest indication that
significant improvements in global health are possible when
governments, institutions and individuals work together to address
common concerns at the national and international levels.
</P>
<P>
But with polio eradication near, the U.N. World Health
Organization (WHO) and its partners in this global effort are
increasingly worried that support for the project many wane before
the final hurdles are overcome.
</P>
<P>
The near-eradication of polio puts the United Nations on the
brink of its greatest health improvement since it led the push to
eradicate smallpox in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary unpublished data obtained from the WHO indicate
that the number of new polio cases reported worldwide dropped to
just over 3,200 in 1998 -- the lowest case-count on record.
Reported polio cases have declined by 90 percent in the past
decade, since the WHO launched its 1988 global vaccination
campaign to eradicate polio virus by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
For much of this century, and particularly prior to the
discovery of the polio vaccine in the 1950s, poliomyelitis was one
of the most deadly and crippling diseases of our time.
</P>
<P>
Still today, from about 10 million to some 20 million people
worldwide, including many children in the developing world, remain
paralyzed from the virus, unable to walk without the help of leg
braces or breathe without devices such as the "iron lung."
</P>
<P>
The actual number of polio cases worldwide, thought to be about
10 times the figure reported, is now estimated at only about
35,000.
</P>
<P>
The steady disappearance of polio is the result of social and
political commitment by national governments and the international
community. By late 1998, 118 countries had conducted at least one
round of National Immunization Days (NIDs), during which all
children under five were administered two doses of Oral Polio
Vaccine (OPV) one month apart, compared with only 21 countries a
decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 450 million children, about two-thirds of the world's
under-five population, were immunized during large campaigns in 80
countries.
</P>
<P>
Polio is one of few diseases that can be wiped out because the
virus is transmitted only through person-to-person contact and
cannot persist in the environment for long periods of time without
a human host. The only other disease that has ever been eradicated
is smallpox, which was wiped out in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The eradication of polio is also possible because the oral
vaccine against the disease is highly effective and cheap (about
one U.S. dollar per dose, or three U.S. dollars per child), and
usually provides lifelong immunity to the virus.
</P>
<P>
Widespread use of this vaccine has eliminated polio from vast
regions of the world where it was once pervasive. Ten years ago,
polio virus circulated freely on all continents except Australia,
but in 1988 a record 188 countries reported zero polio cases,
double the number of a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
The only WHO region with official "polio-free" status is the
Americas, where the last cases of polio was recorded in Peru in
1991. The Western Pacific, Eastern and Western Europe, and parts
of Northern and Southern Africa are also now considered polio-free
following eradication efforts, but will not receive official
certification until they have met the WHO requirement of reporting
three consecutive years of zero polio cases.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Eradicating Polio, Model for Int'l Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the overall decline worldwide, 27 countries were still
reporting polio transmission as of late 1998. The principal
remaining reservoirs of the disease are South Asia, particularly
India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and Western and Central Africa,
particularly Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo, WHO
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The virus also persists in Turkey and in Kurdish-occupied areas
of Iraq, where international health workers have had difficulty
obtaining government cooperation and permission to reach and
vaccinate children.
</P>
<P>
Among the greatest obstacles to eradication are the lack of
basic health infrastructure for vaccine distribution and the
crippling effects of civil war. In polio endemic countries, such
as Angola, Somalia and Sierra Leone, internal conflicts have meant
the suspension of immunization programs, severance of vaccine
supply lines, and destruction of health services.
</P>
<P>
For instance, in August 1988, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
a country that four years ago witnessed one of the largest polio
epidemic of the century, was forced to postpone its scheduled
National Immunization Day and later suspend its vaccination
program after health care workers fled hospitals devastated during
the ongoing war.
</P>
<P>
On a more positive note, in some war-torn countries, including
Sudan and Sri Lanka, immunization efforts have actually led to
momentary cease-fires, as combatants laid down their weapons to
allow health workers to reach and vaccinate young children.
</P>
<P>
Another challenge faced by the global polio eradication effort
is to maintain the required temperatures of 2-8 degrees centigrade
in order to keep live vaccines potent in extremely hot or remote
areas. The recent introduction of color-coded, heat-sensitive
"vaccine vital monitors" has made it easier for health care
workers to recognize whether vaccines have suffered excessive heat
exposure.
</P>
<P>
However, the effectiveness of the monitors hinges on awareness
of proper vital distribution and use.
</P>
<P>
As the target year for polio eradication nears, the WHO and its
partners in the global effort, including the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), vaccine manufacturers, and the
governments of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Japan, the
United Kingdom and the United States are increasingly worried that
support for the project may wane before the most difficult hurdles
are overcome, officials said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, funds are still lacking for the initiative's
challenging final phase, door-to-door "mopping-up" campaign to
immunize children in densely populated, high-risk districts.
Although 50 percent to 80 percent of the costs are covered by the
endemic countries themselves, the WHO estimates that an extra 350
million U.S. dollars in additional international support will be
needed before 2001.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, the final case of polio virus outside the
laboratory setting will probably be identified in 2000 or 2001,
and the world will achieve official "polio-free" status at the
earliest by 2005.

Global child immunization will then continue for an additional
five-year period to ensure that the disease has really been wiped
out from all regions.
</P>
<P>
From that point on, countries will begin to realize the
tremendous benefits from no longer having to immunize infants or
to treat or rehabilitate people affected by polio -- saving an
estimated 1.5 billion U.S. dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
Western Europe alone will save about 200 million U.S. dollars
annually, and the United States will save about 230 million U.S.
dollars, twice as much as it will need to spend per year on global
polio eradication in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Tyson to Fight Canada's Ruddock, Not German Schulz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Former world heavyweight champion
Mike Tyson will fight Donovan Ruddock of Canada in Las Vegas on
April 24, German fight promoter Wilfried Sauerland said in Berlin
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
That means that German fighter Axel Schulz's hopes of a crack
at Mike Tyson were dealt a knock out. Schulz was technically
better and quicker, Sauerland said.
</P>
<P>
Schulz was sure he would be stepping into the ring against
Tyson in Las Vegas on April 24. Indeed, the contracts had been
drawn up, said Sauerland.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. pay television channel Showtime, which has the rights
to the Tyson fight, had vetoed Schulz, Germany's Bild newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After Tyson's uninspiring comeback against South African
Francois Botha earlier this month, Showtime was loath to see the
American face another fighter from outside the American continent,
Bild reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A young Palestinian man died
Tuesday afternoon several hours after being hit in the head by
rubber bullets fired by Israeli soldiers in clashes in
northeastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The clashes broke out when the Israeli soldiers tried to
demolish a house in a Palestinian village on the outskirts of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Angry Palestinian villagers, in a futile attempt to prevent
the demolition, threw rocks at the soldiers, who fired rubber
bullets in return. The young man and other two were injured,
Israeli television reported.
</P>
<P>
The man was rushed to a nearby hospital but died from his
wound several hours later.
</P>
<P>
The house, which the Jerusalem municipality said was built
without permits, was finally torn down.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that the death, which took place at a time when
the Palestinians are frustrated over Israel's freezing of the Wye
deal signed last October, might trigger new clashes between the
two sides.

<P>
ATHENS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday hailed the
decision by the European Union (EU) to seek a peaceful solution to
the problem in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, saying that such a
decision was a "balanced and objective approach" to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that it was positive the 15-member states had
realized that such types of problems could be resolved only by
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
It also reflected the positions which the Greek government had
supported for quite some time, he added.
</P>
<P>
Greece has repeatedly said that a political not a military
solution should be sought for the Kosovo problem and the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo should be given a wide autonomy within the
framework of the present Yugoslav borders.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers unanimously agreed in Brussels Monday that
the Kosovo problem should be resolved peacefully through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos stressed in Brussels
Monday that if the military solution was chosen, Greece could not
participate because the Greek Parliament would never approve of
such action without prior ratification being achieved by the U.N.
Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's New Crown Prince Sworn in as Regent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordan`s new crown prince
Abdullah Bin Hussein was sworn in Tuesday as the regent of
kingdom while King Hussein left here again for the United States
for emergency medical checkup.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah assumed duties of the regent hours after he was
named as the crown prince early Tuesday morning when Hussein
sacked his brother Hassan Ibn Talal as heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
In a rare move, Hussein, before leaving for the U.S.,
delegated all powers to Abdullah, except the rights of making
amendments to the constitution and signing major international
accords.
</P>
<P>
The departure of the 63-year-old monarch for the U.S. came as a
surprise to most Jordanians, who expected that Hussein would leave
for the U.S. for routine physical checks in March.
</P>
<P>
Hussein returned home on January 19 after a six-month cancer
treatment in the U.S., and he piloted his own plane during his
flight back from London, where he stayed for about a week for
recuperation.
</P>
<P>
The king has said on several occasions that he had "fully
recovered" from the illness after his six-round chemotherapy for
lymphatic cancer at the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, the U.S..
</P>
<P>
However, analysts in Amman believed that Hussein returned home
just to solve the issue of succession to the throne, which had
been largely a taboo subject in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said he reconsidered the heir to the throne in the best
interests of the nation instead of personal considerations.
</P>
<P>
In a widely anticipated move, Hussein issued a Royal Decree
early Tuesday morning to name Abdudllah as the crown prince, and
simultaneously removed Hassan as his successor.
</P>
<P>
In the decree, Hussein said that conditions that prevented the
primogeniture succession no longer existed.
</P>
<P>
Hussein named Hassan as the crown prince in 1965 when Abdullah,
then heir apparent and the eldest son of Hussein from his second
marriage, was only three years old.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, 37-year-old, is an army major general and in charge
of an elite special force that is responsible for the security of
the Royal Court.
</P>
<P>
Rifts between Hussein and Hassan over succession was
highlighted Tuesday, when major newspapers in Amman published a
letter by Hussein, blaming those unnamed "climbers" around Hassan
of trying to destroy Jordan and politicize the army.
</P>
<P>
"we have differed, and we still do, over the succession,"
Hussein said in the letter addressed to Hassan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Prosecutors Decide on Witnesses in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House prosecutors
decided Tuesday to ask the Senate for permission to call three
witnesses at President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial -- former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky, presidential friend Vernon
Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, a House source
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors, expecting to be limited by the Senate to only
two or three witnesses, decided to leave Oval Office secretary
Betty Currie off the list because they felt her testimony was not
clear enough on the retrieval of subpoenaed gifts the president
had given to Lewinsky, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate prepared to debate Tuesday whether to call any
witnesses, even as one Republican senator questioned the quality
of the prosecution's overall case.
</P>
<P>
Henry Hyde, head of the 13 House prosecutors, said his
prosecution team still wanted to have the witnesses testify from
the well of the Senate but might have to settle for videotaped
depositions. "It's second best. We'd rather have the live
witnesses there, subject to cross examination," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
He is the first president in the U.S. to be subjected to a
trial since President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one
vote in 1868. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required to
convict Clinton and remove him from office, which most still
consider to be unlikely.

<HEADLINE> Neanderthal Man's Missing Bones Discovered at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists announced Tuesday
that they have found 20 bone fragments which belong to the
original Neanderthal man skeleton which rocked the scientific
world in the mid-19th century, according to a report of German
Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of bone fragments also marked the rediscovery of
the original site where the first Neanderthal man's partial
skeletal remains were found in 1856.
</P>
<P>
The precise location of the site had been lost to science in
the intervening years, and its rediscovery will allow researchers
a new chance to pick up where work left off 143 years ago, said
Juergen Thissen and Ralf Schmitz, who led the team which
rediscovered the site along the banks of the Neander River near
Cologne in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Among the "new" 40,000-year-old bone fragments were several
bits of the right fibia bone missing from the original Neanderthal
man skeleton.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a bone fragment the size of a U.S. 25-cent piece
perfectly fits a gap at the knee juncture of the Neanderthal man's
left tibia bone, the researchers said. The fragment could only
have come from that particular gap in the bone.
</P>
<P>
The other new finds also -- ranging from ribs to toe bones --
all complement the original 16 bone fragments, whose discovery in
1856 revolutionized scientific thinking about the origins of man.
</P>
<P>
Calcite miners accidentally stumbled onto the "old bones" in
the summer of 1856. The bones were taken away for study and by the
time their significance was determined, the exact location of the
find had been lost to science. The partial skeletal remains are
housed at the Rhine State Museum in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Schmitz and Thissen said the rediscovery of the site raises
hopes that more skeletal remains might yet be found along with
other clues to the life that the original Neanderthal man may have
led.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests to U.S. over Stray Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry on
Tuesday lodged a strong protest to the United States over the
landing of a stray U.S. missile in southern Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, the ministry
summoned Swiss charge d'affaires Stefano Lazzarotto, who takes
care of U.S. interests in Iran, to hear the protest.
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Washington cut off their relations in the wake of
the 1979 Islamic Revolution, which toppled the late shah's regime
and brought the clerics to power.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's Director General for American Affairs Mohammad
Reza Bakhtiari said that Iran holds the U.S. responsible for the
missile that dropped Iranian territory Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the incident is by no means acceptable for
Iran. The missile hit an area near Iran's southwestern city of
Abadan, Khuzestan province Monday morning when U.S. airplanes
launched air strikes on targets in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the city Javad Nazemi said the missile was found
about one kilometer from the city, but he did not disclose if it
exploded or hit anything.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said Lazzarotto expressed regret over the incident and
promised to convey Iran's protest to the U.S. government and seek
response.
</P>
<P>
On December 17, two stray U.S. missiles also hit the Iranian
city of Khorramshahr, Khuzestan province when U.S. and British
forces in the Gulf staged their military strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran has presented its protest to the U.S. and Britain over the
issue and demanded compensation for the damages caused by the
missiles.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliament Discusses U.S.-British Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly on
Tuesday called an extra session to discuss the U.S.-British
threats and its relations with the U.N. Security Council, the
Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting. parliament Speaker Saadoun Hammadi slammed the
U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq (UNSCOM), saying it was
partial and was conducting intelligence activities contrary to its
mission outlined by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared on several occasions that UNSCOM was dead
after the four-night U.S.-British bombardment on Iraq in
mid-December, while the U.S. insists that the commission be
allowed to go back to Iraq and resume its mission.
</P>
<P>
The issue of implementing the U.N. resolutions was but a means
to impair Iraq and to launch an aggression on Iraq, said the
speaker.
</P>
<P>
He said the Arab regimes which succumbed to the American
influence, with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on the forefront, had
conspired against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi accused the two neighbors of "joining in the
U.S.-British aggressions" against Iraq "in word, deed and supply,"
adding those aggressions since 1991 up till now had inflicted
heavy losses on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Information Minister Hammam Abdul-Khaliq said on Monday
that U.S. and British warplanes which attacked residential
quarters in and around the southern city of Basra Monday morning
were from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He also lashed out at some Arab regimes which he said "adhere
to put the resolutions of the embargo into effect despite the fact
that Iraq had implemented relevant U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency said the parliament would issue a
statement at the end of the session on Wednesday.

KAMPALA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and Vice-Chairman of China's National People's Congress
Standing Committee, Xu Jialu, officially opened the Mandela
National Stadium, the biggest sports facility in the country, here
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Xu, who is heading a 12-man high-level Chinese delegation, came
to Uganda Monday for the opening ceremony at the invitation of the
Ugandan government.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated Uganda on the opening the modern stadium,
hoping it can further promote the friendship between the two
countries and the physique of the public in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In his half-and-hour opening speech, Museveni hailed the
stadium as a monument of the friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He said:"It should be noted that the idea to construct a
national stadium was conceived by the two countries way back in
1965, but it was only in 1996, when the National Resistance
Movement came to power, that the matter was revived."
</P>
<P>
"I am grateful to the government of China for extending a soft
loan to the government of Uganda which has made the construction
of the stadium possible," the 54-year-old president added.
</P>
<P>
The stadium was named after South African President Nelson
Mandela in recognition of the painstaking efforts he has made in
the struggle for human dignity and African freedom, Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
The stadium, located some 10 kms east of Kampala, was built
with a 34 million U.S. Dollar soft loan from the Chinese
government. Construction work of the facility began in 1993 and
finished in February of 1997.

BEIRUT, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Interior Minister
Michel Murr Tuesday held talks with his Cypriot counterpart Dinos
Michaelides on the illegal immigration issue which has strained
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have reached an understanding on the necessity to
crack down on illegal immigration, said a statement issued after
the talks.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed on a working agenda for solving
the problem, the official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, relations between Cyprus and Lebanon have
been strained after the latter took back only six out of 29
illegal immigrants who allegedly set out from Lebanon's northern
port of Tripoli and landed on the island's southeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government described the case as "extremely
dangerous" and reportedly said at the time that it would take it
up with the European community to seek collective measures
against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides said they have found a solution to the issue and
practical measures are to be taken as well.
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget that Lebanon and Cyprus have had traditionally
friendly relations for many years," he added.
</P>
<P>
He denied that his country had said it would review relations
with Lebanon if Lebanon refused to take back the illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides, who arrived in Lebanon on Monday, also met with
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss later on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's First Vice President
Hassan Habibi said on Tuesday that Iran is concerned about the
recent U.S.-British military attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Iraqi charge d'affaires to Tehran
Abdulsattar Mahmoud al-Rawi, Habibi said that Iran has always
been opposed to foreign military presence in the Persian Gulf and
the Gulf of Oman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain on Monday again hit Iraqi targets,
following their joint military attacks in December to punish
Baghdad for what they called non-cooperation in U.N. weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Tuesday
condemned the recent attack, which killed 11 civilians and 58
others in Iraq's southern city of Basra.
</P>
<P>
Habibi said that Iran sees the presence of foreign forces in
the region as detrimental and considers cooperation among all
regional states important and essential for their interests, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC), Iran is in favor of expanding cooperation among Muslim
states, he said.
</P>
<P>
Habibi also underlined activation of joint commission and
speedy settlement of disputes between Iran and Iraq over issues of
prisoners of war and those missing in action.
</P>
<P>
The successful convention of the OIC summit meeting in Tehran
in 1997 paved the way for cooperation between Iran and Iraq, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi envoy hailed as "courageous and principled" the
stance taken by Iran vis-a-vis the recent U.S.-British military
strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Calling for an all-out expansion of Iraq-Iran cooperation,
al-Rawi said that activation of joint commission can be a way to
promote and further expand bilateral ties.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Coca-Cola Company Tuesday
reported its record volume but a declined income in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta-based company said in a news release available here
that its worldwide unit case volume grew 6 percent to nearly 16
billion unit cases, an increase of 900 million additional unit
cases, the 44th consecutive year that the company has increased
unit case volume.
</P>
<P>
"This past year has been a challenging period for the Coca-Cola
Company as economic slowdowns in several key markets had a
short-term impact, slowing volume growth and affecting our
earnings," said M. Ivester, chairman of the Board of Directors and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
The volume increase was a result of the company's aggressive
investment in certain bottling operations and its marketing
actions around the world to maximize the strength and efficiency
of production, distribution and marketing system, it said.
</P>
<P>
The company said that although worldwide gallon shipments grew
and selective price increases were implemented, net revenues
declined to 18.81 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 from 18.86 billion
dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The slightly declined operating income for the year reflected
the economic uncertainties in many markets throughout the world
and substantial impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, it said.
</P>
<P>
The company said its net income declined to 3.53 billion
dollars in 1998 from 4.12 billion dollars in the previous year.

MOSCOW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the United States
Tuesday urged the rivals in Kosovo to step up efforts for
achieving an "intermediate political settlement."
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stressed that "the
territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Union Republic of
Yugoslavia shall be respected in that settlement."
</P>

"The Kosovo sides shall boost efforts for the sake of achieving

their tasks.
</P>
<P>
"All the attacks and threats in address of the OSCE
(Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) Verification
Mission in Kosovo must be immediately stopped," the statement
said. "Everyone in Kosovo shall realize the importance of security
of the personnel of the mission and other international
organizations."

The two sides reaffirmed their condemnation at "the murder of
Kosovo Albanians in the village of Racak which cannot be
justified."

bilateral trade and investment agreement inked in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by visiting Pakistani Commerce

<P>
TEHRAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said on Tuesday that Iran is committed to its declared
policy of detente in bilateral, regional and international
relations.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with visiting Irish Foreign Minister David
Andrews, Khatami said that Iran has started a new stage in
relations with other countries, the European Union (EU) in
particular, and is optimistic about its foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that dialog would be useful if it was based on
accepting and respecting each other, the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"We need propagation of the moral values in the world to
enable us to move dialog, cooperation and amity forward rather
than create an atmosphere of hostility and bloodshed," the
Iranian president said.
</P>
<P>
Andrews voiced his country's support for Khatami's proposal of
holding dialog between the civilizations.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and Ireland have always been at a
satisfactory level despite international crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Andrews arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit to discuss
trade links with Iranian officials and opened the third session of
Iran-Ireland joint economic commission with his Iranian
counterpart Kamal Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
The two officials underlined the need to follow up on the
agreements signed in previous sessions of the joint economic
commission in the fields of fisheries, animal husbandry, and
veterinary affairs.

<HEADLINE> EU Says European Farmers Facing Advantages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- European Commissioner Franz
Fischler said here Tuesday that liberalization and globalization
provide enormous advantages for the agricultural sector, which the
European Union (EU) must use.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on the EU's main task of reforming the common
agriculture policy (CAP), Fischler stressed the need for improving
the competitiveness of European agriculture on both the domestic
and international levels and promoting and improving the degree of
familiarity of European agricultural products to raise sales.
</P>
<P>
"Orientation towards markets provides more entrepreneurial
freedom and less dependence on political price-decisions in the
Council of Ministers for European farmers and their families.
Accordingly farmers will have to face a higher entrepreneurial
risk," Fischler said at an occasion for celebration of the
European Council of young farmers' 40th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is up to policy to correct undesirable trends in
the general development," he said. Even in the future, ensuring
farmers' income will be the central task of agricultural policy
based on agricultural and rural development policy, in accordance
with the multifunctional aspect of the European agriculture model,
Fischler predicted.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the EU proposal for the CAP-reform aims to
pay farmers for their social functions and to compensate them for
additional environmental measures.
</P>
<P>
Referring to an idea of a European training program for young
farmers, the commissioner for agricultural and rural development
said it is excellent, particularly as the program's main elements
reflect the agro-political challenges in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend in Berlin, Fischler said that the EU commission
has put forward its CAP-reform proposals as part of the EU's
Agenda 2000 package. The final discussions about the reform have
already begun, but the German Presidency will be hard put to it to
keep to the timetable of achieving political agreement on the
whole Agenda 2000 package by this coming March, he added.

KAMPALA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni held talks with visiting Vice-Chairman of China's
National People's Congress Standing Committee Xu Jialu here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Museveni praised China for selecting, no matter under what sort
of pressure from outside, a way of development by its own and said
that Uganda is doing the same.
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour talks, they introduced to each other the
political systems in their respective countries.

Museveni was very interested in the formation and function of
China's National People's Congress and the specific roles in
national affairs of the different parties in the Congress.
</P>
<P>
Xu also elaborated on China's policies on education, a topic of
special interest to the Ugandan president.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official highly praised the wide and smooth
cooperation between the two countries in political, economic and
cultural fields since they established diplomatic relations in
1962.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Prosecutors Want Clinton to Appear in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- In a surprise move, U.S.
House prosecutors asked the Senate Tuesday to "request the
appearance" of President Bill Clinton at a deposition for his
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the prosecutors also sought subpoenas to question
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, presidential friend
Vernon Jordan and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors made the request in a motion at the start of
the trial Tuesday, substantially paring down their demand for live
witnesses at the trial. Their motion requested only that the
witnesses be questioned at depositions.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
"The two people who know the most about this are Monica
Lewinsky and President William Jefferson Clinton," Republican
lawmaker Bill McCollum said, adding that the prosecutors "strongly
urge" the Senate to call Clinton to testify without a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
"It is exceedingly important" that the senators have the
opportunity to hear from Clinton himself, McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
The House prosecutors also asked permission to introduce three
pieces of evidence that weren't in the official House impeachment
record used so far during the trial.

<HEADLINE> Bullet Holes Found in 2nd U.N. Downed Plane in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. search team,
which visited the site of the January 2 crash of a U.N.-chartered
plane Monday, have found bullet holes in the tail section of the
aircraft, a preliminary report said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tail section had fallen off on a hill near the site,
located near the village of Fazenda Tchinguilli, some 32
kilometers northeast of Huambo, a provincial capital in central
Angola, said the report from U.N. Under-Secretary-General and
Security Coordinator Benon Sevan.
</P>
<P>
"The team found bullet holes in the tail section of the
aircraft, which had fallen off on a nearby hill," the report said.
</P>
<P>
A small amount of elephant grass was piled upon parts of the
aircraft as camouflage. Both the cockpit voice and flight data
recorders had been removed from the aircraft with the wires that
attached them to the power source being cut and left dangling, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"The recorders could not be found," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Three of the four vehicles carried on board the aircraft were
located in totally destroyed and burned condition along with the
propeller blades of the three of the four engines, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
A fourth vehicle had fallen out of the aircraft, and the fourth
engines of the aircraft was located about 150 meters beyond the
crash site, the report said, adding that some aircraft parts were
strewn across a radius of 300 meters.
</P>
<P>
Based on the team's preliminary observation, "the aircraft was
attempting to make an emergency landing when major section of the
aircraft started to come apart while at altitude," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"The aircraft then fell out of control with the front section
in a nose down position turning abruptly to the left," and "the
aircraft had been on fire while in flight with two of the engine
propellers feathered by the pilot, indicating that the engines
were no longer operating with sufficient power," said the report.
</P>
<P>
"The aircraft continued to burn after impact," it said. "In
interviewing some of the villagers, the team was told that they
had seen the aircraft burst into flames, falling from the sky,
forcing them to run for cover."
</P>
<P>
"It is doubtful that any of the passengers and crew members
could have survived the crash, with the portion of the aircraft
carrying passengers and crew being totally destroyed," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"The remains recovered were beyond recognition and would
require examination in order to establish the identities of the
victims," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-chartered cargo plane, with nine people on board, was
reportedly shot down about 10 minutes after its take-off from
Huambo airport, central Angola, controlled by the rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). The tragedy
came just eight days after the December 26 crash of another U.N.
plane over the same area.
</P>
<P>
The two incidents, together with the escalating fighting in the
southwestern African nation, have prompted U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to recommend the withdrawal of U.N. peacekeepers. But
the Security Council later insisted on some U.N. presence in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Arrangements are being made the data collected to be examined
thoroughly by aviation and medical experts," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The team was accompanied to the second UNITA forces controlling
the surrounding area. Due to the difficulty of reaching the site
by road over a considerable distance through difficult terrain,
the team had a little over an hor at that location.
</P>
<P>
"The fullest cooperation was provided by the forces escorting
the team which was allowed complete access to all apparent
information at the site and the nearby area. The area around the
area is hilly with cultivated open areas in the immediate
vicinity," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, which has voiced its repeated condemnation
of bringing down the two planes, "would like to thank the
government of Angola and UNITA for their cooperation in making the
visit to the site of the crash possible, and expects their
continued cooperation to facilitate further access to the sites of
the two crashes, as necessary," the report added.

<HEADLINE> UK Police Use Cutout to Catch Flat Cap Robber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- British police hunting the
country's most prolific bank robber unveiled a life-size cardboard
cut-out of the offender Tuesday in an attempt to catch him.
</P>
<P>
The raider, dubbed the Flat Cap Robber because of his trademark
headgear, has struck 34 times at banks, building societies and
estate agencies across the Midlands and the North of England.
</P>
<P>
Although he has only stolen 38,000 pounds (63,000 U.S.
dollars), he has been branded Britain's most wanted man by
detectives on Operation Tornado.
</P>
<P>
Detective Inspector Pat Corfield, who is heading the inquiry,
told reporters the cutout would best illustrate the culprit's
below average height, which he believed was a major clue to his
identity.
</P>
<P>
Corfield said the man, who is thought to be in his 50s, was
believed to be around five feet four inches tall.
</P>
<P>
"He uses what he says is a gun, concealed in a plastic bag, and
although the weapon has never been seen and no shots have been
fired, he has done enough to `frighten the life' out of numerous
cashiers," Corfield said.
</P>
<P>
Police, who believe he may also be responsible for a further
five robberies, are appealing to anyone who recognizes him to
contact them.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Threat Causes Panic in Tanzania's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A bomb threat has caused
panic in a 12-story building located in the downtown of Tanzanian
capital Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
It was a total chaos in the Parastatal Pension Fund (PPF)
building after people on Monday evening received a telephone call
from a man who claimed that a bomb had been planted in the
building and will explode any time from 10:00 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The man identified himself as Godwin of the State Security
Department, according to Suchak Sanjay, a tenant of in the
building who received the call. Sanjay then informed the police.
</P>
<P>
The police, in collaboration with the Tanzania People's Defense
Forces, combed the building and barred tenants from entering the
building until 11 a.m. Tuesday, but found no bomb signs.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Regional Police Commander, Alfred Gewe,
confirmed the incident.
</P>
<P>
Sources said there was no such a person called Godwin at the
State Security Department.
</P>
<P>
Order has been restored at the PPF building with tenants going
with their business as usual.
</P>
<P>
The threat call came only one day after Director of Criminal
Investigations Department Adadi Rajabu gave warnings that those
made false reports will be punished.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time the city received blast threats since the
bombing at U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam on August 7 last year,
killing 11 people and injuring more than 70 others.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian police and the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) are still interrogating Mustafa Mahmoud Said
Ahmed, an Egyptian national, and Rashid Saleh Hemed, a Tanzanian,
who are charged with murdering 11 persons.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that the police held one more suspect on
Saturday evening at SIDO Hostel in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The Diamond Trust Bank in the capital city reported a bomb
threat late last year but nothing had happened.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Up Slightly in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence in the
United States scored a modest gain in January, the Conference
Board, a New York-based research group, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said in a survey that its Consumer
Confidence Index inched up to 127.6, a gain of about one point
over the last month. The index in December was 126.7.
</P>
<P>
The monthly survey says the Present Situation Index moved to
172.1 in January, up from 168.6 in December and the Expectations
Index fell from 98.7 in December to a current reading of 97.9.
</P>
<P>
"Favorable employment conditions continue to lift consumer
confidence levels," said Lynn Franco, associate director of the
board's Consumer Research Center. "While consumer expectations
have softened over the last several months, this vital sector of
the economy continues to be optimistic. Consumers' appraisal of
the current state of the economy is running at decade-high levels,
signaling further growth in the months ahead."
</P>
<P>
The survey based on a representative sample of 5,000 U.S.
households says the percentage of consumers who feel conditions
are "good" increased from 38.1 percent last month to 39.8 percent
in January. Consumers rating conditions as "bad," however,
increased from 8.7 last month to 9.4 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The key factor in historically high consumer confidence
readings is America's still potent job machine and consumers
regard current labor market conditions as positive.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 46 percent of consumers say jobs are more plentiful, up
from nearly 43 percent last month and the proportion of
respondents who feel that jobs are "hard to get" declined from
14.6 percent to 13.1 percent today, it says.
</P>
<P>
The survey says slightly more than 15 percent of consumers
expect fewer job opportunities in the next six months, down from
nearly 16 percent last month. The percentage who anticipate
greater employment opportunities in the months ahead declined
slightly from 14.1 percent to 13.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Coal Production to Hit New High in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The production of coal in
the United States will reach new high of 1.121 billion tons this
year, the National Mining Association (NMA) predicted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NMA estimated the country produced 1.113 billion tons of
coal last year, breaking the previous record of 1.090 billion tons
set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to NMA President Richard L. Lawson, the record
production level will be driven by consumption at electric
utilities, which has been the case since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Because of the strong U.S. economy and utilities' desire for
the lowest cost fuel to produce electricity, America's coal mining
companies are alive and well and producing more coal than they
have at any time in history," Lawson said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, coal mines east of the Mississippi River will produce
575 million tons and mines located in the western part of the
nation will produce 546 million tons, according to the NMA's "1999
Forecast of Coal Markets."
</P>
<P>
The report said total domestic consumption and exports of coal
in 1999 are expected to hit 1.140 billion tons, up from the record
1.131 billion tons used in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Utilities will use 935 million tons of coal to generate 56.8
percent of the electricity produced by the public utility sector,
the report predicted.
</P>
<P>
The NMA's preliminary estimates show that exports of coal in
1998 will be 78 million tons, down 5 million tons from the 83
million tons exported in 1997. In 1999, exports likely will total
76 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Coal stocks will remain unchanged in 1998 and 1999. Imports,
which were 8 million tons in 1998, will increase to 9 million tons
in 1999.

<HEADLINE> France: Fixed Rates Between Major Currencies Unrealistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Finance and
Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn said Tuesday that fixed exchange
rates between the dollar, euro and yen are not realistic although
better cooperation is needed to keep currency fluctuation stable.
</P>
<P>
"In the present situation, it is not realistic to plan a system
of fixed exchange rates," said the minister at an economic seminar
here.
</P>
<P>
He said that better international cooperation in the monetary
field would allow one to react to and deal with in advance the
elements of instability in the exchange rates between major
currencies.
</P>
<P>
"We should monitor together the developments in the exchange
markets to prevent excessive imbalances and to coordinate our
responses to the major stock exchanges which affect the world
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a reference to the devaluation of the Brazilian currency
real, Strauss-Kahn said that sometimes it is necessary to float a
currency as it is useless to using up "foreign reserves to fend
off speculation."
</P>
<P>
But he called on China to keep to its pledge of not devaluing
the Chinese currency yuan.
</P>
<P>
The French minister also called on Japan to make greater
efforts to improve its economic situation as the recession in
Japan is also hurting other Asian economies.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Denies Backing Angola's Rebel Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
strongly rejected accusations by Angola that it is supporting the
rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
''Those accusations are baseless,'' the RNA quoted Rwandan
Minister of Foreign Affairs Anastase Gasana as saying. ''Those
claiming that we are supporting Savimbi have no evidence for
these accusations.''
</P>
<P>
''Rwanda supported and still supports the Lusaka Peace
Protocol,'' Gasana pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The minister indicated that despite the involvement of Angola
on the side of President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC), and Rwanda on the side of the Congolese rebels,
good relations between Rwanda and Angola are still maintained.
</P>
<P>
''We share a lot with Angola, we joined hands in removing the
late Zairean dictator (Mobutu Sese Seko) who was causing trouble
to all his neighbors,'' Gasana underlined. ''So we would not
contribute to any destabilization of Angola which would prolong
the suffering of its people,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected allegations that Rwanda has opened its airport
 facilities for military supplies for the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
A senior official in the Rwandan Ministry of Defense also
denied that Rwandan troops are in Angola fighting alongside UNITA
rebels, or that Rwanda is providing any help to UNITA Chairman
Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
''We are not there,'' the official said, accusing the Angolan
government of looking for scapegoats to attract the sympathy of
the international community.

<P>
PARIS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Elie Kagan, the only French
photojournalist who took pictures of the bloody crackdown on
Algerian demonstrators by French police in Paris on October 17,
1961, died at the age of 70 Monday.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Monde said that Kagan, a life-time freelance
photographer whose pictures showed that many Algerians were killed
during the demonstration, will be buried Wednesday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Algerians demonstrated on October 17,
1961, in Paris to express their support for the Independence War
at home.
</P>
<P>
The French government has since kept secret the number of dead
in the crackdown, in which some demonstrators were shot, some were
pushed onto subway rails and were crushed by trains, and some were
thrown into the Seine River and were drowned.
</P>
<P>
But the French Interior Ministry admitted last year that dozens
of demonstrators could have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources put the figure of victims at 200, while
Algeria said 300 were killed.

JOHANNESBURG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural officials in
northeastern Namibia have reported an outbreak of locusts along
Lake Liambezi in the Caprivi Region, the South African

</P>
<P>
SABA quoted Christopher Joba, provincial extension officer in

place known as Kikiya, the worst affected area.
</P>
<P>
Joba said that he had requested his head office in capital
Windhoek to send more people to help with the spraying because the
area to be covered was too big for his staff. The official said
he had also asked for a helicopter to be sent to the affected
areas to hunt down the points where the insects were concentrated.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian official said that a ground survey had become
impossible because most places could not be reached by vehicles

<HEADLINE> Iran's Industrial Exports Fall by 25.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's exports of industrial
products dropped by 25.2 percent during the first three quarters
of the current Iranian calendar year ending on March 20, a senior
Iranian official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Industries Minister for Economic and International
Affairs Ebrahim Bahadorani said that over 690 million U.S. dollars
worth of industrial goods, produced by units affiliated to the
Industries Ministry, have been exported during the period.
</P>
<P>
Iran had expected to earn 1.147 billion dollars from exports of
industrial products for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The official did not elaborate on the factors that caused the
sharp fall.
</P>
<P>
However, experts listed the fall of oil price, world economic
stagnation, fluctuation of Iran's policies on exports and
complicated procedures as the main hurdles for exports.
</P>
<P>
The Export Promotion Center of Iran (EPCI) announced on Sunday
that the country's non-oil exports registered a 7 percent drop
in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The EPCI said that around 2.205 billion dollars worth of
non-oil goods were exported in the period against 2.4 billion
dollars in the same period of the year before.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the fall in value, the volume of non-oil exports
during the nine months recorded 34 percent increase, the EPCI
said.
</P>
<P>
Iran expected to fetch 5 billion dollars from non-oil
exports in the current Iranian year, but the non-oil exports
showed a negative growth in value during the first two quarters,
mainly caused by the fall in prices of oil and oil products.
</P>
<P>
However, in the third quarter of the year, the exports showed
an increase in value and the upward trend is expected to continue
in the last three months as oil price recovered slightly.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken some steps to revive the country's
non-oil exports, which have fallen since 1995 when then government
imposed strict restrictions on the outflow of hard currency.

JOHANNESBURG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Tuesday
commended last Saturday's decision by the countries of the Great
Lakes region to suspend economic sanctions against Burundi.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the South African Foreign Affairs Department
said that the suspension of these sanctions, subject to review,
will give further impetus to the Burundi peace negotiations.

The sanctions were imposed one week after Tutsi Major Pierre
Buyoya seized power on July 25 1996, in a bid to force him to
negotiate with Hutu rebels and return Burundi to constitutional
rule.
</P>
<P>
The decision to lift sanctions was taken by regional African
presidents at a summit in Arusha, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is confident that lasting peace, democracy and
security can be achieved if the Burundians negotiate a peaceful
settlement of their country's problems," said the statement.

LONDON January 26 (Xinhua) - A mixed Wall Street Opening kept
European stock markets boxed into a narrow range Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, London's FTSE 100 finished a volatile session slightly
higher as the market ignored Wall Street and focused on the search
for equilibrium, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The index touched a high of 5927.8 at 100:00 and a low of 5822
just before 13:00. It closed up 4.8 at 5889.3 points, having
travelled a range of more than 100 points.
</P>
<P>
German shares closed mixed in volatile trading following a
plummet in Brazil's currency against the US dollar and a weaker
opening on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
A slide in the Brazilian real against the dollar sparked a
sell-off in futures late in the session which sent the
electronically traded Xetra Dax down nearly 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
But these losses were erased when Wall Street nudged into
positive territory. The floor Dax ended the day up 4 points at
4886.
</P>

Paris Cac 40 index gained just over 20 points to close at
4071.28 as French stocks ended slightly higher for the second day

<HEADLINE> EU Commission Adopts Policy on Sustainable Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here Wednesday that it has adopted a policy document on
sustainable development of agriculture in a bid to stress the
need to protect the environment while developing the primary
industry.
</P>
<P>
The policy document shows how environmental considerations
have become a major concern for EU's Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP), particularly in the context of its Agenda 2000 reforms.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing here Wednesday, EU commissioner for
agriculture and rural development Franz Fischler said the EU
needs to redefine the relationship between agriculture and the
environment to move towards sustainable agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"The commission's proposals under Agenda 2000 provide member
states and regions with the tools necessary to protect the
heritage of our rural areas and we will continue working at the
EU level to better integrate our agricultural and environmental
policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
EU commissioner for Environment Ritt Bjerregaard said: "It is
clear that Europe's citizens expect that our policies are
coherent. Agricultural policy must contribute to our
environmental objectives and not undermine them."
</P>
<P>
"Integration of environmental considerations in CAP must never
be confined to paper alone. It must be reflected in reality, in
real and genuine changes in the way production and financial
support is organized," she added.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also said this requires a strong and active
commitment from the 15 EU agricultural ministers. "I very much
look forward to their commitment here in the final and crucial
phase of negotiations" on reforms proposed in the Agenda 2000,
the EU's strategy document adopted in July 1997.

programs through satellite equipment by the end of 1998. Over 86
percent and 89 percent of the total population of the country
have access to radio and TV programs, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Tian said that under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and
the Chinese Communist Party's line, workers in the field of
radio, film and television contributed much to publicizing Deng's
Theory, reports on President Jiang Zemin's visits, and
commemorating the 20th anniversary of China's reform and opening
up in 1998.
</P>

<P>
TEHRAN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran Wednesday asked the United
States to apologize to Iran over stray missiles landing on
Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi said that the U.S. must make compensation for the
material and mental damage caused by the missiles and making
apology to Iran is part of the compensation.
</P>
<P>
Asefi stressed that Iran holds the U.S. responsible for the
missile strikes and will never accept such incidents.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. missile went astray and landed near Abadan in Iran's
southwestern Khuzestan province Monday when U.S. airplanes raided
targets in Basra, southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry Tuesday lodged its strong protest to
the U.S. by summoning Swiss charge d'affaires Stefano Lazzarotto,
whose country takes care of the U.S. interests in Iran after the
breakup of relations between Tehran and Washington in 1980.
</P>
<P>
On December 17, two U.S. stray missiles also hit Iranian city
of Khorramshahr in Khuzestan province during the U.S.-British air
strikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran had presented its protest to the U.S. and Britain over the
issue and demanded compensation from the U.S. for the damage
caused by the missiles.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin Denies Frictions Between Yeltsin, Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kremlin said Wednesday that
there are no frictions between President Boris Yeltsin and Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
"They work in full cooperation," said Dmitry Yakushkin,
Yeltsin's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Reports of discord between Yeltsin and Primakov came Tuesday,
when the Kremlin issued a statement describing as unconstitutional
a political accord among the country's three branches of power
proposed by Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said that statement does not represent a dispute
between the president and the premier but merely "an explanation
by the president of his stand," Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
"The president's principled position is: he has not renounced
his constitutional rights and does not intend to renounce them,"
Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
Billed as a political peace treaty between the parliament and
the government, the proposed accord would weaken Yeltsin's power,
such as preventing him from dismissing parliament until the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Primakov held a "prolonged meeting" Wednesday in
the Central Clinical Hospital, where Yeltsin was being treated for
a bleeding gastric ulcer.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said Yeltsin instructed Primakov and Nikolai
Bordyuzha, the presidential chief of staff and head of the
Security Council, to convene a meeting on political stability,
including the tripartite accord proposed by Primakov.
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin stressed the need to ensure law and order in
the country and prevent criminal elements from participation in
the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin declined to predict the fate of the "package"
proposed by Primakov, insisting that it remains "a clearly working
document."
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin "does not intend to enter any haggling" on the
question of political stability.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who entered the Central Clinical Hospital on January
17, will remain in the hospital until the end of the week,
Yakushkin said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Speaker Fumes over Stray U.S. Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Majlis (Parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri on Wednesday urged the government,
especially the Foreign Ministry, to "seriously follow up" the
issue of stray U.S. missile that hit Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an open session of the Majlis, the speaker said
that the landing of a stray missile in southwestern port city of
Abadan on Monday was "a vivid aggression against Islamic Iran."
</P>
<P>
Abadan is close to the Iran-Iraq border. Monday's stray missile
incident was the latest since U.S. and British forces started air
strikes against Iraq in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
During the four-night military campaign one month ago, two
U.S. missiles fired at Iraqi targets reportedly strayed and ended
up inside Iran's border city of Khorramshahr. Tehran has been
seeking U.S. apology.
</P>
<P>
Monday's incident prompted an Iranian protest and demand for
compensation from Washington.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. was following mischievous objectives and "the moves
are suspicious," said the speaker.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that with the missiles hitting Iran's
border areas, the U.S. aggression has taken a new shape and
dimension.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps they are testing us in order to see our reaction and
they are hitting two birds with one stone," Nouri said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran's tolerance has its limits and called called on
the armed forces and border guards to "preserve their full
alertness to respond to these attacks."
</P>
<P>
He criticized the government for not taking serious stance
towards the U.S. action.
</P>
<P>
"Had we taken a serious stance the day when they (the U.S.)
shot down our passenger plane or when they hit Khorramshahr with
missiles, they would have not become so bold to fire another
missile at Abadan," Nouri said.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian airbus passenger plane was shot down by a U.S.
warship in the Gulf on July 3, 1988, 290 passengers and crew on
board were killed.
</P>
<P>
Nouri also condemned the repeated U.S.-British strikes on Iraq
and warned against the dangerous consequences of the attacks for
the region and Iraq's national security.
</P>
<P>
He regretted the passive attitude and silence of the Islamic
countries toward the attacks, and criticized the United Nations
and world countries for remaining mum in this respect.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Latin American Nations to Put House in Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Vice President
Shahid Burki on Wednesday called on Latin American nations to
step up their efforts to bring their economies and finances in
order.
</P>
<P>
"Those countries which still don't have an adequate fiscal
system must adopt the necessary measures as soon as possible,"
the senior World Bank official said on the World Bank forum on
Latin America in the southern German city of Munich.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the governments must adopt long-term strategies
to combat poverty, the vice-president told the 300 participants
of the forum which brings together business leaders, politicians
and economists.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the budget deficits of the central
governments, there are half-hidden deficits at sub-central levels
and, also, in the unsustainable public pension fund systems,"
Burki said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day forum, organized by the Germany's giant
electronics concern Siemens, is being held in a bid to enhance
ties between Germany, the World Bank and Latin American nations
to the backdrop of the Brazilian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Among those invited were World Bank President James Wolfensohn
and President Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Siemens called on the World Bank to provide enhanced
guarantees to private investors in Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
Better investment guarantees would be an incentive for foreign
companies to boost their investments in infrastructure projects
in these countries, Siemens Finance managing board member
Heinz-Joachim Neubuerger told the gathering.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliament Vows to Support Saddam's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) Wednesday reiterated its full adherence to the
leadership of President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
At an exceptional session chaired by Speaker Saadoun Hammadi,
the 450-member assembly hailed Saddam's brave struggle in the face
of "American, imperialist and Zionist onslaught Iraq has been
exposed to."
</P>
<P>
It also authorized Saddam and the Revolutionary Command Council
the power to adopt what they deem it proper to implement the
decisions and recommendations that the assembly had approved, the
Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The session started Tuesday to discuss the U.S.-British
aggressions on Iraq and Iraq's relations with the U.N. Security
Council, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi said Tuesday that the issue of implementing U.N.
resolutions was but a means to impair Iraq and launch an
aggression on it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched a four-night bombardment on Iraq
in mid-December for what they said Iraq's refusal of cooperation
with U.N. weapons inspectors, who were in charge of overseeing
Baghdad's elimination of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The assembly demanded the Arab governments help get lifted the
U.N. sanctions, which was imposed on Iraq following its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990. The invasion triggered the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
It also condemned the U.S.-British aggression and the no-fly
zones imposed by the U.S. and its allies on the heel of the Gulf
War as contrary to the international norms and values, said the
INA.
</P>
<P>
The allied forces set up the no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq to allegedly protect the Kurds in the north and
Shiite Muslims in the south from Iraqi government's suppression.
</P>
<P>
The assembly vehemently lashed out at Monday's U.S.-British
bombardment on residential quarters in and around the southern
Iraqi city of Basra, which killed 11 civilians and injured 59
others.
</P>
<P>
Basra, about 550 kilometers south of Baghdad, is part of
southern Iraqi no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. warplanes patrolling the zones have been regularly
firing missiles on Iraq's ground military targets since the
mid-December air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The assembly also held the U.S. and Britain, and Saudi and
Kuwaiti rulers full responsible for the flagrant aggression
against the people of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that it will continue pursuing the lifting of the
embargo and defying the U.S., British, Saudi and Kuwaiti
aggression on Iraq, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly denounced Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for
allowing the U.S.-British warplanes to use their space and bases
in the bombardments on Iraq.

BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- State Councilor Wu Yi on
Wednesday demanded that Chinese Customs Offices act according to

trade this year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese customs should strictly abide by laws and regulations,
and take more vigorous actions to crack down on smuggling and
maintain a sound trade order, she said today at a national
Customs conference.
</P>
<P>
She called for new and efficient means to cut clearance costs

An outline for approving and opening new ports should be
worked out as soon as possible in order to create a rational
distribution of ports, she said.
</P>
<P>
She urged Customs Offices to improve management, avoid
repetition, and simplify inspection procedures.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she praised Customs Offices for their work in
anti-smuggling activities and tax collecting last year. She also
asked the Customs workers to consider the fight against smuggling
a long-term task, and warned them against corruption.

<HEADLINE> Rebuilding After Colombian Quake Expected to Take Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Finance Minister Juan
Camilo Restrepo said Wednesday that rebuilding the Cauca valley
region after Monday's powerful earthquake will take four to five
years.
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of work ahead of us," said Restrepo, who is now
in the southern German city of Munich for a World Bank forum on
Latin America, according to a report of the German Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian Red Cross said the death toll from the quake in
the country's coffee-growing heartland is more than 2,000 and
warns of the spread of diseases from decomposing bodies.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 bodies have been recovered. About a quarter of a
million people have been left homeless.
</P>
<P>
Restrepo said it was still too early to put a figure on the
damage caused by the quake. He called for an international team
of experts to help find ways to rebuild the region.
</P>
<P>
Restrepo said Colombia was unlikely to reach the 2.5 percent
economic growth expected for 1999 and its national debt increases
will exceed the planned target.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said his government would start talks
with the international financial community and private banks to
discuss the problem.

HONG KONG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa said
Wednesday that the financial instability in Brazil would have no
direct impact on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the Brazilian government's decision to let
the real float will inevitably put pressure on the Hong Kong
dollar and the Chinese Renminbi, Tung said: "Would it impact
directly on Hong Kong, or the Renminbi? The answer is no."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this is a concern of all of us here, in Hong Kong
and around the world. And I am sure it will be subject of
discussion at Davos also," the Hong Kong leader told reporters
here before he left for Davos, Switzerland to attend the World
Economic Forum's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
But Tung also warned that if the financial instability in
Brazil became a global issue, everybody would be affected. He
hoped that Brazil, the United States, and multi-lateral
organizations would have enough wisdom to have the problem
well-handled.

<HEADLINE> Mobile Telecommunications Industry Booming in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's booming mobile
telecommunications industry has chalked up a strong growth
despite the economic downturn, an official of the Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered to the Telecommunication Association of
Hong Kong, Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting
K.C. Kwong quoted the latest statistics, which showed the
industry recorded a growth rate of nearly 40 percent in the
12-month period to October 1998.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 2.6 million mobile phone users in Hong
Kong, said the official. The figure represents a penetration rate
of around 40 percent, the highest in the world outside the
Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the buoyant growth to a number of factors,
including the government's commitment to promoting fair and
effective competition in the telecommunications markets.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that competition will bring innovation, quality,
choice and competitive prices to consumers," said Kwong. Hong Kon
g now has six independent operators operating 11 digital
networks. Consumers have a choice of technical standards
conforming to the GSM standard which originated from Europe and
the Digital AMPS and CDMA standards from North America.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will forge ahead in such areas as the
implementation of mobile number portability, the access to land
for the extension of mobile radio coverage and the introduction
of the third generation mobile services.

<HEADLINE> Annan: No Opposition to Separate Probe Into His Role in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here Wednesday that he would
not oppose any separate probe into his role in events surrounding
the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Annan told Belgian radio that the Security Council has to be
involved in the inquiry. "It has to agree and we'll discuss all
this," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. head arrived here Tuesday night for a two-day visit
to Belgium. He met Belgian King Albert this morning, and is
expected to meet Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, NATO
officials and European Commission President Jacques Santer during
his stay.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival, relatives of Belgian and Rwandan victims of
the 1994 killings hold a protest, criticizing Annan's role in
U.N. mission's failure to prevent the massacre.
</P>
<P>
They also called for an independent investigation of U.N.
actions and Annan's role and urged him personally to set up a
separate panel of experts.
</P>
<P>
"Together we accused Kofi Annan of having a major
responsibility for the U.N. failure to prevent the 1994 genocide
in Rwanda," said Belgian senator Alain Destexhe, speaking on
behalf of the victims' relatives who also asked for a meeting
with the U.N. head. Annan said he agreed to meet them later in
the day.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Annan was director of the U.N. peacekeeping
operations during the killings, in which about 800,000 people
were reportedly killed in Rwanda. Ten Belgian paratroopers in
the U.N. peacekeeping forces were also killed. Kofi Annan took
over office of the U.N. secretary general in January 1997.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: S.Lankan Ruling Party's Local Poll Success Widely Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Despite complaints of violence
and malpractices from opposition parties, Sri Lanka's ruling
People's Alliance (PA) has scored victories in the bitterly
contested North Western Provincial Council (NWPC) election, with a
big margin.
</P>
<P>
The PA won 30 seats out of 52, while the main opposition United
National Party (UNP) got 19 seats and three were obtained by
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), or People's Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said the PA's success is widely expected,
given President Chandrika Kumaratunga's prestige among the people,
the party's successful election campaign, achievements made in the
province since 1994 when the PA came to power and the weak
leadership of the UNP.
</P>
<P>
The poll is characterized by a voter turnout of as high as 75
percent, a 20 percent rise in votes cast to the PA compared with
1993, and an upsurge in violence incidents up to 720, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
The North Western Province (NWP), once UNP's stronghold, is one
of Sri Lanka's nine provinces, comprising the two administrative
districts of Kurunegala and Puttalam. It has a population of 2.2
million out of the country's 18.5 million.
</P>
<P>
The province's poll has attained national significance, as its
results are expected to influence the incoming polls in other five
provinces.
</P>
<P>
To secure victory, the PA led by Kumaratunga launched a hectic
election campaign, with the president addressing meetings
throughout the province in just three weeks.
</P>
<P>
The PA has also garnered support from its political partners --
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and Ceylon Worker's Congress -- which
have much influence in the province's plantation workers.
</P>
<P>
The central plank in the PA's campaign was "vote for us to
develop the country further", which apparently boosted the
confidence of voters in the party.
</P>
<P>
The province is rich in agricultural produce, mainly rice and
coconut, and industry there has also flourished recently with the
number of industrial locations having risen to 113 from 39 in
1970. The rural population makes up the bulk of both districts.
</P>
<P>
Since it took office in 1994, the PA government has launched a
series of development projects for the province in such areas as
road and bridge rehabilitation, water supply and irrigation as
well as agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Although the achievements are far from totally satisfactory,
the people in the province have already tasted the benefits from
the policies introduced by the PA government.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the powerful campaign by the PA, the UNP's appeared
to be ill organized, lackluster, and therefore had less chance of
winning the election.
</P>
<P>
Political sources said the campaign meetings organized by the
UNP were much smaller in scale and had less influence compared
with those by the PA.
</P>
<P>
The plank in the UNP's campaign was "vote to preserve
democracy," which appeared less charming to the rural population.
</P>
<P>
Although the dust has begun to settle on the NWPC elections,
the opposition parties, the province's religious leaders and
independent election monitors still alleged that the PA victory
was not convincing, citing a large number of election violence
incidents.
</P>
<P>
The UNP leader has announced that its members would not join as
members of the NWPC, and asked for a court order to annul the
election results and have a repoll.
</P>
<P>
However, the PA's NWP Chief Minister designate S.B. Navinna
said that no matter whether the UNP was present or not in the
NWPC, he would run the affairs of the province with the help of
his group elected by the people, endorsing the government's
program of working for the development of the province.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Commemorate 10th Anniversary of 10th Panchen Lama's Death-(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Basang said that although the 10th Panchen Lama left us ten
years ago, his loyalty to both the motherland and the religion,
as well as his remarks and efforts supporting the unity of the
motherland are still very vivid in the hearts of people of differe
nt ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Basang recalled that in March 1959, the upper-class
reactionaries in Tibet, headed by the Dalai Lama, mounted an
armed rebellion, and when the rebellion failed, they fled
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen Lama, under the banner of patriotism, unity and
progress, supported the central government's policy of
introducing democratic reform while quelling the rebellion.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Commemorate 10th Anniversary of 10th Panchen Lama's Death-(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region's
committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the regional
government held a rally this afternoon in Lhasa to commemorate
the 10th anniversary of the death of the 10th Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
Basang, vice-chairman of the regional Party committee, said
the 10th Panchen Lama was a great patriot, a renowned activist in
state affairs, a loyal friend of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) and a leader of Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
On January 28, 1989, the 51-year-old Panchen Lama passed away
of a sudden heart attack at his residence in Xigaze, Tibet, and
on the third day after his death, the State Council decided to
build a pagoda for him, which took three years to construct and
cost more than 64 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Basang said that the 10th Panchen Lama had persisted in his
stand of patriotism, unity and progress, and firmly objected to
splitting activities during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
"Both history and reality have proven that the Tibetan people
can have a bright future ahead only when they live in a socialist
motherland under the leadership of the CPC, and with unity among
different ethnic nationalities ensured." Basang said.

<HEADLINE> Trade Union Must Care for Workers in Difficulty: Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Trade unions in China should
step up efforts to aid laid-off workers from State-owned
enterprises and never let "unexpected tragedy happened to a
single household in abject poverty," a top Chinese official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Special attention should be paid to "those who cannot afford
living expenses," said Wei Jianxing, member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of Communist Party of China
Central Committee and president of the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions (ACFTU), at a meeting of the presidium of the ACFTU.
</P>
<P>
Wei called on all trade unions to take on the tasks of helping
the laid-offs find new jobs, offering them vocational training,
and ensuring a basic level of subsistence for the poor.
</P>
<P>
"Protecting the interests of the workers and maintaining
social stability is the task of the Party, and is also a top duty
that trade unions should never shrug off," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
He urged trade unions across the country to merge themselves
with the common workers and to report the truth to the Party.

Chinese journalists have made new achievements in introducing
China's reform and opening up to the world in 1998, and have also
enhanced their friendship and mutual understanding with foreign
counterparts, said Shao Huaze, president of the All-China
Journalists Association and the People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Shao also expressed thanks to the foreign correspondents for

China met severe challenge of the Asian financial crisis and
last summer's disastrous floods, while managing to guarantee a
stable currency and sustainable, rapid economic growth in 1998,
which the whole world is applauding, stressed Shao.
</P>
<P>
1999 will be the 50th anniversary of the founding of the

<HEADLINE> WIPO Expects Further Cooperation With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Intellectual
Property Organization (WIPO) plans to enhance cooperation with
China, according to the organization's director-general Kamil
Idris.
</P>
<P>
The WIPO will continue to support Chinese intellectual property
 institutions through developing human resources, enhancing
legislative framework and other efforts, the WIPO leader told the
press today after his meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
"The immediate short-term project (for the WIPO) with China is
to give specific training courses for specialists," said Idris.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill his commitment, the director-general on Tuesday
donated a range of publications, including information databases
and legal books, to China's Intellectual Property Training Center
which educates high-level professionals in the field.
</P>
<P>
The official emphasized the significant role that China could
play in worldwide intellectual property protection, saying that
China has become "a member of most of the international treaties
of the WIPO, and has legislated in practically all areas of
intellectual property."
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that "the most important challenge
that remains for this country is to amend and modify legislation
in order to meet newly established international obligations."
</P>
<P>
He also praised the Chinese government's recent efforts to
crack down on piracy. "This is a very good campaign in the right
direction because fighting piracy and counterfeit goods will, in
the end, be in the social and economic interest of the country
itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 170-nation-member WIPO urges countries throughout the
world to earnestly protect intellectual property rights. China
joined the organization in 1980 and has participated in 12
treaties under its jurisdiction.

<HEADLINE> Obuchi: Logistical Support Not to Exceed Japan-U.S. Security Treaty Framework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi said Tuesday that Japan's logistical support for U.S.
forces in emergence in "areas surrounding Japan" under the
revised bilateral defense cooperation guidelines will not exceed
the framework of the Japan-U.S. security treaty.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi was responding to a question raised by Tetsuzo
Fuyushima, secretary-general of the New Komeito Party at the
House of Representatives Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
"It is unthinkable that Japan would offer to provide
logistical support for U.S. forces in emergencies in the Middle
East, the Indian Ocean or the opposite side of the earth," Obuchi
said.
</P>
<P>
The Japan-U.S. security treaty is generally considered to
cover the Far East and its vicinity.
</P>
<P>
In 1960, the Japanese government defined the "Far East" as
roughly covering Japan and areas extending south to the
Philippines, South Korea and Taiwan of China.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura, referring to the
same issue, said that the government's view of "areas surrounding
Japan" is not totally without geographical basis.
</P>
<P>
These remarks signaled a change in the Japanese government's
stance over the issue as it had earlier maintained that
"surrounding areas" is not a geographical concept but a
situational one.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and
Liberal Party (LP) confirmed at a meeting of party leaders that
there are implicit geographical limits to the logistical support
Japan would provide for U.S. forces under the new guidelines.
</P>
<P>
However, they also agreed that the geographical areas where
the military support would be given should not be described.
</P>
<P>
Yukihiko Ikeda, the top policy-maker in the LDP, told the
meeting that it would not be convincing to say that such emergenci
es could not be defined in a geographical way.

TOKYO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Japan will dispatch a 15-member
medical team to earthquake-hit Colombia, the Japanese Foreign
Ministry said Wednesday.

<P>
In addition, Japan will also provide some 25.7 million yen

</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Japan sent a 35-member emergency rescue team to
western Colombia, which was hit by a powerful earthquake on

<HEADLINE> Next IOC President Should Be Paid: Samaranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Juan Antonio Samaranch, saying
his successor as IOC president should be a paid professional when
he talked to German weekly Die Zeit in an interview on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The current IOC president also rejected any thought of res
igning in the wake of the IOC bribery scandal and said "I made no
mistakes."
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said he had no doubt that he would win the vote of
confidence he faces in March at an extraordinary IOC assembly.
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old Spaniard is due to retire in two years because
of the age limit.
</P>
<P>
His successor should be a paid professional and the IOC in
future should be open more to Olympic athletes, Samaranch told
the weekly.
</P>
<P>
Some of those athletes on Wednesday joined the chorus
demanding Samaranch's resignation.
</P>
<P>
"Some gentlemen are too old for the job," said Germany's world
champion swimmer Sandra Voelker. "It begins with Juan Antonio
Samaranch. I think he is not adequate for president any more."
</P>
<P>
But Helmut Digel, president of the German Athletics Federation
and a vice president of the National Olympic Committee, defended
Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
"There are no proven accusations against him. Like anybody
else, Mr. Samaranch has the right to remain innocent until proven
guilty," Digel said.
</P>
<P>
Digel said the future venues of Olympic Games should be chosen
by a committee of experts in a non-secret ballot, and their
decision should be publicly explained.
</P>
<P>
Manfred von Richthofen, president of the German Sports
Federation, said the Olympic host cities should be picked by an
independent agency.
</P>
<P>
Lars Riedel, Germany's discus Olympic champion, had a
different suggestion.
</P>
<P>
"I would spread the Games over three or four cities. Then this
undignified theater would come to a quick end," Riedel said.

<HEADLINE> German President: Do Not Forget History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- German President Roman Herzog on
Wednesday called on the parliament to approve plans for a large
holocaust memorial in Berlin near the historic Brandenburg Gate,
warning it is dangerous for the new generation to forget history.
</P>
<P>
In a speech marking the 54th anniversary of the Auschwizt
concentration camp's liberation by the Soviet forces, Herzog said
Nazism is the "common, terrible legacy" of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Herzog warned that with the older generation once living under
Adolf Hitler's Third Reich passing into history, there has been a
growing trend of indifference to history among the younger
generation.
</P>
<P>
He also indirectly criticized a speech last October by Martin
Walser, a German writer who said he was fed up with hearing about
Auschwitz every day in the German media.
</P>
<P>
Herzog stressed that Germany must accept its full history -
both the good and the bad. "Every attempt to leave Nazism out of
historical memory is a special form of intellectual cowardice and
cowardice is the last thing I want from my nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although the vast majority of Germans today are not
responsible for Auschwitz Holocaust, "they are especially
responsible for seeing that something like the Holocaust and
Auschwitz never again happens," Herzog said.
</P>
<P>
Herzog said the memorial should stand out as German desire to
build up self-will, and more local monuments to the Holocaust
should be built in the future.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, the German President also appealed for the
vigilant attention to the growing anti-Semitism and intolerance,
saying such trends "must not be allowed to even set foot here."
</P>
<P>
There are 70,000 Jewish people among Germany's 82 million
population, and the Jewish presence is growing stronger with
immigrants coming from the former Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Three German Nationals Kidnaped in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, January 27 (xinhua) -- Three German nationals were
kidnaped along with five Yemenis by Yemeni tribesmen Tuesday,
government and tribal officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The three Germans have been taken to the northern al-Jawf
tribal area of Yemen, where six foreign hostages are being held
since January 17, the tribal official said.
</P>
<P>
No organization has claimed responsibility yet and the motives
behind the kidnaping is not clear.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Bonn, the German Foreign Ministry
said the hostages comprised 30-year-old German aid worker, her
Yemeni husband and their three Yemeni children, the aid worker's
brother and his wife - both German nationals, and the group's
Yemeni driver.
</P>
<P>
The aid worker worked for the government's aid program,
German Development Services. Her brother and sister-in-law were
visiting Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Tribesmen of Yemen frequently kidnap foreigners to gain
economic concessions from their government. Hostages generally are
well-treated and released unharmed.
</P>
<P>
However, last month Islamic militants seized 16 Westerners
in a kidnaping that ended with three Britons and an Australian
being killed in a shootout with Yemeni soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Members of the northern Bakeel tribe earlier abducted a British
couple and the Dutch family of four, demanding the release of two
fellow tribesmen detained in a murder case.

<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua)-- The National Symphony Orchestra
of the United States, hailed by President Bill Clinton as "one of
America's cultural treasures," staged its premier performance at
the Great Hall of the People this evening, and was well received
by an enthusiastic audience including President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the performance, Jiang met with the orchestra's
president, Robert Jones, and musical director Leonard Slatkin,
and recalled watching them play during his visit to the U.S. in 1
997.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang said the Chinese people's appreciation of
symphony music is growing due to popularizing and education in
basic symphonic knowledge. He stressed the importance of the
current visit by the orchestra, saying its performances will help
deepen mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1931, the National Symphony Orchestra, whose home
base is the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in
Washington, has earned worldwide praise for its many overseas
tours, as well as for its seasons at home.
</P>
<P>
The orchestra regularly participates in events of national and
international importance, and often performs for presidential
inaugurations, and leads the nation in its annual Independence
Day and Memorial Day celebrations with nationally televised
outdoor concerts on the West Lawn of the White House.

Strings," and Berlioz's "Symphonic Fantastique," and was warmly
applauded.
</P>
<P>
The orchestra's current visit coincides with the 20th
anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between
China and the U.S. and President Jiang Zemin and President Bill
Clinton both wrote inscriptions to commemorate this performance.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Civil Servants Joining Politics to lose Govt Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's civil servants who
maintain their membership in political parties or pursue their
political activities will lose their structural posts in
government but will retain their status as civil servants, a
senior official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
These civil servants should thus report their membership in
political parties or their political activities within three
months after Government Regulation No. 5 takes effect, deputy
cabinet secretary Erman Rajagukguk told newsmen at the Bina Graha
presidential office.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie on Tuesday signed the regulation which
requires the country's civil servants to stay neutral during the
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the head of the Civil Servant Administration Agency,
Soenarko, said the state position mentioned in the regulation
includes director generals, lecturers and clerks of court.
</P>
<P>
He said those civil servants who do not report their membership
in political parties will be fired.
</P>
<P>
If a civil servant who is 56 years old and above fails to
report his political activities, he will not be dismissed but will
instead be forced into retirement and given his pension, the
regulation says.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also states that a civil servant who had joined
a political party and lost his government post could be
reactivated once he leaves the party.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Development Supervision/State
Administrative Reform Hartarto Sastrosoenarto said the new
regulation aims to create neutral bureaucrats in the country.
</P>
<P>
"It will also bar certain groups from using state facilities
(for the benefit of their political parties)," Hartarto stressed.
</P>
<P>
The law is part of sweeping political reforms launched by
Habibie after he took power on May 21 last year following the
downfall of his predecessor Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
During Soeharto's 32 years in power, 4.1 million civil servants
were automatically made members of the ruling Golkar party without
any choice.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will hold a multiparty general election on June 7
this year.

the statement.
</P>
<P>
It also said that Pakistan, Turkmenistan and other neighboring
countries should work together to facilitate the realization of
these objectives by promoting intra-Afghan dialogue and sending
joint missions to the war-ravaged country.

The two sides agreed that "the prevailing situation in
Afghanistan presented a unique opportunity for the establishment
of durable peace through the formation of a broad-based and
multi-ethnic government."

<P>
The early restoration of sustainable peace in Afghanistan will
open up enormous economic and commercial opportunities for the
entire region, said the statement, appealing to the international
community to come forward with generous assistance for the
rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Property Market to remain Weak in 1999: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's property market
is projected to have a downward swing this year with volume and
values of transactions by Malaysians and foreign investors likely
to drop by more than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
A survey carried out in October-November 1998 among developers,
public-listed companies, builders/contractors, professionals,
consultants, financiers, building material suppliers and
government agencies, showed that the lower projection was due to
the slow economic growth, the stock market scenario and a cautious
investment mood in the country, C. H. Williams Talhar and Wong, a
leading property consultant, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of those polled said the property market was
on its downward cycle, the company's Executive Director Goh Tian
Sui told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Goh said the survey revealed that capital values for all the
property sub-sectors, except for conventional and low-cost
housing, would fall by more than 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent of respondents and market analysts
projected a drop of more than 20 percent in the capital values of
office buildings, resorts, condominium and retail sub-sectors.
</P>
<P>
For conventional houses, 34 percent of the respondents believed
that capital values for this type of property would either
increase or stabilize, he said, adding that expectations for the
low-cost housing sub-sectors remain promising for this year.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of conventional housing and low-cost housing
sub-sectors, all other sub-sectors are viewed with concern due to
the surplus situation and the overall demand for this year's real
estate was expected to be very low especially for condominiums,
office and retail space, he said.

TOKYO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Several dozens of Japanese

Kyodo said.

The marines, stationed in Japan's southernmost Okinawa
Prefecture, flew to Olta on a chartered flight earlier in the

ANKARA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen U.S. warplanes
Wednesday took off again from Incirlik Air Base in Adana in
southern Turkey to patrol the no-fly zone in northern Iraq
Wednesday, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said six tankers, four transport planes and one
AWACS plane also took off from the base at hours between 11:00 and
12:00 a.m. (0900 and 1000 GMT).
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, seventeen U.S. fighter planes took off from
Incirlik and bombarded two radar units and one anti-aircraft
system in Mosul in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, the United States and its allies set up two no-fly zones
in southern and northern Iraq with a claimed aim of shielding the
Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad's
suppression.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British forces in the Gulf launched four consecutive
days of air strikes on Iraq in mid-December last year to retaliate
what they said Iraq's non-cooperation with the United Nations
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has delivered three Patriot missile batteries to
Incirlik base in case the situation in northern Iraq deteriorates."
</P>
<P>
There are 45 warplanes of the allied forces being stationed at
Incirlik as part of Operation Northern Watch to patrol the north
no-fly zone.

the past few years, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The CAS had about 5,500 papers listed in the three foremost
American scientific reference books, the Scientific Citation

of the Basic Research Department of the CAS.
</P>
<P>
Jin said that the authors of basic research papers published
abroad are mostly scientists aged between 40 and 50, and he hopes

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov Beats Martin to Advance to Semi-finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov
defeated American Todd Martin in Melbourne in four sets in the
quarter-finals of Australian Tennis Open on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The 10th seeded Russian took just 107 minutes to wipe the 15th
seeded Martin 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 6-2 to set up a semi-final showdown
with young German Tommy Haas.
</P>
<P>
For what was expected to be a closely fought battle between
the remaining two seeds in the men's draw, it was remarkably one
sided.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov broke Martin's serve twice in the opening set
during a five-game winning streak and dominated the second set
tie break.
</P>
<P>
Martin struggled early with his own serve and even when he
finally mastered that he couldn't break the Russian, having just
one break point in the first two sets and only two for the match.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov grabbed the initiative in the third set when he
broke Martin's serve in the opening game and again in the seventh
game.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Russian said he had worked hard on his serve
over the past few months and believed it would elevate him from a
one grand slam player (French Open 1996).
</P>
<P>
"I was very satisfied with my serve," Kafelnikov said.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on 1998, when he fell out of the end of year top 10
for the first time since 1994, he said it was one of the most
frustrating periods of his career because results didn't reflect
his ability.
</P>
<P>
He slipped six places last year to No.11 and was ranked No.10
in the world coming into the Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
Martin, who has had a tough road to the quarters with two
five-set clashes and a four-set match, said he could not think of
a worse opponent.
</P>
<P>
"He's the last player I wanted to meet in a quarter-final,"
Martin said.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Positive Domestic Factors Lead to Investment Growth in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment in China
scored an unexpected growth in 1998 both in terms of contractual
volume and materialized volume. The main reason: China's
favorable macro-investment environment, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) show that overseas investment in contractual
volume reached 52.132 billion US dollars, up 2.21 percent, the
first growth since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Arrived investment hit 45.582 billion US dollars, up 0.67
percent. The volume hits an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiuhong, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said in an interview with Xinhua on Wednesday that
the factor leading to the growth was mainly the favorable
macro-investment environment in China.
</P>
<P>
"While some Asian nations became unstable in their economic
and political situations, China has maintained political and
social stability, a continuous fast-growing economy and kept the
value of its currency stable," said Ma.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has pushed forward its reforms toward a
socialist market economy, and that is also an attractive factor
for overseas investors, she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the advantage in attracting overseas investment
brought about by the currency devaluation in some southeast Asian
nations was not realized because their economies remain mired in
the trough of decline.
</P>
<P>
As a result, investment into China from the European Union,
the United States and some free-port areas surged last year,
partly making up the decline from the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Contractual investment from the EU rose 39.8 percent, from the
United States 25.8 percent, and from a number of free-port areas,
29.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to use overseas investment in an "active,
reasonable and effective manner," said Shi Guangsheng, minister
of foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A series of positive policies have been or will be adopted
this year to encourage and woo overseas investment, according to
the minister.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that although China faces a tough situation in
1999, it stands a good chance of securing a relatively high level
of overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Attacks Capital of Angola's Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The forces of the rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) captured
Mbanza-Congo, capital of northern Angola's Zaire Province after
heavy artillery bombing early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Ludy Kissassunda, Governor of Zaire Province said in Soyo, an
important oil city , 200 kms west of Mbanza-Congo that the UNITA
forces engaged in a fierce fighting at 2:00 in the morning with
the government forces. The government lost its contact with the
city at 9:00 in the morning. He said that the UNITA military got
help from Congo (K) rebels and mercenaries from Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Kissassunda was quoted by Angola Daily as saying Wednesday that
the purpose of UNITA's attack on Mbanza-Congo, a city bordering
Congo (K), was to open up an international passage for its
much-needed logistic supply, and at the same time take the oil
city of Soyo with an aim to cut off the government's oil export, a
crucial source of supply for the government.
</P>
<P>
Soyo takes up about 40 percent of the total oil export of the
country. The government's main foreign currency income depends on
oil export.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pedro Sebastiao, Defense Minister of Angola, said at
a session of parliament recently that the situaltion in Angola,
which witnessed a "very dangerous period" in last December, has
passed the most difficult time now.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has drained about 70 percent of
UNITA's military resources during the fighting in central Angola's
Huambo and Kuito cities, capitals of Huambo and Bie provinces.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken control of the over-all situation
nationwide, Sebastiao said. But he said that he was still
concerned over the ever intensifying situation in northern and
eastern parts of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The government of Fujian
Province, east China, said today that it had 11.4 percent growth
in its gross domestic product (GDP) last year to 333 billion
yuan, well above the national average of 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
This meant a GDP of more than 10,000 yuan per capita,
according to Governor He Guoqiang.
</P>

He told the provincial people's congress that the high growth
was largely the result of capital investment which amounted to
104.85 billion yuan last year, a year-on-year rise of 16.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Fujian's revenues increased 12.2 percent to 18.76
billion yuan, which helped keep its budget balanced for the 14th
consecutive year, the governor said.

Incomes were up 5.6 percent among urban dwellers and 5.8
percent for rural people, while the overall retail price index
dropped an average of 1.5 percent.

"There has been a greater urgency to reduce Pak-India
tensions," Kanju said that the nuclearization of South Asia has
raised international concern over the situation in the reduction
and underscored the need to resolve the Kashmir issue as the root
cause of tension which has now become the nuclear flash point.

Replying a question on the forthcoming visit to Pakistan of
U.S. Deputy Security of State Strobe Talbott, Kanju said that
"Pakistan's national security will be prime concern while
discussing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."

<HEADLINE> China to Widen Opening in Service Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China has vowed to use more
overseas capital in such service sectors as commerce, foreign
trade, civil aviation and engineering project contracts.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shijia, director of the Department of Foreign Investment
Administration under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), made the remarks to the national conference
on foreign trade and economic cooperation here today.
</P>
<P>
Besides Shanghai and Shenzhen, the two main experimental
cities for retail joint ventures with overseas investors, the
number of cities approved for trading joint ventures will be
increased from the original eleven and a number of new ones will
be in central China or the west.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more airlines will be able to attract overseas
investment, and the ratio limit of overseas shares will be
relaxed.
</P>
<P>
More joint ventures in intermediary services, including
accounting and commodity and quality inspection, will be allowed,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
China will also encourage qualified Chinese companies to
establish joint ventures with big international companies for
contracting engineering projects overseas, especially in
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Though most of the opened-up service sectors in China are
still in the experimental stage, there will be a much wider
opening process this year.
</P>
<P>
Last week MOFTEC also announced it is to allow joint-venture
travel agencies, making tourism one of the latest important
sectors in China to open up.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Southwest China Mine Explosion Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A gas explosion in a private
coal mine in southwest China's Guizhou Province, which killed 35
people and injured eight others, was caused by sparks resulting
from a shattered electric light in the shaft, local investigators
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
They added that the mine's poor ventilation system and lax
monitoring of gas leaks were also to blame for the blast, which
occurred on January 16 in Hezhang County of Bijie Prefecture in
Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaojiachong Mine, opened in 1989 with joint investment
from five private businessmen, had only one 2.2-kw electric fan
to supply fresh air to the two mining sectors in the shaft, some
400 meters underground, said the investigators.
</P>
<P>
There were 87 miners working in the shaft when the accident
happened, and 42 escaped within five minutes of the explosion.
Ten more were rescued in the next 20 minutes, said an official
with the Hezhang County government.
</P>
<P>
In the following seven hours, rescuers found all the remaining
35 victims and removed their bodies from the shaft.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities quickly detained the five bosses of the mine
and ordered all local coal mines closed for safety checks. They
were told not to resume production unless they can prove they
have taken sufficient and reliable safety measures.
</P>
<P>
Two seriously wounded miners are now out of danger, while
several of the six other injured have completely recovered and
left hospital.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the prefecture and county governments are
making further investigations.

<P>
JAKARTA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The four factions in
Indonesia's House of Representatives (DPR) Wednesday agreed that
the number of Armed Forces' (ABRI) members at the central
parliament is 50 percent of the current number.
</P>
<P>
The next number of the ABRI faction's members at the central
parliament totaled 38, Chairman of DPR's Special Committee dealing
with a bill on political affairs Abu Hasan Sjazili told reporters
here after a five-hour meeting.

and district levels is 20 percent of the total number of seats.
</P>
<P>
On the system of the 1999 general election, Abu said some
agreements were reached.
</P>
<P>
Firstly they agreed that a proportional system would be applied
in the next general election.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, voting to determine the number of seats for the
political parties should be based on all the votes obtained at the
provincial level.
</P>
<P>
"This is a maximal result which accommodates various people's
aspirations," Abu added.
</P>
<P>
The long-debated draft bills on political parties, general
election and composition and position of the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR), DPR, regional and district legislative councils
are scheduled to be brought to DPR's plenary meeting on Thursday

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Group Calls to End Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- His Holiness Abune Paulos,
Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, called on the peoples
of Ethiopia and Eritrea to step up their efforts to seek a
peaceful settlement of the border dispute between the two
countries which erupted last May.
</P>
<P>
According to "the Ethiopian Herald" Wednesday, the call was
made by his Holiness upon his arrival here Tuesday after leading a
nine-member Ethiopian religious delegation from Frankfurt, Germany
where the second round of talks of religious delegations between
Ethiopia and Eritrea was held.
</P>
<P>
The Patriarch said the two peoples ought to "make peace, love
and fraternity, instead of enmity, between them because they had
gone through terrible hardships during the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
He said the objective of the two-day conference (on January
23-24, 1999) was to strengthen the peace talks between the
religious leaders of the two countries which was started in Oslo
in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions held between the two parties so far, although
not altogether fruitful, have helped bring one step forward the
peace-making process," he said, adding that "all concerned
citizens of the two countries should work in coordination to avert
the looming danger of full-scare war."
</P>
<P>
All conditions should be restored to the status quo before May
12, 1998. Not only the Ethiopian government but of other countries
and the international community have already endorsed the peace
proposals of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and have
demanded the unconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The next conference is believed to be held in the future, the
Patriarch said.

<HEADLINE> Lahore High Court Restores Foreign Currency Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Lahore High Court (LHC)
Wednesday restored private foreign currency accounts, declaring
the government's decision taken after the nuclear tests in May
last year to freeze them as "unconstitutional".
</P>
<P>
The decision has sent shock waves in the government circles in
view of earlier reports that the 11 billion U.S. dollar frozen
accounts were in fact utilized by the successive governments and
thus a freeze had only averted a banking sector's collapse for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
The federal government had put a freeze on 11 billion dollar
foreign currency accounts of private individuals and organizations
to prevent an anticipated capital flight from the country moments
after its nuclear test on May 28, 1988.
</P>
<P>
The government offered the foreign currency accounts holders to
draw their money in Pakistani rupee after which more than four
billion dollars of frozen foreign currency were either converted
into rupee or the government's newly launched dollar bonds by the
account holders.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar told a press conference last week
that up to January 22 a total of 4.55 billion dollars had either
been converted into Pak rupee or dollar bonds by the account
holders.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the verdict by LHC, Federal Attorney General
Chaudry Farooq said that the central government will challenge the
decision at the Apext Court.
</P>
<P>
"We are studying all legal aspects of the LHC verdict on
foreign currency," said Farooq.

BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China plans to produce six
million tons of edible fungus by 2010, Farmer's Daily reported

China is the world's largest producer of edible fungus, with

China's annual per capita consumption of fungus is a mere 0.2
kilograms, compared with 2-3 kilograms in the United States. To
promote fungus production, China will spend 973 million yuan on

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Announces Commission to Probe Anwar's Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian government has
decided to set up a commission of inquiry to probe injuries
suffered by former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim while in
police custody, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The government has decided to set up a commission of inquiry
into the cause of the `black eye' of Anwar," he told reporters at
a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the three-member commission would comprise former
chief justice of Malaya Anuar Zainal Abidin, Appeal Court judge
Mahadev Shankar and an unnamed orthopaedic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
Former attorney-general Abu Talib Othman would conduct the
inquiry, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the team was expected to come up with their report as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Anwar caused a stir when he appeared in court to face charges
on September 29 last year with a bruised left eye, igniting calls
for the government to set up a special independent body to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
Attorney-General Mohtar Abdullah in a statement on January 5
this year said police were responsible for injuries on certain
parts of Anwar's body sustained while he was under police custody.
</P>
<P>
Mohtar also directed a special police investigation team to
record statements from top-brass police officers including former
inspector-general of police Abdul Rahim Noor who resigned on
January 7 to assume full responsibility for Anwar's injuries.
</P>
<P>
The 51-year old Anwar was sacked as the deputy prime minister
and finance minister on September 2 last year and later charged
with five counts of committing corrupt practice and five counts
of sodomy charges.
</P>
<P>
Anwar is on trial on four of the charges in the High Court
since November 2 last year.

<HEADLINE> Officials Punished for Graft in Three Gorges Relocation Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen officials were
punished last year for embezzling funds from the relocation
program which is an essential part of the scheme to build the
Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest water conservancy and
hydropower project.
</P>
<P>
Investigations by the Anti-Corruption Bureau under the
Chongqing Municipal People's Procuratorate showed that the
officials, all at or under the township level, had
misappropriated a total of nearly 700,000 yuan (about 85,000 U.S.
dollars) from the relocation fund or accepted bribes.
</P>
<P>
Three of the cases involved more than 100,000 yuan, including
one in which a leather factory manager in Wanzhou Prefecture
exaggerated the volume of his factory's fixed assets by 100,000
yuan and put the money in his own pocket.
</P>
<P>
In another case, a deputy town magistrate misappropriated
106,800 yuan of the relocation fund and was sentenced to six

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian women run
greater risk of contracting cancer than men, according to deputy
health minister Tatu Mussa Ntimizi.
</P>
<P>
Official data showed that 1,425 people contracted cancer in the
year 1997, two thirds of whom are women, Ntimizi was quoted by
Daily Mail on Wednesday as saying.

The figure for women is exactly twice that of men, Ntimizi
Tuesday told a session of parliament in the central city of
Dodoma, adding that 94 percent of the group of women suffered from
cervical and breast cancers.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Calls for Fight Against Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian minister has
appealed to Indian Ocean rim countries to fight drug trafficking
which is fast taking root in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
"The impact of this illegal trade could be massive if it is
left unattended," the Minister of Communications and Transport,
Ernest Nyanda, was quoted by Wednesday's Daily News as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nyanda, who was addressing a function Tuesday in Dar es Salaam
to commemorate the 49th National Day of India, said that there
exists a booming drug trade across Indian Ocean which has expanded
in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
He called on countries in the Indian Ocean rim to control the
phenomenon, otherwise they will be drastically affected.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, said he is pleased to note that Tanzania
and India have been working closely in combating the illicit
trade.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Director of Criminal Investigation,
Adadi Rajabu, said some young Tanzanians managed to go to Far East
countries where drugs are very cheap and ferry them back to make
profit, which he said is a shame to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Rajabu said that the number of Tanzanian youths arrested and
jailed abroad increased from 22 in 1997 to 31 last year.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the year, four Tanzanian youths were
arrested upon arrival from Iran at Uganda's Entebbe International
Airport as the police found 1,480 grams of heroine packed in
pellets in their stomachs.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Parties Re-affirms Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a joint press conference in Lagos Tuesday, leaders of the
two parties restated their commitment to the alliance, despite
opposition from the third party, the People's Democratic Party
(PDP) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
</P>
<P>
"It is not decision we have taken lightly but with all sense of
 responsibility. We have agreed to come together because of the
imminent danger to political stability of the nation and our
ardent desire to establish a full-fledged democracy as opposed to
militarized democracy," a statement read out by APP Chairman
Mahmud Waziri said.
</P>
<P>
The statement alleged that Nigeria's efforts to establish true
civilian democracy can be easily defeated if the two parties fail
to ward off the imminent danger of a one-party totalitarian state.
</P>
<P>
It added that "we owe it to ourselves and to posterity to
prevent this calamity being inflicted on our nation."
</P>
<P>
The statement signed by both Waziri and his AD acting chairman
Ayo Adebanjo assured supporters of the two parties the workability
of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
According to the alliance arrangement, the two parties will
field joint candidates in both the legislative and presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
However, as the INEC has ruled out the possibility of a joint
presidential candidate by any parties, the issue of which party
shall have the presidency candidate has become a major concern for
supporters of both parties.
</P>
<P>
Former Senate leader and APP presidential aspirant Olusola
Saraki said Tuesday that his party would not concede the
presidency to the AD, if the alliance is going to work.
</P>
<P>
APP leader Waziri acknowledged that there is a stiff opposition
in his party to conceding the presidency to AD, but he assured
that the party has a way of resolving the issues internally.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's legislative and presidential elections would be held
on February 20 and 27, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Israel Asked to Enforce Software Piracy Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel is in danger of
losing U.S. commercial trade benefits if it doesn't begin
enforcing legislation for protecting intellectual property rights,
U.S. and Israeli piracy experts warned.
</P>
<P>
The United States might set a six-month deadline for Israel to
approve a new legislation on the intellectural property or face
trade sanctions, the daily Jerusalem Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Washington placed Israel on its "priority watch list" last
May, blaming the Israeli Knesset (parliament) for its repeated
failure to curb illegal use of intellectual property, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just a lack of will to make it go forward,"
U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Justice Ministry declined to comment on the issue, and
a senior aide to Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky said
he hasn't heard anything "official or unofficial" from
U.S. authorities with regard to the priority watch list.
</P>
<P>
According to the current legislation in Israel, anyone caught
violating property rights is subject to up to three years'
imprisonment and 1 million dollars of fine.
</P>
<P>
However, no one has been sentenced to jail for that reason in
the last 10 years, and fine certainly isn't a problem for those
companies earning 10,000 dollars a week by software piracy,
according to Ami Fleisher, an Israeli anti-piracy expert.

<HEADLINE> Record Number of Beijing Civil Servants Disciplined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A record number of civil
servants were brought to task in China's capital last year, with
the Beijing Municipal Personnel Bureau disclosing today that the
800 local government officials found guilty of misdemeanors was th
e highest number in five years.
</P>
<P>
Many were not qualified for the positions they held, others
had broken laws and regulations, and punishments ranged from
dismissal to demotion depending on the seriousness of the cases.
</P>
<P>
There are now over 100,000 public servants in Beijing, and the
municipal government has introduced a series of new laws and
regulations which it hopes will both inspire and encourage them
to work efficiently and effectively.
</P>
<P>
The bureau revealed that unsatisfactory performance and lack
of creativity were the reasons most of the 551 officials were
actually fired from their jobs last year.
</P>
<P>
Another 48 public servants were demoted for disobeying orders
from superiors, abuse of power for personal gain and dereliction
of duty. And five of 237 disciplined governmental officials were
at or above director level.

BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists recently
found an aerolite, a stony form of meteorite, at the South Pole
during their 15th trip to Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
They found it in an area they had never visited before. One
member of the 15th South Pole Exploration Team said that an
initial study showed it to be an iron meteorite but further study
is needed.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that aerolites contain a lot of information
about the history of the solar system and aerolites found here,
compared with the aerolites found in other parts of the world,
are of greater value because they are so well-preserved.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, a group of U.S. scientists said that an aerolite

</P>
<P>
Wu Xuyu, director of the city's Construction Committee,
announced that the city is planning to build an additional 55
million square meters of apartment blocks in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 24,000 families in the city are
experiencing housing difficulties, with each person sharing an
average four square meters of floor space. Many of them live in
shabby bungalows without bathrooms, toilets and running water in
traditional old "hutongs", or back alleys.
</P>
<P>
Wu revealed that 29,000 families moved into new flats last
year with the help of the government.
</P>
<P>
New policies now require citizens to purchase houses,
replacing the old mechanism in which accommodation was provided
mostly for free by the government. Bank loans for individual
citizens will play an important role in the future housing
improvement campaign, Wu added.

<HEADLINE> Phnom Penh Teachers Continue on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of teachers in
universities and secondary schools in Phnom Penh continued their
strike Wednesday despite the government's appeal to return to
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State for Education Pok Than appeared on state-run
television (TVK) Tuesday night, asking teachers to be patient to
wait for the solution by the government and go back to work.
</P>
<P>
"Take a pity upon our new government which is beginning
administrative and military reform in an effort to improve
education and health care," he said on TV.
</P>
<P>
"So I wish to appeal to all teachers and professors to perform
your teaching duties for the sake of the students, the young
people of our nation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Placards and posters were hanged on by the teachers at the
front gates of schools to press home their grouses and demands.
The signs say: "Teachers' stomachs are hungry" and "Teachers
strike non-violently for an appropriate salary."
</P>
<P>
The teachers had earlier been promised a five U.S. dollar
(20,000 riel) bonus per month but this was rejected by them who
wanted their salary to be adjusted to an average of about 300
dollars (1.2 million riel) per month from the current 15 to 20
dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
Many teachers complained that the riel value has dropped but
their wage remained the same for several years, so they had to
seek part-time jobs to earn extra income to make ends meet and to
feed their families.
</P>
<P>
There is a huge gap between the salaries of ministers and
parliamentarians (1,000-2,000 U.S. dollars) and that of teachers
and professors as well as civil servants (only 20 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some teachers said they will continue to strike until their
demand is met.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many students showed sympathy for their teachers.
Some said: " Our teacher's salary can not buy one bag of rice."
"As a student, I spend 40 U.S. dollars a month. Our teacher only
earns 20 dollars a month. How can he live by the salary?" one
student asked.
</P>
<P>
The strike has caused great concerns among many people as well
as the government that it would widen the gaps between the
teachers and other civil servants to cause social instability.
</P>
<P>
There are about 80,000 teachers in the whole country.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Develop Economic Relations With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 China's Mainland and HKSAR
</P>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain will further
strengthen its relations with China's mainland and the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) in the context of the "very
considerable changes which are taking place in China and the UK."
</P>
<P>
This was the point stressed by British Consul General in Hong
Kong Mr. Andrew Burns in his first ever address to the British
business community at a luncheon sponsored by the British Chamber
of Commerce in Hong Kong, under the title "Britain, China and Hong
Kong: Managing Changes in Educated Economies", here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fully recognizing the changes taking place in China and within
Hong Kong, the consul general said that "Britain is faced with an
increasingly and intensely competitive world in which a company's
assets are now its intellectual capital more than its physical
capital."
</P>
<P>
The British Government's strategy for long-term economic
success is to promote competition, education and innovation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The United Kingdom is by far the largest European investor in
China with over 12 billion U.S. dollars in contracted investment
so far and in more than two thousand joint ventures, he said. "But
Britain can and should be doing better with our exports," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We shall be mounting further trade fairs and exhibitions in
China, including strong British participation in the Kunming
Horticultural Expo.," he said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to relations with Hong Kong, he said that his
central concern is to get the political relationship with Hong
Kong right. "You can be fully assured that there is no turning
away from Hong Kong by Britain," he stated. "Hong Kong not only
remains an important element in our relationship with China. It is
an important partner in its own right. We do not see any tension
or contradiction between the two," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the structural change and adjustment going on in
Hong Kong, he said that he is confident that Hong Kong's
traditional strengths and robust fundamentals will reassert
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge for the SAR is to use this opportunity to
identify and encourage those sectors of the economy which are
likely to remain competitive and which should be further
developed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that British companies, working with this chamber and
with the consulate too, will be quick to spot the new
opportunities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the consul general also encouraged Hong Kong
companies to think about investing in the UK.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the UK by Hong Kong companies already covers a
wide variety of sectors including electronics, telecommunications,
clothing, food and drink and ship-building, he said.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia to Integrate Junior Middle and Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Minister of Education
Mohammad Ahmed Al-Rasheed said Saudi Arabia is considering the
integration of junior middle school and primary school education
into a basic stage.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference here on Tuesday, the minister said
about 170 scholars and experts from universities have been
exploring a developed school curricula to match with the
economic development in the country and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
At the basic stage of education, educational programs will be
designed to help students to engage in public life and seek
employment, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added his ministry has already implemented a recent decision
by the Council of Ministers to invite the private sector to
participate in the construction of schools under the
Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) system.
</P>
<P>
In Saudi Arabia, where illiteracy is rampant, one with a primary
school certificate might find a respected job in the past.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education budget constitutes about one fourth
of last year's state budget, indicating that Saudi Arabia is
devoting greater attention to the development of education.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Stock Prices Up Six Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The shares at Seoul stock market
rebounded six percent, or 33.97 points Wednesday, closing the day
at 565.20 and ending a six-day downward spiral due to investors'
buying spree brought over by good economic news.
</P>
<P>
A total of 191.16 million shares worth 1.59 trillion won (1.35
billion U.S. dollars) changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Gainers outnumbered losers at 598 against 200 while 72 other
shares remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts attributed the rebound to news that South
Korea's credit ratings are expected to be upgraded by Moody's
Investor Service in near future as J.P. Morgan's Tuesday forecast
that the South Korean economy would grow four percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the latest rebounds in the United States and Latin
American bourses also contributed to the rally at the Seoul stock
market while investors' sentiment was fueled by an unconfirmed
report that monetary authorities were seeking to lower the
central bank's repurchase rate to bring market interest rates
down further.
</P>
<P>
Analysts recommended that investors increase their purchases
of stocks on bargain hunting as the market is likely to rebound
further.

BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- "The University of National
Defense will enter the information age by nurturing more
open-minded military professionals to face challenges in the new
century," according to Major General Zhang Xingye.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, vice-president of the institution, said the 21st

In an interview with Xinhua today, he said the only way to

teaching philosophy.

The university has adopted a new instruction system based on
the information network which offers tactical options in
simulated battles, and modern military science and technology,
according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The University of National Defense, founded in 1985, has
trained high-ranking military professionals and officers, with
many of its graduates engaged in military science research.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the policy of opening education with frequent
inter-university and international academic exchanges has
revitalized the institution.

<P>
NAIRIBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Charles Mukora,
suspended from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) last
weekend, announced here Tuesday that he is ready to resign.
</P>
<P>
Mukora said he had served long enough and needed time to pursue
his own interests, without citing his being accused of taking two
million Shillings (33,300 U.S. Dollars) to support Salt Lake City
bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics as the reason.
</P>
<P>
Mukora, also chairman of the National Olympic Committee of
Kenya, can only get off the trouble if they manage to solicit
support from at least 70 of the remaining 106 IOC members at the
IOC's special congress in Lausanne on March 17-18.
</P>
<P>
IOC executive board member Kevan Gosper envisaged little or no
salvation at all for Mukora and five other members also charged
with taking bribes to back the Salt Lake bid.
</P>
<P>
However, Gosper, an IOC member since 1977, expressed remorse
over Mukora' s suspension, claiming Mukora has done a lot for the
development of sports in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old IOC President Antonio Samaranch has vowed not to
resign over the scandal that has rocked the Olympics body. He
said he would seek a vote of confidence from the committee's
session in March.

Times of Zambia newspaper Wednesday quoted Zimba as saying

"Zambia was represented when that decision was made. So
automatically, all borders are open," he said.

The lifting of the sanctions was expected to lead to an

Zambia, through which exports such as cement and sugar leave
Zambia.

The United Nations Security Council has asked for the lifting

<HEADLINE> No-Fly Zones in Iraq to Stay: Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain has said no-fly zones
over Iraq will continue to be an important humanitarian measure as
long as Baghdad regime remains a "threat" to its people, a local
paper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to police the no-fly zones. The Iraqi
government knows the rules of engagement. The no-fly zones serve
as important humanitarian measures that have widespread public
support", Kaleej Times Wednesday quoted British Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs Derek Fatchett as saying in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett was speaking to reporters at the end of a
two-day visit to the U.A.E. and before leaving for Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been challenging the no-fly zones, but Fatchett said
that without the no-fly zones, thousands of people in northern
and southern Iraq will have less security and will have to endure
more suffering under Saddam Hussain.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for a united front by five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council to help forge a fresh
consensus toward resolving the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two key issues that the U.N. Security Council will have to
focus on are how to achieve disarmament and how to alleviate the
sufferings of the Iraqi people, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iraqi crisis, the Lockerbie dispute with Libya and
Iran are among the issues discussed during meetings he held
in Abu Dhabi with top U.A.E. officials.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett, who arrived in the U.A.E. from Egypt, said his visit
is part of a broader British diplomatic effort in the region that
will include a visit shortly by British Defense Secretary George
Robertson.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Civil Servants Get Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Federal civil servants in Nigeria
will get 3,000 Naira (35 U.S. Dollars) as minimum monthly salary,
starting from January 1999, media reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, a circular to the effect was signed
Tuesday by Owelle Chikelu, chairman of the National salaries,
Incomes and Wages Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government had raised minimum salary of federal
civil servants from 800 Naira (nine Dollars) to 5,200 Naira (60
Dollars) last September.
</P>
<P>
The new salary soon sparked off a national labor unrest, as
state civil servants began to demand the same salary while state
governments insisted that they did not have the resources to do
so.
</P>
<P>
It was soon found out that even the federal government could
not afford the new salary, as the slump in the international oil
prices has greatly reduced the revenue base of the government,
which depends on oil export for more than 80 percent of its
budgetary income.
</P>
<P>
It is presumed that the reviewed 35-Dollar minimum wage is a
result of negotiations between the government and labor unions in
the past weeks.

JERUSALEM, January 27 (Xinhua) - The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Knesset (Parliament) is expected to approve the
appointment of Moshe Arens as defense minister later Wednesday.
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak has expressed support for Arens,
saying he is a worthy candidate.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Reform leaders in Israel said Tuesday night they will fight
the new Religious Councils law by instructing non-Orthodox Jews
abroad to withhold donations from those Knesset members who
supported the law.
</P>
<P>
The law, which was approved by a 50-49 vote in the Knesset
Tuesday, aimed to keep non-Orthodox representatives off religious
councils in the country.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday the
decision by Jordan's King Hussein to name his eldest son Prince
Abudullah to replace his brother Hassan as the heir should not
affect Amman's relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I neither see nor expect any reason...for that relationship to
change at all," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt Urged to Probe Alleged Arms Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Two parliament members from
Zambia's ruling party Tuesday urged the Zambian government to
investigate Angola's recent allegation that Zambia is supplying
arms to Angola's rebels.
</P>
<P>
The two members said that the government should not treat the
allegation lightly of arms shipment to the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) but to probe the matter for
the safety of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
They said the country's security is at stake and could not be
left to speculation hence the need for the matter to be thoroughly
investigated.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Mukupa said in parliament that any government official
found to be involved should be fired.
</P>
<P>
Private individuals should have their licenses withdrawn and
they should be tried.
</P>
<P>
Regretting the escalating conflicts in the region, particularly
Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo, he said this should
serve as a lesson to Zambia to maintain the dialog spirit and not
resort to arms when dealing with its own internal problems.
</P>
<P>
Jerry Muloji was concerned that the government is taking a low
profile over Angola's accusation.
</P>
<P>
he said it would be difficult to dispute claims that the
Zambian air space is being used to airlift arms to UNITA because
there is an airport near Zambezi motel which the government is
running.
</P>
<P>
"We are told that aircraft are seen landing at night, then
which airport are they using?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
He said there is information that a businessman is transporting
arms into Angola and if that is true he should be exposed.
</P>
<P>
Muloji said the government should investigate and tell the
nation the truth about the Angolan situation to avert a
catastrophe in Zambezi bordering Angola.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Ready to Meet Rebel Leaders as Fighting Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada is willing to meet with rebel leaders in Mindanao, the
southern Philippines, and a neutral team is probing the cause of
the fighting there, senior government officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The quick response team, which is a neutral body approved by
the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
panels, is probing the incident," National Security Adviser
Alexander Aguirre said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He assured the public that the government is rushing to stem
the fighting between government troops and the MILF in Mindanao,
which started Saturday last week.
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora
said President Joseph Estrada is resolved to undertake all efforts
to personally negotiate peace with the MILF hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said Estrada is willing to meet with the leaders of the
MILF during his visit to Mindanao next month.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre reiterated that the government would never declare
martial law or any curfew in the area, saying it would rather
enhance the capability of government troops there.
</P>
<P>
Government peace panel chairman Orlando Soriano is now in
Mindanao to meet with officials of the military and the MILF, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Various government agencies in the area are coordinating with
the military in helping residents evacuate from affected areas, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching Aguirre's office indicate that the fighting
between the government and MILF has affected several towns in the
south.
</P>
<P>
Officials of both sides accused other of starting the violence
in the area.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt Urged to Control Farm Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambia National Farmers Union
(ZNFU) has urged the government to control imports on agricultural
produce and reduce duty on equipment in the 1999 budget to
strengthen the sector.
</P>
<P>
Acting Executive Director of ZNFU Songowayo Zyambo said in a
statement released in Lusaka Tuesday that "For our agricultural
industry to grow, the agro-processing industries have to be viable
in order for them to take up primary farm produce. What is
happening now is that our agro-processing industries are not
selling and are almost dead resulting into a situation where they
are unable to take up produce from farmers."
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's Times of Zambia newspaper quoted Zyambo as saying
that import duty on tractors and other agricultural implements
should be removed and farmers allowed to reclaim value added tax.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the government to pump more funds on improvement
of rural infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
" We expect government to treat rent on agriculture land, rural
 eletrification levy and water right charges as costs which should
be tax deductible," he said.

<HEADLINE> Marshall-Plan Style Program for Troubled Indonesia: Opposition Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Australian federal opposition
leader Kim Beazley Wednesday called for a Marshall Plan-style
reconstruction program for troubled Indonesia in the wake of riots
on its eastern islands.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Indonesia was now a major problem for
Australia," Beazley was quoted by Australian Associated Press as
saying in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian military Wednesday said the death toll from
almost a week of religious unrest on the eastern island of Ambon
had increased to 60, with other reports placing the death toll at
more than 100.
</P>
<P>
There were similar problems throughout Indonesia, driven by a
crisis of confidence in the political processes that has emerged
in the post Suharto era, Beazley said.
</P>
<P>
"I've called before for a Marshall Plan for Indonesia, with the
underpinnings in ... a decent return to law and order and economic
security."
</P>
<P>
The Marshall Plan was formulated by the United States
government to aid the economic recovery of Europe after World War
II.
</P>
<P>
If any country was going to help in organizing such a plan it
was Australia, Beazley said.
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't be able to provide the resources ourselves -
they'd have to come from wealthier countries than us, but at least
we'd have the motive, the knowledge and the capacity to put in
place the organization of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, of course, we must keep pressure on those in
authority in Indonesia to protect populations," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Beazley also mentioned about the opposition foreign
affairs spokesperson Laurie Brereton's intention to visit
Indonesia, saying Indonesia should see the visit to East Timor as
a friend willing to help that country.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia told Brereton it was not convenient for him to visit
East Timor at the moment, because of "the current unruly behavior
of the pro-referendum elements in East Timor".
</P>
<P>
Beazley said it was the second time that Brereton had been
refused entry to Timor "and that's a bad thing".
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the Indonesian government will see that Laurie
Brereton will want to go there as a friend, concerned to secure
the best possible transition arrangements to some form of autonomy
for that province."
</P>
<P>
"We will keep making representations in relation to our
spokesperson's bid to be able to have a look at what is going on
and it will be a matter of ongoing concern to us," he said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Communication Industry Shows Strong Growth for 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Australia's communications
industry showed strong growth in research and development and a
doubling of capital investment in 1998, a survey released
Wednesday showed.
</P>
<P>
Acting Communications Minister Peter McGauran said the 1998
communications industry pulse survey enabled industry and
government to gain valuable insight into the current state of the
industry, including the challenges and potential for growth.
</P>
<P>
"The 24 percent increase in research and development and the 99
percent increase in capital investment reflect a high level of
confidence in the future competitiveness of the industry,"
McGauran said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The survey found the industry (excluding telecommunications
carriers) achieved total sales of 10.7 billion Australian dollars
(6.85 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998, export sales of 2.1 billion
Australian dollars (1.35 billion U.S. dollars), up 36 percent from
1997.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of sales to South-East Asian nations fell from
36 to 25 percent but this was compensated by the share of sales to
Western Europe growing from nine to 19 percent and to North
America from eight to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications carriers achieved a 20 billion Australian
dollars (12.8 billion U.S. dollars) net turnover.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Stresses Cooperation with WIPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking during a meeting with WIPO Director-General Kamil
Idris and his party, Jiang said China's intellectual property
rights protection efforts have developed rapidly over the past 20
years. He noted that the three pillars of the related legal
system center on the protection of patents, trademarks and
publishing rights.
</P>
<P>
China has formed a domestic IPR legal protection system and
has fulfilled all related international obligations, said Jiang,
adding the nation's sphere and level of protection have met all
international requirements, and that China has optimized its law
enforcement system.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that China attaches great importance to
its cooperation with the WIPO and has maintained sound
cooperative relations with the organization. He also spoke highly
of the effective consultations the WIPO provided during China's
preparations to draft IPR protection laws and regulations, as
well as its active role in disseminating information and training
personnel.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president expressed appreciation for the efforts
Idris has extended to promote relations between the WIPO and
China. He also expressed hope that the WIPO will play an even
bigger role in further rationalizing and establishing IPR
protective system as an integral component of a new world
political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
Idris said China has exerted tremendous effort in IPR
protection and has attracted worldwide attention by establishing
a solid protection network in a relatively short period of time.
</P>
<P>
China, an important member of the WIPO, continues to play a
significant role in the comprehensive IPR protection system, said
Idris, adding that his organization is ready to expand
cooperation with China and set up the country's protection
network as a worldwide model.
</P>
<P>
The WIPO, headquartered in Geneva, is an intergovernmental
organization under the United Nations. The organization is
responsible for of promoting intellectual property protection
worldwide. The WIPO currently has 170 member nations..
</P>
<P>
China joined the organization in 1980 and has participated in
12 treaties under its jurisdiction.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka International Leather Fair '99 Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The three-day-long Dhaka
International Leather Fair '99 began here Wednesday with the
objective to highlight the quality of local leather and leather
products to boost their exports.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurated by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the fair was
jointly organized by the Export Promotion Bureau and the
Bangladesh Finished Leather and Leather Goods Exporters
Association (BFLLGEA).
</P>
<P>
As many as 73 companies, of them 59 are local and 14 foreign
ones, took part in the fair, the first one held in this South
Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The participating countries include India, Italy, Australia,
Singapore, Pakistan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh started the export of leather goods in 1990-91
fiscal year and earned 2.84 million U.S. dollars. But after seven
years, the total earnings from exports of leather and leather
goods went up to 237.91 million dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal
year, covering 6.5 percent of the country's total export earnings.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over 200 tanneries employing about 65,000
people, and about 500,000 people are engaged in the leather trade.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of the leather sector is attributed to
the hard efforts made by the Bangladeshi government, which has
identified the sector as a thrust of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh exports about 150 to 180 million square feet of
finished and crushed leather every year to major buyers like
Italy, France, Spain, Brazil, China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Export of finished leather, leather goods and footwear could be
raised to about 20 to 40 billion taka (412.4 to 824.8 million
dollars) from about 11.5 billion taka (237.9 million dollars) if
the BFLLGEA members are given expected incentives requested for,
according to BFLLGEA Chairman M.A. Sattar Bhuiyan.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Textile Industry Reports Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's textile industry,
which has suffered from overstaffing and inefficiency for years,
reported nearly 300 million yuan of profits last year despite the
negative impact of the lingering Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Its total output topped 12 billion yuan, with exports
approaching one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This was the second year the industry had made profits since
hauling itself out of the red in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attribute the change in fortune mainly to the
dramatic restructuring of the industry nationwide and scientific
and technological progress.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China started a three-year reform program to help
the textile industry become profitable. Under the program,
outdated machinery and equipment, including a total of 10 million
of the country's 46 million spindles in cotton mills, are
expected to be scrapped in a bid to cut down production capacity
and increase efficiency ever further.
</P>
<P>
As part of the program, Shanghai last year scrapped 703,000 out
moded spindles and as a result reduced its textile workforce by
96,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it consolidated three major listed textile
companies by issuing 235 million more shares, raising capital of
1.05 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The city also injected 800 million yuan, including 110 million
yuan from abroad, into technological innovation and have since
developed more than 3,000 types of new products, including
special textiles for use in car interiors.

<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The repayment order for
creditors of the bankrupt Guangdong International Trust and
Investment Corp.(GITIC) will be decided by the court, Dai
Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC),
announced today.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference here that GITIC filed for
bankruptcy to the Guangdong Higher People's Court which has
received the case.
</P>
<P>
Dai disclosed that a meeting attended by creditors, debtors
and the court will be convened in late April to discuss the pr
ocedure of the repayment.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the repayment will be dealt with in a
legitimate, open and fair manner and the interests of the
creditors will be guaranteed in accordance to law.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy of GITIC will not affect the stability of the
yuan and China's financial market, he said, adding that he hoped
the case will not affect the confidence of overseas investors in
China either.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy of GITIC is the first case of its kind in China,
which shows that China is stepping up supervision and management
over the financial market, a move that has met with positive
response from international financial institutions and famous
bankers, he said.

<HEADLINE> Assembly Debates on Senate Bill Postponed in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The debate on a
controversial and long-awaited draft law to establish Cambodia's
new Senate was postponed, due to concerns that the parliament
could not muster a quorum.
</P>
<P>
Heng Samrin, acting president of the Assembly, confirmed the
delay of the debate which was scheduled for Wednesday, but gave no
new date for the debate.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to create the Senate was reached by FUNCINPEC and
the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) in November last year and was
widely seen as a political necessity to break the political
impasse which eventually led to the formation of the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
However, progress towards forming the Senate has been slow and
it was not clear whether the draft bill would gain enough support
to be passed by a two-third majority necessary to amend the
Constitution if the quorum was reached.
</P>
<P>
It was reported here that there is still some disagreement over
two issues: how much power the proposed Senate should have and how
its members should be chosen.
</P>
<P>
The draft calls for the Senate, which could have as many as 61
members, to act as coordinator between the Council of Ministers
and the National Assembly, but FUNCINPEC party was against the
role.
</P>
<P>
Heng Samrin, however, denied the delay had something to do with
reported discord in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Some believed that the debate should proceed to finally create
the Senate as this has been agreed upon by the FUNCINPEC and the
CPP.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Sets Unit Cotton Output Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Production and
Construction Corps, China's largest state farm, raised its 1998
unit cotton output to 104 kg.
</P>
<P>
The corps, headquartered in northwestern China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, is the nation's largest agricultural,
industrial, commercial and trade enterprise, with 90 percent of
its employees engaged in agricultural production and management.
</P>
<P>
The state designated the corps as one of China's major cotton
production units in 1995. The corps has since developed cotton
production as its pillar industry and has set a goal of producing
500,000 tons of cotton annually by the turn of century.
</P>
<P>
The corps, which has a cotton-growing history of move than 40
years, raised cotton on 350,000 ha in 1998, with the year's total
output hitting 550,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Output for over 50 percent of the corps cotton fields
surpassed 100 kg, with the highest output reaching 200 kg. Local
agronomists note the rarity of such a high cotton output on large
tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, the nation's leading cotton producer, currently
accounts for 25 percent of China's total cotton output. The
Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps accounted for about 40
percent of the region's total cotton output in 1997.

<HEADLINE> RCA Countries to Formulate Nuclear Instrument Project in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of some member
countries of the Regional Cooperative Agreement (RCA) for Nuclear
Science and Technology are meeting here to formulate a project to
promote the capabilities for repair and maintenance of nuclear
instruments.
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting, jointly sponsored by the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Department of Atomic Energy of
the Myanmar Ministry of Science and Technology, began on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are representatives of RCA member
countries -- Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The project was proposed by the IAEA for cooperation
specifically designed to meet the needs of the RCA member
countries.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Myanmar Deputy Minister for Science and
Technology Thura Aung Ko admitted that his country has had
setbacks in promoting nuclear science although it started quite
early in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar made fresh efforts for the development and application
by establishing the Ministry of Science and Technology in 1996,
and setting up the Department of Atomic Energy as a new
directorate in 1997, getting more and more involved in
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Despite not achieving so much progress in nuclear science and
technology, Myanmar has been able to introduce nuclear application
in important areas, assisted by the IAEA, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He cited nuclear radiation application introduced in the
country for promoting agriculture, for an ongoing program for new
varieties of crops particularly peas, beans and paddy, using the
method of radiation induced mutations, and for disease diagnosis
in animals to obtain the best feeding strategies.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, representatives of IAEA also recounted
experience of the projects carried out in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar became an RCA member in 1994 and hosted the 19th RCA
Working Group Meeting for the first time in March 1997, attended
by delegates from 17 RCA member states.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Faces Shortage of Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The recruitment of untrained
teachers which was expected to have been completed a week ago has
not started and thousands of pupils in Zimbabwe are unlikely to
have lessons during the first half of this term, an official has
said.
</P>
<P>
Acting Secretary of the Education Ministry Francis Pasipanodya
was quoted by Wednesday's daily Herald as saying Tuesday that over
7,000 teaching posts have so far been confirmed as vacant.
</P>
<P>
He said the recruitment of untrained teachers to fill the posts
is now expected to begin next month if the head count is completed
in time. Some schools, especially in the remote areas, did not
open this term while others opened with only a few teachers.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of untrained teachers were dismissed last month as
part of measures by the government to stop the problem of ghost
teachers. But trained teachers have failed to fill the vacant
posts, forcing the ministry to recruit untrained staff again.
</P>
<P>
By January 15, the ministry had established that 6,850 posts in
both primary and secondary schools were still vacant. Up to 6,180
vacant posts were in primary schools.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Predicts 3 Pc Economic Growth for This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Treasurer Bill
Birch is predicting a speedier-than-expected economic rebound in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a Wellington business audience Tuesday night, Birch
said New Zealand's economic growth would reach three percent in
the year to March next year, nearly double the 1.6 percent rise in
gross domestic product forecast by the Treasury last month, the
Dominion reported.
</P>
<P>
"That scenario means we would only have one year of small
deficit," Birch was quoted as saying by the Wellington-based
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Treasury predicted in December that the country
will have three years of deficit before a return to a tiny surplus
in 2001-2002.
</P>
<P>
Birch said the Government would run a budget surplus again this
year, rather than dipping 52 million NZ dollars (28 million U.S.
dollars) into the red as predicted in December.
</P>
<P>
"In a nutshell, the prospects for 1999 are very good," he said.

<HEADLINE> NZ Business Confidence at Highest for 18 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand businesses are
confident that the country's economy is turning the corner and,
for the first time in 18 months, they believe better times lie
ahead.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey of business opinion for the fourth
quarter of 1998 released Wednesday by the New Zealand Institute of
Economic Research, a net 19 percent of firms now expect the
general business situation to improve during the next six months.
</P>
<P>
That compares with the third quarter survey in which a net 20
percent of firms expected worse conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Optimists now outweigh the pessimists across all sectors," the
 institute said. "Even after adjusting for seasonal variations,
there has been a clear turnaround in confidence."
</P>
<P>
Much of the improvement appears to have been driven by a
resumption of export growth, according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
It said export sales have increased during the last two
quarters, and the outlook is for that export growth to strengthen.
</P>
<P>
"A good export performance is a precondition for a recovery in
economic growth, and these latest survey results suggest that the
recovery is, in fact, under way," the institute said.
</P>
<P>
"We may see a further rise in business confidence over coming
quarters," it predicted.

BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic
Committee (IOC) President Juan Antonio Samaranch has sent Nagano
a letter asking for details of any improper acts by IOC members
during Nagano's bidding for the 1998 Winter Olympics, Japan's
Kyodo News Agency reported on Tuesday.

A draft letter from Samaranch asking for "a full and candid

wrongdoing has reached officials in Nagano and the Japanese
Olympic Committee, Kyodo reported from Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
One question raised in the letter, which asks for a response
by January 31, is whether any IOC member accepted "excessive
hospitality" including multiple visits to the host candidate
city, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Two IOC members implicated in the Salt Lake City bribery
scandal -- Anton Geesink of the Netherlands and Agustin Arroyo of
Ecuador -- also visited Nagano on numerous occasions before it
was chosen as the host site of 1998 Winter Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Airlines in NZ Plan to Cash in on Millennium Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Air New Zealand and other
airlines operating in New Zealand, which claims to be the first
country greeting the arrival of the new century, plan to cash in
on millennium celebrations by increasing fares to New Zealand by
up to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Wednesday
that Air New Zealand is charging 5,443 NZ dollars (about 2,940
U.S. dollars) for a return economy fare from Britain next
December, 1,004 NZ dollars (543 U.S. dollars) or 22 percent more
than last December.
</P>
<P>
Other major airlines, including Qantas, British Airways and
Cathay Pacific, are understood to be charging a similar fare, NZPA
said.
</P>
<P>
Kerry Marshall of NZ Taskforce 2000, a group promoting New
Zealand as a millennium destination, was quoted as saying
travelers might be put off by the high fares.
</P>
<P>
But Air New Zealand spokesman Alistair Carthew said the airline
is not ripping people off, but has increased its prices because
people "are prepared to pay more."
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Tourism Minister Murray McCully was quoted as
warning the New Zealand tourism industry to be "careful."
</P>
<P>
"People will remember if they feel they have been ripped off,"
he said.

residents used for living expenses was 5,913 yuan, while the
average per capita net income of peasants and herdsmen was 1,085
yuan. By the end of 1997 bank savings deposits of both urban and
rural people in Tibet were 3.045 billion yuan, while in 1991 they
had been only 510 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the average amount of grain owned by each Tibetan was
372 kg, an increase of 28 percent over 1991. Though the
population in 1996 was 2.5 times that in the early 1950s, the
amount of grain per capita in Tibet was three times that in the
early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the average per capita consumption of meat in Tibet
was 48.6 kilograms, an increase of 17.2 percent compared to 1991.
From 1991 to 1996, the average per capita consumption of
vegetables by urban dwellers in Tibet had increased by 26 percent
and that of edible oil by 14.5 percent. Consumption of eggs and
of sweets and cakes also increased by 1.1 and 3.2 times
respectively over the same period.
</P>
<P>
The peasant and herdsman households own large amounts of means
of production, and the average fixed assets for production
purpose are worth more than 8,000 yuan per household. There are
nine motor vehicles, six big or small tractors, three threshing
machines and 12 horse-drawn carts per 100 households.
</P>
<P>
The numbers of electrical household appliances and other durab
le goods are increasing each year in urban families. In 1996
there were 107 color TV sets, 96 washing machines, 68
refrigerators, 38 cameras, 68 motorcycles and 188 bicycles per
100 urban families -- all these figures being substantial
increases compared to 1991.

According to statistics of the old local government of Tibet,
about 90 percent of the Tibetan population had no residential
houses of their own in 1950, but now, except for people living in
a small number of pastoral areas, all families have their own p
ermanent houses.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to 1995 the per capita living space of rural and
urban people increased, respectively, from 18.9 sq m to 20 sq m
and from 11 sq m to 14 sq m. According to surveys of the middle
valleys of the Yarlungzangbo, Lhasa and Nyangqu rivers, some of
the peasant families have enough surplus grain to last them for
up to three years. Moreover, in some townships 90 percent of the
peasant families have built new houses.
</P>
<P>
In 1952 the average grain yield per mu (one ha equals 15 mu)
was only 80 kg in Tibet and there were only 125 kg of grain per
person. In the old days Tibet had almost no industry in the
modern sense of the word, and in fact in 1950 it only had one
bunkhouse of a mint and one 125 kw hydropower station that
generated power only off and on. At that time there were only 120
workers in the whole of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Even so, more than 95 percent of the social wealth was
concentrated in the hands of the three major categories of feudal
lords -- government officials, nobles and senior monks, who
accounted for less than five percent of the population of Tibet,
and the common people, who accounted for 95 percent of the
population, were extremely poor.
</P>
<P>
Before the Democratic Reform in 1959 the population of Lhasa,
the capital of Tibet, was just over 20,000, of whom some 1,000
households were impoverished or begged their living in the
streets. Now this situation will never appear again in Tibet.

<P>
DHAKA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government has
decided to raise the international postal rates by 25 percent,
effective from March after gazette notification, to raise earnings
and to reduce the loss in the Postal Department.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, which
also decided to raise the registration charges for both the inland
and the international postal services by 50 percent, the
English-language The Bangladesh Observer daily newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Inland postal charges will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
When the increased postal rates are effective, some 25 million
taka (about 515,000 U.S. dollars) is expected to be added each
year to the gross earnings of the Postal Department, which is
currently incurring loss amounting to 150 million taka (about 3.09
million dollars) a year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> US Announces Aid for Thailand's Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has
announced restructuring aid funds worth 10 million U.S. dollars to
help accelerate Thailand's recovery from the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The funds are part of the U.S. government Accelerating Economic
Recovery in Asia (AERA) program that was first proposed by Vice
President Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeline Albright during
November's Kuala Lumpur APEC meetings, Wednesday's Nation
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has allocated funds totaling 35 million dollars for
crisis-stricken Asia in 1999. The funds will quickly bring
assistance to the financial and economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
In the program, crucial restructuring initiatives will be
supplied in cooperation with the private sector. As the first
step, the 10 million dollars will be used to support two principal
objectives.
</P>
<P>
The first objective is to step up Thailand's economic recovery,
by providing expertise and training for bank and cooperate
restructuring, and for recovering non-performing loans, particular
from small and medium companies.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing U.S. ambassador to Thailand William Itoh told the
Nation that the AERA aid and the 1.7-billion-dollar economic
assistance that was provided by the U.S. government in 1998 will
help remove the belief that the U.S. did not stand by Thailand in
its moment of need.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has obviously been one of Thailand's closer
friends for many years. It invested more than 1.2 billion dollars
of U.S. taxpayers' money in aid programs over the last 45 years,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed, 300 Injured in Bangladesh Hartal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and at
least 300 others were injured in Bangladesh on Tuesday during the
opposition-sponsored dawn-to-midnight hartal, press reports here
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed in Jessore, about 150 kilometers
southwest of here, and one was killed in the capital during the
18-hour countrywide shut-down observed by the opposition alliance,
led by the major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
</P>
<P>
At least 300 people were injured in clashes between pro-hartal
and anti-hartal activities, many of them in bomb blasts and from
gun shots at different cities and towns across the country.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 police and Bangladesh Rifle personnel were
posted at strategic points in the capital city on Tuesday to
maintain law and order, and 166 pickets were picked up in the
city.
</P>
<P>
Road communications of Dhaka with the rest of the country were
paralyzed during the hartal hours.
</P>
<P>
The opposition organized the hartal on Tuesday, the day for
submitting nomination papers for the municipal elections scheduled
for late February, to protest against the government's rejection
of their four-point demand for joining in the polls.
</P>
<P>
The demand included resignation of the chief election
commissioner, reorganization of the commission, distribution of
voters' identity cards before the elections, and stopping
harassing opposition workers and leaders.
</P>
<P>
Despite the strike, some 8,450 candidates filed nominations for
the elections on Tuesday, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Election officials would scrutinize the nomination papers on
Wednesday, and the elections would be held on February 23-25.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Beats Pierce in Two Sets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis beat France's
Mary Pierce in straight two sets in the quarter final of the
Australian Tennis Open in Melbourne on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, the No.2 seed, took just 76 minutes to stroll into the
semi-finals, clinching her berth with a 6-3, 6-4 win.
</P>
<P>
The defending champion will meet Monica Seles in the
semi-finals, after Seles downed Steffi Graf 7-5, 6-1 earlier on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
For Pierce, the No.7 seed and the 1995 champion, it was a
third successive loss to Hingis in Melbourne -- and it came in
the same round as last year.
</P>
<P>
Hingis' win leveled the head-to-head record between the pair
at 5-5, but Pierce's first three wins came when the Swiss girl
was only 14-years-old.
</P>
<P>
"I was a kid then and she was killing me," said Hingis, 18.
</P>
<P>
Hingis breezed through the opening set in 32 minutes but in
the second set Pierce clung on, saving three match points before
relinquishing the match when a service return flew beyond the
baseline.
</P>
<P>
Hingis was prepared for this match by her tough three-setter
against South African Amanda Coetzer in the fourth round, the
first match in which she had dropped a set this tournament.
</P>
<P>
"I was attacking her serve very well and had some great
returns on the line," Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
"She was standing so far off the middle I had open lines and I
went for them."
</P>
<P>
Pierce said she decided to stand wide when serving to try to
create a sharper angle for her shots.
</P>
<P>
She said unforced errors - 26 to Hingis' 17 - were the main
reason for her loss, but she was also troubled by a pulled
stomach muscle and a head cold.
</P>
<P>
"To beat her you have to be at the top of your game 100
percent which I wasn't," Pierce said.
</P>
<P>
"She was just hitting some great shots and I didn't have
enough power in my shots," the french player said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Brazilian Soccer Coach to Go Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Sebastiao Araujo
will go back home after his contract with the Hong Kong Football
Association (HKFA) expires in the end of May, it was announced
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
HKFA chairman Victor Hui Chun-fui said last night after a
three-hour meeting that they decided to part company with the
Brazilian coach, who was once an assistant coach with the
Brazilian national squad.
</P>
<P>
"Soccer was not included in the Hong Kong focal events and
therefore we cannot afford to spend such a large amount on a
coach, especially in our current financial situation," said Hui.
</P>
<P>
Soccer is the most favorable sport in Hong Kong, but the Hong
Kong SAR's squad is getting weaker and weaker recently.
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old Araujo, who took charge of the Hong Kong team
in 1997, signed a 4.20 million HK dollar contract, which also
paid for his assistant, last May.
</P>
<P>
"He (Araujo) will continue to coach the Olympic squad until
his term ends in May, " Hui added.
</P>
<P>
Araujo said he was aware that his contract would not be
renewed but was not disappointed.
</P>
<P>
Hui revealed that the HKFA had appointed its technical
executive Tsang Wai-chung to assist Araujo with Hong Kong SAR's
Olympic squad, who will begin their qualifying campaign for the
2000 Sydney Olympics in June.
</P>
<P>
Under Araujo's coaching, the Hong Kong SAR squad have not got
a single win in nearly one year and subsequently the Brazilian
fell out of favor with the HKFA following his team's disastrous
performance at the Asian Games in Bangkok last December.

<HEADLINE> EDS-updated China to Keep Yuan Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank today
ruled out the possibility of devaluing the country's currency,
Renminbi yuan, in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government will continue to adhere to the policy
of keeping the exchange rate of yuan stable," Dai Xianglong,
governor of the People's Bank of China, told a press conference
here this morning.
</P>
<P>
He refuted the rumors on the international financial market
about a possible devaluation of yuan in recent days, saying that
"different economists have different views, but there is only one
Chinese government that decides on national policies."
</P>
<P>
"China didn't devalue its currency during the crucial period
of the Asian financial crisis and now it is all the more
unnecessary to make a devaluation," the governor said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's sound economic strength and a favorable
balance sheet of international payments have laid a solid
foundation for keeping the yuan stable.
</P>
<P>
China's economy grew 7.8 percent last year, one of the fastest
in the world, and its foreign exchange reserves had reached
nearly 145 billion U.S. dollars by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that if the yuan was devalued, the interest of
foreign investors in China would be damaged, the nation's foreign
debt burden would be increased and the Asian financial system
would suffer a further negative impact.
</P>
<P>
"China's top leaders have repeatedly pledged not to devalue
the yuan and the Chinese government will continue to stand firm
on the issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although some economists argue that a devaluation of the yuan
would produce some benefits, most economists agree with our
policy (of keeping yuan stable)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that China has tightened foreign exchange
control and cracked down on foreign exchange-related crimes since
the middle of last year, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
The government detected a total of 6.4 billion U.S. dollars of
foreign exchange acquired through illegal channels and closed a
number of forex black markets last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese currency has been basically stable against foreign
currencies for the past year. The yuan was quoted at 8.278 :
1.000 against the U.S. dollar this morning, slightly stronger
than a year ago.

<HEADLINE> GITIC Repayment Order To Be Decided by Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The repayment order for
creditors of the bankrupt Guangdong International Trust and
Investment Corp.(GITIC) will be decided by the court, Dai
Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC),
announced today.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference here that GITIC filed for
bankruptcy to the Guangdong Higher People's Court which has
received the case.
</P>
<P>
Dai disclosed that a meeting attended by creditors, debtors
and the court will be convened in late April to discuss the pr
ocedure of the repayment.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the repayment will be dealt with in an
illegitimate, open and fair manner and the interests of the
creditors will be guaranteed in accordance to law.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy of GITIC will not affect the stability of the
yuan and China's financial market, he said, adding that he hoped
the case will not affect the confidence of overseas investors in
China either.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy of GITIC is the first case of its kind in China,
which shows that China is stepping up supervision and management
over the financial market, a move that has met with positive
response from international financial institutions and famous
bankers, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ten Young People Honored with "Good Deed" Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Ten Chinese youths were given
an international award here yesterday for their outstanding
achievements in the fight against poverty.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program and the China Youth
Development Foundation (CYDF) jointly sponsored the '98
International Youth Prize for Poverty Elimination to encourage
more people to fight against poverty, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Among the 10 are self-supported students, entrepreneurs
donating profit to the poor, teachers and soldiers helping poor
students continue schooling.
</P>
<P>
Zha Xi, a Tibetan farmer who became rich through his
entrepreneurship, is determined that children in his home village
should not have to quit school due to financial problems as he
has to do in his childhood.
</P>
<P>
He donated 35,000 yuan (about 4,220 U.S. dollars) to help the
village primary school to refurnish the canteen and teachers'
dormitory. In 1995, he opened a primary school for orphans and
other children who could not afford schooling, offering them free
accommodation and basic education.
</P>
<P>
Kerstin Leitner, resident representative of UNDP's Beijing
Office, said the involvement of individuals in the fight against
poverty was just as important as that of the government and
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"They have shouldered the heavy task with their extraordinary
courage and perseverance," said Xu Yongguang, CYDF's
vice-chairman and Secretary-General, when expressing his pride
for the honored people.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Bureaucrats Asked to Remain Neutral During Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie has signed a government regulation requiring civil
servants to remain neutral during elections, national newspapers
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It (the government regulation) has been signed," State
Secretary Akbar Tandjung told reporters after meeting with the
president at the Merdeka Palace on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tandjung, however, declined to elaborate, saying details will
be announced by Coordinating Minister for Development Supervision
and State Apparatus Hartarto Sastrosoenarto soon.
</P>
<P>
The law is part of sweeping political reforms launched by
Habibie after he took power on May 21 last year following the
downfall of his predecessor Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
During Soeharto's 32 years in power, 4.1 million civil servants
were automatically made members of the ruling Golkar Party
(Functional Group) without any choice.
</P>
<P>
The political status of the civil servants was among the
hottest topics in the ongoing political law debates held in the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Before signing the government regulation, the House and the
government struck an eleventh hour agreement on Tuesday over the
question of civil servants' political rights.
</P>
<P>
After high-level political lobbying to break up the jam in the
deliberation of the election laws, the four factions in the House
agreed that the civil servants would no longer be permitted to
join or become executives of political parties.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stated that membership of civil servants in
Golkar or other political parties would "automatically" be negated
following the issuance of the government regulation, but added
that they would have three months to make up their minds on
whether to become party members or keep their official jobs.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants who failed to comply with the ruling would be
discharged.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, the House's special committee deliberating
the bill on the general election agreed that the House will be
made up of 500 members, and the People's Consultative Assembly,
which will elect the president in November, will consist of the
500 House members, 135 regional representatives and 65
representatives of organizations.
</P>
<P>
At present, the House has 500 members and the People's
Consultative Assembly has 1,000 members.
</P>
<P>
Two still unresolved major issues were the number of House
seats to be allocated to the Armed Forces, and whether the House
representatives were to be elected directly at the regency level,
or through a proportional representative system at the provincial
level.
</P>
<P>
The military has accepted a 50 percent reduction of its seats
in the House, from the present number of 75 to 38. But the United
Development Party insisted that the military could be given 15
seats.
</P>
<P>
The House and the government reached an agreement at their
meeting last week that deliberation of three controversial
political bills -- election, political parties and legislators'
status bills -- must be finished on January 28. The general
election will be held on June 7 this year.

Cheretien arrived here on January 23 for a four-day visit to
Poland, the first one by a Canadian premier in history. On
Sunday, Chretien made a private visit to the former Nazi

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua)-- China's cental bank announced
here today that in 1999 it will implement appropriate monetary
policies and further step up its supervision over the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC),
said at today's news conference that this year the PBOC will draw
up and implement appropriate monetary policies to coincide with
the country's pro-active fiscal policies in a bid to encourage
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
He said that the money supply for broad money (M2) is
targeted to grow by 14 to 15 percent or 1.463 trillion yuan,
while that of the narrow money (M1) by 14 percent. Cash in
circulation will be 150 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these goals, the central bank will formulate
guiding plans for state bank loans and carry out relative
supervision, expand the range of the loan interest rate
fluctuation of RMB yuan and gradually lift its control over the
loan interest rates in foreign currencies, Dai said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Issue to Be Tackled in Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The issue of Myanmar's
participation in ASEAN-EU talks is to be thrashed out by a top
Thai foreign affairs official in Berlin, the Bangkok Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sajoj Chavanaviraj, permanent secretary for foreign affairs,
will raise the issue on January 28, a source from the Thai Foreign
Ministry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Saroj will attend a January 28-29 meeting of senior officials
of the ASEAN and the EU convened to prepare for a conference of
their foreign ministers in Berlin in March 30.
</P>
<P>
He will raise the question of Myanmar's participation in the
ministerial forum, as well as in the ASEAN-EU Joint Co-operation
Committee, which brings together senior officials, and which was
postponed for the second time this week.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and its ASEAN partners say ASEAN-EU talks are
bloc-to-bloc and so should involve all members, the source said.
</P>
<P>
As co-ordinator for ASEAN, Thailand is also trying to convince
the 15-strong EU that participants in the March meeting should be
from the same level, the source said.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU foreign ministers indicated they might let a
lower-ranking Myanmar official, possibly a deputy foreign
minister, attend.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would like the 13th Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC)
meeting, initially set to take place in Bangkok in November 1997,
to meet before the foreign minister confer in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The biggest sticking point is the EU's ban on Myanmar speaking
at the JCC. "Myanmar has no right to speak at all, not only when
not necessary," a European source said, clarifying an earlier
report.
</P>
<P>
The EU's two other conditions are for Myanmar and Laos to be
seated separately, and for the JCC to display ASEAN and EU flags
rather than national flags. The flag issue was resolved in
October. But Myanmar has not yet stated its position on Thailand's
proposal for Myanmar and Laos to sit behind a plaque reading
"non-signatories", rather than "non-members" as proposed by the
EU.
</P>
<P>
As non-signatories to the ASEAN-EU co-operation agreement,
Myanmar and Laos are not attending the preparatory meeting opening
in Berlin on January 28.

<HEADLINE> Chile Insists on Trying Pinochet Internally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insulza said that in the next few days, President Eduardo Frei
will ask the State Defense Council to become a party in lawsuits
filed in Chilean courts against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 17 criminal lawsuits were filed in Chile against
Pinochet by relatives of the victims of his military regime and
by social and political pressure groups.
</P>
<P>
In London, the House of Lords has been studying since last
week whether Pinochet has immunity from prosecution aboard as a
former head of state.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean state has become a party in the new case to defend
the concept that Pinochet had diplomatic immunity when he was
arrested on a warrant by a Spanish judge who asked for his
extradition to be tried for torture, genocide and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers representing Chile argue that it alone has the power
to try people committing offenses on its territory.
</P>
<P>
"We should become a party in Chile just as we became a party
in London," Insulza said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite differing opinions both at home and abroad, most
economists believe that a number of favorable factors will help
the national economy overcome lingering difficulties and
uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University Professor Xiao Zhuoji notes that China's
political and social stability provides a sound environment for
sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Last year's good harvest ensured a sufficient grain supply and
the supply for means of production will outstrip demand,
according to Xiao.
</P>
<P>
China has witnessed a diversified structure in the realm of
investments in fixed assets, said Xiao, adding that
infrastructure projects initiated last year, including most
projects costing 100 billion yuan, will be completed during 1999
and are bound to play an important role in promoting economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Xiao predicted that China will continue to lead the world with
seven to 7.5 percent growth in 1999 gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
He Jian, deputy director of the National Bureau of
Statistics, expressed optimism about the nation's economic
prospects. He said that "positive financial policies adopted last
year will help expand domestic demand and increase income levels."
</P>
<P>
Deflationary pressure is expected to ease along with
anticipated rises in price indexes in the third quarter of this
year, according to He.
</P>
<P>
A research paper released by the State Information Center
concludes that China's economic growth for 1999 will range from
seven to 7.8 percent, with an outside chance of the figure
hitting 8.5 percent.

Another report issued by the Institute of Economic
Restructuring and Management says that the Chinese economy has
entered a new development stage characterized by structural and
qualitative improvements and will sustain stable growth over the
next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The report predicts that this year's economic growth will rise
slightly to around eight percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists are confident that China will continue to enjoy a
solid position in terms of the balance of international payments.
Official figures show that the country's foreign exchange
reserves hit 144 billion US dollars by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, economists warned that uncertainty surrounding
the international economic and financial situation continues to
pose a threat to China's economic development. They stressed that
the potential impact of the threat should not be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
China is also confronted with intensified difficulties
involving the management of state-owned enterprises, controlling
financial risks and expanding employment, as well as promoting
exports, according to economists.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, said the central government will introduce
further measures to stimulate domestic demand and increase
exports during 1999.
</P>
<P>
China will accelerate the pace of economic reform, readjust
the economic structure and maintain sound economic development,
said Zeng.

BONN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- International basketball ruling
body FIBA has lifted a two-year ban on Puerto Rican veteran Jose
Ortiz who failed doping test twice.
</P>
<P>
In December FIBA suspended Ortiz, playing for Greek club Paok
Salonika, for testing positive twice for the anabolic steroid
stanozolol but the organization had to lift the sanction after a
decision by a Greek sporting court.
</P>

Earlier this month the Greek High Council of Athletic Disputes
ruled the sanction imposed by Greece's basketball association was
not valid.
</P>
<P>
FIBA said in a statement that "FIBA wishes to add that it
regrets the fact that a player who publicly admitted to have
taken a prohibited substance may possibly be able to walk away
without any sanction."

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Want Rapid Selection of New WTO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The informal group of
developing countries in the World Trade Organization (WTO) have
reiterated their call for a rapid decision on the selection of a
new director-general of the world trade watchdog.
</P>
<P>
"Given the state of the selection process, the developing
countries reiterate the need that this process be carried out
rapidly," the group said in a statement issued here Tuesday at a
meeting of the WTO governing body, the General Council.
</P>
<P>
Current WTO chief Renato Ruggiero will conclude his four-year
term of office on April 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The successor of Renato Ruggiero should come from a
developing country," said the group. "The density of such support
is equally significant when it is compared with the totality of
the WTO membership."
</P>
<P>
More than 100 out of the 133 WTO members are developing
countries. Up to now, only 91 of the 133 have stated which of the
four candidates is their preference.
</P>
<P>
Among the four candidates, Thailand's First Deputy Prime
Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and Morocco's former Trade
Minister Hassan Abouyoub are now in the first and second place
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that more than two thirds of the members that have
expressed their views in supporting a candidate from a developing
country corresponds to the expectations that were mentioned at
the time of the appointment of the current director general of
the WTO," said the group.
</P>
<P>
The other two candidates are former New Zealand Prime Minister
Michael Moore and Canada's former Trade Minister Roy Maclaren.
</P>
<P>
The WTO members have failed to reach a consensus on the new
head several times since the end of 1998. The next regular
meeting of the General Council falls on February 16.

<HEADLINE> World Tourism Grows 2 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Tourism earnings reached 445
billion U.S. dollars worldwide last year, a two percent increase
over 1997, World Tourism Organization head Francesco Frangialli
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Frangialli said that despite the Asian crisis, 625 million
people traveled throughout the world last year, 2.4 percent more
than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
He said that Spain was the "chief beneficiary" of the tourist
boom, with tourism earnings in 1998 reaching 29.5 billion
dollars, more than five times the world average.
</P>
<P>
Frangialli said that Europe in 1998 remained the main
destination for tourists, with a three percent increase in
travelers and 3.6 percent more earnings.
</P>
<P>
He said America ranked second, with 1.4 percent more travelers
and 2.1 percent more earnings.
</P>
<P>
Frangialli said America's disappointing performance was due to
a 1.3 percent drop in the number of visitors to the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said the introduction of the euro would be positive for
tourism, since visitors will be able to visit several European
countries without additional costs due to the exchange rate.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Central Bank Pledges to Curb 1999 Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's central bank will
implement a more restrictive monetary policy this year to curb
its annual inflation rate to 13 percent, the bank's governor
Guillermo Ortiz said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Mexico's inflation rate soared to 18.65 percent, well
above the Banco de Mexico's expectations of 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz said the new monetary policy would focus on neutralizing
what he called the secondary effects of "external shocks" on
prices, adding that the bank would take occasional measures to
counter inflation's direct effects on the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the fundamental elements of the policy
would be the bank's decision to adjust economically on a daily
basis according to demands.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz said the policy could trigger an estimated annual
economic growth of 1.18 percent and attract over 2.3 billion
dollars in investments in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"When deviations imply inflationary pressures due to
international volatility, Banco de Mexico will adopt a
restrictive monetary policy," he said, referring to the effects
of Brazil's current crisis.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Government Refuses to Intervene in Currency Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government
confirmed its determination on Tuesday to refrain from propping
up the real, despite a devaluation of nearly 50 percent in the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"It is useless to watch how much the dollar is worth every
minute or to spend our reserves to try and set a balanced level,
which will be set by the market itself in the next weeks,"
Finance Minister Pedro Malan told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Malan's statements were reportedly made to curb a nervous
exchange market Tuesday, when the real reached a low of 2.10
against the dollar, but closed at 1.85, compared to a rate of
1.25 two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
He publicly requested traders to ignore rumors or to resist
speculating on the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
"We are undergoing turbulence and need everyone's support,
including businessmen, politicians and every sector of society,"
Malan said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the devaluation was a "great boost for exports
and for domestic business which can compete with imports, and
this has a positive effect on the economy".
</P>
<P>
Malan said the fluctuating exchange market would "fix itself
alone" and the rate find its own balance.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out reports of a possible hyperinflation, predicting
a 1999 inflation rate above last year's 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the abrupt plunge of the real has raised fears of
renewed inflation, for decades the scourge of Brazil's economy.
The strong real, dating in 1994, cut inflation from 2,700 percent
to less than two percent.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A team of financial
experts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) arrived in
Brazil Tuesday to study the country's economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Since the government devalued its currency on January 13, the
currency has fallen 40 percent against the U.S. dollar to 1.8
real per dollar.
</P>
<P>
The IMF delegates will analyze the effects of the devaluation
which took place after the central bank let the real float freely
this month.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for a rescue package of 41.5 billion U.S. dollars,
they might recommend the government apply a stricter financial
adjustment plan than the one previously agreed upon with the IMF,
government officials said.

<HEADLINE> Romania Adopts Law to Stimulate Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A new law to stimulate
Romanian exports took effect on Tuesday, giving export companies
tax breaks and favorable credit conditions.
</P>
<P>
Under the law signed by President Emil Constantinescu,
companies involved in commodity and service exports will get a 50
percent in profit tax.
</P>
<P>
Every year, the exporters will be eligible for low-interest
loans from the government of at least 0.1 percent of the total
foreign trade earnings of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country will take other measures such as
organizing exhibitions, fairs and seminars to stimulate foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
Romania has been suffering a continual deficit in foreign
trade since the beginning of the 1990s. For the last three years,
the annual deficit has remained at three billion U.S. dollars, or
15 percent of the total foreign trade earnings.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Ten Chinese youths were given
an international award here yesterday for their outstanding
achievements in the fight against poverty.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program and the China Youth
Development Foundation (CYDF) jointly sponsored the '98
International Youth Prize for Poverty Elimination to encourage
more people to fight against poverty, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Among the 10 are self-supported students, entrepreneurs
donating profit to the poor, teachers and soldiers helping poor
students continue schooling.
</P>
<P>
Zha Xi, a Tibetan farmer who became rich through his
entrepreneurship, is determined that children in his home village
should not have to quit school due to financial problems as he
has to do in his childhood.
</P>
<P>
He donated 35,000 yuan (about 4,220 U.S. dollars) to help the
village primary school to refurnish the canteen and teachers'
dormitory. In 1995, he opened a primary school for orphans and
other children who could not afford schooling, offering them free
accommodation and basic education.
</P>
<P>
Kerstin Leitner, resident representative of UNDP's Beijing
Office, said the involvement of individuals in the fight against
poverty was just as important as that of the government and
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"They have shouldered the heavy task with their extraordinary
courage and perseverance," said Xu Yongguang, CYDF's
vice-chairman and Secretary-General, when expressing his pride
for the honored people.

<HEADLINE> Inland Anhui Province Makes Progress in Customs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- customs units in Hefei, the
capital of east China's Anhui Province, solved more than 300
smuggling cases since being set up in 1989 and retrieved for the
country a loss of several hundred million yuan worth of goods.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, they have dealt with 3.88 million tons
of imported and exported goods worth 3.85 billion U.S. dollars
and collected 1.39 billion yuan (167 million US dollars) in
taxes. Last year, the export volume of the customs hit 600
million dollars, an increase of 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
As an inland province, Anhui has established eight customs
departments, with four situated along the banks of the Yangtze
River. As a result, its investment environment has been improved
and the number of registered foreign-funded enterprises reached
more than 2,000.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Senate Approves Key Pension Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Federal Senate on
Tuesday passed a key measure in its austerity policy, expected to
save about 2.1 billion U.S. dollars a year in government spending
by slashing the pensions of some 300,000 federal retirees.
</P>
<P>
The measure, approved last week by the Chamber of Deputies, is
seen as crucial to convince foreign investors that Brazil is
serious about implementing austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
The bill will be submitted to President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, who is expected to sign it.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Senate approved the bill in a symbolic vote
without a roll call, preventing the identification of those who
voted for and against the measure. Opposition members requested
Senate clerks to record their votes against the controversial
measure which will cut federal pensions by between 11 and 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
The world financial crisis hit Brazil last August, when
investors withdrew funds amid concerns that the government would
not be able to cover a 65 billion dollar budget deficit and might
default on its debts.
</P>
<P>
The government's recent problems with fiscal reforms have
further lowered investor confidence. After spending billions of
dollars in foreign reserves trying to prop up its currency, the
real, Brazil began last week to take a series of steps to devalue
it.
</P>
<P>
The real has lost over 35 percent of its value since then. The
real closed at 1.82 to the dollar on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> New Hepatitis Virus Found in Liver Cancer Patient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese doctors have
discovered a new type of hepatitis virus in a liver cancer
patient.
</P>
<P>
The discovery might indicate a new direction for liver cancer
research, since only previously infection with the B or C type
hepatitis virus has been related to liver cancer, according to
the researchers at Shanghai Dongfang (Oriental) Hospital of
Biliary and Hepatic Research.
</P>
<P>
The virus detected in a blood sample of the 41-year-old male
patient was confirmed as TTV, the seventh hepatitis virus, which
was first discovered in a Japanese hepatitis patient in December,
1997.
</P>
<P>
"It's the first finding of TTV in liver cancer patient
anywhere in the world, and may provide a new train of thought
about the relationship between TTV and cancer," the Beijing-based
Science Times quoted Wang Hualiang, head of the medical team, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Chinese Military Academy of Medicine
reported the TTV finding last April. They believe the virus could
be transmitted through blood transfusions and possibly other ways.
</P>
<P>
Five types of viruses are known to cause hepatitis: Hepatitis
A, B, C, D and E. But scientists suspected that there were
viruses still undiscovered because evidence of the five viruses
could not be found in 8 to 15 percent of hepatitis patients; so
they were referred to as Non A-E viruses.
</P>
<P>
The sixth type was discovered by American scientists in 1996,
but was found to cause less than 20 percent of Non A-E hepatitis
cases.

CANBERRA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The prime minister's representative on Sydney's Olympics
board Tuesday called for an extraordinary meeting, saying it would
be "unthinkable" if directors were not immediately briefed on the
bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Key legislation could be threatened in New South Wales state
upper house, regardless of who wins the March 27 election, with a
newly elected government having to negotiate with up to 12 minor
parties or independents who will control the 42-member chamber.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Australia's top indigenous leader Tuesday challenged the
Howard government's commitment to reconciliation, saying
Aborigines had no cause for optimism, but the prime minister,
while urging Australians to make a greater effort towards
achieving reconciliation, said Australia Day was no time for
Australians to be apologizing for their achievements.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- Industry groups have made a strategic decision to directly
lobby the federal government behind closed doors on key changes to
its tax reform package rather than use the senate's Goods and
Services Tax inquiry.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Causes More Than 1,000 Deaths in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 26 (Xinhua)-- The death toll from
Monday's earthquake in Colombia -- the worst to hit the country
in more than 100 years - has risen to more than 1,000 and
continued to rise on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands more were injured, reported missing, or left
homeless as rescuers expected the number of victims to reach
2,000 in western Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, which touched six on the Richter Scale,
devastated cities and villages across western Colombia, a vast
Andean terrain where much of the world's coffee is grown. It
shook buildings as far away as the capital, Bogota, 225
kilometers from the epicenter.
</P>
<P>
Rescue teams in Armenia, a city of 300,000, had recovered
about 650 bodies by noon Tuesday, while relief workers estimated
the death toll in the region could treble. The quake severely
damaged two-thirds of the buildings in Armenia, leaving 180,000
of the city's residents homeless.
</P>
<P>
With hundreds of people believed to be still buried under the
rubble Tuesday, the streets of Armenia were chaotic. Residents
wandered about desperately looking for relatives in a city that
was nearly totally without electricity and running water and
dangerously short of food.
</P>
<P>
The quake lasted for about 15 seconds and had a
100-kilometer-deep epicenter in the municipality of Obando, about
225 kilometers from Bogota.
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Andres Pastrana, due to start his European
tour Monday, postponed his trip until Tuesday and traveled to the
western town of Pereira -- one of the three hardest hit cities --
to head the work of rescue teams.

LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Robbie Fowler has signed a
five-year contract with Liverpool, which commits him to the
Anfield club until the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old also hopes that the decision will also help
keep his close friend Steve McManaman at Anfield.
</P>
<P>
"Steve has his future in his own hands, but I think Robbie
signing will have some influence, I certainly hope so." said
Liverpool manager, Gerard Houllier, on the day he unveiled
Cameroon international Rigobert Song as his second signing for
Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Fowler's decision ends nearly a year of speculation about his
future, a year which has seen him constantly linked with a move
to Premiership champions Arsenal as well as reports of wage
demands of up to 42,000 pounds a week.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have said a lot of things about me going, but
I've always been going to sign this contract." said the
Toxteth-born striker.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy here and at no time did I want to leave.
Gerard has been brilliant, it has helped to know that I am
wanted." he added.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a tough year for me, and I would like to look
upon this contract as the beginning of something new for me, a
new start with the real chance of winning trophies with the
quality of players we have here." Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
Houllier admitted that Fowler's decision and the arrival of
Song had lifted him as well as the team after the heartbreaking
FA Cup defeat at the hands of arch rivals Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
"Two days ago I was very downhearted, but these two signings
have brought a smile back to my face, they could not have come at
a better time." he said
</P>
<P>
"Getting Robbie to sign is exactly what I wanted. He is one of
the most respected strikers in Europe, if not world football.
This is a massive boost to the future of this club, and it shows
an attitude in the post-Bosman era that deserves to be
highlighted." added the manager.
</P>
<P>
Fowler has been a first team regular since his debut in late
1993, and since then has scored over 140 goals, including 101 in
the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
Until the emergence of Michael Owen, the player was regarded
as the best young striker in England. His renewed commitment to
Liverpool will increase the pressure on McManaman, who has yet to
declare whether he will stay with the club when his contract
expires at the end of the season.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Police in Loudi Prefecture
in central China's Hunan Province have arrested a number of
suspects involved in a futures fraud put together by criminals
from the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
One suspect from Hong Kong and another from Taiwan, two of the
chief suspects still at large, collaborated with Song Jianzhong
and Tan Biao in the province to obtain over 3.9 million yuan
(470,000 U.S. dollars) through six months of illegal futures
trading in 1997.
</P>
<P>
They set up the so-called "Jinli Futures Consultative Service
Company" in March 1997 in impoverished Xinhua County in Hunan,
which they claimed was doing business with a local futures
company, but was actually engaged in illegal futures trading of
the HK Hang Seng Index and American SP500 Index, through a Hong
Kong company.
</P>
<P>
Police have recovered some 1.1 million yuan made by the crooks
and are carrying out further inquiries.

<HEADLINE> Schulz Knocked off from Tyson's List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Axel Schulz's dream of
fighting Mike Tyson on April 24 watered on Tuesday when the U.S.
cable network showed no interest in the German boxer.
</P>
<P>
Wilfred Sauerland, Schulz's manager, said that Showtime, which
has signed a multiple-fight deal with Tyson, denied the possible
bout between Schulz and Tyson on April 24 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
"It's the end of dreams," said Sauerland. "The subject is
close.Axel is very disappointed."
</P>
<P>
Jay Larkin, who runs boxing for Showtime and SET, its
pay-per-view arm, said: "I'm not saying he's in or out."
</P>
<P>
But Larkin said: "It would be very difficult for us to sell
Mike Tyson against a guy who lost to the guy he just beat. And,
Schulz is not exactly a household word in America."
</P>
<P>
Botha, who was knocked out by Tyson on January 16, beat Schulz
in 1995. Schulz's last fight in America was the fight in which he
lost to George Foreman in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Larkin said others being considered for Tyson's next fight
included Michael Moorer, Lou Savarese, Shannon Briggs, Herbie
Hide of Britain and Brian Nielson of Denmark.

<HEADLINE> Iverson Gets Six-Year, $71 Million Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philadelphia 76ers made
a big deal with Allen Iverson, rewarding him with a contract
extension reportedly for six years at $71 millions.
</P>
<P>
The team did not disclosed terms, but the Philadelphia Daily
News is reporting the deal is worth $70,785,000, the largest
guarantee ever given a 76er. According to the newspaper, the
package includes annual raises of $1.125 million.
</P>
<P>
The electric point guard has led the team in scoring and
assists in each of his first two seasons, with Iverson and the
team making incremental improvement each year. He also has
clashed with league officials, teammates, opponents and the law
with his brash defiance.
</P>
<P>
Iverson is making $3.54 million in the final year of a
three-year, $9.38 million deal and could have become a free agent
July 1. The top overall pick in 1996 draft had until March 13 to
sign an extension.
</P>
<P>
The deal surpasses the one given last week to forward-center
Theo Ratliff, who re-signed for seven seasons and a guaranteed $6
0.2 million, plus performance bonuses that could yield another
$20 million.
</P>
<P>
Since last week's signing moratorium was lifted, the Sixers
have spent roughly $180 million on five free agents.
</P>
<P>
Since joining the team, Iverson has been arrested on weapons
and marijuana charges, refused to back down to Michael Jordan,
had an altercation in practice with former teammate and aroused
the league's fashion police with his long shorts and short socks.
</P>
<P>
He averaged 22.0 points per game last season, and finished
among the league leaders in scoring and assists and steals.
</P>
<P>
During his senior year, he was convicted of three counts of
maiming by mob in connection with a chair-throwing incident at a
Hampton bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to five years in prison and served almost
four months before the Virginia Court of Appeals overturned the
conviction.

<HEADLINE> CASS Release 1999 Social Development Analysis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Political stability will
remain the top priority for the Chinese government, as well as
the focus of attention for the general public in 1999, today's
"China's Daily" quoted Chinese social scientists as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) on Tuesday
released its analysis and forecast of the social development for
1999, and a seminar was also held for social scientists to
exchange views.
</P>
<P>
The reform of State enterprises, establishment of social insura
nce systems, anti-corruption campaigns, village elections,
housing reform and construction of water conservation projects
are listed as issues of common concern by the experts.
</P>
<P>
Interest in environmental protection, social stability,
pension systems and education will grow this year among the
public, one CASS expert said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a new focus in our reports for this year, which is on
the issue of reemployment. We hope to offer some feasible
solutions to the problem for the reference of the authorities,"
said Li Peilin, an expert in charge of compiling the reports.
</P>
<P>
Published by the China Social Science Documentation
Publishing House, the book covers the development in major
aspects of the Chinese society and will help readers form a
clearer picture of the current situation, said Li Shenming,
vice-president of the CASS.
</P>
<P>
Besides research results from CASS experts, the reports also
include contributions from scholars with the Development Research
Center under the State Council, and other institutions, said Li
Peilin.
</P>
<P>
The reports forecast maintained social stability in 1999, when
China will celebrate its 50th founding anniversary and the return
of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The information-based economy will continue to gain attention
in 1999, and the public is expected to expand their participation
in the social affairs of the country this year, since they
continually are being offered better access to information.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Firms Pitch for Yellow River Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Two civil engineering projects
to divert water from the Yellow River to north China's
water-deficient Shanxi Province have drawn 13 foreign companies
to bid for the work.
</P>
<P>
They gathered in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province, to
pitch tenders for the Wanjiazhai water diversion project. The
project developers previously invited international tenders for
three other civil engineering works and selected the best
contractors for the jobs.
</P>
<P>
The two projects are the IV and V bids in the series. In the
IV tender allocation the project developers hope to find ideal
contractors to design and build a factory for producing special
pipelines (PCCP) and installing 44.33 km of the PCCP pipelines,
said a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The project developers will also select the best contractors
for constructing a water diversion tunnel, with a length of 13.36
m, a diameter of 4.2 m.
</P>
<P>
The bidders include the AlpineBan, CMC, Dong Ah/Price/Mole,
Dumez and Dyckerhoff companies or other conglomerates. During the
preparatory sessions before the tenders were submitted the
foreign firms were allowed to inspect 29 of the project's sites.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the Wanjiazhai Water Control Project will
diver water from the Yellow River to Taiyuan, the provincial
capital. It has an investment of more than 12 billion yuan, of
which 400 million U.S. dollars were provided by the World Bank.
The second phase will extend the water channel from Taiyuan to
Datong and Shuozhou.
</P>
<P>
The project started to generate power last October. Work on
the 6-billion-yuan project began in 1993. It is one of eight
power stations on the Yellow River and is expected to provide 1.2
billion cu.m. of water for Shanxi Province; 200 million cu.m. for
Inner Mongolia, and 2.75 billion kwh of electricity to north
China, annually.

<HEADLINE> Britain Calls for EU Common Stance to IOC Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain called on Tuesday that
the European Union should take a common stance on the crisis in
the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on the day, British sports minister
Tony Banks said in a statement: "There will be an informal
meeting of EU ministers at Lausanne and I have written to the
German sports minister ...suggesting that at our meeting we
discuss a common position with regards to the current crisis
within the IOC."
</P>
<P>
Banks, a strong supporter of England's bid to host the 2006
World Cup, said the International Olympic Committee had been
damaged by the Salt Lake City bribery scandal but he believed
Juan Antonio Samaranch should remain as IOC president.
</P>
<P>
"I have been following events with great concern and there is
no doubt their reputation has been damaged by this whole series
of events," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have written to Mr Samaranch today emphasising the
government's support for firm action to root out corruption in
the Olympic movement and I will be seeing him in Lausanne next
week to reinforce that message.
</P>
<P>
"I restate my feeling that for the moment president Samaranch
is the person best positioned to clean up the IOC. His presidency
will be judged by his ability to restore confidence in the
Olympic movement."
</P>
<P>
The IOC suspended six members on Sunday after an investigation
into allegations of bribery surrounding Salt Lake City's
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Manchester in northern England has said it might sue the IOC
over its failure to win the 1996 and 2000 Summer Games following
revelations of malpractice in the Games' bidding process.

According to a World Bank assessment of the Y2K problem, few
developing countries have taken the remedial actions needed to
safeguard their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
Y2k arises because older computers and software often
allocated just two digits for the year in dates. When January 1,
2000, rolls around, some systems may think it is 1900.(World

<HEADLINE> Swift Investigation Promised over Walker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- British track and field
governing body the UK Athletics promised Tuesday decisive action
following confirmation that sprinter Doug Walker failed a drugs
test.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive David Moorcroft of the organization said: "T
here will be an initial hearing to determine whether there is an
issue and it is important that happens quickly and decisively so
we begin the process of getting to the truth.
</P>
<P>
"I think potential doping cases are a major problem for sport
in general and it is one of the realities of life. The way we
deal with it is crucial."
</P>
<P>
"We must be non-adversarial in supporting the athletes,
discovering the truth and then we can address the issue and
identify the right way forward," he added.
</P>
<P>
The sport's governing body confirmed Walker's identity
following a newspaper report which the European 200 meters
champion vowed to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
Walker was quoted by the Glasgow Herald as saying: "I have
never taken any banned substance in my life. I have never used s
teroids and I will be contesting the findings."
</P>
<P>
The story overshadowed Tuesday's official launch of UK
Athletics, the new body in charge of track and field in Britain.
</P>
<P>
"It is ironic that on day one we inherit a problem of this
magnitude," said Moorcroft.
</P>
<P>
"We pride ourselves on the number of tests we do and we must
also pride ourselves on the way we deal with the consequences,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
UK Athletics confirmed on Monday that two urine samples from a
"senior competitor at international level" had shown traces of a
banned substance.
</P>
<P>
Walker was subsequently identified in the Glasgow Herald but
told the newspaper: "There is no chance of my ever using drugs. I

"I am innocent and expect to be exonerated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dave Gibson, Walker's coach for the last nine years, insisted
there is a scientific explanation.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I fully expect him to be exonerated in the next
couple of weeks. We have hired a top lawyer and the best medical
advice.
</P>

"If Dougie had used drugs, I am not saying he would break the
world record, but he would run well inside 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"I still hope to see him do that, just as he has achieved
everything else in his career - and that is legally."
</P>
<P>
Walker first came to prominence in 1997 when he won the UK
200m title and was part of the bronze medal-winning 4 x 100m
relay squad at the World Championships in Athens and reached the
semi-finals of the individual 200m.
</P>
<P>
Last year he again won the UK title and broke the European
record in the rarely-run 300 meters with a time of 31.56 seconds.
</P>
<P>
But his main achievements came in Budapest where he won the
European 200m final and claimed a second gold in the sprint
relay.

<HEADLINE> Hasan: UNSCOM Must go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- There is no possibility
for the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) to go back to
Iraq, Iraq said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Saeed H. Hasan, Iraq's Ambassador to the United Nations made
the statement during an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Hasan said the UNSCOM and its Executive Chairman Richard
Butler must go.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said UNSCOM, in charge of dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, conducted their work in a unjust,
unfair way which prolonged the U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hasan said Iraq has complied with relevant U.N. resolutions and
destroyed all weapons of mass destruction, but UNSCOM failed to
report this fact.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador said UNSCOM should show the Security Council
evidence when It doubted that Iraq was hiding weapons, but
It failed to offer any.
</P>
<P>
Hasan said signs have shown that UNSCOM, which should work
for the United Nations, has become a tool of a specific country
and only serves the intersets of this country.
</P>
<P>
He urged the United Nations Security Council to have it
abolished.

<HEADLINE> Developing World Unprepared for Y2K Bug: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Many developing countries
are unprepared for the risks posed to national life by the
Millennium or Y2K Bug despite less than 12 months before the start
of the year 2000, the World Bank said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a World Bank assessment of the Y2K problem, few
developing countries have taken the remedial actions needed to
safeguard their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
Y2k arises because older computers and software often allocated
just two digits for the year in dates. When January 1, 2000, rolls
around, some systems may think it is 1900.
</P>
<P>
The problem has been overlooked because many observers assume
developing countries are less dependent on computers in everyday
national life, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
"But the majority of developing countries, even the poorest,
have computerized essential services such as power generation,
telecommunications, food and fuel distribution, and provision of
medical care," the Bank said.
</P>
<P>
It warned that a general failure of such system could endanger
the health, security, and economic well-being of people in the
developing world.
</P>
<P>
"This is a global problem affecting not only industrial
countries which are highly dependent on computers but developing
countries as well," said James Bond, Director of the World Bank's
Energy.
</P>
<P>
Bond said that in a recent World Bank survey of Y2K
preparedness in 139 developing countries, only 54 had initiated
national Y2K policies and among them just 21 were taking concrete
remedial steps to safeguard their computing systems.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the Bank recommended that governments in
developing countries should use the remaining months of 1999 to
make contingency plans to safeguard their most important computer
systems from failure.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has already approved loans to help Argentina and
Sri Lanka cope with Y2K associated problems and more credits are
in the pipeline, including 100 million U.S. dollars for Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Bank said its own internal systems would be fully
operational and ready for the deadline.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Score Big Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stock prices
stood higher Tuesday mostly on the share splits announced by a
number of companies.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,324.58, up
121.26 after slipping into negative territory at midday. The
Index was up 82.65 at 9,203.32 Monday.
</P>
<P>
The surge was driven by Dow components, IBM and McDonald's.
IBM announced that it will exchange two shares for every one
held by investors and its shares were up 3 points after the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
McDonald's also announced a two-for-one split and its shares
were up nearly 3 points.
</P>
<P>
The splits would be seen as an indication that the two
companies believe their already-expensive stocks are about to
go even higher, which attracted investors, particularly
small ones.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index still enjoyed
its benefits from Microsoft's high stock price. The Index
was up as much as 64.10 at 2,433.41.
</P>
<P>
Micosoft declared a stock split on Monday, which raised its
dividend and pushed Nasdaq up as well. Nasdaq closed at 2,369.31,
up 30.43 on that day.
</P>
<P>
Broad stock indexes were also up. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
composite was up 18.33 at 1,252.31.
</P>
<P>
NYSE index was up 5.39 at 591.45 while the American Stock
Exchange Index was up 0.35 at 706.36.

<HEADLINE> Hasan: China Plays Great Role in Maintaining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- China has always
maintained the principles of the United Nations Charter and the
norms of international law, Iraq said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Saeed H. Hasan, Iraq's Ambassador to the United Nations, made
the statement during an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Hasan, who has been Iraq's Ambassador to the United Nations
since the beginning of this month, said in dealing with
international issues, including the issue of Iraq, China has
always maintained the legitimate rights of member countries inside
or outside United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador believed that with the role China and other
countries are playing in the Security Council, positive
conclusions concerning lifting U.N. sanctions against Iraq could
be reached.
</P>
<P>
Hasan expressed the hope that China, along with Russia and
France, would continue to play their role in the issue of Iraq by
calling for respect for others, balanced implementation of
international laws and opposition to the policy of hegemony.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Calls for Restoring Growth to Crisis-hit Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert E. Rubin vowed on Tuesday to protect the economic
prosperity of the United States by continuing the effort to
restore stability and growth to financial crisis-hit countries.
</P>
<P>
Giving his testimony before the Senate Finance Committee on
global economic and trade initiatives, Rubin said that while the
U.S. economy has performed very well despite the world-wide
financial crisis, there are certain sectors that have
substantially affected, most notably, steel, agriculture and
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"The risk of that crisis continue, despite some positive
developments in recent months, as do the risks to us from that
crisis," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He said the United states has to "continue to be enormously
focused on the effort to restore stability and growth to troubled
parts of the world" in order to "protect the economic prosperity
of our country, and to restore the well being of affected
sectors."
</P>
<P>
He also urged Japan and Europe to "increase the world's access
to their markets, for their sake, and for the sake of the rest of
the world."

Arens, 73, was offered the post soon after Netanyahu fired
Yitzhak Mordechai over the weekend, for what he alleged
